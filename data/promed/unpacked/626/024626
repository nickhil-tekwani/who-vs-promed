Health experts have warned that the country is not safe from a fresh
outbreak of the debilitating disease. They also revealed that about
300 000 children are not vaccinated during routine immunisation.

UNICEF Chief of Health Sanjiv Kumar said yesterday [19 May 2009] that
in spite of rapid response and 2 rounds of anti-polio campaigns, the
virus was still circulating.

"The latest was detected on [19 Apr 2009], raising doubts on the
quality and coverage during the campaigns," said Dr Kumar.

Reported polio cases have risen from 2 in February [2008], to 8 in
March [2009] and now 13.

Speaking during the launch of the 3rd round of the polio immunisation
campaign at a city hotel yesterday [19 May 2009], Kumar expressed
concern that there was a downward trend in immunisation coverage.

He said 10 of 13 children diagnosed with the wild polio virus in
Turkana District had not been immunised. In February [2009], a polio
outbreak reported in the district left 13 children paralyzed.

UNICEF challenged the country to overcome the obstacles of
immunisation in the hard-to-reach areas, which are mainly susceptible
to disease importation.

Public Health and Sanitation Director Shahnaaz Sharif announced plans
to boost coverage of immunisation campaigns against polio.

Dr Sharif said vaccination sites would stay open on weekends and
public holidays. "The government is to blame for low immunisation
coverage, but when we ask people to bring their children they do not.
Everybody has a role to play to lock out polio," said Sharif.

He said the polio outbreak was due to low immunisation in Turkana
District and cross-border movement. The World Health Organization
(WHO) Head of Expanded Programme on Immunisation, Mohammed Duale,
urged the government to address the issue of vaccine stock.

WHO has reported that the wild polio virus in Kenya was exported from Sudan.

The government has identified 42 high-risk districts in Rift Valley,
Central and Nairobi provinces.

Health experts have expressed concern that the polio outbreak
threatens to undo the gains made since 1984.

The 1st polio cases reported early this year [2009] were of 2
children aged 2 and 4 respectively.

Three emergency campaigns a month after the other have been conducted
in Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia to stem the spread.

Kenya faces increased risk of polio importation from its northern
neighbors, where new cases of polio resurgence have been reported.

Weekly summaries as of 19 May 2009

Endemic countries
------------
Afghanistan
* No new cases were reported this week. Afghanistan has reported 7
cases in 2009, all of them wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). The most
recent case, from Kandahar province, had onset of paralysis on [19 Apr 2009].
* The next National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for [23-25
May 2009], using trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV). Further
sub-national immunization days are planned for [21-23 Jun 2009] in
selected southern districts, using monovalent oral polio vaccine type
1 (mOPV1).

India
* Three new cases were reported in the past week: one WPV1 (in
Bihar's Saharsa district, with onset of paralysis on [20 Apr 2009])
and 2 WPV3 cases, in the Badaun and Rampur districts of Uttar
Pradesh. The most recent case (WPV3 case in Badaun, UP) had onset of
paralysis on [29 Apr 2009].
* The next large-scale SNIDs across UP, Bihar and key high-risk and
re-infected areas are proposed for [24-29 May 2009], using mOPV1.
* The total number of cases for 2009 is now 43, compared to 229 at
this time last year [2008].

Nigeria
* 13 new cases were reported in the past week: One WPV1 case in
Talata-mafara, Zamfara, with onset of paralysis on [20 Apr 2009], and
12 WPV3 cases, 4 of which were from Bauchi state.
* The total number of cases for 2009 is now 256, of which 190 cases
are WPV3, 65 of which are type 1, and one is a type 1/3 mixture. The
most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Apr 2009] (WPV3 in
Zaria in Kaduna state).
* The next nationwide Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) will be held
from [30 May 200 -2 Jun 2009], using trivalent OPV (tOPV).

Pakistan
* Up to 1 million people are now internally displaced (IDPs) in
Pakistan due to the ongoing military conflict in North West Frontier
Province (NWFP), and the polio program is responding in earnest. Nine
transit teams have now immunized more than 17 850 children aged under
5 on the 3 main transit routes out of the conflict zone. More than 87
000 people are currently living in the 26 IDP camps now established
in NWFP, and mobile immunization teams have immunized more than 6890
children by going tent to tent in the camps. With 868 936 IDPs, or 91
percent of the total displaced population registered as currently
living with host families such as friends or family, it is critical
that the upcoming NIDs planned for [28-30 May 2009], targeting 33
million children using trivalent OPV (tOPV), is of exceptional
quality. Special training is being given to the teams covering
communities hosting IDPs to ensure that as many IDP children as
possible, many of whom have not been immunized against polio since
August 2008 due to the poor security situation, are reached.
* No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2009 remains 12. The most recent case (WPV1 case in Multan
in Punjab) had onset of paralysis on [21 Apr 2009].
* NIDs will be held from [28-30 May 2009], distributing tOPV and
Vitamin A. A sub-national immunization round (SNID) is subsequently
planned in selected districts from [22-24 Jun 2009] using mOPV1.

Importation countries
-----------
Angola
* Two new cases were reported in the past week, both WPV1, one each
in Benguela and Luanda provinces. The Luanda case is the most recent,
with onset of paralysis on [11 Apr 2009]. The total number of cases
for 2009 is now 6 (all WPV1).
* While no cases of WPV3 have been reported, the detection of 2
WPV3 cases in October 2008 and February 2009 in the southern
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), closely related to the Angolan
outbreak (last case in Namibe Province in November 2008) suggests
that transmission of this serotype continues in Angola.
* The Benguela case has been covered by one Sub-National
Immunization Day (SNID). The Luanda case will be covered by NIDs
planned for June [2009] (in conjunction with a measles campaign),
July and August [2009], with tOPV.

Central African Republic (CAR)
* One new case was reported in the past week, a WPV3 case from
Ouham, RS3, with onset of paralysis on [3 May 2009]. The total number
of cases for 2009 is now 2.
* No WPV1 has been reported in the country since [30 Dec 2008].
* National Child Health Days will be held from [23-29 May 2009],
with tOPV administered. An NID is planned for the end of June [2009].

Chad
* No new cases were reported in the past week, meaning the WPV3
case from Chari-Baguirmi remains the only recorded case of 2009, with
onset of paralysis on [1 Apr 2009].
* A staggered, nationwide campaign using tOPV concluded on [17 May 2009].
* A further sub-national round is planned for the southwest from
[19-21 Jun 2009], using mOPV3, with NIDs using tOPV planned for
October and November [2009].

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
* No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2009 remains one (WPV3 from Kasai Occidental in February 2009).
* DRC held a SNID on [7 May 2009], with further SNIDs planned for
[4 Jun 2009] and [9 Jul 2009], using a mix of mOPV1, mOPV3 and
trivalent OPV, depending on the risk and circumstances.
* DRC has not had a WPV1 case since August 2008.

Horn of Africa
* No new cases were reported in the past week, meaning the total
number of cases in the Horn of Africa for 2009 remains 51. The most
recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Apr 2009] (WPV1 from
Turkana South, Rift Valley, Kenya).
* The major risks associated with this outbreak are ongoing
transmission and further geographic spread within the affected
countries into the high transmission season; spread from southern
Sudan or northern Uganda further westward into northeastern DRC or
CAR, and further spread eastward, particularly to Somalia and Yemen.
* To minimize these risks, outbreak response activities were
conducted in Sudan (using mOPV1 in southern Sudan and tOPV/mOPV1 in
the north) on [27-29 Apr 2009], with further activities planned for
[25 May 2009]. In Uganda, a NID (in conjunction with a measles
campaign) using tOPV is to be held from [6-8 Jun 2009]. Kenya has
planned SNIDs from [23 May 2009]. Both Uganda and Kenya also have
plans for the addition of OPV to nationwide measles activities during
the course of 2009. Ethiopia has plans for SIAs in high-risk areas
for [22-25 May 2009] and [28 Jun 2009-1 Jul 2009]. Yemen is currently
preparing plans for at least one NID in June 2009. Eritrea held an
SIA on [6 May 2009], its 1st since December 2005, using tOPV. Somalia
held an NID on [11 May 2009], while Djibouti is planning an SIA for
June [2009].

West Africa
* One new case was reported in Guinea, the 1st case in that country
since 2004, a WPV1 case in Beyla district, Nzerekore, with onset of
paralysis on [9 Apr 2009].
* The total number of cases in west Africa for 2009 is now 57 from
7 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Togo
and Guinea). The most recent is the Guinea case.
* A coordinated 11-country immunization activity will be held from
[29 May-2 Jun 2009] encompassing 8 infected countries (Nigeria,
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Togo) and
2 at-risk countries (Liberia and Sierra Leone) using mOPV1, tOPV or
mOPV3, depending on the risk and circumstances.
* Following these rounds, any transmission in west Africa will be
responded to by large-scale mop-ups with monovalent OPV.

[3] Religious objection to vaccination
Date: 21 May 2009

<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/6/978a.htm>


Religious Opposition to Polio Vaccination. Author: Haider J.
Warraich, Aga Khan University Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan
Warraich HJ. Religious opposition to polio vaccination [letter].
Emerg Infect Dis. 2009 Jun. Available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/6/978a.htm>.

To the Editor: In 1988, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was
formed, with the aim of reducing infection with poliomyelitis virus.
Two decades later in 2008, a total of 1625 children contracted acute
flaccid paralysis caused by poliovirus infection (1). This finding
represented a 150 percent increase over the number of cases in 2007
(1) and resulted in the reemergence of polio as one of the world's
deadliest infections. As of 2009, polio remains endemic to 4
countries (India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan); in 2008, cases
were also detected in 14 other countries.

Religious opposition by Muslim fundamentalists is a major factor in
the failure of immunization programs against polio in Nigeria (2),
Pakistan (3) and Afghanistan (4). This religious conflict in the
tribal areas of Pakistan is one of the biggest hindrances to
effective polio vaccination. Epidemiologists have detected
transmission of wild poliovirus from polio-endemic districts in
Afghanistan, most of which are located in the southern region of this
country bordering Pakistan, to tribal areas of Pakistan (4). This
transmission has resulted in new cases of polio in previously
polio-free districts. The local Taliban have issued fatwas denouncing
vaccination as an American ploy to sterilize Muslim populations.
Another common superstition spread by extremists is that vaccination
is an attempt to avert the will of Allah. The Taliban have
assassinated vaccination officials, including Abdul Ghani Marwat, who
was the head of the government's vaccination campaign in Bajaur
Agency in the Pakistani tribal areas, on his way back from meeting a
religious cleric (5). Over the past year, several kidnappings and
beatings of vaccinators have been reported. Vaccination campaigns in
Nigeria and Afghanistan have also been hampered by Islamic
extremists, especially in the Nigerian province of Kano in 2003,
which has resulted in the infection returning to 8 previously
polio-free countries in Africa (2).

Before the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, a total of
1000 persons/day were infected with a virus that would cripple them
for the rest of their lives (6). To eradicate the disease, one major
factor will be to gain support of those susceptible to fundamentalist
propaganda. Islam is a progressive religion, and religious leaders
should be asked to support polio eradication programs. The Imam of
the Ka'aba and other influential religious figures should be asked to
highlight the plight of children with polio. Vaccinators operating in
conflict-ridden areas should be provided protection so that they are
better able to perform their duties. Not only will children in these
areas be safer, but the disease will not be exported to areas where
wild polio transmission has been interrupted by vaccination. Further
study of the attitudes of Muslim populations toward vaccination is needed.

[Since the last polio update on 17 Apr 2009 (see ProMED-mail prior
posting Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (04): Importations Africa
20090417.1454), cases have continued to occur in both West Africa and
the Horn of Africa, with countries newly reporting cases, including
Chad, Central African Republic and Guinea. For Guinea, it reported
its 1st WPV-associated disease since 2004, and according to
newswires, Kenya has confirmed 2 additional cases in the past few
days (since the closure of this week's official report on 19 May 2009).

The letter to the editor of the Emerging Infectious Disease Journal
discussing the challenges facing the polio eradication effort is
timely. The challenges related to vaccination acceptance in Northern
Nigeria have gone on since 2004, and countries are continuing to be
re-infected after having successfully interrupted wild poliovirus
circulation. If one reviews the current status of the eradication
efforts, of the 4 countries with uninterrupted circulation of WPV
(endemic countries), 3 of the 4 countries are those very areas to
which the letter to the editor refers, a challenge facing the
eradication effort. - Mod.MPP]
