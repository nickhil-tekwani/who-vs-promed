[In the wake of the devastation caused by the earthquake on 12 Jan 2010 that centered about 10 mi (approx. 15 km) southwest of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, cholera erupted prominently with more than 3/4 of a million cases and almost 10 000 deaths. After several years, the numbered of cases lessened but flared in times of stress including hurricanes.

The social and economic crises have continued and, along with gang violence, a resurgence of the waterborne scourge has recurred. ProMED awaits more information regarding this cluster. It will be interesting to see how closely the newly found bacteria are related to the previous outbreak strain. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - Bahamas

The Ministry of Health and Wellness (MOHW) on [Thu 13 Oct 2022], reported the 1st case of cholera in the country in 5 years. In an official press statement, the Ministry of Health & Wellness verified that a 52-year-old Bahamian male, now in New Providence, had a history of recent travel and was diagnosed with the diarrheal infection after doctors ran lab tests.

The report noted that the man is being treated and is in stable condition and that cholera is not naturally or typically found in The Bahamas. However, the MOHW is encouraging the public to, 'use and drink safe water, and to wash hands before preparing food and after using the lavatory'.

The Pan-American Health Organization, this week also turned its attention to cholera in the region after an outbreak in Haiti, where cases are mounting after 3 years of them being cholera-free.

"Cholera's resurgence in Haiti is a reminder of how quickly diseases can spread. After all, a few months ago, Haiti was on the verge of being declared cholera-free," she said.

PAHO is strongly recommending that Pan-American countries strengthen health monitoring systems for early detection of cholera and to 'update their preparedness and response plans as well as 'to continue efforts and reinforce actions to improve water and sanitation quality and conditions'.

The release from the Ministry of Health and Wellness recommends that people experiencing cholera symptoms -- profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, thirst, leg cramps, restlessness and irritability -- to seek medical help as soon as possible.

[There is no evidence that the resurgence of cholera in Haiti is related to the Bahamian case. Perhaps localized flooding was a contributing factor from the recent hurricane. ProMED await more information on the microbiology of the isolate. - Mod.LL
