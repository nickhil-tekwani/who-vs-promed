A deadly deer virus has struck New Jersey for the first time in 2 decades
has killed more than 200 deer in the southwestern part of the state and
officials say it could take years for the herd to recover.
The number of dead deer could rise to 1000 as bow hunters discover more
carcasses, said Tod Eisenhuth, a lieutenant conservation officer with the
state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife.
So far, at least 238 deer deaths have been blamed on the virus, epizootic
hemorrhagic disease, or EHD. The viral infection is spread by gnats and
causes rapid hemorrhaging and shock.
The disease typically appears in 20-year cycles, and wildlife officials say
New Jersey was about due for an outbreak. With the onset of fall and the
first frosts of autumn killing gnats, officials say this year's outbreak is
believed to be over, said Bob Lund, a wildlife research scientist with the
division
Overall, the state's deer population about 175 000 white-tailed deer is
very healthy and substantial, Lund said. The virus has been concentrated in
the southern part of the state.
The lethal virus is neither treatable nor preventable. It is not a danger
to people, livestock or pets, state officials say.
The first deer in the state killed by the virus were reported in August in
the Carneys Point area of Salem County. The rural area is known for some of
the best deer hunting in the region. "It's a hard thing to get a gauge on
because you're not talking about cattle in a field; you're talking about
deer in the forests," said John DiGregorio, a deer hunter who owns a
600-acre hunting preserve near Carneys Point.
The virus has killed deer in Gloucester and Cumberland counties, officials
say. Several deer found dead along the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County
are believed to have died from the disease.
The disease does not wipe out entire deer herds, but officials say herds
could take up to 3 years to replenish after the disease strikes. The
disease usually appears in late summer in the southeastern United States.
In 1975, EHD killed about 1000 deer in Hunterdon, Warren, Morris and Sussex
counties. Twenty years earlier, the virus felled more than 700 deer in
Somerset, Morris and Essex counties.
