[1] Chile: Case surge despite vaccination

Experts say Chile's government eased restrictions on travel, business, and schools much too early, creating a false sense of confidence that the worst of the pandemic was over.

Having negotiated early access to tens of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, Chile has been inoculating its residents faster than any other country in the Americas and appears poised to be among the 1st in the world to reach herd immunity.

But experts say the country's speedy and efficient vaccination drive -- only Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Seychelles have vaccinated a larger share of their populations -- gave Chileans a false sense of security and contributed to a sharp spike in new infections and deaths that is overloading the health-care system.

The surge in cases, even as more than 1/3 of Chile's population has received at least the 1st dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, serves as a cautionary tale for other nations looking to vaccination drives to quickly put an end to the era of beleaguered economies, closed borders, and social distancing. The rise in cases prompted a new set of strict lockdown measures that have restricted mobility for much of the country, affecting nearly 14 million people.

"When transmission rates are high, the vaccine does not rein in new infections right away," said Dr. Denise Garrett, an epidemiologist at the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington. "And with the new variants, which are more contagious, we're not likely to see a big impact until the vast majority of the population is vaccinated."

The severity of the crisis in Chile became clear Sunday [28 Mar 2021] as President Sebastian Pinera asked Congress to delay by 6 weeks a vote scheduled for early April [2021] to elect the representatives who will draft a new Constitution and other officials.

"Protecting the health of our compatriots has always been our 1st priority," Mr. Pinera said in a statement on Sunday [28 Mar 2021], arguing that the current state of the pandemic was not conducive to holding a vote that was "democratic, inclusive, and safe."

While more than 6 million of the country's 18 million people have been vaccinated, a surge in infections has left intensive-care units operating with few beds to spare and the system at a breaking point.

Last week Chile recorded 7626 new COVID-19 cases in a single day, a record, and the pace of new infections has doubled in the past month. The main hospital in the coastal city of Valparaiso had to create an overflow morgue over the weekend. Health officials in Chile have identified cases of new variants that were first identified in Brazil and Britain.

Dr. Francisca Crispi, a regional president of Chile's medical association, said that 20-30% of medical professionals in the country had gone on leave because they are so exhausted. Many are experiencing mental health problems and suicidal ideation, she added.

"No one questions that the vaccination campaign is a success story," she said. "But it conveyed a false sense of security to people, who felt that since we're all being vaccinated, the pandemic is over."

The government moved too quickly as it reopened its borders in November [2020] and eased restrictions on businesses, said Dr. Crispi. In January [2021], after tightly restricting the flow of people across provincial borders, the country created a permit system for Chileans to go on summer vacation.

"There was no control or traceability of the people who arrived in the country and many people traveled abroad on vacation," Dr. Crispi said. She called the vacation permits a "seriously misguided measure."

Soon, Chile also allowed gyms, churches, malls, restaurants, and casinos to reopen. Even as experts urged caution, the government stuck to its plan to reopen schools on 1 Mar [2021].

As people began moving and consuming with greater ease, doctors grew concerned, especially because the government did not have an effective contact tracing system in place.

"The situation we're in is one we saw coming," said Dr. Claudia Cortes, an infectious disease specialist who teaches at the University of Chile and has been treating COVID-19 patients at a private clinic in Santiago. "More than 4 million people traveled around the country. That led the virus, which had been largely contained to some major areas, to spread across the country."

Health Minister Enrique Paris has defended the vacation permits system, but acknowledged that the government should have been more emphatic about conveying that the virus remained a big threat as Chileans became more lackadaisical about mask wearing and gatherings.

"The mistake was perhaps to not have communicated the evident risk so the people who obtained those permits could have had the necessary instructions," he said in early March [2021].

Several other countries in the region are struggling to rein in contagion. In Brazil, hospitals in several states have waiting lists of gravely ill patients. Doctors in Paraguay say they are facing shortages of basic drugs as the virus spreads briskly.

Chile is better equipped than any of its neighbors to get the virus under control. Rodrigo Yanez, a senior foreign ministry official who oversaw the vaccine procurement program, said Chile had successful been in securing a large quantity of doses soon after manufacturing began by acting decisively and early.

The government has relied mainly on the Chinese-made CoronaVac and on Pfizer's shot, but it has also placed orders from other suppliers to ramp up the pace.

Mr. Yanez said the government's campaign to encourage Chileans to get vaccinated had been effective at reducing the percentage of people who have expressed reservations about the vaccines in public opinion polls.

"We expect that the effect of the vaccines will be felt by mid-April [2021]," he said in an interview.

[Chile represents a good case study showing that widespread vaccination at modest levels, similar to that now seen in the US, do not by themselves prevent surging COVID-19 cases. The level of population immunity required to prevent outbreaks of COVID -- community or "herd" immunity -- is still uncertain and may depend on the transmissibility of emerging variants and other factors such as the duration of vaccine efficacy. Immunization in children who are clearly capable of developing and spreading COVID, won't begin until sometime in the future. Thus nonpharmaceutical interventions such as mask-wearing, testing, tracing and isolation, and social distancing will be needed for at least the medium term. - Mod.LM]

[2] Risk for indoor transmission
Date: Tue 30 Mar 2021
Source: Nature [abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00810-9


Ref. Why indoor spaces are still prime COVID hotspots. Nature. 2021; 592: 22-25; doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-00810-9.

When Lidia Morawska leaves home, she takes with her a slick, shoe-sized device that provides some sobering insights about the restaurants and offices she visits. Outside these buildings, her carbon dioxide monitor reads just above 400 parts per million (p.p.m.). But indoors is a different story.

Even in a seemingly spacious, high-ceilinged restaurant, the number sometimes shoots up as high as 2000 p.p.m., a sign that the room has poor ventilation and could pose a risk for COVID-19 infection. Visual cues can be deceptive, even for Morawska, an aerosol scientist from the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. "The general public has no idea about this," she says.

The situation is no different inside cafes or kindergartens around much of the world, according to researchers who have wielded similar handheld CO2 meters. And that's bad news for hopes of defeating the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

For months, health authorities have singled out indoor spaces with poor ventilation as potential infection hotspots. And on 1 Mar [2021], the World Health Organization (WHO) released a long-awaited road map to better ventilation. The document -- which Morawska contributed to -- sets out specific targets and measures that businesses and other places can take to improve ventilation and make buildings safer (1).

But Philomena Bluyssen, a building engineer at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says that more needs to be done. "The WHO guidelines," she says, "are the minimum."

Bluyssen and others are critical of governments' failure to provide clear guidance or money for people to make indoor spaces safer. Some scientists say that has left large swathes of the population -- from schoolchildren to office workers, restaurant goers, and prisoners -- at risk of catching COVID-19.

Others say that there's no easy fix, and the precise ventilation or air-purification regimes to make indoor spaces safe are not known. "The complexity is not at a level that you can -- with a simple set of advice -- resolve it," says Ehsan Mousavi, a construction engineer at Clemson University in South Carolina, who studies indoor air quality and ventilation in hospitals.

Still, many experts say that enough is known for authorities to provide a clear message about how important good ventilation is for safety indoors, especially in spaces that are continuously occupied, or where masks are removed when eating.

By the start of this year [2021], concerns over ventilation had reached a boiling point. Hundreds of health-care workers, scientists, engineers, and occupational health-and-safety experts signed open letters calling on government officials in Canada, the United States, Australia, Colombia, and the United Kingdom to address, among other things, poor indoor air quality. These concerted campaigns all urged local or national governments to take steps to reduce airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

One of the problems is that governments and businesses are still spending millions of dollars on surface disinfection, says Jimenez, despite evidence that it is rare for SARS-CoV-2 to pass from one person to another through contaminated surfaces. By contrast, few countries have invested in measures to improve indoor air quality.

"If we took half the effort that's being given to disinfection, and we put it on ventilation, that will be huge," Jimenez says. In October [2020], Germany set aside €500 million (USD 593 million) to improve ventilation in public buildings, including schools, museums, and public offices.

Businesses in Germany and South Korea can also apply for government funding to purchase mobile air purifiers that remove virus-laden aerosols. In the United States, by contrast, federal funding to improve indoor air quality was limited to health-care providers such as hospitals, until the American Rescue Plan Act -- which also provides funding for schools -- became law on 11 Mar [2021].

What makes indoor spaces so dangerous is that exhaled virus can accumulate and infect people who do not have direct contact with an infected person. A prime example happened a year ago during a St Patrick's Day party at a bar in Ho Chi Minh City, in Viet Nam. Twelve people became infected at the party, but only 4 had close contact with the infected person (2). More recent outbreaks at gyms in Chicago, Illinois, and Hawaii have also occurred despite physical distancing of attendees (3) and capacity limits on fitness classes (4).

Ever since the WHO acknowledged last year [2020] that airborne transmission could happen, public-health agencies have emphasized the risks in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces. But the terminology is deceptive, says Morawska. "You imagine a busy bar," she says. "In the reality, any place can become crowded and poorly ventilated. And people don't realize this."

Her own modestly sized office at the Queensland University of Technology quickly becomes poorly ventilated if someone visits and the door is closed, she says. And spacious, uncrowded restaurants can appear to be well ventilated when they are not.

It's one of the reasons that Jimenez and others advocate the use of inexpensive CO2 monitors as a rough measure of whether ventilation is adequate or not. As virus-carrying aerosols are exhaled, so too is CO2. And when ventilation is poor, CO2 accumulates along with the virus, says Jimenez. In an unreviewed analysis (5), Jimenez and his co-author, Zhe Peng, found that SARS-CoV-2 infection risk rises along with CO2 concentrations indoors.

Taiwan, Norway and Portugal have laws that limit indoor CO2 to 1000 p.p.m. Studies in California (6) and Madrid (7) show that CO2 levels in school classrooms frequently exceed this level. High levels have been linked to poorer mental concentration and more sick days (6).

Setting clear CO2 limits would help to ensure that ventilation is adequate to reduce infection risk, says Jimenez. But his work suggests that, in general, 700 p.p.m. would be a better limit, and lower limits should apply to gyms and other venues where people expel greater volumes of air.

Not everyone agrees that CO2 monitors are the solution. "There is no correlation between CO2 and virus," says Christian Kahler, a physicist who studies aerosol production and dynamics at the University of the Federal Armed Forces in Munich, Germany. This can give people a false sense of security when CO2 levels are low, he says.

Part of the difficulty in setting ventilation targets is that it's unclear how much ventilation is needed to reduce infection rates to an acceptable level. Experiments that directly measure how infection risks change with different ventilation rates would be unethical because it would put people in danger, says Mousavi.

The precise infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 is also unknown (8). But researchers can infer how much exhaled virus is needed to cause infection by analysing disease outbreaks. For example, Jimenez and colleagues used details from an infamous choir rehearsal in Skagit Valley in Washington -- where one person probably infected 52 of the 60 other attendees -- to estimate the amount of infectious virus exhaled (8).

Jimenez used this approach to launch an online tool (which has not been peer reviewed) [https://tinyurl.com/z36zmca8] in June 2020 to help people assess the risk of infection in different indoor spaces, with or without masks. The tool calculates risk based on room size, the number of people present and what they are doing; viruses are exhaled at different rates depending on whether people are singing, running on a treadmill, or sitting quietly.

The WHO recommends a minimum ventilation rate of 6-12 air changes -- in which the entire volume of air in the room is replaced -- per hour to prevent airborne transmission of pathogens in health-care facilities, but a lower rate of air changes for other venues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) establishes minimum standards for indoor air quality. Recommended targets are as low as 0.35 air changes per hour for homes, 2-3 for offices, 5-6 for schools and 6-12 for hospitals.

Researchers say that a greater focus on ventilation will yield benefits during the next pandemic, and even when there are no major disease outbreaks. Indoor air quality "has been very bad for a long time", says Bluyssen. "This gives us the opportunity to improve not only the air quality for pandemic situations, but also the whole indoor environmental quality for the future."

[This is an important article to read in full to understand the challenge that opening up schools, gyms, restaurants, theatres, and other indoor events pose. There have been a number of super-spreading events at indoor events named in the report that brings this message home. The point raised about redirecting some of the resources going towards disinfection of surfaces to upgrading ventilation systems is well taken. Department of Homeland Security has a tool to determine how long SARS-CoV-2 virus will remain viable on a surface depending on temperature, relative humidity, UV index. See Estimated Surface Decay of SARS-CoV-2, US Department of Homeland Security (<dhs.gov>) at https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/sars-calculator. The type of surface also has an impact. But contact infection is less important than what we now know is the predominant mode of transmission: respiratory droplets and aerosols produced by talking, coughing, and sneezing. This makes ventilation of indoor spaces critical to address. - Mod LK]
