Russia: Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, Volgograd Region (Southern
Federal District)
-----------------------------------------------
Physicians and officials at Rospotrebnadzor (The Federal Service for
Supervision of Consumer Rights and Welfare Protection) are concerned
by the serious Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) situation in
the Volgograd Region. 13 cases of CCHF have been recorded in the
Volgograd Region since the beginning of this year [2006].
The Kotelnikovsky District of the Volgograd region is causing the
greatest concern. Here, CCHF has been diagnosed in 12 patients, twice
the number in the previous year [2005]. Three patients have been
discharged from hospital, while 9 are still receiving treatment. A
single case has been registered in Oktyabrskiy district. A difficult
situation is developing also in adjacent regions. 41 cases of CCHF
have been recorded in the Republic of Kalmykia, and there have been 2
fatalities. CCHF also has also been recorded in the Stavropol and
Rostov Regions.
Bearing in mind that ticks are the principal vector of CCHF, the
administration of Rospotrebnadzor has failed to implement tick
control measures promptly. The heads of regional administrations,
veterinarians, local managers and individual businessmen have not
devoted sufficient attention to this problem. Experts have estimated
that prevention and control of CCHF in the [Volgograd] region would
require an expenditure of 7 million rubles [USD 260 620]. The
decision of the governor and allocation of the necessary funding are
now awaited.

[All above-named regions (Volgograd, Stavropol, Rostov, the Republic
of Kalmykia) are parts of the Southern Federal District of Russia. A
map of the Russian Federation can be accessed at

According to an Ami-Tass News agency report of 8 Jun 2006 (see:
Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Russia (South. Fed. Dist. 20060624.1760),
only 4 cases of CCHF had been registered in the Volgograd region. In
the subsequent 20 days, the number of cases had increased by 9, i.e.
by 2.25 times. A similar situation pertains in the Republic of
Kalmykia: the number of cases of CCHF for the same period increased
from 21 up to 41 persons. Thus, the CCHF situation in the Southern
Federal district is an increasing cause for concern. - Corresp.NP]
