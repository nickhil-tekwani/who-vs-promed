[1] Haiti update

Haiti's cholera death toll has soared in recent days with 3333 people
dead, official figures show. The figures, released yesterday, 30 Dec
2010, included a 1-day record high for the daily number of fatalities
since the outbreak erupted in mid-October 2010.

The new data up to 26 Dec 2010 of 432 more recorded deaths compared
with previous Haitian health ministry data marked a major jump in
fatalities, although it was unclear exactly when they occurred. The
number of confirmed cholera deaths on 19 Dec 2010 alone was just over
100, the new data showed, far higher than previous peaks around 80 in
mid-November 2010. More recently, the death tolls have returned to
previous averages of around 50 new reported deaths each day.

The total number of infections soared toward 150 000 in Haiti. The
Pan-American Health Organization in early December 2010 estimated
Haiti could see up to 400 000 cholera cases over the next 12 months,
half of them within 3 months alone.

initial numbers reflecting the inability to provide clean, safe water
to the population. There is no substantial reason to suspect that
there will be a significant drop anytime soon. - Mod.LL]

Authorities in the Dominican Republic have shut off water supplies in
a western region after lab tests revealed they were contaminated with
cholera, officials said Thu 30 Dec 2010. The affected communities are
located near Banica, a town along the border that the Dominican
Republic shares with Haiti, where more than 2400 [3000 -- see report
above] people have died as a result of a cholera epidemic.

Water trucks are temporarily serving dozens of residents in the area,
Health Minister Bautista Rojas said. Soldiers also are patrolling
several rivers where fishing, water consumption and other activities
have been banned, including the South Yaque, one of the country's
largest and most important rivers.

The government drained an irrigation canal in the border province of
San Juan de la Maguana on Mon 27 Dec 2010 because officials said it
was contaminated. The canal provides water to dozens of families and
is used to irrigate 273 hectares (675 acres) of crops. Rojas expected
to reopen the canal by the end of the week.

At least 139 cholera cases have been reported in the Dominican
Republic, most of them along border towns.

not in Haiti. - Mod.LL]
