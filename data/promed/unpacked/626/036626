Tatarstan isn't considered a safe region regarding the African swine fever [ASF] anymore, claimed vice head of the Main Veterinary Office of the Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers, Gabdulkhak Motygullin, on 21 Dec [2020].

"I will start with the unpleasant news: a mortality case of wild boars in Yelabuga District was found on Saturday [19 Dec 2020]. Samples were taken; a laboratory showed the ASF. The samples were sent to the Federal Centre in Vladimir to confirm the diagnosis. We are waiting for confirmation of the results of the tests."

Around 10 corpses of boars were found not far from Tanayka village [map at https://tinyurl.com/yayrsq8k]. It became known on 21 Dec [2020] that the Commission for Emergency Situations in Yelabuga decided to place checkpoints in a 5 km [3.1 mi] zone from the site the infected animals were found; employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will restrict access for both animals and people at these checkpoints. Tanayka, Lekarevo, and Armaly villages are in this zone. According to the Commission for Emergency Situations, private households and small farms in the settlements in this zone have about 50 heads of swine. They all are subjected to seizure and further destruction. Moreover, groups of hunters have mobilised in Yelabuga District to catch wild animals to prevent the disease from spreading.

In total, 25 regions are considered unsafe regarding ASF in Russia, Motygullin says. The biggest number of hotspots in quarantine is registered in Tatarstan's neighbouring Samara Oblast. Of the 261 cases of ASF reported since the beginning of the year [2020], 154 are found in domestic pigs and 107 among wild boars.

"The greatest concern is that hotspots are reported in Samara and Orenburg oblasts. Grachyovsky District is on the list in Samara; this district is close to Tatarstan. Abdulinsky District is near the border with Tatarstan; it also neighbours Bashkortostan, Bavly, and Bugulma districts, [which] are also near the border," Motygullin says, describing the geography of the disease.

Motygullin himself recently travelled to Bavly District, [where] he held a meeting of the Commission for Emergency Situations. Now it is necessary to raise the alarm and spread the information among livestock farmers through the mass media too, he notes.

[African swine fever [ASF] started its circulation within Russia in 2007, initially penetrating into Chechnya from Georgia. Since then, it spread northward, westward, and eastward.

The ASF cluster, affecting particularly wild boar, closest to Tatarstan's territory is located in its southern neighbour oblast, Samarkand. This can be seen in OIE's global ASF interactive map, at https://tinyurl.com/wpqgxcv.
