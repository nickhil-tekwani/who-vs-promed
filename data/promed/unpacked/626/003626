Swedish researchers suspect that certain field mice can be carrying a
deadly virus, one that causes myocarditis, a serious infection of the
cardiac muscle. More than a dozen Swedes die from this disease yearly. The
theory about the field mice' potential danger arose after six young Swedish
orienteers died of myocarditis in early 1990. Bo Niklasson, a Professor of
Virology at the Swedish National Bacteriology Laboratory, Stockholm, said
that while they have established the link between the rodent and the
disease, they have yet to nail down how the virus is spread. "it would be
wise for parents to keep small children away from the rodent," he said.

[Prior to posting this, I asked Bo Niklasson for some input. Here is what
he had to say about it. - Mod.CHC]
"Sudden deaths among Swedish orienteers during 1989 to 1992 caused a major
public concern in Sweden. Six of approximately 200 elite orienteers died of
acute myocarditis. Orienteering involves finding the fastest/shortest way
between several checkpoints, often in forested areas. Because of extensive
exposure to nature, it has been speculated that the sudden deaths of the
orienteers were caused by a vector-borne (rodent or arthropod) infectious
agent. We performed a study looking at all deaths caused by myocarditis in
young and middle-aged people. When we broke down the results by time and
geography we found a very interesting pattern. In the northern counties of
Sweden small rodents are cyclic with distinct peaks every 3-4 years. The
number of deaths due to myocarditis followed this pattern with a time lag
of one year. The same association is true for nephropathia epidemica (NE)
in Sweden (NE is caused by the [hantavirus} Puumala virus, carried by bank
voles, _Clethrionomys glareolus_). However, we found no evidence that the
myocarditis that killed the orienteers was caused by Puumala virus or any
other known vector-borne virus in Sweden, including Ockelbo virus [a
togavirus] or Inkoo virus [a bunyavirus]).
Looking for new agents, we modified the method used by Ho Wang Lee and Karl
Johnson when they were searching for the etiologic agent of Korean
hemorrhagic fever [Hantaan virus]. Using sera from patients who died with
myocarditis, we screened small rodents looking for "new agents".
A novel virus was recovered and named Ljungan virus (after Ljungan river
where the first virus was isolated). Electron micrographs suggested that it
was a picornavirus and sequence data showed that it is a new picornavirus
genetically distinct from but related to both cardiovirus and parechovirus
(former echoviruses 22 and 23). Since the cardiovirus - mouse model is
well established for inducing not only myocarditis but also insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus as well as some neurological diseases, we
expanded our epidemiological investigation to investigate other human
diseases.
In the current issue of "Emerging Infectious Diseases" we have published a
hypothesis that the bank vole in Sweden carries an infectious agent that
cause myocarditis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and Guillain-Barr√©
syndrome in humans <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/Vol4no2/niklason.htm>
. We are presently investigating
Ljungan virus to determine if it is a human pathogen and if it can be
linked to the diseases mentioned above."
[We are grateful to Bo Niklasson for providing this information and shall
continue to watch the progress of these fascinating studies, which could
have immense implications. - Mod.CHC]
