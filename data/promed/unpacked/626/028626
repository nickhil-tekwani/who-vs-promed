2nd village on the Bulgarian-Turkish border allegedly FMD infected
------------------------------------------------------------------
After the outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in the village of Kosti,
Burgas district veterinarians found clinical signs of the disease in
animals raising freely in the village of Rezovo on the border with Turkey.
It is about 90 cows, 70 sheep and goats, and 30 pigs that move freely
together with a herd of 21 buffaloes that came on the Bulgarian territory
from Turkey. That is what general director of the National Veterinary
Medical Service Dr Yordan Voinov told Focus News Agency.

The animals still [do] not have the typical symptoms of FMD.

By the end of the day or tomorrow [Sun 16 Jan 2011] at the latest the
[focus] of FMD infection will be neutralized in the village of Kosti and
the village of Rezovo. [This will involve large ruminants] to be
slaughtered, [since] half of the [animals] have already been killed.
[According to Dr Voinov], experts from the European Commission are expected
to arrive on Monday [17 Jan 2011] at the site to examine the situation.

[Voinov explained that the barbed wire fence] laid years ago along the
border with Turkey is currently missing at many places. So nothing can stop
the movement of animals from Turkey to our country and re-transmission of
FMD in Bulgaria.

In practice there are no guarantees that the case of transmission of FMD
from Turkey in our country will not be repeated. The reason is the attacks
of robbers who steal the metal wire of the fence on the border. A few days
ago a herd of buffalo crossed the border and entered Bulgaria's territory
from Turkey, quite freely, Voinov said.

The restoration of the fence must be carried out by the regional
administrations and the municipalities themselves, Voinov added. In his
words, almost all outbreaks of infectious animal diseases in [Bulgaria]
have come from Turkey.

zoom-in) at <http://healthmap.org/r/0msR>.

It is not clear if infection has been established by testing in Rezovo, or
just suspected because of the reported possible contract between local
livestock and the Turkish buffalos. Confirmation or otherwise is requested.

I've noted the apparently seasonal aspect of previous instances of FMD
assumed to be associated with wild boar in this general area and I am
wondering about its significance.

If wild boar in this region behave similarly to wild pigs in at least some
other areas of the world, then they are probably driven by availability of
food and water, which in turn will be quite seasonal in temperate zones and
areas that are afflicted by marked wet and dry seasons such as the
Mediterranean, most arid and semi-arid zones, and some of the monsoonal
tropics. Their ranging, foraging, and "congregating" behaviors probably
differ considerably from season to season, with the latter autumn and
winter (in that area of the world) likely to see them foraging harder,
possibly ranging further and, maybe, congregating together more around
better food and water sources relative to other times of the year. Maybe
this too could be driving increased levels of "contact" between the wild
boar and other susceptible domestic livestock, including species more
likely to act as longer term carriers of the virus.

It also stands to reason that during the cooler (and/or damper) months, the
FMD virus is likely not to be inactivated by desiccation and direct
exposure to sunlight quite as quickly, so possibly expanded opportunities
for exposure of other wild boar and associated domestic livestock.

Understanding and responding appropriately to these cyclical ecological
factors is likely to be more crucial for effective control/management than
barrier fence maintenance.

[By addressing the behaviour of "wild pigs in at least some other areas of
the world", Dr Thomson may have referred also to feral pig populations in
Australia, which have been extensively studied throughout the years,
including their potential to play a role in FMD dissemination, should the
virus be introduced. It has been shown that, if not disturbed, the wild
boar tends to be a sedentary animal (home range=area with a radius of 2-5
km/1.2-3 mi) and to live in rather stable groups (for example: A Laddomada.
Incidence and control of CSF in wild boar in Europe. Vet Microbiol. 2000;
73(2-3): 121-30; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10785322>.). Wildlife experts may wish
to add information concerning the ecology/behaviour of wild boars.

With regard to seasonality, see also commentary in ProMED-mail 20070517.1571.

The genotyping results of 3 samples from wild boars in Kosti have become
available online, at
