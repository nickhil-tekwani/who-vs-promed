A new outbreak of bird flu was registered in the Chelyabinsk region
in Russia's Urals Federal District Thursday. The press service of the
Russian Agriculture Ministry said a laboratory analysis had confirmed
a diagnosis of avian flu. This brings the number of villages
officially experiencing an outbreak of the virus in Russia up to 13.

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao presided over an executive meeting of the
State Council, China's cabinet, on Wednesday [2 Nov 2005], to analyze
and step up bird flu prevention and control.

The premier said all the concerned localities have taken active
measures and the bird flu prevention and control work is being
conducted in an effective and orderly way.

He urged various localities to maintain sharp vigilance on fighting
the bird flu epidemic and to take strict measures to curb the spread
of the bird flu and prevent human infection.

According to 12 measures adopted at the meeting, China will allocate
2 billion yuan (25 million US dollars) out of this year's central
budget to set up the bird flu prevention and control fund and
initiate a national headquarters to oversee the prevention and control work.

The measures urged the localities concerned to [make full use of] the
system in monitoring, forecasting, and reporting bird flu [outbreaks]
and take harsh legal action against those who delay reporting or
cover up outbreaks.

Various localities should improve the emergency response mechanism
and take decisive measures to slaughter, [disinfect], and [isolate]
in case of new occurrence of the epidemic.

[In addition,] efforts should be strengthened to step up immunization
in the border areas, poultry farms, and water regions and give
priority to the development of high-tech and more effective vaccines,
according to the measures.

The executive meeting stressed that it is of vital importance to
achieve success in the prevention and control of the bird flu
epidemic, and strict measures should be taken to prevent human
infection [by] the virus, which [affects] the general situation of
economic development and social stability.

The meeting promised that China will continue to actively take part
in international cooperation and make timely reports to relevant
international organizations, countries, or regions on the spread of
the bird flu virus.

[3] Seasonality

The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus thrives in the cooler months between
October and March, matching the seasonal peak for common human
influenza viruses.

This fact is not lost on health experts, who fear the 2 will marry in
a "mixing host", such as a human or a pig, resulting in a lethal
hybrid that not only spreads easily between humans, but is packed
with the power to kill millions of people.

One question is why influenza peaks at this time each year.
Scientists suggest a plethora of likely explanations, from viruses
surviving better in cooler and wetter environments to people crowding
together in the festive season, creating the perfect setting for
viruses to proliferate.

"The survival of the virus in the environment is partly involved, and
the stress (occurring in both humans and animals) in these
temperatures," said Alan Hampson, an influenza expert and former
deputy director of the WHO's Collaborating Centre for Reference and
Research on Influenza in Melbourne.

A team of scientists in Asia published a paper in Nature magazine in
2004 saying that H5N1 viruses have been circulating in China since
2001 with a seasonal pattern, peaking from October to March when the
average temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit).

And the lower the temperature, the better it can survive. "When the
temperature goes below 20 C, the isolation rate of (H5N1) goes up to
15 percent in waterbirds," said Yuen Kwok-yung, one of Hong Kong's
leading scientists who helped fight SARS and the bird flu virus in
recent years. The isolation rate is the amount of virus found in
samples, such as blood and faecal matter, that are collected for testing.

Waterbirds are natural reservoirs of the H5N1 virus, which made its
1st known jump to humans in Hong Kong in 1997, killing 6 people.
Since late 2003, the virus has become endemic in poultry in many
parts of Asia and is known to have infected more than 120 people,
killing half of them.

It surfaced in recent weeks in birds in parts of Europe, including
Russia, Turkey and Romania, and many experts have pinned the blame on
wild migratory birds for the spread.

Samson Wong, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said
avian viruses can survive for up to 4 days in water with temperatures
around 22 C. At 0 Celsius, they can survive for more than 30 days.
They have also been found to survive longer in low relative humidity
on droplets and on faecal matter.

Malik Peiris, a leading virologist at the University of Hong Kong,
said these were crucial conditions for the survival of viruses. "They
don't multiply outside the host, but through contamination of the
soil, faeces, the virus should remain alive until it moves from one
animal to another," Peiris said.

Cultural factors also assist in the spread of human and bird
influenza viruses, the scientists said. "It probably relates to the
level of crowding and person-to-person contact during the colder
season, travelling in vehicles with windows closed. We tend to crowd
together more in cooler weather," said Hampson, who now advises the
Australian government on how to prepare for a possible influenza pandemic.

"Higher levels of stress assists the virus in taking hold and reduces
our ability to fight it off in the first instance, so our first
barriers to infection are easily overcome."

Wong added: "The reason why flu infection is higher among chickens
and ducks in winter is because we have many festivities. Farmers rear
more for this season and the birds are packed closely together. It
helps to propagate the virus."

Hampson said reduced ultraviolet (UV) light in winter might also
explain why viruses thrive in the cold. UV light is capable of
inactivating viruses and bacteria.

"But I would think that UV light alone is not enough to explain the
trouble. It could certainly be a contributing factor. Humidity,
temperature, UV, all of these [determine] whether the virus can
survive in the environment," Hampson said.

[4] Regional cooperation: Southeast Asia (ASEAN)

Cash set aside to improve farming in Southeast Asia may be redirected
to help the region's poorer countries battle bird flu, the general
secretary of ASEAN said Thursday [3 Nov 2005].

The proposal is part of a coordinated effort by the 10 members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations as they struggle to fend off
an avian influenza pandemic, the bloc's secretary general Ong Keng Yong said.

In an interview with AFP, Ong said money in a special fund set up to
improve farm hygiene could be redirected to compensate farmers who
lost their poultry flocks in culls during outbreaks of the deadly disease.

This would ensure that the poor farmers were less likely to cover up
outbreaks among their flocks.

"The money is there for animal health issues; we are now trying to
see if we can redirect these resources to help these poorer economies
to compensate farmers after culls," he said.

"The farmers are poor and they are ignorant of the dangers and when
their animals fall ill or die, they do things the local way -- they
cook them or sell them," Ong added. "They won't dispose of the rest
of the flock because they fear losing their entire livelihoods."

Outbreaks of the H5N1 flu virus have decimated the poultry industries
of many of the regional grouping's 10 members, most of whom are
developing economies that depend heavily on agricultural production.

More than 60 people have died in outbreaks over the past 2 years in
Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia -- all ASEAN member nations.

Ong, who was in Hong Kong on a scheduled visit to discuss economic
matters with local government officials, said ASEAN members were
sharing information on a daily basis through a communication channel
called Focal Point.

The system was put together as an early warning alert during the
global outbreak of the pneumonia-like Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.

"We have a strong conviction in this system ... we are quite
confident it is in place," said Ong.

The secretary general conceded, however, that member nations had
neither the cash nor the resources to stockpile antiviral drugs and
vaccines to counter a pandemic, and called on richer nations to help.

"I feel that the international community could help by providing
additional resources," Ong said. "We need cold hard cash to pay the
compensation for the farmers, also to buy the vaccines and to provide
the mass education."

The leaders of Thailand and 4 neighbouring countries agreed today in
Bangkok to cooperate in containing the spread of bird flu, which has
already claimed 58 lives in the region.

One of the main outcomes of the 2nd summit of the Ayeyawady-Chao
Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) -- named for the
3 rivers that connect its members: Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Thailand
and Vietnam -- was a joint commitment to combat avian influenza and
other infectious diseases.

"This declaration on avian flu is an expression of our determination
to mount a strong, concerted effort to contain the spread of this
disease in the region by enhancing surveillance and response systems,
sharing information and capacity building of public health
personnel," Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said.

To do so, Thailand has pledged 2.5 million dollars in seed money to
go toward anti-bird flu projects, he added.

The summit came nearly 2 years after the 1st human bird-flu deaths
began to be reported. Nearly all of the 62 human deaths have occurred
in the region: 41 in Vietnam, 13 in Thailand and 4 in Cambodia. [The
remaining 4 deaths occurred in Indonesia. - Mod.AS]

The leaders at the one-day summit also agreed to promote contract
farming, integration as a tourist destination requiring only a single
visa and the setting up of "One Stop Services" at customs checkpoints
to facilitate border trade among the neighbours.

This year's ACMECS summit drew Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, Lao
Prime Minister Bounnhang Vorachith, Burmese Prime Minister and Lt Gen
Soe Win, and Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.

The 1st ACMECS Summit was held in Pagan, Burma, 2 years ago. This
year, Vietnam joined the new forum.
