AFRICAN SWINE FEVER IN ZAMBIA
(Date of last previously reported outbreak: August 2000).
Emergency report: Information received on 18 Sep 2001 from Dr
M.P.C. Mangani, Director of Animal Production and Health, Ministry
of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Lusaka:
Report date: 7 Sep 2001
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, postmortem, and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 6 Aug 2001.
Estimated date of first infection: 30 Jul 2001.
Outbreaks:
Location / No. of outbreaks
MW Farm (15º 17.1' S - 25º 23.2' E) / 1
Kalimba Farm (15º 18.2' S - 28º 21.5' E) / 1
Description of affected population: the affected pigs were all on
commercial properties.
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
swine / 1105 / 20 / 16 / 431 / 0
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: preliminary studies made at
the Central Veterinary Research Institute (CVRI) and the University of
Zambia were positive. Confirmatory diagnosis was made by the
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI - South Africa).
B. Diagnostic tests used: fluorescent antibody test and hemagglutination
(University of Zambia and CVRI); polymerase chain reaction and virus
isolation (OVI).
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: a neighbouring abattoir.
B. Mode of spread: movement of animals.
Control measures:
- quarantine;
- modified stamping-out policy;
- surveillance has been instituted;
- movement control inside the country;
- testing; other areas are being investigated.

[The number of dead and destroyed doesn't amount to even 50% of the
susceptible animals. Where are the remaining susceptibles and will they
pose a risk of further spread? We will keep you posted as we get
updates. - Mod.PC

Epidemiology: Origins of outbreaks in Africa
-------------------------------------------------------
Previous studies have shown that, on the basis of restriction enzyme
analysis of the viral genome, there are a number of distinct genotypes
of ASFV [African Swine Fever Virus present in different regions of
Africa.
Within one enzootic region of Zambia, where the disease persists
because the virus is continuously circulating within the domestic pig
population, up to 14 separate sub-groups have been identified within
the basic genotype, due to variations in the length of restriction enzyme
fragments in the left and right terminal regions and in one fragment in
the central region of the genome.
When outbreaks of ASF occurred outside the known enzootic area it
was possible to identify the origin of the virus by comparing the
genome of the outbreak virus with those from within the enzootic area.
