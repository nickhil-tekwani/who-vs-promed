We have been in contact with the MOH [Ministry of Health], Oromiya Regional
Health Bureau, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Regional Health
Bureau, the
Editor of 'Ethiop', a local newspaper published in Addis Ababa, and UN
Emergency unit. All have confirmed that they don't know of any UNDIAGNOSED
disease. Our general assessment also confirms to this. We are however doing
the necessary follow up and will notify accordingly.

My recollection of Addis Alem (literally: New World) is that they had banana
trees,
both false and real. The false banana is or was a Gurage staple. Both have
plant
axils suitable for [breeding] _Aedes bromeliae_ mosquitoes. Could this be
another round of yellow fever?
I got an isolate of Germiston virus from the Addis Alem area, but that
[virus] would not account for the deaths. Zergebaghew Asfaw brought sera
[from that area] to Dr R. Shope´s lab [the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit],
some of which were reactive in an Ebola ELISA -- as were some sera from the
1962 yellow fever outbreak across the lake from Addis Alem. The rainy season
should have ended recently there.

[The original report did not say the disease was hemorrhagic. But Owen´s
point is that yellow fever, Germiston and, probably, Ebola viruses occur in
the area - Mod.JW]
