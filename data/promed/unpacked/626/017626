[The previous 2014 outbreak they report was in Olt and involved 2 sick goats that got butchered resulting in 3 human cases; prior to that the previous small ruminant outbreak was in 2007 in Vaslui. The previous bovine outbreak was in a cow in Tulcea in 2011, and elsewhere in 2009, 2008, and 2007. This disease is now sporadic in Romania with just the odd outbreak like this. Though they have an active national vaccination program one can see a backyard trio of animals being overlooked. How this animal became infected and why they suspected anthrax is not clear from this report. If I were optimistic it is that with vaccination the incidence has dropped right down but as in the Dakotas and southern Italy there will be the odd outbreak among the procrastinated at risk herds, emphasizing to all why vaccination is important for the moment. - Mod.MHJ
