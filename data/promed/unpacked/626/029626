I am writing to you because at the moment in an area between Campania
and Basilicata (South Italy) 5 anthrax outbreaks have been reported
involving 3 bovines, one sheep, and one horse. No human cases.

We are working to genotype the isolated strains.

[With one case reported per herd or farm, we can safely assume that
Dr. Fasanella's information is presently limited to what came in with
the diagnostic samples. Logically the incidence will be minimally 2 to
3 times the numbers quoted on a submission document.

I seriously advise members to read Antonio's paper on the 2004
epidemic in Basilicata. It is most interesting and is a good
demonstration of the value of multiple samples from all the
flocks/herds involved in working out what in fact happens in such an
epidemic. For diagnosis you just need one good sample. For a sound
epidemiologic analysis you need to submit as many samples as you can
persuade the laboratory to work up. See: Antonio Fasanella, Giuliano
Garofolo, Domenico Galante, Vincenzo Quaranta, Lucia Palazzo, Romano
Lista, Rosanna Adone, and Martin Hugh-Jones, 2010. Anthrax outbreaks
in Italy in 2004: genetic analysis of isolates and evaluation of risk
factors associated with outbreaks. New Microbiologica 33(1):83-86.

In a word there was the epidemic strain affecting nearly all the
farms, but there were 3 novel strains hitching a lift to infect a mere
handful of other farms but using the same bus (biting flies) to go
from farm to farm. An anthrax season is characterised by random
sporadic outbreaks. Whether they can spread to other livestock depends
on the rainfall and flies available.

Our thanks to Antonio for his quick report and generosity at sharing
this information with us. - Mod.MHJ
