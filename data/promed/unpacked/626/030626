Viet Nam; 9th Fatality from Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
A teenager from Vietnam's southern Bac Lieu province, who died on 14 Jan
2005, has just been confirmed to have contracted avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus infection, bringing the total fatalities in the country to 9, the
local newspaper Youth reported on Tue 25 Jan 2005.
Samples from the 17-year-old patient from Phuoc Long district have tested
positive for the virus, according to the testing carried out by by the
Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. The avian influenza victim suffered
cough, high temperature and breathing difficulties for several days after
slaughtering chickens for meals.
A total of 11 local people, 9 from the southern region and 3 from the
northern region [the numbers do not add up - Mod.DK], have been found to
have contracted the H5N1 virus since 28 Dec 2004. 2 [recovered] patients
will be discharged from the Tropical Disease Institute in Hanoi capital
city soon, said local doctors. Since the 1st outbreak of avian influenza
occurred in Viet Nam in late 2003, a total of 37 people have been confirmed
to be infected with the virus, of whom 29 have died.
Tests are also being done in Viet Nam to determine whether the virus killed
a 39-year-old woman from Long An province last week, the Nguoi Lao Dong
newspaper said. A 42-year-old man, the 1st avian influenza patient in
northern Viet Nam in 2005, was set to be discharged this week after
recovering from the disease.
Since January 2005, avian influenza has hit 412 communes of 25 cities and
provinces nationwide, killing and leading to the forced culling of some 604
000 poultry, the paper said.
