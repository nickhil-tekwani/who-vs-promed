Can anyone tell me how horses are being diagnosed with West Nile Virus
infection? I don't think the lab we send our EEE brain suspects to would
find it. Would it be found by routine viral isolation? Do horses
seroconvert before dying?

[Given that IgM antibody capture ELISA is so useful in serodiagnosing other
arboviral infections of equids, I assume this is the best of choice for
West Nile virus infections, but I do not know. We would be grateful if
someone would provide this information. I would expect the incubation
period for the equid disease to be at least 4-5 days, so IgM antibody
should be detectable on the day of onset and thereafter for a month or two,
at least. Virus isolation or viral RNA detection always is the best method
of diagnosis. - Mod.CHC
