-----------------------------------------
Information received [and dated] on 17 Nov 2014 from Dr Nigel Gibbens, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London, United Kingdom

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 14 Nov 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 16 Nov 2014
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 20 Aug 2008
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (AIV/2014/01): Yorkshire, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Nov 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 6000 / - / 338 / 0 / 0

Affected population: Housed duck breeding flock of approximately 6000 60-week-old birds. The birds showed signs of slightly raised mortality and a gradual but marked drop in egg production. An underlying bacterial/fungal infection is likely to have preceded the infection by avian influenza, contributing to presentation of clinical signs.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / ** / 5.63 percent / ** / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not called because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The epidemiological investigation has started in response to the outbreak, and early information indicates that the unit routinely applies high standards of biosecurity and had not moved any birds or eggs from the premises in the preceding week. Updates will be provided in the weekly reports as further information becomes available.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge (OIE's Reference Laboratory) / Birds / haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) / 16 Nov 2014 / Negative
Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge (OIE's Reference Laboratory) / Birds / intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test / - / Pending
Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge (OIE's Reference Laboratory) / Birds / nucleotide sequencing / 16 Nov 2014 / Positive
Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge (OIE's Reference Laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 16 Nov 2014 / Positive
Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Weybridge (OIE's Reference Laboratory) / Birds / neuraminidase inhibition assay / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The affected population is a housed duck breeding flock of approximately 6000 60-week-old birds. According to the report (see above), the ducks showed signs of slightly raised mortality and a gradual but marked drop in egg production.

The test results for the neuroaminidase serotype and the pathogenicity index for this H5 AI strain are pending.

According to the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA): "Investigations are now ongoing to discover whether the outbreak is linked to cases found in the Netherlands and Germany with further test results expected over the coming days." https://www.gov.uk/government/news/avian-flu-outbreak-in-duck-breeding-farm-in-yorkshire

Public Health England (PHE) is assisting DEFRA with the investigation. According to its declarations:

"The risk to public health in this case is considered extremely low based on what we currently know about the specific strain of avian flu. Further testing is ongoing, but DEFRA has already ruled out the H5N1 strain, which has sometimes caused severe human infection linked to poultry outbreaks, especially in the Far East. As a precautionary measure, anyone who is directly involved in culling the birds at the site in Yorkshire will be offered antiviral medicine, which is usual practice in incidents of this sort. The Food Standards Agency has advised that avian flu does not pose a food safety risk in the UK."
