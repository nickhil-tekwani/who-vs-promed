Notes from the Field: Use of Electronic Messaging and the News Media to Increase Case Finding During a Cyclospora Outbreak -- Iowa, July 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Friday, 28 Jun 2013, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) routinely reported 2 cases of cyclosporiasis in its weekly electronic newsletter, the EPI Update. The newsletter's primary audience consists of Iowa's public health officials and health-care providers, but readers also include members of the news media.

By Wednesday, 3 Jul [2013], an additional 4 cases had been reported to IDPH, indicating that an outbreak could be occurring (before 2013, only 10 cases had been reported in Iowa). In response, IDPH released a special EPI Update Alert and a Health Alert Network alert to all hospitals, emergency departments, infection preventionists, public health agencies, and other health-care providers in Iowa. Both electronic alerts included information on symptoms of cyclosporiasis, and diagnosis and treatment guidelines. By [4 Jul 2013], when a CDC Epidemic Information Exchange alert was issued, most major media outlets in Iowa had reported on the outbreak. An e-mail press release with updated information was issued on [8 Jul 2013] to nearly 400 members of the news media, and the 1st round of 14 messages was sent to 5282 Twitter followers. By [9 Jul 2013], daily updates, including case counts, were being requested by the media and posted on the IDPH website. Over the next several weeks, as health-care providers and the public became aware of the outbreak, many Iowans were tested and given diagnoses of cyclosporiasis.

Cyclospora, a coccidian parasite, can cause prolonged and relapsing watery diarrhea, which, if untreated, can last several weeks to months (1). This long duration of diarrhea is unusual among foodborne pathogens and allows time for patients to seek medical attention and have their illness diagnosed (1,3). Testing for Cyclospora is not routinely done in most US laboratories, even when stool specimens are tested for parasites; health-care providers must specifically request testing for Cyclospora when indicated. The preferred treatment for cyclosporiasis is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; to date, no reliably effective alternative treatments have been identified (1,3). Cyclospora is not spread from person to person because excreted oocysts require several days to weeks outside the host to become infectious. Previous outbreaks in the United States have been associated with fruits (i.e., raspberries [2]) and raw vegetables (i.e., mesclun lettuce, basil, and snow peas [3]).

As of [26 Jul 2013], nearly all of Iowa's 135 reported cases of cyclosporiasis had been diagnosed by testing at the state's public health laboratory, the State Hygienic Laboratory (SHL) [Figure: Number of confirmed cases of cyclosporiasis (N = 135), by dates of symptom onset and collection of laboratory specimen, and dates of electronic health alerts -- Iowa, 4 Jun 2013 to 25 Jul 2013; available at original source URL listed above]. The 2 initial cases, reported in the [28 Jun 2013] issue of EPI Update, were diagnosed by a laboratorian at SHL who identified possible Cyclospora oocysts on microscopic examination of fresh stool and confirmed this diagnosis using a modified acid-fast stain technique. In June [2013] at SHL, before electronic messaging was used and media attention was attracted, 271 stool tests for ova and parasites were requested but none specifically for Cyclospora. In contrast, during the 1st 23 days of July [2013], requests for general ova and parasite stool tests had increased to 762, and specific Cyclospora testing was requested on 1460 specimens.

In addition to case ascertainment, increased attention by the news media and health department notifications led to improved diagnosis and treatment. For example, one patient with severe vomiting and diarrhea was discharged without a diagnosis after a 5-day hospital stay and extensive laboratory testing, only to relapse days later. After reading the EPI Update Alert, the patient's health-care provider ordered Cyclospora testing on the patient, and the result was positive. The patient was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and the symptoms resolved.

The use of electronic messaging and media attention in the early stages of this outbreak investigation provided public health agencies a unique opportunity to increase testing for this uncommon disease, which might not otherwise have been considered by health-care providers or their patients. After diagnosis and case reporting, patients provided IDPH with valuable information on their potential exposures to Cyclospora, increasing the power of statistical analyses and the likelihood of finding the source of the infection. The Cyclospora outbreak investigation is ongoing.

[ProMED-mail was launched in 1994 with a focus on the use of the [then nascent] internet to serve as an early warning for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and toxic exposures of importance in the plant, animal and human health arenas [following what is now referred to as the "One Health" approach]. In the early years, in addition to relying upon the subscriber base of interested health professionals and lay subscribers to report on events of interest they had learned of (through a variety of sources), ProMED-mail recognized the power of the media in reporting unusual health events of interest around the world. In the early days/years, this was done through manual searches of news reports available on the internet. In later years, webcrawling and aggregator programs were developed that used a series of taxonomies to do these searches more rapidly, especially with the exponential growth of information available on the internet. In more recent years, the growth and development of social network communication means such as Facebook and Twitter have further expanded the volume of information available through these services.

Historically, during the initial years of existence, ProMED-mail faced an uphill battle to gain official acceptance of reports based on the information obtained from these sources. Early on, these reports were felt by the official sector to be rumors and were disqualified as not trustworthy. Through the years this has changed, and "Digital Disease Detection" is recognized as both the present and the future in providing earlier access to information on unusual health events, thereby enhancing the reach of traditional disease surveillance activities.

In 2011, there was an outbreak of respiratory illness associated with a global conference held at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles, California (see prior ProMED-mail posts Legionellosis - USA (02): (CA) conference, susp. 20110304.0713 and Legionellosis - USA: (CA) conference, susp.. 20110214.0494 for details on the outbreaks). Attendees included 715 participants from 30 countries. The initial reports of this outbreak came from a journalist's query to the health department after seeing postings of illness queries on the conference Facebook page. Social media was used at that time to contact the dispersed conference participants for investigation of the outbreak. (For an interesting discussion of this, see http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/social-media-helps-cdc-track-playboy-mansion-disease-outbreak).

The above "Notes from the Field" present an excellent short case study on the value of the use of Digital Disease Detection methods for disease surveillance. The enhancement in case finding with appropriate laboratory diagnostics permitting case confirmations through the use of traditional media sources in addition to social media communication networks helped to better define the magnitude and geographic extension of this outbreak in Iowa.

It is nice to see official reports validating the use of non-traditional information sources.
