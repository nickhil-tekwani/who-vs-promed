I am intrigued by Professor Dupouy-Camet's suggestion that macaques may
serve as a host for trypanosomes which may cross over to humans. Together
with colleagues in Sri Lanka, I recently described an epizootic dengue virus
in eastern Sri Lanka among toque macaques (_Macaca sinica_).
Reference: Serological evidence for an epizootic dengue virus infecting
toque macaques at Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka. A. de Silva, W. Dittus, P.
Amerasinghe and F. Amerasinghe. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. (1999) 60
(2):300-306.
I still have some macaque serum samples in my freezer. If any one is
interested in attempting to isolate trypanosomes or testing for trypanosome
antibodies, I can send them some _M. sinica_ serum.

There have been a few reports in the 1970s in Malaysia of trypanosomiasis
amongst the aboriginal population. It is believed that these were simian
trypanosomes and had a _T. cruzi_-like appearance. I suspect that the Sri
Lankan case is similarly acquired from animals and may well be from monkeys.
For the benefit of every one interested in this infection, I am including
the references for the above reports:

in Malaysia. Trans.Roy. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 68:494-495
2. Weinman D 1970. Trypanosomiasis in macaques and in Man in Malaysia.

the Malaysian primates, _Macaca nemestrina_ and _M. ira_. Trans. Roy. Soc.
Trop. Med. Hyg. 66: 628 (I may have got the page no. wrong!)

(aborigines) in West Malaysia. Trans. Roy. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 70: 170-171.
