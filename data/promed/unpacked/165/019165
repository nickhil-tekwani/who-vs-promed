I know you have cut the string but you might nevertheless be interested:
Following the outbreak of JE in the Torres Strait in early 1995, the
residents of the outer islands in the Torres Strait were offered the
lyophilised inactivated mouse brain derived (Nakayama strain) JE vaccine in
late 1995/early 1996. It was hoped that high coverage would be achieved
before the onset of the 1996 wet season; 93% of those who commenced the
3-dose series received two doses, and 73% three doses.
An outbreak of dengue 2 began in the Torres Strait In October 1996; it
lasted for nearly seven months (Med J Aust 1998; 168: 221- 225). This was
the first recognised outbreak of dengue in the Torres Strait since 1981/82.
The outbreak affected residents of 8 of the outer islands, with two islands
(Mer, Masig) being severely affected. Using a very strict case definition
(either virus isolation or IgM detected by UC-HAI) there were 201 cases,
nearly 75% of whom were residents of the outer islands. Only 7 (3.5%) of
the cases were hospitalised; this is a much lower rate than that being seen
(~20%) in the current dengue 3 outbreak in Far North Queensland. There were
no cases of either DHF or DSS; there were no deaths.
Intriguingly, Caucasians were over-represented among the few hospitalised
cases of dengue 2 virs infection. Are Melanesians less likely to develop
severe complications of dengue? (It is interesting that there are so few
reports about dengue emanating from Papua New Guinea, yet it is clear from
the importations into north Queensland, that both dengue 2 and dengue 3
viruses have been circulating, apparently simultaneously, in PNG in recent
years). Or did the JE vaccine have an ameliorating affect on the severity
of dengue in the outer island residents who had been vaccinated less than
12 months previously? (An ameliorating affect was suggested - albeit with
low statistical power - in the randomised trial of the JE vaccine in
Thailand; the affect was noted particularly in the short-term after
vaccination. NEJM 1998; 319:608-614).

The median age of the 201 cases was 31.4 (range 1.1-75.3) years. As
expected, 87% of the patients were aged 15 years or older. Certainly the
majority of the residents of the outer islands who developed dengue 2 had
previously been vaccinated against JE; indeed the vaccine-induced
antibodies created considerable difficulties for the diagnostic laboratory.
All 7 hospitalised cases were adults.

that vaccination against Japanese encephalitis negatively effects clinical
severity of subsequent dengue infections. - Mod.CHC
