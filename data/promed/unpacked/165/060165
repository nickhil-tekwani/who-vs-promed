Heroin shortage in UK is "putting lives at risk"
------------------------------------------------
[UK] hospitals are treating a growing number of drug users who have
overdosed on heroin mixed with other substances by dealers because of a
huge shortage of the opiate across the UK. One of the most severe heroin
"droughts" for 5 years has been reported in areas across the UK, including
London, Lancashire, Surrey, and Stockton-on-Tees. The shortage has been
linked not to seizures of the drug by law enforcement agencies but to a
fungus that has blighted this year's [2010] poppy crop in Afghanistan,
reducing it by half.

Users are overdosing either on adulterated heroin or, in some cases, what
has been found to be a combination of a powerful sedative, caffeine, and
paracetamol. Some have become unconscious very soon after injecting or
smoking it, while others have reported vomiting, flu-like symptoms, and
amnesia, drug agencies say. One of the most recent reports of overdoses and
hospital admissions came last week from Hastings, where 4 users overdosed
even though they had only taken a small amount of what they thought was
heroin. Toxicologist Dr John Ramsey, head of the Tictac Communications
drugs database at St George's Medical School, London, said he had had about
50 recent requests to analyse adulterated heroin.

While sedatives of the type turning up in recent batches used to be found
only in the occasional sample of heroin, there appeared to be much more of
it around now, he said. Gary Sutton, head of drugs at the charity Release,
said: "There is a very significant heroin shortage across the UK at the
moment. It has been going on for some time now, but the last 2 months have
seen stockpiles exhausted." He expressed concern that what was being sold
as heroin at the moment appeared to be adulterated with a powerful sedative
and mixed with a high percentage of bulking agents like talcum powder or
paracetamol. "If people use this intravenously, perhaps on top of alcohol
and methadone [the prescribed substitute drug for heroin], it is extremely
risky. We have had many reports of people overdosing. It's really important
that accident and emergency departments understand that they may not be
dealing with a "normal" heroin overdose when people are brought in," he said.

"When the drought ends, prices will rise. Heroin tolerance will be reduced,
so the risk of fatal overdose will be much higher."

Such is the alarm about the current situation that several drugs agencies
committed to harm reduction held an urgent meeting last week to discuss
setting up an online warning system about contaminated street drugs. Neil
Hunt, director of research at KCA, a nationwide community drug treatment
service, said: "This "heroin drought" appears to be serious and
geographically widespread. Street heroin is in a complete and utter muddle
at the moment, and users are collapsing unexpectedly. We need to
standardise information about what's out there."

Among heroin users commenting in online forums about the drought, one long
term user said: "I've never known anything like it in 30 years."

[Bob tells me that back in October 2000 the BBC filed a report on the
"Sunshine Project". This involved the alleged use of a disused bio-warfare
facility in Uzbekistan to produce _Pleospora papaveracea_ and/or _Fusarium
oxysporum_, to kill off the opium poppy. There is a covert history of this
type of activity over the past few decades. This heroin shortage in Europe
may explain the increasing frequency of reports of drugs being shipped from
Latin America to Africa and Europe. - Mod.MHJ]
