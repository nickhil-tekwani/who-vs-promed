The virus that killed 5 people at Jaipurhat in the last 4 days has been identified as Nipah.

The Institute of Epidemiology Diseases Control and Research (IEDCR) confirmed on its website on Tuesday [24 Jan 2012] that the 5 had indeed died from [a] Nipah [virus infection]. A team from the institute are now working in the affected area.

The IECDR said human infections took place in Joypurhat municipality and Khetlal Upazila.

Of the 5 deaths, 2 are from Khetlal and the others from the municipality. They died in Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital in Bogra and Rajshahi Medical College Hospital.

On 21 Jan [2012], a 5-member IECDR expert team went to Bogra and Rajshahi to collect blood and other samples.

Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital said it had launched a separate unit for Nipah [virus]-infected patients.

Nipah virus causes severe illness characterised by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), respiratory disease, seizures, vomiting and fainting.

Experts advise against drinking unprocessed date extracts, as fruit bats, the natural host of the Nipah virus, could contaminate the juice. They also advise not to eat partially eaten fruits, to wash them before eating, and to wash hands after coming into contact with patients.

[Cases of Nipah virus infection occur sporadically in Bangladesh. The most recent outbreak reported occurred last year (2011) at this same period of time. From 31 Jan - 5 Mar 2011, an outbreak in Rangpur region resulted in the deaths of 35 persons, including babies, boys, adolescents, and women (see ProMED-mail archive number 20110308.0756).

_Pteropus_ giant fruit bats ("flying foxes") are the natural hosts of Nipah virus, and virus shedding occurs when females are pregnant or lactating.

One hopes that the public information effort mentioned in the report above is successful and that another outbreak of the size of 2011's does not occur again.
