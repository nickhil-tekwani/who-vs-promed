1st Report of a Geminivirus Associated with Leaf Curl in Baja
California Peninsula Tomato Fields.

Since November 2001, geminivirus-like symptoms (stunting, reduced
leaf size, and leaf curling "chino") have been observed in tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.) plantings in Baja California Sur,
Mexico.
Samples of symptomatic plants were collected from commercial fields
and analyzed by traditional and molecular methods for the presence of
geminiviruses. Inocula prepared from infected plants were
experimentally transmitted to tomato seedlings and _Datura
stramonium_ by mechanical inoculation and whitefly transmission. Leaf
curling and interveinal chlorosis symptoms similar to those found in
the field were observed in inoculated tomato and _D. stramonium_.
DNA from infected plants was extracted and analyzed by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis using degenerate primers
PALIv1978/PARIc494 (1). PCR fragments of the expected size (1.1 kb)
for the common region (CR) were obtained from 28 of 64 plants, cloned
and sequenced (GenBank Accession No. AY336088).
Comparisons of CR sequences with the NCBI database by using BLAST and
MegAlign (DNASTAR, London) indicated that the Baja Californian
isolates were New World bipartite begomoviruses sharing the highest
nucleotide sequence identity (93 percent) with a partially
characterized geminivirus (Tomato severe leaf curl virus (ToSLCV);
GenBank Accession No. AF130415) from Guatemala.

[ToSLCV strains have also been reported from Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua, and Cuba. Cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_) and tomato are
natural hosts. These strains likely originated in Central America and
the Caribbean region. The genomes of these viruses are either
monopartite or bipartite, the viruses are transmitted by whiteflies
(_Bemisia tabaci_), and they infect a range of dicotyledonous plants.
Disease management involves procedures to delay infection, regulated
applications of insecticides, use of biopesticides (parasitoids and
predators), and planting resistant cultivars if they are available.
