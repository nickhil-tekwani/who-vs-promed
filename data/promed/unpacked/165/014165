Deaths Among Children During an Outbreak of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease
Taiwan, Republic of China, April-July 1998
--------------------------------------------------------------------
During April-July 1998, the Ministry of Health in Taiwan received
approximately 90,000 reports of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) among
young children based on passive surveillance from sentinel physicians.
Approximately 320 children have been hospitalized with HFMD associated with
suspected meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and
at least 55 have died. This report describes the clinical course of two
fatal cases and presents summary findings from an ongoing clinical,
epidemiologic, and laboratory investigation of the 55 deaths.
A case was defined as refractory shock following a prodromal acute illness
characterized by fever or rash that resulted in the death of a previously
healthy child. Cases of HFMD have been reported from all regions of Taiwan,
including Taipei City, with most reported from the central and northern
regions...
Summary Findings
-----------------------
All 55 previously healthy children initially developed an acute illness
characterized by fever, or rash, or mouth ulcers. Approximately 2-7 days
(median: 3 days) after onset of illness, case-patients were hospitalized
for rapid cardiopulmonary failure. In 41 case-patients, death occurred
within 24 hours of hospitalization despite respiratory and cardiovascular
support. Of the 55 children, 43 (78%) were aged less than 3 years (median
age: 17 months; range: 3-151 months), 32 (58%) were male, and most lived in
the central (27 [49%) or northern (21 [38%) regions of Taiwan. Reasons
for seeking medical attention included respiratory distress (17 [31%) or
an altered level of consciousness (14 [25%). Thirteen (24%) children were
comatose on admission. Forty-four (80%) case-patients either died in the
emergency department or were admitted directly to an intensive-care unit.
All case-patients required intubation for respiratory distress during their
illness. The last child who died was admitted on July 8. EV71 was
identified in the central nervous system tissue from one autopsy and in
preliminary studies was isolated from 14 specimens from the 55
case-patients. In addition, one specimen was positive for EV71 by
polymerase chain reaction.
[MMWR Editorial Note: EV71 is one of two etiologic agents of epidemic HFMD
and has been associated with other febrile rash illnesses, aseptic
meningitis, encephalitis, and a syndrome of AFP similar to that caused by
poliovirus. This is the third known EV71 outbreak resulting in rapid
clinical deterioration and death among young children; previous outbreaks
primarily among children aged less than 3 years occurred in Bulgaria during
May-September 1975 (44 cases) and in Malaysia during April-June 1997 (28
cases). In Bulgaria, the outbreak was characterized by rapid onset of
central nervous system disease (described as "medullary involvement"); EV71
was isolated from 27 of 29 fatal cases. In Malaysia, clinical presentations
were similar to the case-patients in Taiwan. The outbreak involved children
who had febrile illnesses, oral ulcers, or hands or feet rash followed by
rapid clinical deterioration. Most died within 24 hours of admission to
area hospitals. Immunohistochemical evidence of EV71 infection was detected
in central nervous system tissues from four of five case-patients. Other
viruses isolated from Malaysian case-patients included echovirus 25,
adenovirus, and coltivirus (L. Munn Sann, Malaysia Ministry of Health,
personal communication, 1997).
The etiologies of the deaths in Malaysia and Taiwan are still under
investigation. The epidemiologic (presence of concomitant HFMD outbreaks),
clinical (presence of HFMD rash in most case-patients), and virologic
(isolation of EV71 from case-patients) evidence suggest an association
between EV71 infection and these deaths. However, further evidence is
required to conclude that EV71 infection alone is responsible for all
deaths reported from Malaysia or Taiwan. In Malaysia, various other
potential causative agents were identified, and EV71 was isolated from only
two of 11 specimens submitted to CDC. The EV71 isolates recovered from
case-patients in Taiwan are genetically distinct from the strains from
patients in Malaysia. Case-control studies are under way in Taiwan to
further assess the associations between EV71 infections and rapid death and
to identify other potential factors or cofactors (e.g., toxins, medicines,
or environmental exposures) that might contribute to the disease process.
Laboratory studies also are under way to further characterize the viral
agents recovered, and clinical review of suspected cases is in progress.
Clinicians and health-care providers who encounter similar deaths among
children should report cases through their local ministry of health to
CDC's Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Branch, Division of Viral and
Rickettsial Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases; telephone
(404) 639-3596.
