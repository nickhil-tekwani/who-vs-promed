We note the statement in the subject post by moderator MHJ: "The ISU team have identified their affected piglets as being infected with a pestivirus, the genus to which classical swine fever virus or hog cholera virus (HCV), if you prefer, belongs. I suspect that the ISU people have just stumbled on some herds congenitally affected with CSF or HC. As this classical disease is meant to have been eradicated in the US, they have opened an interesting door."

This is an understandable error considering the limited information in the news article and the clinical signs. However, in an oral presentation at the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD)/United States Animal Health Assocation (USAHA) annual meetings last month [October 2015], a description of the sequences revealed that while the agent is a pestivirus, having the typical genes of that genus, the sequence identity with classical swine fever, bovine viral diarrhea, and border disease virus was very low. It was low enough that targeted PCRs for those viruses would not have cross-reacted and detected the agent, requiring the sequencing techniques cited in the article.

This agent is not the agent of classical swine fever, which was eradicated from the United States.

We hope your readers will continue to follow publications on investigations of the new pestivirus, where additional details will no doubt be provided.

[Randall's comment is much appreciated in response to my dragging my coat on the actual identity of this "pestivirus". Okay, so it is a pestivirus but very dissimilar to CSFv (classical swine fever virus) but it can produce a similar, possibly identical, nervous congenital lesion resulting in shaking in piglets. That provides the potential for deciphering the genomics to identify those sequences responsible for this lesion or lesions. And we can ignore the rest in this regard. (I am an optimist.) - Mod.MHJ
