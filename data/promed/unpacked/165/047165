The Bulgarian Food Safety Agency said on [Tue 23 Oct 2018] that it had confirmed a case of African swine fever [ASF] in a wild boar near Kaynardzha in the country's Silistra district.

Silistra is a port city in north-eastern Bulgaria, on the southern bank of the Danube River, Bulgaria's border with Romania - one of the European countries recently hardest-hit by African swine fever [see comment].

The wild boar was found dead entangled in a wire fence at the Romanian - Bulgarian border, the agency said. Tests had confirmed the presence of the ASF virus. The carcass had been destroyed and buried. Disinfection was carried out where it was buried.

The Bulgarian Food Safety Agency said that it was carrying out all steps mandated by current legislation. It said that clinical examinations were being carried out to detect ASF, including through checks of wild and domestic swine.

Currently, ASF has been detected in 9 EU countries: Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Hungary, Latvia, and Romania.

A meeting of an official veterinary control committee would be held in Silistra on [Wed 24 Oct 2018] to discuss steps against the sickness in the area, Bulgaria's Food Safety Agency said.

A total of 20 km [approx. 12 mi] of a crisis and another 20 km [approx. 12 mi] of buffer zone are formed around the Kaynardzha village, where a body of a wild boar was found in the vicinity of the Bulgarian-Romanian border a few days ago, BNT reported. Samples are positive for African swine fever, according to information from the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BSAF).

At a meeting of the Epizootic Commission in Silistra today [Wed 24 Oct 2018], the measures for the prevention of the disease in domestic pigs, on the private farms and in the industrial, commercial enterprises have been discussed. The lists of the private farms are to be updated.

[Bulgaria has submitted on Tue 23 Oct 2018, an official immediate notification to the OIE about the above, its 1st ASF case in a wild boar. See at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28379.

The current case, a wild boar, is located in the village Kaynardzha, bordering Romania's Calarasi province. Kaynardzha is located about 22 km [approx. 23 mi] south-east to the Bulgarian port city Silistra on the southern bank of the lower Danube river (map at https://tinyurl.com/ycmqaew7). From Silistra westwards, the Danube divides the 2 countries, forming a natural boundary between Romania and Bulgaria; Silistra is the western end of the fence planned to stretch from the Black Sea coast in north-east Bulgaria.

The 1st (and, so far, only) ASF outbreak in Bulgaria's domestic pigs was notified early September 2018 (20180903.6005066) involving backyard pigs on a farm in the village Tutrakantsi, Provadia, province of Varna (map at https://tinyurl.com/yaydognk).

Additional information on Bulgaria's ASF prevention policy, including a map presenting the fence route, is available in Bulgaria's SC PAFF presentation of 17 Oct 2018, at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20181017_pres_asf_bul.pdf. The presentation preceded the current wild-boar case. It would be interesting to obtain information on the structure of the (completed?) erected fence. Wild boars are known as notorious fence trespassers; it would require a robust fence to keep them away.

Romania has notified the OIE on 18 Oct 2018 about an outbreak in domestic pigs, in the southern province Teleorman, facing Bulgaria's Pleven province. Given start date was 28 Sep 2018 (see 20181018.6098967). Map at https://tinyurl.com/ybpshdsy; this presents a considerable leap westwards from Romania's south-eastern explosive ASF cluster.

Additional (17) outbreaks in southern Romania, adjacent to the Bulgarian border, affecting domestic pigs and wild boar, have been reported in today's (24 Oct 2018) follow-up report No 11, with map; http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28314. - Mod.AS
