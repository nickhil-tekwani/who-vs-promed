One Additional Deer Tests Positive for Chronic Wasting Disease in
Hampshire County, West Virginia
-----------------------------------------------
Preliminary test results have detected the Chronic Wasting Disease
(CWD) agent in one hunter-harvested deer collected in Hampshire
County during the 2006 deer hunting season.
"As part of our agency's ongoing and intensive CWD surveillance
effort, samples were collected from 1355 hunter-harvested deer
brought to game checking stations in Hampshire County," according to
Frank Jezioro, Director for the West Virginia Division of Natural
Resources (DNR).
"This most recent positive CWD sample was taken from a
2-and-a-half-year-old buck harvested during the firearms deer season,
and the deer was located within close proximity to the 9 positive
cases previously detected in Hampshire County."
CWD has now been detected in a total of 10 deer in Hampshire County
(i.e., one road-killed deer, 4 deer collected by the DNR in 2005, 4
deer collected by the DNR in 2006 and one hunter-harvested deer
during the 2006 deer season).
"Our analysis of this CWD surveillance data indicates the disease
appears to be found in a relatively small geographical area located
near Slanesville, West Virginia," noted DNR Director Frank Jezioro.
"From a wildlife disease management perspective, we consider this to
be encouraging news. Based upon these CWD surveillance findings, we
are taking the steps necessary to implement appropriate management
actions designed to control the spread of this disease, prevent
further introduction of the disease, and possibly eliminate the
disease from the state," Jezioro said.
The following disease management options have been evaluated and
implemented by the DNR within the affected area of Hampshire County:
--Continue CWD surveillance efforts designed to determine the
prevalence and distribution of the disease;
--Lower deer population levels to reduce the risk of spreading the
disease from deer to deer by implementing appropriate antlerless deer
hunting regulations designed to increase hunter opportunity to
harvest female deer;
--Establish reasonable, responsible and appropriate deer carcass
transport restrictions designed to lower the risk of moving the
disease to other locations;
--Establish reasonable, responsible and appropriate regulations
relating to the feeding and baiting of deer within the affected area
to reduce the risk of spreading the disease from deer to deer.
"Landowner and hunter cooperation throughout this entire CWD
surveillance effort in Hampshire County has been just terrific," Jezioro noted.
"As we strive to meet this wildlife disease challenge and implement
appropriate management strategies, the support and involvement of
landowners and hunters will continue to be essential. The DNR remains
committed to keeping the public informed and involved in these
wildlife disease management actions."
CWD is a neurological disease found in deer and elk, and it belongs
to a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies. The disease is thought to be caused by abnormal,
proteinaceous particles, called prions, that slowly attack the brain
of infected deer and elk causing the animals to progressively become
emaciated, display abnormal behavior, and invariably results in the
death of the infected animal. There is no known treatment for CWD,
and it is fatal for the infected deer or elk. It is important to note
that currently, there is no evidence to suggest CWD poses a risk for
humans or domestic animals.
"Our well-trained and professional wildlife biologists, wildlife
managers and conservation officers are working diligently to fully
implement the DNR's CWD Incident Response Plan, which is designed to
effectively address this wildlife disease threat," said Jezioro.
"Hunters, landowners and other members of the public should feel
confident that we have some of the best wildlife biologists and
veterinarians in the world, including those stationed at the
Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study in Athens, Georgia,
working collaboratively on this situation."

[Perhaps West Virginia can eliminate the disease from the state, but
Wisconsin has been unsuccessful in its attempts to do so. The disease
eradication zone in Wisconsin has caused considerable public outcry
and has taxed the will and resources of the people. However,
Wisconsin did succeed in getting several million dollars (6 million?)
for their trial at eradicating it.
West Virginia's situation appears to be a little different, but they
would be wise to consider the public response. Currently, their plan
looks manageable and relatively palatable. - Mod.TG]

16 more CWD deer discovered
-----------------------------------
Tests for chronic wasting disease found 16 more confirmed cases in
northern Illinois this fall [2006], bringing the total to 163 since
the state's 1st infected deer was discovered in 2002 near
Roscoe. The positive tests came from deer killed by firearm and
archery hunters and a few suspicious deer taken by DNR staff.
Winnebago and DeKalb counties each had 6, Boone County 4. All but
one case was from deer in previously infected areas. The exception
was a deer killed in southern DeKalb County, about 7 miles from the
LaSalle County line. The state has included southern DeKalb in next
month's [January 2007] special CWD hunt because of the new discovery.
The latest positives came from about 2500 deer. Tests have not been
completed on all deer sampled during the firearm seasons. Midwest
states had increased firearm deer harvests this season. Illinois'
total was 115 192 deer, compared with 114 209 last year [2005].
Wisconsin's harvest was 336 211, compared with 325 630 in 2005.
Michigan's harvest was up about 7 percent at about 258 000. Minnesota
doesn't yet have a total, but officials expect it to surpass 250 000,
which would place it among the state's 5 best harvests.

[It is interesting that 2 of the 3 states named as having a larger
deer harvest have CWD and that the 3rd state's deer have been
involved in the tuberculosis outbreak in Michigan. There are no links
to indicate that CWD has caused any human health problems. - Mod.TG]
