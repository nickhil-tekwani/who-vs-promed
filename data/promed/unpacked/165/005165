--------------------------------------------
Cuba:
No new cases have been confirmed since epidemiological week (EW) 8 of 2014 [week ending 22 Feb 2014]. In EW 38 of 2014 [week ending 20 Sep 204], the Chile International Health Regulations National Focal Point reported a confirmed case of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, serotype Ogawa, in a Chilean national with travel history to Cuba.

Between EW 1 and EW 41 of 2014 [1 Jan-11 Oct 2014], there were 209 suspected cholera cases, including 5 deaths, signifying a monthly average of 23 cases. This is less than the number of new cases registered in the same period of 2013 (monthly average of 130 cases and a total of 13 deaths), in 2012 (monthly average of 557 cases and a total of 21 deaths), and in 2011 (monthly average of 240 cases and 35 deaths in total).

While the number of reported cases for 2014 remains well below those reported in previous years, there is a steady increase in cases since EW 37. Between EW 1 to EW 37 of 2014 [1 Jan-13 Sep 2014], the weekly average of new cases was between 250-290, however, from EW 38 to EW 44 [14 Sep-1 Nov 2014] the weekly average increased to 629 new cases.
