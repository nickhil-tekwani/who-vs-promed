The New Mexico Department of Health announced an outbreak of lab-confirmed salmonellosis in 7 people related to baby poultry. The 7 cases reside in Curry, Eddy, Lea, Luna, Otero, and Taos counties respectively. 4 of the cases were in infants 13 months of age or younger and two of them were hospitalized. The department is warning families to keep baby chicks or other baby birds out of their homes and use caution in order to avoid salmonellosis.

"The infection in young children can be a very serious illness, sometimes fatal," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward. "We are urging families that have recently purchased baby birds to not allow the animals inside their home where they can contaminate the environment and potentially infect people, especially children."

"Salmonella is often present in the droppings of chicks and other baby birds, even though the animals themselves usually do not show signs of illness," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, Public Health Veterinarian at the Department of Health. "That makes it easy for people to let their guard down, and that's when they run the risk of getting salmonellosis. An increasing number of people around New Mexico are choosing to keep live poultry, such as chickens or ducks, as part of a greener, healthier lifestyle. While they enjoy the benefits of backyard chickens and other poultry, it is important to consider the risk of illness, especially for children, which can result from handling live poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam."
