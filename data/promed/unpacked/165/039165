Britons living in what is described as the remotest community in the
world are seeking help after the outbreak of an acute virus
[infection]. Many of the 271 British citizens living on the volcanic
island of Tristan da Cunha, in the south Atlantic, have developed
severe breathing problems. They need to ensure that their current
medical supplies do not run out. An international operation to
provide help is being led by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

BBC world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge said the islanders
were being affected by what appears to be an outbreak of
viral-inducted asthma, which causes severe breathing problems.
Tristan da Cunha's one resident doctor, a South African, has issued
an appeal for medical supplies. The South African Marine Rescue
Co-ordination Centre was alerted first and informed British
coastguards. The volcanic island has no airstrip, making getting
medicines there difficult. However, merchant ships in the area are
unlikely to have the necessary drugs on board and a coastguard
spokesman said there were no British military vessels nearby at present.

Viruses have swept through the island before but Michael Swales,
chairman of the Tristan da Cunha association, said he could not
recall medicines becoming exhausted on previous occasions. He said
there was particular concern about the health of the elderly and the
very young.

Tristan da Cunha is situated 2800 km (1740 mi) west of Cape Town,
South Africa, and is part of a small group of islands. It was at one
time on the main trading route between Europe and the Indian Ocean,
but the small community living there is now extremely isolated. The
community of 275 people describe themselves as living in the world's
most isolated settlement. The island is famous for a mass evacuation
to Southampton in the 1960s after a volcano erupted. The main island
is about 38 sq miles (98 sq km) and the currency is the British pound.

[Debora MacKenzie has also sent us the same report.

Episodes of asthma may be triggered by such things as exposure to an
environmental stimulant (or allergen) such as cold air, warm air,
moist air, exercise or exertion, or emotional stress. In children,
the most common triggers are viral infection, although no specific
virus is associated with asthma. It is not clear why this outbreak
has been attributed to viral infection, and the nature of the
medicines in short supply is also unclear. Further information is awaited.
