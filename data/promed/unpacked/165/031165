8 monkeys died of suspected yellow fever in the past 15 days
------------------------------------------------------------
On Wednesday afternoon (15 [Apr 2009]), the Maringa municipality
decided to indefinitely close the Inga Park to the public. The park
closure is due to the death of 8 primates with suspected yellow fever
[virus infection] in the last 15 days.

The decision to ban access to the reserve came from the municipal
Secretariats of Environment and of Health as a precautionary measure,
at least until the investigation confirmed whether or not the deaths
were caused by yellow fever.

The Superintendent of Health Surveillance of the State Secretariat of
Health, Jose Lucio dos Santos, who was in Maringa this Thursday [9
Apr 2009], said that, pending determination of the cause of death of
the monkeys, the park should remain closed. According to him,
however, there is no reason for alarm. The forest reserve, located in
Center, has about 150 marmosets -- which live free in the forest --
and 7 monkeys which are kept in captivity.

Teams of the Health Surveillance of Santa Cruz do Sul and the 13th
Coordination Regional Health Unit (CRS) yesterday [14 Apr 2009] began
investigating the death of a 28-year-old woman who may have suffered
a reaction after receiving yellow fever [YF] vaccine. A resident of
Vila Nova, she died at the weekend.

This is the 1st suspected death recorded in the Rio Pardo Valley
since vaccination against this disease began. In Santa Maria, 2
people died from complications caused by the vaccine. According to
coordinator of the epidemiological section of CRS, Beanir Lara,
reporting is necessary in such cases. "They may have been due to
various causes, but we have to eliminate whatever suspected cause [of
death]", she stressed. She emphasizes that the patient had bleeding
and also was icteric (jaundiced), which may be a sign of adverse
reaction [to the YF vaccine].

Starting with this case, a study will be carried out to identify what
actually caused the death of this student. Yesterday afternoon [14
Apr 2009] the nurses of Health Surveillance were in the family home
to collect more information, but the Secretary of Health, Leni
Weigelt, preferred not to give details. She said she will need to
await the findings to identify what really happened.

Risk
----
Complaints by people who suffered allergic reactions after being
immunized against yellow fever have been given to the health posts.
However, they [often] fail to be notified, because the manifestations
are of short duration. According to the Ministry of Health, there are
rare cases of allergic reactions. As indicated in a notice published
by the Municipal Secretariat of Health, a dose [of YF vaccine] is
contraindicated in persons with acute febrile diseases, allergy to
eggs, in pregnant women, patients with cancer or AIDS and children
less than 9 months.

[This is the biggest problem: the yellow fever vaccine, a live
attenuated virus vaccine, is highly effective; however, vaccination
of people who are not at risk of infection has a bad relative
risk:benefit [relationship].

Without a doubt, the Rio Grande do Sul region is passing through a
period of intensified transmission of jungle [sylvan] yellow fever
virus and vaccination is indicated. However, it is very difficult to
assess the risk for every [individual]. This implies that the
vaccination must be indiscriminate, unfortunately, [leading to]
occurrence of an event as described above. As for other [adverse]
manifestations of the vaccine, they are usually unimportant. -
Mod.LJS]

[It is important to determine if the adverse reactions noted above
are, in fact, due to the YF vaccine, or to something else.
Unsubstantiated reports of death or other serious reactions to the
vaccine in the popular press may have the unintended unfortunate
consequence of discouraging people who are truly at risk of YF virus
infection from receiving the vaccine, or from being revaccinated if
their previous vaccination was received 10 or more years ago. The
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC)
reports (<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#yf>)
that mild reactions to YF vaccine may occur in 25 percent of
vaccinees and include soreness and swelling at the site of
inoculation, fever and myalgia lasting for up to 7 days. The CDC
reports that "Severe problems (estimates based on passive reporting)
may include:
- Life-threatening allergic reaction (approximately 1 reported per
131 000 doses).
- Severe nervous system reactions (approximately 1 reported per 150
000 to 250 000 doses).
- Life-threatening severe illness with major organ system failure
(approximately 1 reported per 200 000 to 300 000 doses, or 1 reported
per 40 000 to 50 000 doses in people 60 years of age and older). More
than half of the people who suffer these side effects die."
