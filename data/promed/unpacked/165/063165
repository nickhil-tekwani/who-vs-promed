I just wanted to clarify a few things. 1st, the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased distinctly since 2000, roughly about 50 percent. Comparing the time period from 1985 through 2000 (average reported number of TBE per year 66) with the period from 2001 through 2016 (average reported number of TBE per year 138), the trend is even more obvious.

This year (2017) may be on track to exceed the number of TBE cases that were reported in the record year 2006 (245). I therefore believe that Steve Berger's statement that there was "somewhat of an increase" appears to be an understatement.

Regarding the comparison of the Swiss TBE incidence with its neighboring countries, which is nicely displayed on Gideon (https://www.gideononline.com/2017/10/11/tick-borne-encephalitis-switzerland/), it has to be noted that the impressive decrease of TBE in Austria, which had comparatively extremely high TBE incidence levels before the mid-1980s, nicely reflects the impact of vaccination, which is forcefully promoted there.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ivo Foppa for pointing out the trend for increasing TBE cases in Switzerland.

Perhaps a proactive vaccination campaign against TBE as has been implemented in Austria can reverse the increasing trend. Health officials in Switzerland urge individuals to become vaccinated. The WHO states, "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/

Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
