Vesicular Stomatitis Diagnosed in Colorado
------------------------------------------
VS-Specific Travel Requirement Remains in Effect

A Las Animas County premises is under quarantine after a horse tested positive for vesicular stomatitis (VS); the horse had not recently traveled and is believed to have been infected by insects. The Colorado Department of Agriculture recommends tips and guidelines for the horse and livestock industries.

"While this is the 1st case diagnosed in Colorado in 2012, there have been several cases identified in the Rio Grande River valley of New Mexico," said State Veterinarian, Dr. Keith Roehr [see ProMED refs. below]. "This Colorado case represents a northern movement of the virus that has been typical in past years."

VS is a Foreign Animal Disease that occurs sporadically in certain areas of the western United States. The last confirmed case of VS in Colorado was diagnosed in 2006.

Travel Requirement
------------------
The Colorado Department of Agriculture's State Veterinarian's Office has issued a travel requirement for horses, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, swine and camelids entering the state from states with confirmed cases of VS.

This requirement states that health certificates should include the following statement from the issuing veterinarian, "I have examined the animal(s) represented on this Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) and have found no signs of vesicular stomatitis and they have not originated from a premises under quarantine for vesicular stomatitis."

"The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that veterinarians issuing health certificates are aware of the spread of Vesicular Stomatitis and are vigilant in looking for signs of the virus. VS can be painful for the animals and costly to their owners," said Roehr. "While this virus does not typically cause death, the animal can suffer from painful sores, so it is important to monitor herds for symptoms."

[I have only posted the first part of this report. The rest has instructions to horse owners and their veterinarians.

To find Las Animas county, go to:

It is in the SW corner of the state on the border with New Mexico, and therefore possibly of the same ecosystem. - Mod MHJ]
