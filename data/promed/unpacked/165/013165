CDC issues health advisory re. anthrax exposure in department of
defense mail facility
---------------------
CDC Health Advisory
Possible Anthrax Exposure in Department of Defense Mail Facility
Source:
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/han031505.asp>
Distributed via Health Alert Network, 15 Mar 2005.
Samples taken from a mail facility at the Pentagon at a Remote
Delivery Facility (RDF) on 10 Mar 2005 tested positive for _Bacillus
anthracis_. The Department of Defense (DOD) briefed all personnel who
may have had contact with the mail at the Pentagon RDF. These
employees are being provided with antibiotics as a prophylactic
measure. Based on the route of mail reaching the Pentagon, CDC has
made the following public health recommendations for USPS postal
workers at the V Street Postal Facility in Washington DC, where the
DOD mail was processed prior to being sent to the Pentagon:
[1] Active medical follow-up should be initiated; that is, interviews
with possibly affected workers for evidence of symptoms and review of
sick leave records.
[2] Although risk is considered to be low, based on an abundance of
caution, a course of prophylactic antibiotics (doxycycline or
ciprofloxacin; both are equally effective) is recommended, until
tests determining possible exposure to _B. anthracis_ at the V Street
facility can be conducted.
CDC has also recommended that DOD follow up immediately with other
non-USPS commercial mail carriers that deliver to the DOD facility to
share information on:
- Positive alarm signals
- Recommendations for USPS workers, so that those carriers can take
steps as needed to follow up with their employees
[1] Extensive environmental sampling will be conducted in the
Pentagon's RDF and the V Street Postal Facility to determine the
extent of anthrax contamination [That's strange -- I thought that
identification was a false positive? - Mod.JW].
[2] Clinicians and public health agencies are encouraged to heighten
their surveillance for typical symptoms and exposure history for _B.
anthracis_. Clinicians should report suspected or confirmed anthrax
cases immediately to your local or state department of health.
Anthrax causes and transmission:
-------------------------------
Anthrax is caused by exposure to _B. anthracis_, an encapsulated,
aerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium.
Depending on the route of infection, human anthrax can occur in 3
clinical forms: cutaneous, inhalational, and gastrointestinal. Direct
skin contact with contaminated animal products can result in
cutaneous anthrax. Inhalation of aerosolized spores, such as through
industrial processing of contaminated wool, hair, or hides, can
result in inhalational anthrax. Hemorrhagic meningitis can result
from hematogenous spread of the organism following any form of the
disease.
The incubation period for anthrax is generally <2 weeks. However, due
to spore dormancy and slow clearance from the lungs, the incubation
period for inhalational anthrax may be prolonged. This phenomenon of
delayed onset of disease is not recognized to occur with cutaneous or
gastrointestinal exposures.
Skin/cutaneous anthrax:
----------------------
Skin or cutaneous anthrax is the most common type of
naturally-acquired infection. Infection begins as a pruritic papule
or vesicle that enlarges and erodes (1-2 days), leaving a necrotic
ulcer with subsequent formation of a central black eschar (images at
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/anthrax-images/cutaneous.asp>).
The lesion is usually painless with surrounding edema, hyperemia, and
regional lymphadenopathy. Patients may have associated fever, malaise
and headache. Historically, the case-fatality rate for cutaneous
anthrax has been <1 percent with antibiotic treatment and 20 percent
without antibiotic treatment. There are rare case reports of
person-to-person transmission of cutaneous disease. See
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5042a1.htm#tab2>
for specific treatment of cutaneous anthrax.
Inhalational anthrax:
--------------------
Inhalational anthrax is rare but is the most lethal form of the
disease. Disease may initially involve a prodrome of fever, chills,
nonproductive cough, chest pain, headache, myalgias, and malaise.
However, more distinctive clinical hallmarks include hemorrhagic
mediastinal lymphadenitis, hemorrhagic pleural effusions, bacteremia
and toxemia resulting in severe dyspnea, hypoxia and septic shock.
Widened mediastinum is the classic finding on imaging of the chest,
but may initially be subtle (images at
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/anthrax-images/inhalational.asp>
and in the appendices). Case-fatality rates for inhalational anthrax
are high, even with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
Following the bioterrorist attack in fall 2001, the case-fatality
rate among patients with inhalational disease was 45 percent (5/11).
Person-to person spread of inhalational anthrax has not been
documented.
