Situation update for the week 5 to 12 Apr 2019
[The next update will be issued on 19 Apr 2019].
------------------
China:
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) confirmed its 1st ASF outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 Aug 2018, a total of 123 ASF outbreaks have been detected in 30 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities. Around 1 010 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

- Tibet (Xizang) Autonomous Region: The 1st ASF outbreaks occurred on 3 farms in Bayi District, Gongbu Jiangda County and Bomi County of Linzhi City; a total of 55 pigs died from the disease.

- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region: An ASF outbreak occurred on 4 Apr 2019 on one pig farm in Yecheng County, Kashgar Prefecture and a few days later on another farm in Shule County in Kashgar Prefecture; 39 of 341 pigs became sick and died and 150 of 583 pigs became sick of which 92 died from the disease, respectively.

Mongolia:
Since its 1st report on 15 Jan 2019, 11 outbreaks in 6 provinces and in Ulaanbaatar have been reported, involving 105 farms/households. More than 3115 pigs -- more than 10% of the total pig population in Mongolia -- have died/been destroyed due to the ASF outbreaks.

Viet Nam:
Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) confirmed its ASF outbreaks on 19 Feb 2019, 23 provinces/cities reported outbreaks, and more than 89 600 pigs have been culled.

Cambodia:
The Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries confirmed Cambodia's 1st ASF outbreak in a backyard farm in Som Thom Commune, O Ya Dav District, Ratanakiri province on 2 Apr 2019; more than 300 pigs have been culled.

New actions undertaken during the week:

China:
Dead pigs drifted ashore, one each, in Qingshuiwo, Nangan Township (island), Lianjiang County on 4 Apr 2019; Nan Stone Trap Park, Liao luo, Jinhu Township, Jinmen County on 7 Apr 2019; and Tongqiangshan, Ou Cuo Beach, Jin cheng Township, Jinmen County [in Taiwan] on 8 Apr 2019. The 3 pigs tested positive for ASF by PCR, and the genomic sequence analysis of both viruses showed 100% identity with ASF virus elsewhere in China.

Following assessment, the epidemic zone was lifted on 9 Apr 2019 in Xushui District, Baoding City, Hebei Province and in Yinhai District, Beihai City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as there were no new cases reported in the affected areas for 6 weeks. As of 5 Apr 2019, the quarantine in 109 epidemic zones has been lifted.

Viet Nam:
Movement control was lifted in Ninh Khang commune, Hoa Lu district, Ninh Binh Province on 8 Apr 2019 and Hop Thanh and Thanh Luong communes, Luong Son district, Hoa Binh Province on 9 Apr 2019, as there were no new cases reported in the affected areas for 30 days.

Cambodia:
Cambodia has implemented movement control of live pigs within the affected district. Stamping out, disposal and disinfection was completed in Som Kaninh Village on 10 Apr 2019. Further investigations have identified sick and dead pigs in other communes (Ya Tung commune and Som Thom commune). The confirmatory testing results of samples collected in surrounding communes are pending. The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) carried out a preliminary investigation of the affected area on 5-6 Apr 2019 and concluded the presence of wild boars around Som Kaninh and the surrounding villages.
