In a follow-up on the dengue epidemic on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, French health officials report an additional 298 biologically confirmed and probable cases in the past week, bringing the total to 2119 cases for the year [2018].

To date, 59 people have required hospitalization for their illness. This compares with 12 hospitalizations for all of 2017.

The following actions have been implemented in Reunion by public authorities:
- reinforced vector control measures, focusing primarily in areas around reported dengue cases;
- enhanced surveillance of cases;
- blood and safety of substances of human origin (SoHo) safety measures implemented;
- social mobilization activities; and
- specific risk communication messages aiming to raise dengue fever awareness among the public and health care workers, including posters at points of entry (PoE) and announcements onboard flights to and from RÃ©union.

_Aedes albopictus_ and _A. aegypti_ mosquitos are both found in Reunion; however, _A. albopictus_ has historically had the highest observed abundance.

On 27 Mar 2018, public authorities raised the level of the emergency plan "Organisation de la Reponse de Securite Civile" (ORSEC) to 3, corresponding to a low-level epidemic. This plan includes:
- active case finding;
- intensified vector control;
- reinforced communication to the public and health care workers;
- mobilization of additional resources, including human resources (such as firefighters).

[The ongoing dengue epidemic in Reunion Island is currently being classified as 'low level'. However, all the elements that could potentially cause escalation of the current status -- vector, virus, and human hosts -- are in place. The 2 key measures that can reduce the impact and eventual burden of human cases are stringent vector control with regular monitoring of indoor and outdoor vector indices and community mobilization/risk communication. - Mod.UBA
