The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of the Netherlands recently informed EPPO of the 1st finding of _Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus_ (_Crinivirus_, SPCSV) in sweet potato (_Ipomoea batatas_), a new crop in the country. SPCSV was found in 2 open fields in 2 provinces during an official survey. The sweet potato planting material originated from another EU Member State.

Plants with and without virus symptoms were sampled and tested. SPCSV was identified in several plants with virus-like symptoms (e.g. vein banding, discolouration, rings, dots). In several of these symptomatic plants, _Sweet potato virus G_ (_Potyvirus,_ SPVG) was also detected. The mixed infection may have increased the severity of the observed symptoms.

Official phytosanitary measures have been taken. The growers have to report to the NPPO when all the tubers have been harvested and the total quantity thereof. All infected lots should be stored in a traceable manner, separately from other lots. Only sales for consumption or processing are allowed. The growers should report when the infected lots have been sold or destroyed which has to occur before 31 March 2023.

The NPPO of Belgium recently informed EPPO of the 1st finding of _Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus_. Cuttings of sweet potatoes were imported from Portugal and planted in June 2022 in a field (2.5 ha). In September [2022], the farmer took a symptomatic sample for diagnosis and SPCSV was detected. An official sample was taken by the NPPO which confirmed the virus. Cuttings of the same imported lot had also been planted in other fields and SPCSV was found in additional areas.

An area has been demarcated and official measures taken: it is forbidden for one year to grow sweet potato in the fields where the infected lots had been planted. Harvested tubers may only be used for consumption and processing. Foliage should remain on the plot or be destroyed where possible. It is noted that the whitefly vector of SPCSV, _Bemisia tabaci_ (EPPO A2 List) does not occur outdoors in Belgium.

[_Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus_ (SPCSV; genus _Crinivirus_) is one of the co-infecting partners in sweet potato virus disease (SPVD). SPVD can cause severe yield losses and is considered the most serious disease of the crop worldwide. In Europe, SPCSV had been detected for the 1st time about 20 years ago in Spain, but the cultivation of the crop is increasing northwards due to warming climate. Since some of the other coinfecting partners are also present in the region, such as _Sweet potato feathery mottle virus_ (ProMED post 20040404.0929) and SPVG in item 2 above (both genus _Potyvirus_), a spread of SPVD is to be expected. Multiple viral infections are common in field plants, with the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement) resulting in dramatic increase of symptom severity. In predominantly vegetatively propagated crops like sweet potato, the risk of a build-up of viruses is increased.

Criniviruses are transmitted by a number of whitefly vectors, while some of the other SPVD partners, e.g. the potyviruses, are aphid transmitted. Outbreaks are usually associated with high vector populations. Control of insect transmitted viruses is particularly difficult in open field crops. Disease management may include vector control; removal of reservoirs of both virus and vectors; as well as use of crop varieties with increased pathogen tolerance or resistance. Certified virus-free planting material is essential, but "clean" plants may still become infected later in the field.
