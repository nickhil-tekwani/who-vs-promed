The cumulative incidence of hepatitis A in Khujand [the
administrative center of the Sogdinskiy (Sogd) oblast] for 2009
exceeded the 2008 incidence by 1000 cases. City physicians are
predicting an imminent outbreak.

The local hospital is admitting 10 new patients each day. Most cases
are pre-school children, and the reason for widespread infections is
considered to be a lack of proper hygiene. The patients are given
some injections and drugs in the hospital, but the main form of
treatment is diet, such as avoidance of heavy meals, fatty dishes and
fried food. All pediatric institutions are taking extra measures to
disinfect and promote hygiene to prevent the spread of infection.

[Tajikistan is traditionally a region with a high incidence of
hepatitis A virus infection (see ProMED-mail references below). The
total number of cases in the Sogdinskiy Oblast so far in 2009 is
4600. - Corr.BA]

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's stool. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene habits, such as hand-washing. The occurrence of
hepatitis A is often a good indicator of deficiencies in the public
water supply. Epidemics can be explosive in growth and cause
significant economic losses. An effective hepatitis A vaccine is
available and the most effective way to combat the disease.

Tajikistan is a landlocked country in Central Asia that borders
Afghanistan to the south, China to the east, Kyrgyzstan to the north,
and Uzbekistan to the west and northwest. The nation is unique in
that the majority culture is non-Turkic, unlike its neighbors to the
north and west and east. A map of Tajikistan showing the location of
Khujand in the far north of the country can be accessed at:
