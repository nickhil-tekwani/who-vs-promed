[1] Laying hens, migrating cranes

The Ministry of Agriculture announced today [19 Dec 2021] an unusual outbreak of bird flu in the locality of Margaliot [see map at <tinyurl.com/mtxksnbr>] in the Upper Galilee. Traffic restrictions on the entry of trucks and equipment into the poultry farms were imposed in the area, and anyone engaged with poultry elsewhere was instructed not to approach the coop complexes.

The Veterinary Services fear that they will have to prepare for the extermination of about half a million [240 000, according to other media reports] laying hens in order to prevent the spread of bird flu. The source of the disease is probably in the [migrating] cranes that brought the virus with them to the Hula valley [but see comment below]. Due to the avian influenza outbreak, the entrance of hikers to the Hula Lake Park [known in Hebrew as Agamon HaHula] and to the vicinity of the cranes has been closed.

This incident is accompanied by poultry mortality and requires culling and complete isolation until the event's termination is officially announced. This was informed to the owners of the poultry farms and the residents of [the regional Councils] Mevoot Hermon, Merom Hagalil and Ma'ale Yosef.

To prevent the spread of the disease, poultry breeders in the Upper Galilee have been instructed to refrain from reaching Margaliot in the coming days to prevent vehicles and trucks that had visited Margaliot, in particular those engaged in the supply of feed concentrates, from entering their premises, and to immediately notify any signs of disease or increased mortality among their birds. The Ministry of Agriculture also instructed the growers to refrain from allowing manure removal contractors to approach the poultry farms until the announcement of the event termination.

The source of the outbreak is said to be a disease event in the Hula Lake Park [Agamon; see map at <tinyurl.com/2p9fu9dp>], which started last weekend, where hundreds of cranes were affected by bird flu and many died. The management of the Agamon said that they are constantly in contact with the professionals in the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture to find a solution to the issue [see comment below].

The Ministry of Agriculture updated the Ministry of Health yesterday [Fri 17 Dec 2021] on dozens of cranes infected with bird flu that were discovered in the Hula Valley. The Ministry of Health asks not to approach the migratory birds and to avoid contact.

The initial suspicion arose following an abnormal mortality of cranes at the site. Following this, samples were collected by the Nature and Parks Authority and sent to the Veterinary Institute's laboratory at the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary Services, which showed that wild birds were infected with H5N1 bird flu due to widespread morbidity. The Ministry of Agriculture regularly updates the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health).

This case joins other recent cases in which H5N1 avian influenza has been identified in wild birds. According to a report published by the (acting) Director of Veterinary Services, Dr. Tamir Goshen, many cases of wild bird disease have been diagnosed recently in several places in the country, including Moshav Hayogev in the Jezreel Valley, Agmon Hahula, Kibbutz Migdal Oz in Gush Etzion and Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon in the Hefer Valley. The current outbreak was detected in wild birds a few weeks ago, and so far has been diagnosed in cranes, pelicans and marbled ducks.

The Ministry of Agriculture also said that all avian influenza events this year [2021], as well as the current one, involved an H5N1 virus that could cause a low risk of human disease. This case joins other recent cases in which H5N1 bird flu has been identified on [5] poultry farms in Kfar Baruch, Kibbutz Ein Tzurim, Avigdor, Maayan Zvi and Nahalal. These events have been long resolved.

[The distance between Margaliot (adjacent to the Lebanese border) and the Agamon, on its southeast, is 13.20 km (8.20 mi).

The route and direction of introduction of the HPAI H5N1 into Israel and into the poultry farms (hen-to-crane or rather vice versa), and the reason(s) of the severe disease, including mass mortality among the cranes, an event not seen before in a location visited by 5-digit number of migrating cranes each November, are yet to be investigated and clarified. One hypothesis could be the cranes' possible susceptibility, becoming infected in this bird-crowded meeting site from co-visiting infected migrating waterbirds of the order Anseriformes, the latter known to remain subclinical while infective. A One Health approach, incorporating animal health, public health, and ornithologists, is warranted.

The Hula Valley is an agricultural region in northern Israel with abundant fresh water, which used to be Lake Hula, prior to its draining. Lake Hula and the marshland surrounding it were a breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying malaria, and so were drained in the 1950s. A small section of the valley was later re-flooded in an attempt to revive a nearly extinct ecosystem.

Hula Lake Park, known in Hebrew as Agamon HaHula, is located in the southern part of the Hula Valley. The new site has become the 2nd home for many thousands of migrating birds in the autumn and spring. The lake covers an area of one square kilometer, interspersed with islands that serve as protected bird nesting sites. It has become a major stopover for migrating birds flying from Europe to Africa and back, and also a major birdwatching site. In 2011, Israeli ornithologists confirmed that Lake Hula is the stopover point for tens of thousands of cranes migrating from Finland to Ethiopia every winter. In Israel, farmers set out food for them to keep them from damaging crops near the lake. This likely has contributed to increased density.

A 2.51-minute video clip presenting the event in the Agamon is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0QrhaM6X6I (Israel TV, Channel 11 News, 19 Dec 2021; presenter/commentator, Ruby Hammerschlag; in Hebrew). At the beginning, neurological clinical signs in an affected crane are presented. For a picture showing supernatant dead cranes in the Agamon (Hula Lake), see <tinyurl.com/3k24khww>. - Mod.AS]

[The affected birds are very likely common cranes (_Grus grus_). This species breeds in the northern parts of Europe and across the Palearctic to Siberia. In the boreal spring, these cranes embark on a long migration southward. Most eastern common cranes winter in the river valleys of Sudan, Ethiopia, Tunisia, and Eritrea with smaller numbers in Turkey, northern Israel, Iraq, and parts of Iran. - Mod.PMB
