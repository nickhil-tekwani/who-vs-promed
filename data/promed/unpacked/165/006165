Having already infected 26 people in the state [Maharashtra] this year [2017], Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne viral disease, has set a 5-year record. What is more worrying, the virus seems to have adapted and spread to areas outside its endemic zone. In fact, along with dengue and chikungunya, JE has emerged as a potential threat this year.

Till recently, JE cases were mostly confined to the state's eastern districts. However, most of the cases now are being reported from outside of the endemic zone. "Maharashtra has recorded a total of 26 Japanese encephalitis cases so far this year [2017]. Of these, 21 cases were recorded from outside the endemic areas, including Pune, Jalna, Raigad, Parbhani, Osmanabad, and Solapur," said MS Diggikar, the joint commissioner (vector-borne diseases) of the state health department.

This shift in transmission base of the virus is being observed for the 1st time in Maharashtra, indicating the virus's greater adaptability. Understandably, this has set the alarm bells ringing. State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, "We have been diagnosing the virus outside the endemic areas, mainly western Maharashtra and the Marathwada region, for the last one-and-a-half years. This means that the virus's endemic areas are expanding. It sure warrants a close watch."

The JE surveillance system, experts say, should be improved to better understand the drivers of the disease expansion for instituting a robust control programme. Awate also underlined the need for an in-depth study to gauge the virus's adaptability to different environs and vectors.

[Historically, JE cases have been relatively uncommon in this area. This year (2017) things are different, with 26 cases. The reasons for the increased case numbers and expansion into areas not considered endemic is undefined "virus adaptability". More likely, it is due to an increase in vector mosquito populations, or increases in numbers of reservoir bird hosts, or of pigs, the amplifying hosts. Studies of field conditions are needed. Avoidance of mosquito bites as is usually recommended is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult.
