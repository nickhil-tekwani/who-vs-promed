[1] COVID-19 associated mental health issues
Date: Tue 10 Nov 2020

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/10/one-in-five-covid-19-survivors-develop-mental-illness-study


Many COVID-19 survivors are likely to be at greater risk of developing mental illness, psychiatrists said, after a large study found 20 percent of those infected with the coronavirus are diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within 90 days.

Anxiety, depression, and insomnia were most common among the study's recovered COVID-19 patients who developed mental health problems, and the researchers also found significantly higher risks of dementia, a brain impairment condition.

"People have been worried that COVID-19 survivors will be at greater risk of mental health problems, and our findings ... show this to be likely," said Paul Harrison, author of the study and professor of psychiatry at the United Kingdom's University of Oxford.

Doctors and scientists around the world urgently need to investigate the causes and identify new treatments for mental illness after COVID-19, Harrison said.

The study, published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal [see reference below] on Monday [9 Nov 2020], analysed electronic health records of 69 million people in the United States, including more than 62 000 who had cases of COVID-19.

In the 3 months following testing positive for COVID-19, one in 5 survivors were recorded as having a 1st-time diagnosis of anxiety, depression, or insomnia. This was about twice as likely as for other groups of patients in the same period, the researchers said.

The study also found that people with a pre-existing mental illness were 65 percent more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 than those without one. 2 main factors could explain why people tend to develop anxiety and depressive symptoms, according to the study's author.

"The virus might be directly affecting the brain in some ways, maybe through the immune system, which leads to the mental health problem," Harrison told Al Jazeera.

"But more importantly, the experience of having had COVID-19 and understanding all the things that might have happened to you with all the fears and concerns that the virus led people to have, may also be a reason."

"[Health] services need to be ready to provide care, especially since our results are likely to be underestimates [of the number of psychiatric patients]," he added. Mental health specialists not directly involved with the study said its findings add to growing evidence that COVID-19 can affect the brain and mind, increasing the risk of a range of psychiatric illnesses.

Simon Wessely, regius professor of psychiatry at King's College London, said the finding that those with mental health disorders are also at higher risk of getting COVID-19 echoed similar findings from previous infectious disease outbreaks.

"COVID-19 affects the central nervous system, and so might directly increase subsequent disorders. But this research confirms that is not the whole story, and that this risk is increased by previous ill health," he said.

Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow the spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends, and colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental as well as our physical health.

The actual physical impact of COVID-19 infection on the brain leading to post infection mental issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other as yet unknown manifestations which are also affected by the prevalent pandemic situation and no end in sight. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Denmark: updates on mink culling plan
[A]
Date: Tue 10 Nov 2020
Source: Live Science [edited]
https://www.livescience.com/mink-culling-denmark-coronavirus-update.html


Last week [week of 2 Nov 2020], the Danish government announced plans to cull all farmed mink in the country to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus; now, legislators have dropped this plan, according to news reports.

Danish health authorities were initially concerned that a mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 could spread from mink to humans and render COVID-19 vaccines less effective, Live Science previously reported. The State Serum Institute, the Danish government's public health and infectious disease arm, did find evidence that the virus mutated in mink and then got transmitted to humans, but that's not enough evidence to say the virus changed in ways that would make vaccines ineffective.

"It's almost never the case that it's such a simple story of one mutation and all your vaccines stop working," Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Bern, Switzerland, told Stat News.

Experts from Denmark and abroad expressed similar doubts that the new mutation would undermine a human vaccine, The Guardian reported. Meanwhile, some legislators and law experts argued that the Danish government cannot legally order the mass killing, noting that many people make their livelihoods from mink farming.

At this point, the Danish government has stopped trying to pass emergency legislation to cull the mink, according to The Guardian. But others argue that culling remains the best option, both for public health and animal welfare.

"If mink on a farm are infected, suffering respiratory problems and are not being culled, their welfare will also be seriously compromised," Joanna Swabe, a policy adviser for Humane Society International, told The Guardian. "Mink, who are already stressed from the unnatural living conditions, experience severe respiratory distress before dying," the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association wrote in a statement. And life and death on a mink farm is no picnic even without COVID-19, according to National Geographic.

SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in mink around the world, including in the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Some infected minks show no symptoms, while others can develop nasal discharge, difficulty breathing, and even pneumonia, Science Magazine reported. Just like older humans, older mink are more likely to die from the infection, according to a statement from the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Due to outbreaks on farms worldwide, thousands of mink have died from the infection itself, and thousands more have been culled to prevent further spread, Live Science previously reported.

But despite attempts to spot and snuff out the infection, mink farm workers and their contacts may still be catching SARS-CoV-2 from the animals at high rates. In a new study, published [10 Nov 2020] in the journal Science, researchers surveyed 16 mink farms in the Netherlands for coronavirus infections among people. They tested 97 workers and their close contacts for the virus and found that 66, or 68% of those tested, had evidence of infection. Scientists analyzed the genetic sequence of the virus in some of these people.

"In most cases, these human sequences were near-identical to the mink sequences from the same farm," but different from the variants spreading in the same region, the authors wrote. All that suggests people are catching the virus from infected mink.

While this mink-to-human spread may not affect how well vaccines work, in the long-term, mink farms represent "a pool of nonessential animals that could pose a risk to public health," Swabe told The Guardian.

In general, factory farming, illegal wildlife trafficking, and the farming and consumption of wild animals create the perfect conditions for diseases to spread, mutate, and then spill over into human populations, Live Science previously reported. Mink pose a similar risk, but unlike other animals, they aren't farmed for food.

"So far it's just luck that we are talking about mink rather than food animals," Swabe said. "What if we get a zoonotic disease that affects pigs in the next pandemic? Or chickens? Mink can easily be culled, they are non-essential. It's going to be harder to do that with food-animals."

The Danish government put forward hastily drawn up legislation on Tuesday [10 Nov 2020] to back up its order to cull all the country's farmed mink, admitting it lacked the legal basis for the measure aimed at preventing human contagion of a mutated coronavirus strain.

Authorities last week [week of 2 Nov 2020], embarked on a plan to eliminate Denmark's entire population of 17 million mink, one of the world's biggest, saying the new strain could move to humans and evade future COVID-19 vaccines.

However, the minority Social Democratic government has since drawn fierce criticism from the industry and lawmakers who said the order, which followed earlier culls of infected mink, was illegal and questioned the science behind it.

The World Health Organization has said transmission of the virus between mink and humans was "a concern" and British Health Minister Matt Hancock suggested on Tuesday the international community should look again at the industry, alluding to a possible global ban.

China, Denmark, and Poland, which ordered testing of its mink on Tuesday, are the largest producers (here) of mink pelts, animal rights group Humane Society International - United Kingdom, says.

On Tuesday afternoon [10 Nov 2020], the government presented draft emergency legislation to back up the cull order given last week, proposing a ban on all mink breeding in the country until 2022.

The opposition says the cull of healthy mink should not have been initiated before compensation plans were in place for the owners and workers at some 1100 mink farms.

The draft bill proposes compensation for farmers who have culled their entire herd by [16 Nov 2020] at a suggested level based on the value of their herd along with consequential losses.

Late on Monday [9 Nov 2020], Environment and Food Minister Mogens Jensen said in emailed comments to Reuters that he regretted "the lack of clarity" in the initial instruction, which ordered mink farmers with healthy mink to cull their herds.

On Tuesday [10 Nov 2020], the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration apologised to mink farmers in a letter, saying it still recommended the culling, even though current legislation could not force them to go ahead with it.

Tage Pedersen, head of the Danish mink breeders' association, has urged farmers to continue the cull despite the legal uncertainty, saying the industry, which employs around 6000 people and exports fur pelts worth $800 million annually, was finished.

"We are still culling," said Hans Henrik Jeppesen, whose mink farm is located far away those infected. "I still think the law will be passed at a later stage."

[We know that COVID-19 virus was originally transmitted from an 'animal' source to humans and there have been reported events of transmission to farmed mink, before jumping back to a small number of humans, as reported in Denmark recently.

Several different mutations have been discovered in the virus in mink that do not arise in humans. But one called "cluster 5" identified in Denmark is of particular concern and 12 people are known to be infected. More than 200 other people have contracted other mink-related strains of the virus. The Danish strain was considered to be associated with a decreased susceptibility to post-infection antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 in humans, leading to Denmark's decision to cull its entire mink population. - Mod.AS

So far 6 countries have reported where COVID-19 infections in farmed minks, including the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, USA, Italy, and Sweden. There are many other countries where minks are farmed, led by the world's largest country, China. Active animal surveillance and reporting in all countries with reported infections or farming of susceptible animal species is highly recommended. Furthermore, identification and testing of people who are or have been in contact with the infected farms/animals as well as tracing of the persons who have moved from these locations should be an important consideration. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 10 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov11_1605176851.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 33.2% of daily case numbers and 21.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 22.0 million cases. The USA is dominant, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, Peru, and Chile.

- The European region reported 46.7% of daily case numbers and 57.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 13.8 million. Countries not reporting cases today (11 Nov 2020) include Israel, Sweden, Kazakhstan, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Poland, France, UK, Russia, Germany, and Ukraine. 21 additional countries reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.2% of daily case numbers and 10.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.40 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Iraq, Pakistan, Tunisia, Lebanon, and UAE. Libya, Kuwait, and Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 72 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.37 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Algeria, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Angola, Uganda, Cameroon, and Ghana. Countries not reporting any new cases include Madagascar, Botswana, Reunion, and Mayotte, and among others.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.82% of daily case numbers and 0.46% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.78 million cases. The Philippines is dominant followed by Japan, Malaysia, French Polynesia, Guam, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 11.1% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.6% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.7 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: It is very difficult to comment other than observe the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (149 446), India (48 285), and Brazil (47 724), have been dominant. A global total of 10 345 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (10-11 Nov 2020). The global total is now above 52.4 million cases.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include the USA, India, Brazil, France (35 879), Italy (32 961), Poland (25 221), UK (22 950), Germany (20 536), Russia (19 851), Spain (19 096), Iran (11 780), Argentina (10 880), and Ukraine (10 611). A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 32 of the 58 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the African region, and 2 are from the Western Pacific region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 9.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 20.5%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA (which reported 23.8% of all newly reported cases in the past 24 hours), as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 32.4% and in reported deaths is 9.2%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with the daily increase between 500 000 and 600 000 new cases. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. Italy may cross the 1 million mark for cumulative cases in the next 24-48 hours, bringing the number of countries reporting more than 1 million cases to 10.

All in all, the growth in the USA is exponential, having surpassed the 10 million cumulative case mark, with the state of Texas having reported over one million cases and California will be crossing one million cases very soon assuming daily reports continue at the same rate. - Mod.UBA]
