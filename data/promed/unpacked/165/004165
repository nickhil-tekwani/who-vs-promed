A specimen of the influenza virus which killed 21 million people in the
1918 worldwide epidemic has been recovered from the frozen remains of a flu
victim buried in Alaska. Researchers at the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology announced Thursday that biopsy specimens from a frozen corpse
exhumed from a cemetery in Brevig Mission contain genetic material from the
killer flu. Experts have said that analyzing the 1918 virus genetic pattern
will help science learn how that particular virus was able to kill so many
people worldwide and will help researchers prepare vaccines to protect
against the virus if it breaks out again.
Army researchers last year identified the flu virus in preserved lung
specimens taken during autopsies of soldiers killed by the flu in 1918 at
military bases in Fort Jackson, S. C. and Camp Upton, N.Y. The new specimen
was taken from the lung of one of 72 people buried in a mass grave after
the flu swept through Brevig Mission, then known as Teller Mission, in
1918. The small town lost 85 percent of its population in a single week.
Dr. Johan Hultin, a retired San Francisco pathologist, exhumed four bodies
from the mass grave and found that one, an obese woman, was well-preserved.
Tissue from her lung was later found to contain genes from the killer flu.
Dr. Jeffery K. Taubenberger of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology said
last year that the genetic pattern of the 1918 flu virus is unlike any
other flu bug, but is closely related to the so-called "swine flu."
Taubenberger said that although the disease that caused the worldwide
epidemic was called "Spanish flu," the virus apparently was a mutation that
evolved in American pigs and was spread around the globe by U.S. troops
mobilized for World War I.
The finding supports a widespread theory that flu viruses from swine are
the most virulent for humans. Two other flu viruses spread worldwide since
1918 -- the Asian flu in 1957 and the Hong Kong flu in 1968 -- both mutated
in pigs. Most experts believe that flu viruses reside harmlessly in birds,
where they are genetically stable. Occasionally, a virus from birds will
infect pigs. The swine immune system attacks the virus, forcing it to
change genetically to survive. The result is a new virus.
The 1918 flu genes were first isolated last year from the preserved lung
tissue of an Army private who died at Fort Jackson, S. C. Army doctors in
1918 conducted autopsies on some of the 43,000 servicemen killed by the flu
and preserved some specimens in formaldehyde and wax. The 1918 flu epidemic
caused about 700,000 deaths in the United States and about a quarter of the
nation's population contracted the illness.
