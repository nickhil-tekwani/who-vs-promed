USDA AMENDS CITRUS CANKER QUARANTINE IN FLORIDA
-----------------------------------------------
The following was released today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture:
In a press release posted on the USDA web site 1 Sep 2000, the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service incorrectly stated information about
portions of Florida designated as citrus canker quarantine areas. The
corrected version follows:
The USDA amended its citrus canker regulations by adding portions of Hendry
and Hillsborough counties, FL, to the list of quarantined areas. It is
also expanding the boundaries of the quarantined areas in Broward, Collier,
Dade, and Manatee counties, FL. USDA is taking these actions due to the
detection of citrus canker in those areas.
"These actions are necessary on an emergency basis to prevent the spread of
citrus canker into non-infected areas of the United States, including those
portions of Florida that are outside the current quarantined area," said
Richard L. Dunkle, deputy administrator of plant protection and quarantine
with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part of USDA's
marketing and regulatory programs mission area. "USDA has imposed
restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from and
through the quarantined area."

[Citrus canker is caused by the phytopathogenic bacterium _Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pv. _citri_. Eradication of infected trees and prevention of
movement of infected material from infected areas are the only methods
currently available to contain spread of the pathogen. Florida authorities
are eliminating all infected trees within 1900 ft of infected tree(s)
which have been removed. - Mod.DH
