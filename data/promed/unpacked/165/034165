Angiostrongylus infection, human, Philippines
---------------------------------------------
Two male Dutch patients presented on 10 Mar 2014 at the Center for Tropical and Travel Medicine of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. Seven days after return from a holiday in the Philippines (5-20 Feb 2014) they developed painful paresthesias on thorax and limbs.

There were no visible skin lesions. Both patients were HIV positive, but had undetectable viral loads on antiretroviral treatment with stable CD4-counts greater than 500 x 10E6/l. On laboratory examination, serum eosinophilia (1.26 x 10E9/l and 0.66 x 10E9/l, respectively) was noted.

Three days after presentation at our clinic, one patient developed a confused state and diplopia due to paralysis of the abducens nerve. CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] analysis showed an increased opening pressure, pleiocytosis and increased protein, but no increased eosinophil count. Empirical treatment for bacterial and herpes virus meningitis was initiated.

Both bacterial cultures and PCR-analysis of the CSF remained, however, negative. A 2nd CSF analysis 5 days later did show an increased eosinophil count. With this clinical syndrome of eosinophilic meningo-encephalitis, a parasitic infection with _Angiostrongylus_ sp. was suspected and treatment was started with prednisone and albendazole.

PCR for _Angiostrongylus_ sp. turned out to be positive in both patients, who are currently recovering. Both had been exposed by food consumption (salads, vegetables, shrimp, fish) in the Philippines.

[Angiostrongylus is well known in the Philippines. Angiostrongylus is a parasitic nematode (worm) that resides in rodents and uses molluscs, such as slugs, as an intermediate host. Rats, such as the cotton rat, transmit the larvae through their feces. Slugs then ingest the larvae.

Risk factors for infection with angiostrongylus are likely to be ingestion of infected slugs or raw vegetables or vegetable juices contaminated with slugs or their slime, which can contain angiostrongylus larvae (CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/angiostrongylus/epi.html).
