South Dakota Game, Fish & Parks officials have a "big concern" after a 3rd dead bighorn sheep from its transplanted Deadwood herd tested positive this week [10-16 Dec 2016] for a highly virulent strain of pneumonia. Others have died in recent weeks.

Test results received by GF&P confirmed the state agency's worst fears, that this 3rd animal of the 26 bighorns transplanted last year [2015] from Alberta did indeed die of _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, a deadly bacterial disease that is often the primary cause of pneumonia in sheep, according to GF&P regional wildlife manager Trenton Haffley.

That "very, very old ewe" was euthanized on 7 Nov 2016 after being found near the junction of U.S. Highways 85 and 14A leading into Deadwood. Local police were notified that day of an injured animal by the side of the road. GF&P staffers responded to the scene and determined that the animal needed to be euthanized to prevent further suffering, Haffley said.

Following a necropsy on that bighorn, blood samples were sent to the Washington Animal Disease and Diagnostic Laboratory on the campus of Washington State University at Pullman, which confirmed the cause of the animal's death.

Since that bighorn was euthanized, 2 or 3 other bighorns from the Deadwood herd have died, Haffley said. The GF&P is awaiting results of samples taken from those animals and sent to the same Washington laboratory, he noted.

The most recent update from those monitoring the herd shows 11 of the 26 original bighorns transplanted from Canada in February 2015 are still alive, Haffley said. 13 of 15 yearlings born in 2015, and 4 of 5 lambs born last spring, have been observed as recently as last week [3-10 Dec 2016], giving wildlife managers cause for optimism, he added.

"The 2016 lambs and the yearlings are all still doing really well, and those are the ones we would expect to be most susceptible to this disease, the older and younger bighorns," Haffley said. "It's a bummer we have the disease up there, but at this point, we are somewhat hopeful we will be OK. It's not total doom and gloom. We are hopeful that a bunch of sheep will survive and that we'll continue to have a herd up there."

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease (caused by multiple pathogens). Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena usually requires integrated and sustained research efforts. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

The bighorn sheep pneumonia "web of causation" may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggest that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant. However, recent evidence indicates that in the northwestern USA, there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America introduced by domestic ovids.
