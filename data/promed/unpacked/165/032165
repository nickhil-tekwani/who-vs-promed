QUESTION:

From: <bernie@whidbey.net>

Is there a potential impact on the already stressed Pacific salmon?
While _Myxobolus cerebralis_ (the organism responsible for
whirling disease in trout) or its intermediate host may not survive
salt water, the salmon must return to fresh water to spawn. The
current state of the salmon on the west coast is less than
favorable. Would the salmon fry be at risk? (I believe salmon and
trout are fairly closely related.)

Some U.S. ESA (Endangered Species Act)-listed stocks of west
coast salmon are at minimal risk of parasitism with _M. cerebralis_.
If the fish are exposed to the parasite early in their life span they
may develope the disease and the severity of the disease depends
on environmental factors (e.g., water temperatures, water quality,
nutritional status etc.). There are other salmon diseases that are
much more likely to have adverse effects on these salmon (i.e.,
BKD for example).
Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD) is a major threat to both wild and
cultured salmonids in the Pacific Northwest and California.
