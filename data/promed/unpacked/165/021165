In Essonne, a woman was infected by the botulism bacterium after ingesting old soup.

A serious neurological disease, botulism develops in the absence of oxygen and most often through vacuum-sealed foods and canned foods. Botulinum toxin is a poison still "more powerful than cyanide", but this type of case is very rare in France.

According to our Parisian colleagues, the consumer had ingested an old vegetable soup. At the end of August 2019, this resident of Essonne felt unwell. Her health deteriorated, and doctors diagnosed a case of botulism. According to information, she is almost totally paralyzed and hopes of recovery are slim.

Following the diagnosis of botulism, the ARS (Regional Health Agency) decided to conduct an investigation to determine the origin of the bacteria from the outdated soup. The soup was found in the refrigerator of the victim. The soup brand concerned was inspected without ARS finding any error on the manufacturer's part.

In a document, the Ministry of Agriculture recommends respecting the cold chain: adjust the refrigerator to a low temperature (at most, 4 deg C), meet the deadline for consumption, quickly consume the products after opening, and clean dishes after preparation.
