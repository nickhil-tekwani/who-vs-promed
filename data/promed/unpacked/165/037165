The diagnosis of anthrax was done at Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana (IZSLT), in Rome, Italy (same province of the outbreak) after an onsite inspection by vets from IZSLT who were called by the Local Veterinary Services, on [Fri 25 Aug 2017].

During the inspection, IZSLT decided that anthrax was the main etiology to be firstly investigated. 4 bovine animals found dead at inspection site (a pasture in the municipality of Grottaferrata, province of Rome, Italy), most probably dead in the latter 4-5 hours, were sampled (blood samples, following the international consensus procedures). The Veterinary Services disposed of fallen stock (destruction) according to EU legislation (the 4 animals plus another one that was found dead nearby by the Veterinary Services).

All 4 cases investigated were preliminarly diagnosed as anthrax cases on the same day, by microscopic examination of blood smears stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean's reaction), and confirmed by cultures and PCR (chromosomal target, pXO1 and pXO2 plasmidic targets) by the next [Mon 28 Aug 2017]. These are the only cases that were confirmed as anthrax by a laboratory diagnosis.

The area is an historical anthrax site and pastures are located in the crater of an extinct volcano, not far from the Albano Lake, itself a lake of volcanic origin. Anthrax cases in livestock living in the area are considered absolutely sporadic nowadays, thanks to the intense vaccine prevention measures of the past decades (from the late 1950s of the 20th century). The outbreak may have been favored by the severe drought ongoing in central Italy. This is the only outbreak notified in 2017 in the Latium region. In 2016 one case only was notified in the Rome province, Latium region (Artena municipality).
