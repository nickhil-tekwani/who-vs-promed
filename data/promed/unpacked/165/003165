Influenza update 356 (based on data up to 24 Nov 2019)
--------------------------------------------------
Summary
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity started to increase in most countries. Influenza activity was elevated across the countries in Western Asia.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza activity was low overall, except for Jamaica and Honduras. In tropical South American countries, influenza activity remained low.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity remained elevated in some countries of Western Africa.

- In South East Asia, influenza activity continued to be reported in Lao PDR and Viet Nam.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity returned to interseasonal levels.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National influenza centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 119 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 11 Nov 2019 to 24 Nov 2019 (data as of 6 Dec 2019 09:04:10 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 92 883 specimens during that time period. A total of 7914 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 5629 (71.1%) were typed as influenza A and 2285 (28.9%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 2682 (71.5%) were influenza A(H3N2) and 1069 (28.5%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Of the characterized B viruses, 1014 (96.8%) belonged to the B-Victoria lineage and 34 (3.2%) to the B-Yamagata lineage.

Two expatriates living in Oman died after contracting the seasonal influenza (H1N1) or swine flu in the governorate of Dhofar -- the 1st in July and the 2nd in August [2019]. They were among 78 confirmed cases of swine flu registered at the Sultan Qaboos Hospital over the first 9 months of 2019 in the governorate.

The hospital authorities reported a total of 599 registered suspected cases of H1N1 between January and last September [2019]. Doctors working at Sultan Qaboos Hospital dealt overall with 1779 cases of respiratory infections during the same period.

Patients most vulnerable to the respiratory viruses are those over 18 years, particularly pregnant women; those suffering from chronic illnesses, kidney and heart diseases, liver problems, diabetes, asthma, blood disorders, and HIV/AIDS; and even health workers, according to Muscat Daily.

https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/vijayawada/2019/nov/30/state-records-14-swine-flu-deaths-this-year-2069229.html


According to official data, 14 swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] deaths across the state were recorded this year [2019] till [17 Nov 2019]. The figure is slightly less than the previous year's [2018] toll of 17. The total number of H1N1 swine flu-positive cases [has] also come down this year [2019] compared with 2018 from 402 to 325. Health officials are setting up isolation wards in hospitals as a preventive measure.

As the winter season has set in and the minimum temperatures are coming down, health officials are instructing the public to take precautions in order to stay away from being infected by swine flu. The health department has initiated steps to set up district-[wide] swine flu testing facilities and isolation wards in every district hospital, area hospital, and community health centre.

As per the requirement of treatment procedure, the government has to set up special isolation wards in all government hospitals and provide protection kits to the healthcare staff, especially to those who will attend to the patients suffering from the flu. Across the state, Visakhapatnam registered the highest number of positive swine flu cases and deaths. Out of 325 positive cases, 180 alone were reported from Visakhapatnam, of which 8 died. West Godavari district registered 3 deaths, and Anantapur, East Godavari, and Srikakulam registered one death case each.

All the district health officials have been instructed to intensify awareness camps and screening centres. As part of the action plan, isolation wards with 5-10 beds are to be set up in every teaching, district, and area hospital. A sufficient stock of drugs, masks, and PPE [personal protective equipment] kits are to be made available. Currently, there are 18 labs eligible for conducting confirmation test in the state. "We are creating awareness by distributing pamphlets and putting up screening centres at bus stops and railway stations," DMHO [district medical and health officer] Dr. TSR Murthy said.

Symptoms of swine flu are generally similar to that of seasonal flu. These include cough, fever, sore throat, stuffiness, runny nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Later on, breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, low blood pressure, sputum mixed with blood, and bluish discoloration of nails also develops.

This year's [2019] flu season is already packing a wallop in Pennsylvania, where it's taken the lives of 5 people. The state's 2667 confirmed flu cases mark the highest number the state's seen at this point of the year over the past 8 flu seasons, according to Pennsylvania Department of Health data. But it still remains well below peak levels.

On Tuesday [3 Dec 2019], the health department released its weekly report tracking the number of confirmed flu cases in all 67 counties through 30 Nov 2019. When a positive lab test is reported to the state, it's logged as a confirmed flu case.

All of the flu-related deaths thus far have involved people 50 [years of age] and older, with the majority over 65.

The latest figures show that flu activity is increasing across all regions of the state with the virus reported in 63 of the state's counties. Three strains of the flu are all circulating -- although A (H3N2 and H1N1) dominates -- and the predominant virus varies by region and age-group.

Areas of the south and parts of the west are seeing elevated activity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC's tracking lags a week behind Pennsylvania's data.

Nationally, B viruses account for the majority of flu cases, while in Pennsylvania they account for only 3.85% of lab-confirmed illnesses. The B viruses are mostly affecting young children and people under the age of 24, according to the CDC.

The season officially began 29 Sep 2019 and runs until 16 May 2020, but the illness tends to peak in the middle of the winter, often on the heels of the holidays. At this point, flu activity in the state is considered widespread, as the [percentage] of outpatient visits associated with a flulike illness [has] reached the epidemic threshold. There have been 70 flu-related hospitalizations.

When health officials say the flu is widespread, it means there are confirmed outbreaks or increases in confirmed cases of the flu in at least half the regions of the state. It is not an indicator of severity.

The vast majority of people who contract the flu never get tested or go to the doctor. So, the health department cautions its case counts actually represent only a [fraction] of the flu in the state at any time. It is estimated that 5% to 20% of Pennsylvanians, or 600 000 to 2.4 million people, get the flu each year and 120 to 2000 die from flu-related complications.

We analyzed the Department of Health's available confirmed flu cases data to find which of Pennsylvania's 67 counties have been hardest hit this flu season. For privacy purposes, the department did not release figures for counties with 5 or fewer flu cases.

The data cover from the start of the flu season 29 Sep until 30 Nov [2019] [see source URL for state map and county statistics].

Health officials say they don't start seeing flu-related deaths until December or early January. However, with several flu-related deaths being reported throughout the state already, they're urging folks to get vaccinated and get prepared before [it's] too late.

It's a virus that can quickly turn deadly and health officials are urging folks to get vaccinated as the flu season is getting its earliest start in a decade. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms 30 states are already seeing flu activity, including some cases in California.

Dr. Jessica Mason with Community Regional Medical Center (CRMC) and UCSF Fresno says people are already suffering symptoms and they want help, fast. "We've seen a lot of people coming into the emergency room with flulike symptoms...the common one being...think of a really bad chest cold," said Dr. Jessica Mason at CRMC.

According to the California Department of Public Health, their latest report released Friday [6 Dec 2019] says there have been 16 flu-related deaths in the state since September [2019], [with] one of those being in Tulare.

The numbers are reported to the state by local public health departments, but the most current data can lag. For example, the state has documented one flu-related death in San Diego County. However, that regional public health department reports 6 influenza deaths so far this flu season.

Health officials say the most vulnerable are younger children, the elderly and those with autoimmune issues. They also say this is the season when the virus is likely to be transmitted. "You'll be among your family. That's how you get germs, you'll be among people and in closed areas," said Leticia Berber with Fresno County Public Health Department.

So far, Fresno County Health Department officials say no flu-related deaths have been confirmed. They urge folks to get the flu shot, and if they feel the symptoms...go see their doctor.

"We can help you determine if it is the flu, and do you need treatment...not everyone needs treatments," said Dr. Mason.
