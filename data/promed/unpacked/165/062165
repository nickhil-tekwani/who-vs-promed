---------------------------------------------------------------
The Moderator's referred question from Dr Robert McNair Scott is an
interesting one, which has been the subject of previous research. The near
universal prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus (HAV) by the age of
5-10 in endemic areas (1) argues strongly against HAV as the cause of large
epidemics of hepatitis amongst adults in these regions.
In 1980, it was shown that HAV was not the cause of a large outbreak of
water-born hepatitis in Kashmir (2,3) resulting in 52 000 hepatitis cases
and 1560 deaths.
In 1993, Arankalle and colleagues (4) reported the results of a
retrospective seroepidemiologic study of 17 epidemics of water-born
hepatitis, none of which were caused by HAV.
In 16 (94 per cent) of these epidemics, evidence of recent hepatitis E
virus (HEV) infection was found in 60-100 per cent of patients studied,
including in the large epidemic in Delhi in 1955 involving 29 000 patients
with hepatitis, in which all of the 28 archived serum samples were positive
for anti-HEV IgM.
Thus, it is indeed likely that many outbreaks of epidemic hepatitis
previously ascribed to HAV were in fact caused by HEV (1). With respect to
the post preceding Dr McNair Scott's question, we have previously looked at
HEV infection in Victoria, Australia (5,6). Although autochthonous HEV
infection is increasingly recognised in "non-endemic" countries, most
infections are imported, although referral bias is likely to apply
(clinicians are less likely to refer for HEV testing in the absence of a
travel history).
I would support the call for increased testing to better explore the
epidemiology of HEV in non-endemic areas, not least because trends in such
diagnoses may even provide early warning of evolving epidemics in endemic,
less resource-rich areas with less access to routine testing.
We have previously compared trends in our laboratory diagnoses of HEV
against reports of HEV outbreaks on ProMED-mail, with a notable association
between reports of epidemics in India and significant increases in
highly-reactive anti-HEV serology results at our laboratory (6). A similar
association was not observed for epidemics in other countries, reflecting
the close ties and relative frequency of travel between India and Australia.

thread, although it does not relate directly to the situation in Europe.
His commentary, however, suggests a need for enhanced HEV surveillance in
