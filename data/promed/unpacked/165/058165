Michigan agriculture officials are alerting farmers after finding a bovine tuberculosis [TB]-infected deer in a new area.

Dr Mike Vanderklok is with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. He says, "We have a core area where TB has been kind of found endemically in the free-ranging white-tailed deer in northeastern lower Michigan, and occasionally we will find a TB-positive deer outside of that area, and that did happen."

Vanderklok tells Brownfield the infected deer was found in Cheboygan County west of the area known to have deer with bovine TB, so the department is reaching out to area farmers. "The letter went out at the end of last week [last of May 2022]. They should be receiving it anytime now, and we'll be having a meeting next week on Thursday night [9 Jun 2022] for those producers at the Wolverine Village Hall to talk about the TB testing and what needs to be done."

He says the cattle near the infected deer will have to be tested for bovine tuberculosis within the next 12 months.

Vanderklok says the disease has been contained to the wild deer herd, and it's very rare for the disease to infect any of Michigan's cattle.

[Bovine tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ has one of the widest host ranges of all the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (MTC) and can readily spill over into a variety of domestic and wild mammals, including humans.

In North America, naturally occurring tuberculosis has been reported in white-tailed deer, elk, and mule deer. Surveillance efforts in deer are key to providing an early warning of a risk of transmission to livestock and also to producing crucial data to better understand the ecoepidemiology of the disease. - Mod.PMB
