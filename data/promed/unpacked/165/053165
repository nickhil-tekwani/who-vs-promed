UNDIAGNOSED SMUT, MAIZE - FRANCE (NORMANDY)

There is quite a bit of smut in maize fields. It looks like a type of
smut to me; it is called "Charbon" by locals. A farmer said that only
certain varieties of maize are susceptible to this fungus disease and
that they have not had an outbreak here in this area for several
years. He does not think it is toxic for cattle.

I saw something very similar in Kenya, and also here. The fungus is
at the bottom of the flower that is at the top of the maize plant. It
is at the leaf junctions on the flower stem above the cobs, which do
not seem to be affected. It is either head smut or boil smut.

[Smuts are a group of fungi causing symptoms of spore-filled galls on
a number of cereal hosts. They usually attack the plant's
reproductive components rather than the leaves or stems.

Boil smut of maize is caused by _Ustilago saydis_ and attacks any
above-ground growing part of the plant to form blisters or galls
containing black spores. Mature galls can grow as large as 20 cm in
diameter. The yield of affected cobs is very low, and they may be
toxic to livestock but are eaten by people in South America as a
delicacy. Spores can be spread by wind, seed, clothes or farm
machinery and can survive in the soil for many years. Disease
management includes plant hygiene measures and seed treatment with
fungicides. For more information on boil smut, see recent ProMED-mail
post no. 20080909.2817.

Head smut caused by _Sphacelotheca reiliana_ can affect both maize
and sorghum. In maize, it infects the young seedling then grows
through the plant, replacing reproductive tissues (ears and/or
tassels) with masses of spores. Distortion is common, and leafy
structures may replace the plant's flowering components (phyllody).
The fungus survives in the soil and may also be seed-borne. Cool
weather and dry seedbed conditions favour this disease. Disease
management includes cultural techniques and the use of clean seed and
resistant varieties.
