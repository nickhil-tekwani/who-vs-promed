Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome: Second Death in Texas This Year
--------------------------------------------------------------
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has claimed the lives of 2 South Plains
residents in the past 4 months, the Texas Department of Health announced on
Thu 9 May 2002. James Alexander, Regional Zoonosis Veterinarian for Region 1
of the Texas Department of Health, said a South Plains woman died in Apr 2002
from exposure to hantavirus. Alexander said that: "We have had people
infected with hantavirus from Potter County to Gaines County since
hantavirus was first identified in 1993. Most of the (reported) cases have
been out in this region." The South Plains woman, who resided in Crosby
County, is the second Texas resident to die from hantavirus infection this
year. The other case resulted in the death of a male Lubbock County resident
in Feb 2002, according to the Texas Department of Health.

Alexander stated that 18 Texas residents have contracted hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome since 1993, with 7 of those cases resulting in death. A 26-year-old
Gaines County woman died from hantavirus infection in 1996. In Mar 2000, a
12-year-old Lubbock girl was the first diagnosed case of hantavirus in
Lubbock County. But she received aggressive respiratory treatment at
University Medical Center and was released. In addition to Lubbock and
Gaines counties, 2 cases have been reported in Deaf Smith County, with
other cases having been reported in Castro, Parmer and Randall counties.
The death of the male in Feb 2002 was the second reported case in Lubbock
County.

Hantaviruses are thought to be transferred to humans through contact with
rodents and their droppings. _Alexander stated that: _Peromyscus maniculatis_
(the deer mouse) is [the predominant reservoir of Sin Nombre virus, the
hantavirus associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this environment].
Alexander also said that: "[Elsewhere] the white-footed mouse [and a few other
rodent species could be carriers of hantaviruses responsible for serious human
illness]. The more common house mouse is not considered a real concern [as a
reservoir host for] hantaviruses". Alexander said that he had been told that
some rodents were found in the home of the woman who died in Apr 2002.

The Texas Department of Health is still conducting an investigation into the
case, though Alexander was not sure whether details of the investigation would
be released at a later date. According to the Texas Department of Health the
woman had other health conditions that may have increased her susceptibility to
the disease.

Alexander added that: "We want people to be alert. If they go clean up an area
with rodent droppings, they need to take precautions. People may become exposed
to the virus that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome when dust contaminated
by rodent droppings and urine is disturbed."

[The identity of the viruses responsible for these cases is unclear from this
report. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has been associated generally with the
hantavirus Sin Nombre virus throughout much of continental U.S., with the
exception of the southeastern and eastern seaboard. However, another hantavirus
Bayou virus has been associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in eastern
Texas. The reservoir host of this virus is _Oryzomys palustris_ (the rice rat).
