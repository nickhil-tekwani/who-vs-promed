Plum Pox Traced to Niagara Nursery
-------------------------------------
After months of exhaustive research, the source of a plum pox virus
outbreak [in Ontario has been traced to a nursery in Niagara-on-the-Lake,
according to officials from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA.
Ontario Tender Fruit Producers Marketing Board manager Adrian Huisman
confirmed the outbreak's link to the nursery on Friday 29 Dec 2000.
[Budwood from 2 good clingstone peach varieties in the nursery was used for
propagation of trees which were subsequently distributed across Ontario.
[Most of the 12 000 to 13 000 affected trees, including 8000 from one
grower in Niagara-on-the-Lake were removed last summer and fall to stem
the outbreak.
Most [of the affected trees were from Niagara, but some trees were found
near Port Dover and Chatham [in Ontario and 4 in Nova Scotia. Most of
those removals involved only a few trees, said Len Troup, marketing board
chair. [Approximately 80 growers forced to remove and destroy their trees
are anticipating possible compensation. Troup said federal and provincial
agriculture departments have a confidential report on the matter prepared
by a private firm in Guelph, ON [which will include recommendations
proposed by CFIA. The marketing board has endorsed an action plan to
ensure [that the virus is wiped out in Niagara within 3 years. [The plan
includes continual removal of infected trees, [elimination of blocks of
trees with high infection rates, and allowing [affected areas to remain
fallow until the following spring. Huisman said the stone-fruit industry
has also asked the CFIA to continue sampling orchards to locate any
remaining infected trees.

but it was not recognized until early 2000. - Mod.DH
