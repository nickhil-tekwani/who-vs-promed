New outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Britain
------------------------------------
LONDON ­- New outbreaks of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in a previously
unaffected area have broken the lull in Britain's epidemic and prompted
warnings from government officials that farmers should remain "as watchful
as they ever have been".
A total of 15 new cases were diagnosed in North Yorkshire, far removed from
the England's northern Cumbria region and its south west, where most of the
more than 1400 cases had been reported since the epidemic began 2 months
ago. North Yorkshire farmers said some 50 000 farm animals had already been
culled in an effort to contain the outbreaks, but they warned [that] the
disease could spread rapidly if the virus spread to the area's hills and
valleys, where thousands of sheep graze.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, under whose
orders more than 2.5 million farm animals have been destroyed since the
epidemic began, said, "Farmers need to be as watchful now as they have ever
been." The new outbreaks came even as the number of fresh cases nationwide
appeared to be on a downward swing and hopes were growing the epidemic had
nearly run its course [see below - mod.SH] "Although nationally the number
of outbreaks were falling," the ministry spokesman said, "there was always
the possibility of outcrops such as this one."
The spokesman said, however, that the North Yorkshire cases are different
from the Cumbrian outbreak, "where the disease spread in all directions
very quickly because there had been wholesale movement of infected animals.
In this [new] outbreak," he said, "there have been no widespread movements,
and the disease has simply been spread from farm to farm in a localized area."

Slaughter/disposal numbers, 20 May 2001
---------------------------------------
Slaughter and disposal statistics are reported as they have been completed
and collated, and there is inevitably a delay to this, given the scale of
operations. These figures are therefore subject to revision.
3 050 000 animals slaughtered or identified as being for slaughter.
2 972 000 animals slaughtered, of which 26 000 remain to be disposed of.
462 000 cattle, 2 390 000 sheep, 118 000 pigs, 2000 goats slaughtered.
78 000 animals awaiting slaughter.
