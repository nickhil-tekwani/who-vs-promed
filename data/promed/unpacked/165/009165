Presence of lettuce big-vein disease and associated viruses in a
subtropical area of Brazil

Lettuce big-vein is a soil-borne viral disease characterized by vein
clearing and leaf shrinkage resulting in plants of poor quality and reduced
marketable value. The disease commonly occurs at temperatures below 20 deg.
C, typical of temperate climates.
Recently, Mirafiori lettuce virus (MiLV), a possible ophiovirus, was found
to be the causal agent of the disease, whereas the historically associated
Lettuce big-vein virus (LBVV, genus Varicosavirus) causes only a latent
infection (Roggero et al., 2003). No synergism has been observed between
these serologically unrelated viruses, although both are transmitted by
chytrid fungus, _Olpidium brassicae_.
MiLV has been detected in samples from several European countries, USA, and
Japan. Mixed infection by both MiLV and LBVV are common in samples from
lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_ L.) crops in northern Italy and France (Roggero
et al., 2003). Molecular sequences for both viruses are now available
(Sasaya et al. 2002; Van Der Wilk et al., 2002).
Recently, typical big-vein symptoms have been observed in Sao Paulo State,
Brazil, on various lettuce cultivars grown both directly in soil or
hydroponically. Symptoms were observed mainly during the cooler season,
with day temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 deg C and night temperatures
from 10 to 16 deg C.
Samples collected in different areas of Sao Paulo State (Biritiba-Mirim,
Embu-Guacu, Guarulhos, Itapecerica da Serra, Mogi das Cruzes, Monte Alegre
do Sul, Vargem Grande Paulista) were tested by DAS-ELISA with antisera
specific for MiLV and LBVV (Roggero et al. 2003) and by negative-staining EM.
Most samples with big-vein symptoms tested positive by ELISA for both
viruses and a few only for one. In EM, only LBVV virus particles were
observed; virions were observed in only a few samples, confirming the
difficulty in EM visualization of both LBVV and MiLV particles.
Our surveys in this subtropical area of Brazil were similar to those in the
temperate climate of Europe, where both viruses are commonly found. The
presence of _O. brassicae_ was reported earlier in Brazil (Lin, 1979).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of lettuce
big-vein disease and the associated viruses MiLV and LBVV in a sub-tropical
area.

[There are 2 surprises in this piece. Lettuce big-vein disease is caused by
Mirafiori lettuce ophiovirus (MiLV), not by Lettuce big-vein varicosavirus
(LBVV), and the disease occurs in a sub-tropical region (Brazil). Virion
morphologies are similar to those of Tenuiviruses, and their internal
structures are similar to those of Bunyaviruses. MiLV-infected lettuce is
less marketable, thus imposing an economic burden on growers.
