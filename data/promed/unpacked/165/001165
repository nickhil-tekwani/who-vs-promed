Los Santos province health authorities confirmed the 2nd hantavirus [infection] case in the Tonosi district.

The patient, approximate 28 years old and a resident of Rio Viejo del Solar, was admitted this past Monday [11 Feb 2013] to the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayaz Hospital in Las Tablas, where he remains in intensive care. According to medical personnel, the patient is in stable condition.

[Cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur sporadically in Panama. Although the hantavirus involved in this case and the previous ones is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus, as mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935. Of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
