Last Thursday [10 Mar 2022], representatives of the Ministry of Health, Departmental Health Service (Sedes), Regional Government, and Municipal Government of Villa Montes [Tarija department] met to coordinate work actions and control the disease.

The head of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Departmental Health Service (Sedes), Marcelo Magne, confirmed the presence of visceral leishmaniasis, being the 1st case that occurs in the department of Tarija. He reported that the patient is a child.

The head of the Health Unit of the Regional Government of Villa Montes, Agustín Quispe, reported that, in the face of this outbreak of the disease, the corresponding steps were taken before the Ministry of Health to establish the procedure to be followed.

"We have defined the competencies of each entity because this disease is new in the region. For example, in Villa Montes, we have had cutaneous leishmaniasis, but it is the 1st occurrence of visceral leishmaniasis and consequently, not even the Ministry of Health had contemplated the treatment, and the care flowchart," he pointed out.

The specialist confirmed that there are 7 cases of leishmaniasis that have occurred in this Chaco region, a cause of concern, and does not rule out that in the following days a health alert will be declared, to prioritize the care of this disease and prevent its spread.

Asked about the epidemiological link of this disease, Quispe explained that according to the background, the 1st case of this disease in Villa Montes is that of a mother who came with her son from the department of Beni.

[We posted news of a leishmaniasis outbreak in Tarija Department on 30 Jan 2022 (see archive 20220130.8701160) and assumed it was cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, it now seems that it is visceral leishmaniasis.

In the 2012 review of the worldwide incidence of leishmaniasis (Alvar J, et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671) annex 10, Bolivia), visceral leishmaniasis was, at the time of the review, not found in the Tarija region. Bolivia has the highest rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis in South America (Ballart C, et al. Clinical and immunological characteristics of tegumentary leishmaniasis cases in Bolivia. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2021; 15(3): e0009223; <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009223). - Mod.EP
