An outbreak of "blue-ear pig disease" has killed more than 1000 pigs and caused nearly 3000 to fall ill in 2 districts in Siem Reap province, officials said [Sun 6 Sep 2015].

Moeung Sonithya, director of the provincial agriculture department, said the disease -- officially called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome [PRRS] -- flared up in mid-August [2015]. He said that as of [Thu 3 Sep 2015], 583 pigs had died and 1725 become sick in Chi Kreng district, while 418 had died and 936 fallen ill in Sotr Nikum district.

"We are taking measures in each area where the disease has been found," he said. "Initially we go down to the villages to cure the sick pigs. Then we separate the sick pigs from the healthy ones. And 3rd, we use anti-bacterial spray" in areas where the pigs live and on the vehicles used to transport them, Mr. Sonithya said.

Prum Vich, chief of the agriculture department's animal health and production office, said the disease can only be transmitted between pigs and posed no threat to humans. He added, however, that an affected pig produces lower-quality meat.

Mr Vich said the 1st sign of the disease was a high fever of about 40 deg C [104 deg F]. Red spots then appear on a hog's skin and its ears and stomach turn purple, he said, resulting in respiratory problems in piglets and reproductive failure in sows.

Mr Vich added that it was unnecessary to cull sick pigs because it was possible for them to recover, and that Siem Reap farmers were either burying the carcasses or selling them to crocodile farms.

He said the officials were still trying to determine how the outbreak occurred. "We are still studying it with technical support from officials in Phnom Penh," he said.

Sen Kimseng, chief of Chi Kreng's Sangvoeuy commune, said losses in both districts had so far cost farmers about USD 532 200, based on a selling price of roughly USD 200 for a healthy 100-kg pig. Mr Kimseng said pig farmers in his commune had lost about USD 240 000 on the 1200 swine that had died or become sick since last month [August 2015], and that their inability to sell sick pigs was causing them to become more indebted to the microfinance institutions from which they borrowed money to purchase the animals.

"People have stopped selling, buying and eating pigs -- even at home and at markets -- and pig raisers have already borrowed money from banks," he said, adding that most families in his commune owned at least 1 pig and that some had as many as 30.

According to Mr Vich, Cambodia's last severe outbreak of blue-ear pig disease was in 2009, when more than 1000 pigs died.

[The farmers are either burying the carcasses or selling them to crocodile farms. The carcasses of the infected animals should not be provided for crocodiles' feed, as this is a risk factor for a disease outbreak.

The newswire provides no information on laboratory results.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was initially detected in Cambodia in 2010. The disease was responsible for high morbidity and high mortality in adult pigs and the outbreak had a costly impact on those farmers affected.

In Cambodia, HP-PRRS (highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome) emerged in 3 provinces, Battambang, Kampong Cham, and Kampot in August 2010. Then the disease quickly spread to 5 other provinces, Kampong Chhnang, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, Takeo, and Kandal.

PRRS is caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), a single-stranded RNA virus, for which 2 genetically different strains are recognised: type 1, initially isolated in Europe, and type 2, initially isolated in North America.

PRRS virus can spread through a variety of routes, including direct contact between pigs, droplet contact through nasal secretions, direct contact with saliva and faeces, and indirect contact. Shedding in saliva, urine and faeces also results in environmental contamination and creates the potential for transmission via fomites.

PRRS is one of OIE's notifiable diseases; it is not a zoonotic disease. Animal movement is an important risk factor for transmission of PRRS. It has caused severe damage to pig production and has become a burden for pig producers in the region.

Updated (May 2015) chapter 2.8.7 on PRRS is available in OIE's Terrestrial Manual, at

Based on the USD figures provided, approx. 266 metric tons of pigs have died so far. In a country that has produced 2.5 million metric tons of pork on a year, that does not seem very serious so far, except for the farmers immediately affected. - Mod.JW]
