[Once again, we call the notifying countryÂ´s attention to the fact that
the International Health Regulations require the reporting of all
suspect cases of cholera to WHO within 24 hours, & we ask for
information on the countries of origin and strain of the 15 imported
cases. This is particularly important for cases originating in
countries which have not notified any cholera, and for tracking the
emergence of _V. cholerae_ O139 - Mod.JW
