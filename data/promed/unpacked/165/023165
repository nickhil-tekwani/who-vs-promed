- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The latest case had onset of paralysis on [18 May 2018], from Dukki district, Balochistan province.

- A door-to-door polio vaccination round to reach approximately 11 million children in high-risk districts of Pakistan has concluded.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- 4 WPV1 cases were reported in Nigeria in 2016 and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018. The most recent WPV1 case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno State, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) positive environmental sample was reported in Jigawa state, collected on [2 May 2018].
- Since confirmation of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, virus has been isolated from environmental samples and 1 case with onset of paralysis on [15 Apr 2018].
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country has conducted additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response. A round of mOPV2 vaccination covering part of Jigawa, Gombe, Bauchi and Sokoto was carried out in May [2018] and early June [2018].

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- In June [2018], 1 polio vaccination campaign targeting vulnerable island populations in Chad took place. This special vaccination activity concerned the 8 health districts of Bagasola, Bol, Isseirom, Karal, Kouloudia, Liwa, Mani and Ngouri. A total of 124 833 children were targeted for vaccination in the island villages in the Lake District and Hadjer Lamis.
- In a recent meeting in N'Djamena, Chad, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) reviewed the status of the recommendations from the previous TAG meeting and assessed progress towards closure of the outbreak.

Central Africa
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The country is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in the DRC in 2018 is 7.
- The geographic extent of the outbreak response to all 3 strains is being re-evaluated, given the confirmed spread of 1 of the strains to Ituri and confirmation of the 3rd strain in Mongola. The risk of further spread is magnified given the proximity of Ituri to Uganda, and known population movements between affected areas.
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response in the affected provinces, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.

Horn of Africa
- Last week's advance notification of 1 new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case in Somalia has been confirmed. The case was reported from Dolo district, Gedo region, with onset on 26 May [2018]. This is the 1st detection of cVDPV2 in Gedo region in this outbreak.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3.
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria.
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].
- In an effort to heighten population immunity against type-2 among high risk populations, more than 5000 children aged 2-23 months have received inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in newly accessible areas of eastern Ghouta. In addition, a total of 33 836 children under 5 years of age have received bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). 23 vaccination teams were deployed between March and May [2018] through fixed centres and mobile clinics that also provided other routine immunization.
- WHO has supported further upgrades to the Syrian National Polio Laboratory, to improve poliovirus diagnostic capacity. 7 national technical staff were trained on intratypic differentiation of poliovirus samples, which will allow for more comprehensive testing and faster identification of results.
- All empty and expired unopened vials of monovalent oral polio vaccine type-2 (mOPV2) have been destroyed according to global guidelines, under the direct supervision of WHO staff in country.

Papua New Guinea
- On [26 Jun 2018], the Papua New Guinea Government declared the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak in Morobe province a National Public Health Emergency.
- 1 case of cVDPV1 and 2 cVDPV1 community contacts were reported in Lae, Morobe province. The case had onset of paralysis on [24 Apr 2018].
- The National Department of Health (NDOH) is closely working with GPEI partners in launching a comprehensive response.

[The new news contained in this week's global update not previously covered in prior updates is the mention of the WPV1 positive environmental samples in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. While this is new news, it is in fact old news, as indicative of continued circulation of the WPV1 in these 2 countries.

The situation with cVDPV's warrants continued monitoring as previously stated in prior ProMED-mail posts on this. 2017 and 2018 activity of cVDPVs highlights the continued challenges of the GPEI towards a world free from polio.
