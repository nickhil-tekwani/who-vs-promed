[West Nile virus surveillance 2001 - USA (14); part (10) 20010728.1476
carried a press report which was based on a paper entitled "Epidemic West
Nile encephalitis, New York, 1999: results of a household-based
seroepidemiological survey" by Farzad Mostashari et al., published in the
28 Jul issue of The Lancet (Vol. 358, No. 9278):
<http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol358/iss9278/full/llan.358.9278.original_research.17060.1>.

The report was concerned with the under-reporting of West Nile virus
infection in humans in the 1999 outbreak in the USA. The same issue of The
Lancet contained the following commentary on the Mostashari et al. paper,
which contains a comparative analysis of the African, European, Middle
Eastern and the North American experiences. - Mod.CP

Commentary: Comparative Symptomatology of West Nile Fever
---------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has now spread to the western hemisphere. The report by
Mostashari and colleagues of the seroepidemiology of the epidemic of West
Nile encephalitis in New York 2 years ago raises questions about possible
variation of West Nile fever in different parts of the world; e.g.,
variations in ratio of clinical to symptom-free (or subclinical)
infections, and differences in clinical picture.
The outbreak in New York was thought to have affected 8200 people (2.6% of
the population), of whom about 1700 had febrile infections, with 59 of
these having meningoencephalitis. The ratio of clinical to subclinical
cases was about 1:2.2, and only about 3.5% of symptomatic febrile cases
(about 0.7% of all infections) developed into West Nile
meningoencephalitis. In other words, the central nervous system was
affected in only a very small proportion of people infected with the virus.
On the other hand, there was certainly significant under-reporting of the
milder cases of West Nile fever.
Seroepidemiological data from outbreaks in Romania and the Czech Republic
gave a picture similar to that in New York. After the 1996 epidemic in
Bucharest, serosurveys showed that 4.1% of 959 people had antibodies to
West Nile virus, and an estimated 70 000 (range 43 000-96 000) residents
had probably been infected during the epidemic; 0.5% of them developed
encephalitis. However, the proportion of mild cases of West Nile fever and
the ratio of clinical to subclinical cases could not be established. During
a period of increased activity of the virus in South Moravia (Czech
Republic) in 1997, 2.1% of 611 people tested had neutralizing antibodies to
West Nile virus, but only 5 of the 13 seropositive people had symptoms
compatible with West Nile fever. Thus the clinical to subclinical ratio was
about 1:1.6. No case of encephalitis was diagnosed. The area had a
population of about 30 000, so the number infected was probably 630, of
whom about 240 might have had symptoms of the disease, albeit undiagnosed.
Unfortunately, no other relevant seroepidemiological data about West Nile
virus are available from other areas.
More information is available on the clinical picture of the disease from
various areas. If the 20 most common clinical features of West Nile fever
reported in the 9 outbreaks for which there were sufficient data were
scored according to the frequency of their occurrence (0=absent, 1=<20%,
2=20-50%, and 3=>50% patients), the mean scores (ranges in parentheses)
would be: fever 3.0 (3), headache 3.0 (3), muscle ache 2.7 (2-3), joint
pain 2.1 (1-3), fatigue 2.6 (2-3), nausea/vomiting 2.4 (1-3), abdominal
pain 0.4 (0-2), diarrhea 0.8 (0-3), sore throat 1.6 (0-3), cough 0.7 (0-2),
lymphadenitis 1.6 (0-3), skin rash/flushed face 2.1 (1-3), conjunctivitis
0.7 (0-2), ocular pain 1.1 (0-3), hepatosplenomegaly 0.4 (0-1), myocarditis
0.3 (0-1), meningitis 1.8 (1-2), encephalitis 1.1 (0-2), anterior myelitis
0.2 (0-1), death 0.3 (0-1).
When the matrix of these 20 scored symptoms is used for calculation of the
average Manhattan distance (i.e., arithmetic average of absolute
differences in the scores over all symptoms) between pairs of countries
(see table), and these distance coefficients were then subjected to UPGMA
cluster analysis with the NTSYS program, 3 clusters of related patterns of
clinical features were revealed at the average distance of 0.65; one for
recent outbreaks in Romania, Russia, the Congo, and the USA, one for the
epidemic in Israel in 1953, and the third for older outbreaks in France,
the Ukraine, and South Africa. The Czech cases are in line with the third
cluster but this outbreak was small, so its grouping may not be very reliable.

A cluster analysis not reproduced here shows the following [for
diagrammatic representation, see original paper. - Mod.CP. The first
cluster is characterized by a low frequency of some classic features of
West Nile fever (sore throat, maculopapular rash, ocular pain) but a
relatively high rate of encephalitis and death. The overall impression
given by the groupings of clinical features is that the time (year) could
be a more important factor than geography in influencing clinical pattern.
This finding suggests that the pathogenicity of West Nile virus changes
with time, with more virulent strains being involved in the more recent
outbreaks.
However, geographic and demographic factors can also influence the clinical
picture in several ways. One factor is endemicity. The high level of
immunity in the local population of such areas normally prevents extensive
outbreaks, but immigrants, soldiers, tourists, and other immunologically
naive newcomers to the area are vulnerable to the infection and disease, as
was the case in Egypt and Israel. In some epidemics (e.g., Bucharest,
Volgograd, and New York) the circulation of the virus in urban areas was an
influential factor. In others (e.g., France 1962, Czech Republic) the
abundance of competent mosquito vector species and amplifying avian hosts
was an important factor, whereas in yet others (e.g., Israel, Romania,
South France), being along or at flyways and resting places for migratory
birds made the areas prone to the establishment of natural foci of the
virus. Finally, the age structure of a population can greatly affect the
outcome of the disease, because in all the known epidemics the central
nervous system was affected much more commonly in elderly patients than in
the rest of the population.
In conclusion, the good news for public health is that fewer than 1% of
cases of West Nile fever develop into meningoencephalitis. The bad news is
that more than 90% of the milder cases are not diagnosed correctly, and
that the severity of symptoms and the fatality rate may vary from outbreak
to outbreak. The factors influencing the variations should be investigated.
