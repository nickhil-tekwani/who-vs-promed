Potato blight, caused by the fungus _Phytophthora
infestans_, is the most important constraint to potato production
worldwide. Historically, the disease is best known for the
terrible human suffering it caused in Ireland in the 1840's.
Nearly a million people died of starvation and another 3 million
emigrated as a result of crop failure caused by late blight.
Late blight can completely defoliate a crop in a matter of a few
days and eventually rots the tubers.
For nearly one hundred years, control of late blight has
involved use of chemical fungicides that are expensive and can be
injurious to health and the environment. These compounds are
known to affect the soil flora and fauna, and have been linked to
breast cancer in women. In the 1990's, the use of fungicides
increased dramatically because the late blight fungus is
overcoming its susceptibility to some of the most widely-used
chemical controls. This means that in the future, farmers will
likely spray more than ever before, though with more limited
results.
The escape from Mexico of the A2 mating type of _P. infestans_
raises the specter of even higher virulence of the pathogen and
disturbing changes in the epidemiology of the fungus. What the
world's farmers have been battling for the past 150 years is the
A1 mating type of the pathogen. Conventional wisdom holds that
both the A1 and A2 types originated in the Toluca Valley of
Mexico. But for reasons that we do not fully understand, the A2
remained behind while the A1 spread around the world.
The situation changed dramatically in the 1970s when the A2
was unintentionally exported to Europe on contaminated Mexican
potatoes. Most scientists agree that it was then re-exported on
infected seed potatoes. Were you to take a map of the countries
where the A2 is present and overlay it with a map of countries
that purchase seed potatoes from Europe, you would find you have
an almost perfect match.
The problem comes to a head when A1 and A2 are present
in the same environment and recombine sexually. The result is an
explosion of genetic variation of the fungus and the enhanced
probability that even more virulent forms of the disease will be
produced. The new forms of the disease could be resistant to
some of the most powerful fungicides and to existing sources of
genetic resistance within the crop. Moreover, due to the
formation of oospores, which are the product of sexual
reproduction between the A1 and A2 types, late blight could
become an earlier blight and begin infecting the plant
immediately after it emerges. Oospores can survive between
cropping seasons and become active soon after planting. With
just the A1 present, infestation usually takes place quite late
in the season when the disease is easier to manage. Earlier
infection means that farmers are battling the problem soon after
emergence.
The general implications of this development are likely to
result in dramatic increases in the use of fungicide sprays and
the development of even more powerful chemicals, both of which
carry important consequences for the environment and health. In
addition, farmers face substantial annual increases in the costs
of production. Nowhere, however, are the challenges likely to be
greater than in the developing world where farmers often lack the
cash required to buy chemical inputs and where potatoes are
helping to meet the future food challenges that the Consultative
Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is trying to
address.
According to a recently completed book published by the FAO
crop statistics unit and the International Potato Center (CIP),
annual potato production in lesser developed countries (LDC) has
grown from 30 to 85 million tons since the early 1960's.
Developing country production is currently growing at an annual
rate of 3.6%, a figure that is expected to hold steady for some
time. By the year 2000 developing countries will be producing
more than a third of the world's potato crop. These figures are
extremely conservative and are likely to increase as developing
counties diversify their agriculture. We also expect that the
unexploited yield potential of potatoes will be called upon to
play a far greater role in feeding LDC populations as we begin to
bump against the yield ceiling of the most popular cereals.
Currently, developing country potato yields average about 13
tons/hectare, but most of these countries could easily produce
upwards of 40 tons/hectare. Most potato experts agree that yield
potential of the crop can reach 120 tons/hectare.
