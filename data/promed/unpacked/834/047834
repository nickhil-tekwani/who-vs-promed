[Since the start of the FMD-O epizootic in Israel (end December 2006)
17 foci in domestic ruminants (predominantly cattle) have been
reported: one in December 2006, 8 in January 2007, 5 in February
2007, and 3 in March 2007 (see time-series-analysis at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=country_disease_time_series&disease_id=1&selected_analysis=tot_new&selected_start_month=1&selected_start_year=2006&selected_end_month=12&selected_end_year=2007>.
The current outbreak in wildlife, affecting the protected species
Mountain gazelle (_Gazella gazella gazellae_) with, seemingly, high
case-fatality rate, is a reminder of the exceptional susceptibility
of these delicate animals to FMD virus O, as recorded during the
previous outbreak, in the same nature reserve of Ramot Yissachar,
during March-May 1985. For more information on the 1985 event,
including pictures of lesions in affected gazelles and
virological/serological survey in gazelles and wild boars,
subscribers are referred to the review "Foot and Mouth Disease: The
Israeli Approach" available at
<http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/agriculture/> (go to
"epidemiology", then to "FMD in wildlife" where clickable further
information can be accessed).
Similar investigations are expected to be carried out during the
current outbreak. Hopefully they will also address wild boars, whose
population-density has, reportedly, been steadily increasing during
the recent decades, particularly in northern Israel. Hopefully,
investigations are being carried out also in other Middle Eastern
countries; any relevant information will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
