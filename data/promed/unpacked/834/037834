Health officials in Sirajganj, Bangladesh are reporting an additional 25 human anthrax cases in Shahzadpur upazila in recent days, according to local media. This is the 3rd wave of anthrax cases in the upazila since May [2016]. The outbreak is linked to anthrax tainted meat. All the cases are considered cutaneous anthrax, according to the report.

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. Although it is rare, people can get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products

Cutaneous anthrax occurs when the spore (or possibly the bacterium) enters a cut or abrasion on the skin. It starts out as a raised bump that looks like an insect bite. It then develops into a blackened lesion called an eschar that may form a scab. Lymph glands in the area may swell plus edema may be present. This form of anthrax responds well to antibiotics. If untreated, deaths can occur if the infection goes systemic. Up to 95 percent of cases of anthrax are cutaneous.

[As 13 new cases were reported on last Fri 19 Aug 2016, I suspect that in reality only 12 additional cases are officially being reported. This would put the total number to 103 since the start ... still a significant number. As the incubation period for anthrax is inversely proportional to the size of the infecting dose, there can be a drawn out tail of late cases. In the Sverdlovsk incident the final case was 6 weeks after exposure. Only careful interviewing will determine who was exposed when and possibly to what.
