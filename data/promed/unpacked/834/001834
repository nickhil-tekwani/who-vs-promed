For more than 30 years up to 2006, the incidence of human listeriosis
in the Czech Republic has been low, ranging between 0.1 and 0.2 cases
per 100 000 population per year. In 2006, however, the incidence of
human listeriosis was about 0.7. Altogether, 75 cases of listeriosis
were reported to have occurred in 2006 [Figure 1. For figures, see
original URL. - Mod.LL], and a few more are still under
investigation. 43 cases were registered during the last quarter of
the year (Figure 2). For comparison, in 2005, the overall number of
cases was 15.
The majority of patients with listeriosis were elderly people; 52
percent of patients were aged 60 and above [Table. For table, see
original URL. - Mod.LL]. In general, men were affected more often
than women (42 versus 33 cases), but in the age group 20-39 years,
women (especially pregnant women, 11 cases) constituted the majority
of patients. A diagnosis of neonatal listeriosis was made in 14
cases. Miscarriage as a consequence of infection was reported in 2
women. 12 of the 75 patients died. 10 of the deaths were in adults
between 51 and 80 years of age (mean age 71) and 2 in newborn babies.
The breakdown of cases by age identified the 3 main population groups
at risk: newborns, pregnant women and immunocompromised elderly people.
Geographically, almost half of the country was affected, with 38 out
of the 76 districts reporting human cases of listeriosis (Figure 3).
Although cases occurred in both Bohemia (western region of the
country) and Moravia (eastern), the latter registered higher
incidence (0.5 per 100 000 in Bohemia versus 0.99 per 100 000 in Moravia).
Notification of cases:
In the Czech Republic, listeriosis is one of the mandatory notifiable
diseases reported within the EPIDAT system. The standard
demographical, clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data
collected do not include detailed clinical information. All reported
listeriosis cases are always laboratory confirmed.
The patients affected in the 2006 outbreak (all who recovered) were
interviewed by qualified senior epidemiologists to establish what
food they had consumed and what their dietary habits were, however,
no standard questionnaire was used. Most patients reported having
eaten mature cheeses and mixed salads.
Laboratory findings:
Strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_ isolated both from patients and
food samples (altogether 36 isolates) were forwarded to the Czech
national reference laboratory for listeria for detailed serotyping,
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antibiotic susceptibility testing.
Food consumed by the patients was not available for laboratory
analysis. However, food samples collected during inspections of food
production sites and sale outlets were analyzed for listeria.
Laboratory analysis showed that all strains detected belonged to
serotype 1/2b and none was found to be resistant against ampicillin,
penicillin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole. 30 human isolates were
analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; 26 belonged to the same
pulse type (type A), and only 4 were types B, C, E1 and X. The pulse
type A was also confirmed in 2 isolates gained from a sample of
mature cheese collected in different food store chains. Several
patients confirmed consumption of this particular cheese. Another
pulse type was detected in a different sort of mature cheese produced
by another manufacturer. Furthermore, the pulse type of an isolate of
one patient corresponded with the type found in a mixed salad
containing salami, cheese, vegetable and dressing. The analysis of
isolated strains identified in food samples continues; so far only 2
strains have been analyzed.
Control measures:
As part of the control measures undertaken by the Czech authorities
in response to the outbreak, 404 inspections were carried out by
public health authorities, and _L. monocytogenes_ was detected in 11
samples. As a result of inspections, the contaminated products were
identified, and their production at several food production sites was
suspended.
The public health services cooperate closely with the Czech trade
inspection and Veterinary administration services in control of food
quality and safety. In addition, the National Institute of Public
Health prepared a new standard questionnaire on food habits for use
in the surveillance of listeriosis.
