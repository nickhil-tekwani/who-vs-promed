The previous posting said: "The Veterinary Laboratories Agency [VLA] is now
trying to pin down the cause of the disease, which has been described as a
type of cattle poliomyelitis. Analysis of this cow's brain showed that the
disease affected the white matter. This led to paralysis for 5 to 6 days,
followed by death".
Poliomyelitis is a gray matter disease. A white matter disease would be
referred to as a leukoencephalopathy.

Just a small note on the neurologic considerations.
Flaccid paralysis is normally thought to be a sign of lower motor neuron
(LMN), peripheral nerve, or neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disease. This
would suggest a lesion in the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, or muscle
rather than a lesion higher up in the CNS. This is why botulism is seen as
flaccid paralysis, because it is acting at the NMJ. There could of course
be lesions higher up, but they should be found at this lower level in the
neuromuscular system if it truly is flaccid paralysis.
