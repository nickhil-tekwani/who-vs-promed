South Cotabato village quarantined to control malaria
-----------------------------------------------------
While their colleagues elsewhere scramble to prevent the spread of dengue,
health officials in South Cotabato have quarantined an entire village to
stop the spread of malaria.
Online news site MindaNews (<http://www.mindanews.com>) reported on Tuesday
[5 Jun 2007] that authorities had placed a mountain village in Lake Sebu
town under isolation after noting 80 cases of malaria there.
"We have initially quarantined the area, which is already endemic to
malaria, to prevent an outbreak, especially now that the rainy season has
started," said provincial health officer Edgardo Sandig. Sandig said they
are closely monitoring Bacdulong village in Lake Sebu for a possible
outbreak of malaria after noting an increase in positive cases during a
recent blood-smearing test.
Aside from Bacdulong, Sandig said he and his counterparts in Sultan Kudarat
have stepped up their joint malaria border operations in neighboring Ned
village, where a malaria outbreak was recorded 2 years ago.
The cause of the outbreak was then traced from malaria-endemic villages in
nearby Sultan Kudarat province. He said they are set to deliver mosquito
nets and reagents for malaria to Bacdulong and nearby villages. While he
said that there was no reported death yet due to the disease in the area,
he stressed that they are not taking any chances.
The World Health Organization's Global Fund Project has committed to
provide at least 2000 mosquito nets and malaria reagents to the province,
he said. "We have also started a massive treatment for malaria in the area
and we're encouraging residents to undergo blood smearing to know if they
have the disease," Sandig said. Aside from the treatment, Sandig said they
also conducted an evaluation in the area to find out why the disease spread
so quickly.
One of the reasons was that the village lacks safe and potable water, and
residents mainly rely on wells for their drinking water. Some of the wells
were breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
Malaria is a debilitating infectious disease characterized by chills,
shaking, and periodic bouts of high fever.

[Quarantine needs to be followed by case detection, especially identifying
asymptomatic gametocyte carriers with primaquine. The strategy will be most
successful in low endemic areas where few cases are asymptomatic. Mindanao
is endemic for malaria. The latest malaria data available from WHO's
Western Pacific Region are from 2002, when 37 005 malaria cases were
reported from the Philippines with 71 deaths:
