Just over a month after health officials announced a hepatitis A outbreak tied to the Famous Anthony's restaurant chain, the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts are reporting 50 cases associated with the outbreak.

On [24 Sep 2021], health officials reported that 10 people were diagnosed with hepatitis A after an employee who worked at 3 different Famous Anthony's locations tested positive for the highly contagious infection. As of Tuesday [26 Oct 2021], Dr Cynthia Morrow -- the director of the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts -- says 49 primary hepatitis A cases have been reported in connection with the outbreak, as well as one secondary case. According to Dr Morrow, 31 of those people ended up in the hospital due to the severity of their symptoms.

This news comes after Dr Morrow announced the 1st death associated with the hepatitis A outbreak on [15 Oct 2021]. That person was reportedly hospitalized with complications from the infection and had underlying medical conditions.

Exposure to hepatitis A may occur through direct contact with someone who is infected, or by eating or drinking something that is contaminated. According to health officials, anyone who visited any of the following Famous Anthony's locations between [10 and 27 Aug 2021] could have been exposed:
4913 Grandin Road
6499 Williamson Road
2221 Crystal Spring Avenue

Health experts say symptoms may develop up to 50 days after exposure, but according to Dr Morrow, no new cases have been reported since that estimated incubation period passed on [15 Oct 2021].

As a result, Dr Morrow says they are cautiously optimistic that they have identified all of the people associated with the outbreak, but since symptoms from hepatitis A can last for months after exposure, it is still possible for new cases to emerge among people who are sick but whose symptoms have not been identified.

[Since the last post, 5 days ago, the number of cases linked to an infected food handler has increased from 44 to 50, with one death and one case of severe enough disease to require a liver transplant. It is now more than 50 days after the end of the period stated in the post (presumably the last time the food handler worked) so the number of cases is leveling off but secondary household cases could continue to occur and one has already occurred. It is also possible that food contaminated by the food handler could have been refrigerated at the restaurant and served later.

While many cases of acute hepatitis A are mild and can occur without any manifestations ("asymptomatic") or with nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain without jaundice ("anicteric"), hospitalizations are required in severe liver disease which can manifest with bleeding (the liver produces many of the clotting factors) and mental status problems. More often, short hospitalizations can be required related to dehydration from vomiting and the inability to keep liquids down.

So far one death in 50 cases (CFR 2.0%). If a serosurvey were to be done of the diners during that period, asymptomatic cases would likely be found.

It is also likely, but unstated, that the food handler index case here was unimmunized, and this substantial cluster could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers were the rule. An outbreak of hepatitis A with 23 confirmed cases was traced to a food handler who worked in the kitchen of a private Morris County, NJ, country club in 2019. Outbreaks such as these may not change the statistics for cost effectiveness nationwide but might push public health authorities to a plan to immunize food handlers against HAV. Although now part of childhood immunization programs in the USA and none of the cases were in children, many adults in the developed world are susceptible. - Mod.LL
