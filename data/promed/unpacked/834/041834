[1] Bacterial spot, apricot - Hungary

First report of _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ in Hungary
----------------------------------------------------------------
In Hungary, symptoms of bacterial spot were observed in June 2016 on apricot (_Prunus armeniaca_ cvs. Bergecot and Toyesi) trees in a commercial orchard (5 ha) in Fej√©r county. Affected trees displayed red-purple necrotic leaf lesions (1-5 mm diameter) surrounded by a chlorotic halo, and water-soaked or dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit. Disease incidence ranged from 10 per cent on cv. Toyesi to more than 90 per cent on cv. Bergecot. As the disease progressed, the necrotic areas on leaves dropped out, leaving a 'shot-hole' appearance.

Symptomatic leaf and fruit samples were collected from 20 apricot trees and tested (biochemical, molecular and pathogenicity tests). Results confirmed the presence of _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ (EPPO A2 List) in diseased samples. This is the first time that _X. arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ is reported from Hungary.

First report of _Xanthomonas fragariae_ in Iran
------------------------------------------------
In Iran, characteristic symptoms of angular leaf spot were observed in May 2015 in a strawberry (_Fragaria ananassa_ cv. Paros) field in Kurdistan province, irrigated overhead. Affected plants displayed angular and water-soaked lesions on leaves. Older, necrotic lesions were also present on leaves, leaf veins and calyces. Films of dried exudate were observed on the abaxial side of the leaves. Approximately 75 per cent of the plants showed at least one of the above symptoms. The planting material had been purchased from a local nursery, which was then inspected but found free of angular leaf spot symptoms.

Symptomatic leaves were collected from 7 plants. Results of the laboratory analysis (isolation, sequencing) confirmed the presence of _Xanthomonas fragariae_ (EPPO A2 List) in diseased samples. At the end of spring 2015, the whole field was treated with copper. However, in spring 2016 the disease was observed again in the same field with a 70 per cent incidence. Surveys did not detect the disease in other strawberry fields. Eradication measures were decided by the NPPO of Iran and all strawberry plants of the affected field were burned on-site. This is the first time that _X. fragariae_ is reported from Iran.

[Apricot leaf spot
-------------------
Bacterial spot caused by _Xanthomonas arboricola_ (Xa) pv. _pruni_ is a serious disease of peach, nectarine, apricot, almond and plum. The pathogen was described for the 1st time on plum in the US in 1903 and was subsequently introduced into Europe. Symptoms may include dark spots or watery lesions on fruits and leaves, premature leaf drop, cankers and tip necrosis on young twigs. The disease can severely reduce tree vigour by defoliation and reduces yield and quality of harvested fruit. Infection occurs via leaf scars in autumn and bacteria start to multiply when conditions become favourable.

Bacterial exudate from cankers and lesions is spread by mechanical means (including insect activity) and water. Disease management may include agrochemicals (for example, copper or antibiotic sprays), reduction of available inoculum by orchard sanitation, and use of crop cultivars with resistance or at least reduced susceptibility to the disease.

Different pathovars of Xa affect a range of hosts. For example, pathovar _juglandis_ is considered the most serious disease of commercial walnut plantings (ProMED-mail post 20120122.1018001) and pv. _corylina_ causes a serious disease of hazelnut crops.

Angular leaf spot, strawberry
------------------------------
Angular leaf spot caused by _Xanthomonas fragariae_ (Xf) affects almost exclusively wild and cultivated strawberry. It has been reported from the Americas and parts of Europe, Africa and Asia, but is currently considered absent from Oceania where it was successfully eradicated in Australia and New Zealand. Symptoms may include water soaked lesions on leaves and fruit calyces which may exude bacterial suspensions under wet conditions. It reduces plant vigour and therefore yield, and may also make fruit unmarketable due to blackened or necrotic calyces. The disease also jeopardises trade and export of nursery stock.

The bacteria survive on leaf debris and in crowns of systemically infected plants. They are spread by water (rain splash, irrigation) and mechanical means. Disease management may include bactericidal sprays (including copper compounds), cultural and plant hygiene measures and use of certified disease free planting stock.

Other species in the genus cause important diseases in a range of crops, including citrus canker and banana xanthomonas wilt (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
