CAPRECOM (a state-run healthcare provider) has reported that as a
result of a survey performed in the Carcel Modelo (the Model Prison,
the main prison in Bogota, the Capital City of Colombia), 323 cases of
mumps have been confirmed, raising fears of an uncontrolled epidemic.

The 1st case was reported in September 2010, an inmate in the north
area of Carcel Modelo. Subsequently, in order to prevent spread of the
disease, CAPRECOM implemented the following 4 measures:
- firstly, the healthcare team would treat independently each
individual showing symptoms;
- secondly, if necessary, inmates with a confirmed diagnosis of mumps
would be isolated;
- 3rd, CAPRECOM would distribute information through lectures to the
other prisoners, and;
- fourthly preventive measures would be reinforced, particularly
where there was direct contact with healthcare personnel working in
the prison, including physicians, nurses, and technicians.

INPEC (the Colombian National Prison Authority ) reported that the
mumps outbreak in Carcel Modelo had spread to the northern wing of the
prison and announced that there would be restricted access to the
prison in the case of children, pregnant women, and the elderly.

INPEC also released its own figures with respect to case numbers,
revealing that as of 27 Oct 2011, there are 191 affected inmates in
areas 4 and 5. They also stated that the initial manifestations of
this viral infection occurred in the northern wings of Carcel Modelo,
in areas 1A and 1B. As soon as the presence of mumps virus infection
was confirmed, inmates were moved to the former high-security wing,
which had been emptied some months ago and now served as a Special
Health Unit, to provide isolation facilities.

In addition to restrictions on admission and release of prisoners from
the affected wings, the movement of inmates to other prisons in the
country will also be suspended.

[From a single case in September 2011, the outbreak had affected 65
prisoners by 14 Oct 2011 and now may affect as many as 323 prisoners.
Clearly, this is a major outbreak not yet under control. It also
suggests that MMR vaccination coverage is far from comprehensive in
Colombia.

La Modelo is a prison in Bogota, Colombia with a population of about
11 000 inmates. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Colombia
