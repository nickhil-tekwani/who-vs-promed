Health authorities in Gansu province have confirmed the death of a patient from septicemic plague -- a rare disease in China -- and strict control and prevention measures are being imposed. The patient, a herder from Jiuquan's Subei Mongolian autonomous county, died on [Tue 12 Dec 2017] afternoon, despite efforts by medical personnel, according to a statement by the Gansu Health and Family Planning Commission on [Wed 13 Dec 2017].The patient's gender was not disclosed. Experts said tests had confirmed at 11 pm that the patient died of septicemic plague that evolved from bubonic plague, which was reported as a suspected plague case at 5:30 pm.

Authorities said they had placed 12 people who had close contact with the patient under quarantine, and no abnormalities had been found. The Jiuquan government also imposed quarantine measures at Subei People's Hospital and at the patient's residence in Subei to prevent the spread of the disease, the statement said. The National Health and Family Planning Commission, China's top health authority, and the Gansu commission sent experts to Subei to guide disease control and prevention, the statement said.

Plague, a virulent microbe that can be transmitted to humans from wild animals, is classed as a Category A infectious disease -- meaning extremely dangerous -- under Chinese law. The only other disease falling into the category is cholera. The law requires that authorities adopt strict measures for control and prevention, including immediately reporting suspected cases, keeping infected people under quarantine during treatment and sterilizing the bodies of the deceased and cremating them.

Only one plague case was reported on the Chinese mainland in 2016 and the person didn't die, according to the national health commission. No cases were reported on the mainland between January and June 2017.

Tuesday's case was the 1st reported in Gansu since 2014, according to the provincial health commission. Three cases were reported in the province that year [2014], and all 3 people died. In July 2017, Gansu became the 1st provincial region in China to adopt strict measures for the control and prevention of plague. Governments at the county level and higher that are in, or near, places prone to the disease were asked to establish institutions to prevent and control the disease.

Residents were advised to avoid contact with sick animals that might be infected with the disease -- marmots, for example -- and told not to eat them.

[Most plague cases are due to the bubonic form following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, the _Yersinia pestis_ organism can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition "septicemic plague". Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing cases of "primary" plague pneumonia.

The marmot is the most common reservoir for _Yersinia pestis_ in eastern Asia. The etymology of the term "marmot" is uncertain (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot). It may have arisen from the Gallo-Romance prefix marm-, meaning to mumble or murmur (an example of onomatopoeia). Another possible origin is post-classical Latin, mus montanus, meaning "mountain mouse." - Mod.LL
