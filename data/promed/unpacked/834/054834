Cases of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne tropical disease marked by
excruciating muscle and joint pain, rose sharply in the United States from
1993 to 1998, the government said. Increased travel, especially to the
Caribbean and Central America, led to the dramatic rise, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
The CDC recorded 90 cases of imported, laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue
fever in 1998, up from a total of 46 in 1993-94. Dengue fever is
characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, severe headaches, severe
joint and muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and a rash. About 5% of those
infected die. Dengue, also called break-bone fever, is transmitted by the
bite of infected _Aedes aegypti_ [and other species of] mosquitoes.
In 1998, dengue was diagnosed in 22 travelers from New York, 12 from
Massachusetts and eight from Maryland, the CDC reported.
Travelers to tropical areas should use mosquito repellents, wear protective
clothing and stay in well-screened or air-conditioned areas, the CDC said.

[Not much fun going to a tropical area if you have to stay in well-screened
or air conditioned rooms. Might be better to choose places with active and
competent mosquito control programs, if choice of destination is possible.
