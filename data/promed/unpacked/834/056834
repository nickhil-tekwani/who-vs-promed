Zoo handles Johne's infection in farm animal area
-------------------------------------------------
A total of 12 animals in the children's farm at the Little Rock Zoo are
infected with Johne's disease, or paratuberculosis, a wasting disease of
the lower intestine that affects ruminant animals. The disease was
discovered by zoo veterinarian Dr Marilynn Baeyens after a routine blood
test was performed on a male goat. Dr Baeyens then took fecal samples from
the goat to confirm the presence of the disease. All animals in the
children's farm were tested and 12 animals were found to carry the disease.

Paratuberculosis is a bacterial disease commonly found in ruminant animals.
It is non-transferable to humans. According to the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA), more than 22 per cent of US dairy farms are infected
with Johne's. The disease causes severe diarrhea and eventual death for the
infected animal. The disease is transmitted when an animal ingests manure
or milk of an infected animal or is kept on previously infected ground. No
effective method exists to kill the organism in the ground.

The Little Rock Zoo has quarantined the 12 infected animals and will
euthanize them to prevent the disease from spreading to other animals.
Infected animals include 1 cow, 4 sheep, and 7 goats. The zoo currently has
14 sheep, 22 goats, 2 cows, 2 donkeys, and 2 mini-horses in its children's
farm exhibit. The exhibit will be closed until further notice.

[Johne's (pronounced YO nees) disease is caused by the bacterium
_Mycobacterium avium _ subspecies _paratuberculosis_. As the article
states, once an animal has it the animal progressively gets worse, to the
point of death. The most prominent characteristic is loose stools, and
secondarily a wasting condition.

Young animals generally are inoculated with it at an early age from sucking
their mother's milk. Because it can be passed in the milk, it is also a
human concern. A couple of research papers indicate that the organism has
been found in pasteurized milk. In response to those research papers the
temperature for pasteurization has generally been raised by 3 degrees in an
effort to try to halt the bacteria from being found in the milk within the
human food chain.

A link has been suggested between _Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis_
and Crohn's disease in people. The organism is very difficult to work with
and therefore the link with human disease link may be tenuous.

In the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has (or had) a
surveillance program on Johne's disease. The program provided testing and
recommended culling when test results indicated high levels of infection.
The US Food and Drug Administration has not been as actively engaged in the
Johne's issue, aside from the increase in pasteurization temperatures.
Increasing the pasteurization temperature too much, or too fast, results in
a flavor consumers find distasteful. Questions remain, however, as to
whether it is high enough to kill this particular agent.

Sadly, there are more problems on a state level regarding cleanliness of
dairies. The states are responsible for enforcing many of the milk safety
standards in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, and are faced with conflicts
between keeping producers in business and maintaining the health and safety
of consumers.

It is likely the zoo is considering the potential link between the infected
animals and children in a petting zoo. The animals may not be in a wasting
state at the moment, and the amount of organism shed is likely to be low
until the animals began showing consistent profuse diarrhea and are in a
negative energy balance situation.
