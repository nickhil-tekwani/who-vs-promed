First report of Tomato torrado virus in tomato in the Canary Islands, Spain
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2003, greenhouse-grown tomato crops (_Lycopersicon esculentum_
Mill.) in the Canary Islands (Spain) were observed showing an initial
yellowing in defined areas at the base of the leaflet that later
developed into necrotic spots or an extensive necrotic area
progressing from the base to tip. Fruits were also affected, showing
necrotic areas and often developing cracking. Generally, the plants
that were affected seemed to be burnt, their growth was reduced, and
the production level was seriously damaged. Similar symptoms have
been observed in Murcia (Spain) since 2001, which have been recently
associated with Tomato torrado virus (ToTV) infection (2).
Between 2003 and 2006, 22 tomato samples showing 'torrado disease'
symptoms were collected from different greenhouses in Las Palmas
(Canary Islands, Spain). To verify the identity of the disease,
double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA [Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
Assay] was performed on leaf and fruit extracts of symptomatic plants
using polyclonal antibodies specific to _Potato virus Y_ (PVY),
_Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV), _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV), and
_Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV). Total RNA was extracted from the 22
tomato samples and tested using one-step RT-PCR
[reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction] with primers
specific to PepMV (1) and ToTV (2). All analyses included healthy
tomato plants as negative controls.
Of the 22 tomato samples, 5 were positive for PepMV and negative for
the other viruses tested by serological analysis. However, all 22
samples were positive in RT-PCR performed with the primers specific
to ToTV. Healthy plants & a water control were negative. The ToTV
RT-PCR product was purified and sequenced. Analysis of one sequence
showed 99 percent identity to ToTV RNA2. To our knowledge, this is
the 1st report of ToTV in the Canary Islands.

Studies on a new disease of tomato in Spain called 'torrado' or 'cribado'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since spring 2001, a new disease called 'cribado' or 'torrado', has
been observed on tomatoes grown under protected conditions in the
region of Murcia, in Spain. Affected plants show necrotic lesions at
the base of the leaflets, which later turn into shot holes (hence the
Spanish name 'cribado'). Longitudinal necrotic lesions also appear on
the stems, necrotic line patterns or blotches followed by
deformations appear on the fruits rendering them unmarketable.
Affected plants present a general burnt-like appearance (hence the
Spanish name 'torrado').
In Spain, several methods were used to try to identify the causal
agent (symptomatology, serology, molecular tests, electron
microscopy, and transmission trials) on a large number of symptomatic
tomato samples during the last 6 years. On the basis of
symptomatology, it was considered that the disease mainly occurs in
Murcia and Canary Islands (Tenerife, Gran Canaria) and to a lesser
extent in Almeria (Andalusia), Alicante (Valencian Community), and
Balearic Islands (Mallorca). Similar symptoms were observed in the
provinces of Vizcaya (Basque Community), Tarragona (Catalonia), and
Valencia (Valencian Community) but were finally attributed to
_Parietaria mottle virus_ (_Ilarvirus_). Preliminary results of ELISA
[Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay] and PCR [Polymerase Chain
Reaction] analysis showed that from a total of 369 samples, 67
percent tested positive for _Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV;
_Potexvirus_ -- EPPO Alert List). However, in transmission assays,
symptoms could only be reproduced in 2 plants grafted with infected
plants (the rest of the inoculated plants showed typical symptoms of
PepMV). Further molecular studies showed that 89 percent of the PepMV
isolates detected in diseased tomato plants corresponded to the
'Chilean 2' isolate of PepMV.
In other studies done in the Netherlands (Verbeek et al, 2007), a new
virus was isolated from tomato plants in Murcia showing similar
symptoms and tentatively called Tomato torrado virus (ToTV).
Phylogenetic analyses suggested that this new virus might belong to a
new genus (close to _Sequivirus_, _Sadwavirus_, & _Cheravirus_).
Following this report, further experiments were done in Spain and 94
samples, which had been collected in tomato glasshouses in Murcia
from 2003 to 2006, were tested for the presence of this newly
described virus (RT-PCR, molecular hybridization). A total of 87
samples tested positive for ToTV. In 83 of these samples, ToTV was
detected in association with PepMV (mainly 'Chilean 2' isolate).
It is concluded that this new tomato disease is probably a syndrome
involving ToTV and particular strains of PepMV, as well as other
factors, which remain to be determined.

[ToTV symptoms of leaf necrosis affect the photosynthetic potential
of the host and therefore may result in considerable yield loss.
Recent reports suggest that the new virus is spreading. White flies
are suspected to be possible vectors for ToTV. Virus particles are
isometric with a diameter of approximately 28 nanometers. The viral
genome consists of 2 positive strand single-stranded RNA molecules of
7793 (RNA1) and 5389 (RNA2) nucleotides. The RNAs are encapsidated by
3 proteins with estimated sizes of 35, 26, and 23 kDa. Phylogenetic
analyses of nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences showed that
the virus is related to, but distinct from, viruses belonging to the
genera _Sequivirus_, _Sadwavirus_, & _Cheravirus_ in the proposed
order of the Picornavirales. It most likely represents a member of a
new plant virus genus.
_Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV; _Potexvirus_ was originally described
in Peru on pepino and has since been reported from North America
(2000) and Europe (1999). Hosts include cucurbits and solanaceous
species such as pepino (_Solanum muricatum_), tomatoes (mainly
glasshouse grown), potato and wild _Lycopersicon_ species. Symptoms
are yellow mosaic or spots on the leaves, inter-veinal chlorosis,
leaf distortion, stunting, and sometimes fruit discoloration.
Significant crop losses have been observed if the virus remains
unchecked. It is spread by plant material, mechanical means, and
grafting. Seed transmission would be unlikely in a _Potexvirus_, but
further studies are needed.
_Parietaria mottle virus_ (PMoV; genus _Ilarvirus_) has been reported
from Italy and Spain. Hosts include parietaria weed (wall pellitory;
_Urticaceae_), tomato, French bean, English spinach, basil, and
mungbean. Symptoms vary seasonally and include mosaic, mottling, or
necrotic patching on leaves. The virus is transmitted by mechanical
means and grafting.
