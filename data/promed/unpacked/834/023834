HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME (HPS) - ARIZONA, USA
==================================================
The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah) reported on Saturday, March 16
that a 57 year old man, admitted to the Chinle Indian Health Service
(IHS) Hospital, was transported on March 2 to the University of
New Mexico Hospital, Albuquerque, with a diagnosis of HPS. He recovered
after treatment, and was discharged on March 10. Jennie Notah, spokeswoman
for the Navajo Area IHS, observed that this was the first case there since
November 1994. The press report noted that additional investigations
(testing of rodents near the patient's home and searching
for any other cases in the vicinity) are being carried out by IHS
environmental health specialists.

The most recent confirmed case of HPS involved a 57 year old Arizona man who
survived the disease. (Our total for confirmed HPS cases in the U.S. is now
130 cases, in 24 states.) The patient was being treated in New Mexico;
serum tested positive for hantavirus at the Arizona state lab, at UNM, and
here at CDC. We are waiting for the results of the ongoing case
investigation. AZ Dept of Health Services posted a news release, dated 15
March, which lists David Mosley as a contact (602) 230-5932. Ralph Bryan
and Jim Cheek (both at 505-837-4226) are also familiar with this case.

[Some further clinical information:]
From: Brian_Hjelle@somasf.unm.edu
There was a case in Apache Co (we prefer not to identify the actual
community). Treated at UNMH [Univ. of New Mexico Hospital] when he
was found to be RIBA+ [positive by radioimmunoblot assay] (later
Western blot and PCR+ [PCR: polymerase chain reaction for viral
gene sequences]). Treatment: Ribavirin protocol, did quite well
without any heroics.
