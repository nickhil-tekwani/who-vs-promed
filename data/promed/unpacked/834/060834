[2] Media report

Last detected in the region only a few months ago, the degenerative nerve disease [scrapie] appears to have returned to northwest Iceland after a years-long hiatus.

The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) reports that scrapie has been detected on the farm Alftagerdi, near Varmahlid in the North West Iceland region of Skagafjordur. The matter was brought to light by the owner of the farm, who reported to MAST that 2 of his 370 sheep showed signs of the disease. They were subsequently put down and destroyed.

The last known case of scrapie was also found in the Varmahlid area, last September [2018], but cause for alarm would be pre-mature [see archive 20181104.6125151 and comment below].

Scrapie, a fatal, degenerative disease that affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats, is very rare in Iceland. Considering that the country has more sheep than people, the number of cases has not exceeded 10 since 1995.

The highest levels were in 1988, when 34 cases were reported, and there were zero cases from 2011 through 2014.

MAST is working diligently on the case to find the root cause, boost education, and stop the miniature outbreak in its tracks.

[The reports above relate to a new outbreak of classical scrapie (also known as la tremblante; traberkrankheit; gnubberkrankheit; prurigo lumbar, among others), a listed OIE disease of sheep and goats. Classical scrapie is a naturally occurring progressive, fatal, infectious, neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats that has been recognized for at least 250 years, and has been reported in Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa. There is no evidence of a causal link between classical or atypical* scrapie and human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [TSEs]. Scrapie is the archetype of the TSEs.

*The so-called 'atypical' scrapie is clinically, pathologically, biochemically, and epidemiologically unrelated to 'classical' scrapie, likely to be non-contagious and a spontaneous degenerative condition of older sheep and rarely of goats.

Classical scrapie was probably introduced into Iceland in 1878 by an imported ram of the Oxford-Down breed that was brought to a farm in the mid-north of Iceland. Its descendants were used widely for breeding in the adjoining area and, a few years later, scrapie was detected in this region. At the beginning of the 20th century, scrapie had spread to a considerable part of the mid-north; at the height of the epidemic in mid-century, it had spread to all except 13 of 38 quarantine areas (see map 1 in ref 1 below). It has remained endemic in the Northland West ever since.

A retrospective epidemiological study based on data from the period 1978-2004 showed that, despite the eradication measures put in place, which included depopulation, cleaning of the premises, allowing restocking only after at least 2 years, recurrences of the disease had occurred on 33 farms. Recurrences were observed most frequently 4-7 years after restocking of the farms, but cases were also observed as late as 12-19 years following restocking, the high persistence of the scrapie agent in the environment playing a significant role in this. For more data concerning the exposure and transmission of scrapie, see section 1.2.5. in ref 2.

The previous scrapie event in Iceland was reported to the OIE on 2 Nov 2018; it involved a sheep flock of 762 head in Vallanes, Skagafjaroar, Northland West where one animal showed clinical signs on 12 Sep 2018. The entire flock was culled ("killed and disposed of") and the event declared resolved on 26 Oct 2018. The last earlier event took place, similarly in Northland West, in January 2018.

Additional background is available in the commentary in postings 20180110.5551049 and 20181104.6125151 which address the 2 recent outbreaks in Iceland.
