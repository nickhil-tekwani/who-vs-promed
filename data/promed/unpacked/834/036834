[1] Modified vaccine
Date: Sat 13 Feb 2021
Source: Reuters [abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-vaccines-exclus/exclusive-eu-drugs-regulator-plans-to-fast-track-variant-modified-covid-vaccines-idUSKBN2AC27T


Europe's medicines regulator is planning to speed up assessments of any COVID-19 vaccines that are modified to protect against variants of the virus, the head of the agency's COVID-19 task-force told Reuters on Fri 12 Feb 2021.

Marco Cavaleri, chair of the vaccine evaluation team at the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said there should be no need for lengthy large-scale trials like those needed to evaluate the 1st COVID-19 vaccines, since tweaks for new variants can be tested on smaller groups.

"We are working on updated guidelines, assuming that we cannot ask for large Phase III trials. This will allow us to go faster," said Cavaleri.

"We will ask for much smaller trials, with a few hundred participants, rather than 30 000 to 40 000," he told Reuters. He said the EMA would focus primarily on immune response data.

Drug makers, including Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, have been testing their COVID-19 vaccines against several fast-spreading, more infectious variants of the novel coronavirus.

Variants which emerged in Brazil (known as P.1.), Britain (known as 20I/501Y.V1 or B.1.1.7) and South Africa (known as 20I/501Y.V2 or B.1.351) have already spread around the world, piling more pressure on governments struggling to tame the pandemic which has killed almost 2.5 million people.

These are the 3 major variants that are worrying scientists, with their spread raising the risk that newly developed COVID-19 vaccines will need to be updated or tweaked to be effective against some variants, and that people may require one or more booster shots.

Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also said it is considering a rapid review process for the quick turnaround of new COVID-19 booster shots if variants emerge against which the vaccines do not provide protection.

Vaccine makers Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as AstraZeneca and Moderna, whose COVID shots have been authorised for emergency use in Europe, have said they are preparing for the possibility that variants will emerge that could require tweaks to their vaccines. Normally, an EMA approval requires extensive studies with large numbers, starting with safety and ending with efficacy.

"We will also try to streamline regulatory procedures doing something similar to what happens with flu vaccines. In short, without the drug makers having to submit all the preliminary data again," Cavaleri said.

He added that the EMA is also aware that in the near future, it may no longer be possible to do clinical trials with placebo for categories such as the elderly, due to rollout of current COVID-19 vaccines.

"In that case, we could think about a head-to-head comparison with an already approved vaccine," he said.

Cavaleri also told Reuters that Johnson & Johnson will file its vaccine formal application in the next few days. "Probably as early as next week," he said, noting that the EMA has been conducting a rolling review of the vaccine for some time. "Mid-March 2021 is reasonable for the EMA decision," he said.

The EMA, he added, has been in contact to date with about 50 pharmaceutical companies working on COVID vaccines.

Regarding the Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, he said the agency is in constant contact with the company producing it.

"There is a constructive cooperation. If there are no problems with the answers we receive on the subject of the production phase, the rolling review could start within a matter of weeks," he said

The EMA is also in contact with the Chinese companies developing vaccines, particularly Sinovac Biotech, but the process for the Chinese vaccine is a few steps behind the Russian one, he said.

[Facilitating the process of modifying vaccines which will protect against variants is important [see case report below]. It is hoped that once the intensity of transmission diminishes with the vaccinated population increasing, mutations will be less likely to occur. On the other hand, it is possible that pressure on the virus by the vaccines may equally lead to mutations. - Mod.LK]

[2] France: Reinfection

Ref. Noemie Zucman, Fabrice Uhel, Diane Descamps, Damien Roux, Jean-Damien Ricard, Severe reinfection with South African SARS-CoV-2 variant 501Y.V2: A case report, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2021;, ciab129, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab129.


Doctors in France are treating a critically ill patient infected with the South African coronavirus variant, 4 months after he recovered from Covid-19, in what study authors said was the 1st case of its kind.

The 58-year-old man had a history of asthma and initially tested positive for Covid-19 in September 2020, when he presented to medical staff with a fever and shortness of breath. The symptoms persisted only for a few days, and the man tested negative for Covid-19 twice in December 2020.

However, he was admitted to hospital in January 2021 and diagnosed with the South African variant. The patient's condition worsened, and he is currently in a "critical condition" on a ventilator.

"This is, to our knowledge, the 1st description of reinfection [with variant B.1.351, 1st identified in South Africa] causing severe Covid-19, 4 months after a 1st mild infection," said authors of a study published this week in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. [see below]

The 501Y.V2 coronavirus variant emerged late last year [2020] in South Africa and immediately provoked alarm among disease specialists. It has 8 key mutations, one of which affects the virus' spike protein, making it more effective at binding to human cells and, therefore, more infectious.

Vaccine manufacturers Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna say their mRNA vaccines retain their effectiveness against the South African variants and another that emerged last year [2020] in Britain.

However, a study last week showed that AstraZeneca's vaccine failed to prevent mild and moderate cases of infection of the South African variant.

"The impact of 501Y.V2 mutations on the effectiveness of vaccines developed based on earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains is still unknown," said the authors of the reinfection study.

[The rapid acquisition of herd immunity appears to be the only way out of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the strength and duration of immunity against this coronavirus are still uncertain. Reinfections have been described but remain rare, albeit probably underestimated (31 confirmed cases worldwide as of January 2021), and, in most cases, less severe than the initial infection [1,2]. However, major concern is arising from the recent description of variants carrying mutations providing SARS-CoV-2 with selective advantages. Three emerging variants of concern (VOC) are currently associated with a new rise in the incidence and mortality related to COVID-19. There are well-grounded fears that these VOC could cause reinfections or post-vaccination infections.

As a matter of fact, we read with interest the article by Harrington et al. describing a case of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 Variant VOC-202012/01 [3]. "The sequence of the 1st infection is not available. But the timing of the exposure to variant 501Y.V2 lineage B.1.351 makes it clearly a re-infection. Although rare, reinfection due to lack of protective immunity to variants makes it likely that annual vaccination with revised vaccine will become necessary." - Mod.LK]

[3] Convalescent plasma

Ref. Prus K, Alquist CR, Cancelas JA, Oh D. In serum antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2 in convalescent plasma donors over time. Transfusion. Letter to the Editor [see URL above for full publication].

Convalescent plasma, collected from donors who have previously recovered from viral illnesses, has been used to treat patients with a variety of emerging infectious diseases. This product has become more prominent during the current COVID‐19 pandemic, including with the recent emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, but the longevity of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies in donated plasma is unknown. Historically, convalescent plasma has been used to reduce mortality in a number of illnesses, such as SARS, H5N1, H1N1, Ebola, and others. A limited number of prospective trials have been published or are pre‐publication regarding treatment of COVID‐19 with convalescent plasma, many of which are small but report conflicting data spanning from no benefit to statistical significance in specific patient groups but not overall, and the uncertainty of effectiveness is reflected in a large review as well. Post‐infection antibody titers vary and may remain constant or wax and wane over time independent of sex and age.

Our institution collected convalescent plasma throughout the current COVID‐19 pandemic, and recorded data points including the Signal‐to‐Cutoff ratio (S/C ratio) of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2 in these units. This letter aims to describe trends in the S/C ratio observed in donor units over the past 4 months to ultimately improve donor collection practices and yield units with sufficient antibody to qualify as convalescent plasma.

This institution overall had 262 individual donors, of which 38 qualified for analysis. Donors were included in this data set if they successfully completed at least 3 convalescent plasma donations over a minimum of 30  days. This was set to allow for enough data points over time to establish a trend in S/C ratios. Donors included had an age range of 19‐75  years at time of 1st donation, with an average age of 48.2  years (median: 51  years). Collected products overall showed a decrease in S/C ratio in all periods and more significant decreases over time. Specifically, for products collected on days 29-56  days, 57% of products showed a decrease in S/C ratio from that donor's baseline, as compared to 78% of products with a decrease from 57-84 days and 100% of products with a decrease from 85-112  days and 113 to 140  days (Figure 2). The average S/C ratio decreased over time for each additional month after symptoms resolved. Donors had an average S/C ratio of 10.3 from days 1 to 28, and this decreased to 8.1 for days 29-56, 6.5 for days 57-84, 5.1 for days 85-112, and 4 for days 113-140. In the group that donated at 4 months or later post‐recovery (113  days‐140  days), these donors had an average decrease in S/C ratio from baseline of 47% (mean 53.6%).

Overall, this data set suggests that antibody S/C ratios decrease over time and are most pronounced at 12  weeks or later using the EuroImmun assay. This assay has been shown to be comparable in sensitivity and specificity to other major antibody detection assays, including the Ortho‐Clinical Diagnostics assay. Many donors also showed stable or increasing levels during the 1st 8 to 11 weeks after donation. Based on our data, donor centers may yield more convalescent plasma units if each collection is optimized to maximize volume collected and donors are collected more frequently closer to their disease recovery, ideally within 4 to 8  weeks, as opposed to many collections over a long period of time. This would facilitate increased antibody titers in collected plasma and reduce collections of plasma that is unable to be used as convalescent plasma. We believe our findings will aid other collection centers in the development of convalescent plasma collection algorithms to optimize SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody titers.

[4] Viral load and epidemiological dynamics
Date: Sat 13 Feb 2021

https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.08.20204222


Ref. James A Hay, Lee Kennedy-Shaffer, Sanjat Kanjilal et al. Estimating epidemiologic dynamics from cross-sectional viral load distributions. medRxiv 2020.10.08.20204222; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.08.20204222

Abstract
Estimating an epidemic's trajectory is crucial for developing public health responses to infectious diseases, but incidence data used for such estimation are confounded by variable testing practices. We show instead that the population distribution of viral loads observed under random or symptom-based surveillance, in the form of cycle threshold (Ct) values, changes during an epidemic and that Ct values from even limited numbers of random samples can provide improved estimates of an epidemic's trajectory. Combining multiple such samples and the fraction positive improves the precision and robustness of such estimation. We apply our methods to Ct values from surveillance conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a variety of settings and demonstrate new approaches for real-time estimates of epidemic trajectories for outbreak management and response.

Main Text: Real-time tracking of infection incidence during an epidemic is fundamental for public health planning and intervention. In the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, key epidemiological parameters such as the time-varying effective reproductive number, Rt, have typically been estimated using the time-series of observed case counts, percent of positive tests, or deaths, usually based on reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing. However, reporting delays, limited testing capacities, and changes in test availability over time all impact the ability of routine testing to reliably and promptly detect underlying changes in infection incidence. In particular, whether changes in case counts at different times reflect epidemic dynamics or simply changes in testing have been major topics of debate with important economic, health and political ramifications. Here, we describe a new method to overcome these biases and obtain accurate estimates of the epidemic trajectory, one that does not require repeat measurements and uses routinely generated but currently discarded quantitative data from RT-qPCR testing from single or successive cross-sectional samples.

Discussion
The usefulness of Ct values for public health decision making is currently the subject of much discussion and debate. One unexplained observation which has been consistently observed in many locations is that the distribution of observed Ct values has varied over the course of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has led to questions over whether the fitness of the virus has changed. Our results demonstrate instead that this can be explained as a purely epidemiologic phenomenon, without any change in individual-level viral dynamics or testing practices. We find that properties of the population-level Ct distribution strongly correlate with estimates for the effective reproductive number or growth rate in real-world settings, in line with our theoretical predictions.

[This preprint is recommended reading. It addresses the problem of obtaining real-time accurate estimates of epidemic trajectories for outbreak management and response. Public health policy is based on such estimates and depends on rapid results from surveillance. But methods among institutions and locations vary, making comparisons difficult. The methods proposed in this paper may help work around this problem. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (86 275), Brazil (45 561), and France (21 231) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 11 586 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 12 Feb 2021 to late 13 Feb 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Russia (14 861), the UK (13 308), Italy (13 532), India (12 188), and Mexico (10 388). A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 48 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 14.2%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 20.6% decrease in daily reported cases and 7.3% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 370 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 109.0 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.40 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts, while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.UBA]
