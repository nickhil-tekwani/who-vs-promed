On 19 Mar 2010, the Ministry of Health of Argentina reported the
occurrence of 2 confirmed cases of Saint Louis encephalitis (SLE)
infection in the nation's capital city of Buenos Aires. The SLE virus
has caused outbreaks in the central part of the country (mainly in the
provinces of Cordoba and Entre Rios), and this is the 1st time that it
has been detected in Buenos Aires. This virus has epidemic potential.

[St. Louis encephalitis is caused by a flavivirus transmitted by
infected _Culex_ sp. mosquitoes. It can only be transmitted by the
infected mosquito; it cannot be transmitted directly between people.
The incubation time varies from 5 to 15 days. (The mosquitoes get it
from wild birds. - Mod.JW).

Generally, this is a mild disease and may initially be mistaken for
the flu, as the 1st symptoms are fever and headache. In more severe
cases, the patient may experience high fever, headache, a sore and
stiff neck, some disorientation and perhaps even stupor. These may be
followed by convulsions, coma, tremors and occasionally a spastic but
flaccid paralysis.

Supportive and symptomatic care is recommended, as there is no
specific treatment for this disease. It has been known to have a case
fatality rate of approximately 3 percent. Prevention is the best
solution. - Mod.TG]


[It would be of interest to know what preventive measures are being
taken in Buenos Aires city to avoid additional SLE virus infections.
