Japan yesterday tightened quarantine on fodder straw imports as suspicion
grew that Chinese feed may have been behind a suspected outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in cattle, an official said. "It has come to
light Chinese straw had been fed" at the farm where cows were suspected of
being infected with the disease, said the official at the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. It is "unclear" whether the Chinese
straw caused the scare but the ministry "cannot rule out the possibility",
the official said.
The ministry will inspect closely imports of rice, wheat and barley straw
as well as hay from China and South Korea "for the time being", said the
official, who declined to be named. South Korea is no longer considered "a
clean country" for cattle product imports as an outbreak of FMD is also
suspected there, the official added. A South Korean quarantine official
said 15 animals were involved but the outbreak was limited to 1 farm in
Kyonggi province, near Seoul.
The scare has spread concern in the region. Singapore has banned beef
imports from Japan.
Seoul banned Japanese beef imports, after Japan and Taiwan reacted to the
suspected outbreak in South Korea by suspending imports of Korean livestock
produce. Straw imported from China and South Korea will be disinfected if
necessary, the official said.
Over the weekend, the authorities rushed to contain a suspected outbreak of
FMD on Japan's southern-most main island of Kyushu, where cattle at a small
farm in Miyazaki Prefecture were suspected to be infected. The ministry
said on Wednesday it "could not completely rule out the existence of the
virus" in cows at the farm. It had failed to establish an outbreak itself
but antibodies suspected of being formed as a result of FMD were detected
in blood samples from 9 cows. The entire herd of 10 cows was slaughtered.
The Japanese ministry imposed a quarantine zone with a 50-km radius around
the farm from Saturday.
Japan's farm ministry said by the end of Tuesday, there had been no
suspected cases of FMD since Sunday. It had checked more than 5000 farms in
the Miyazaki area, along with neighbouring Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectures.
