Re: Foot & mouth disease - Mongolia: (BO) bovine, OIE
-----------------------------------------------------
I saw in the ProMED commentary to the above posting that it is suggested the type A SEA genotype has spread to southwest Russia, presumably you mean the recent Krasnodar outbreaks [see ProMED-mail's postings 20130618.1780183 and 20130701.1802284. - Mod.AS].

The FGI-ARRIAH [Federal Governmental Institute - Centre for Animal Health, Yur'evets, Vladimir, Russia] lab has typed the [causative agent of the Krasnodar outbreak] as being an A Iran-05 lineage, and the latter is the main type involved in the epidemics currently continuing in West Eurasia. Type A has predominated this year [2013] in Iran and Turkey, in Virus Pool 3.

The above information was provided at a recent Workshop held in FGI-ARRIAH for Central Asian countries.

[Dr Sumption's authoritative, corrective update is gratefully acknowledged.

It is a relief to note that the FMDV-A strain currently circulating in southwest Russia belongs to the A Iran-05 lineage, against which an efficient vaccine is commercially available. For the genotyping results of recent isolates of this strain (2012/2013), including related vaccine strains and a dendogram, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLFMD-2013-00002%20A%20Iran%202012-2013.pdf.

ProMED-mail published RFI's requesting genotyping data on the recent outbreaks in Krasnodar and the Karachay-Cherkess Republic in postings 20130610.1765568 and 20130618.1780183. The following question was included:

"Has this outbreak been caused by the same FMDV-A strain (topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97) which caused, earlier this year (2013), 4 outbreaks in Russia's Zabaykalsky kray, on Russia's border with China, thousands of km northeast to the current outbreak? That strain was found, by genotyping carried out at the World Reference laboratory for FMD (Pirbright, UK), to be identical to the FMDV-A strain circulating in China (so far reported from 5 provinces scattered throughout China). The same virus strain is also suspected in eastern Kazakhstan; however, official confirmation has, so far, not become available from the Kazakh authorities."

Later, Russia reported 3 new FMDV-A outbreaks, one in Amur and 2 in Krasnodar, in a common OIE follow-up report (posting 20130701.1802284). Information on the difference between the causative agents in the 2 distant areas would have been helpful.

FGI-ARRIAH is an OIE reference laboratory for FMD, serving a significant number of countries in FMD-stricken areas. Early publication of their serotyping and genotyping results, as practiced by WRLFMD (Pirbright), is essential for the global control of this major epizootic.

Virus Pool 3, referred to by Dr Sumption, is one of the 7 internationally recognised FMD virus pools, namely: Pool 1 - South-East Asia; Pool 2 - South Asia; Pool 3 - West Eurasia; Pools 4, 5, 6 - Sub-Saharan Africa; Pool 7 - South America. See additional information in 20110610.1772. - Mod.AS
