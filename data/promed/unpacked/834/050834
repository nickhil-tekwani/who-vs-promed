[Information from Zambia's last OIE annual report (January-December 2016) indicates that the country reported African swine fever (ASF) as being restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s). During 2016, 6 outbreaks were reported in the Eastern province and 1 outbreak in the Northern province. For further details on these outbreaks, see section 3 of this report.

Information in this same annual report mentioned that the following disease control measures were in effect or applied: ASF is a disease which must be officially reported, monitoring, screening, general surveillance, movement control inside the country, and zoning. See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2016&semester=0&wild=0&country=ZMB&this_country_code=ZMB&detailed=1

What is not clear from the information reported in 2016, and which remains unclear in this recent report, is the fate of the susceptible animals. For example, in 2016, from a population of 3163 pigs, there were 406 cases and of these, 298 died. In the current outbreak, 11 of 15 cases resulted in death. However, in neither is there any mention of the fate of the other affected cases or the rest of the susceptible population. Were the rest of the susceptible pigs depopulated? Was modified stamping out applied? Any information that would help explain what additional measures were applied will be greatly appreciated. - Mod.CRD
