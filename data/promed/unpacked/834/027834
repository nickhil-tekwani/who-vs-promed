HANTAVIRUSES - BOSNIA-HERZEGPOVINA (4)
======================================
Subject: HFRS Viruses in Former Yugoslavia
Obviously, with the current situation in Bosnia, there is increasing
information desired about the health risks in the Former Yugslavia.
Recent PROMED postings have discussed the HFRS situation. Here is
some additional information, which I cannot confirm, but which appears
to be reliable:
Following up on the report in communicable disease report section of
6 October CDR weekly [UK] that 250 cases of HFRS had been reported by
WHO's Health Monitoring Unit Zagreb, the UN reports that as of
mid-summer 200 cases in the Bosnian and 400-500 cases in the Serbian
populations, mostly Puumula but some Hantaan and a few mixed (or a 3rd
virus). At least one case of Seoul infection was also documented in
UN forces. The Tuzla Hospital has reported 400 cases among Serbs and
350 cases among Bosnia military during 1995. Bosnian military medical
personnel have indicated that cases were actually much higher perhaps
10-fold (3500 cases among Bosnian military) with mortality originally
a few % but now rising. Attack rates were not uniform across the area,
but varied considerably with "hot spots".
This is typical of HFRS where rodents in one area are highly infected
while no infection occurs in other areas. Recent fighting around Tuzla
occurred in one of the "hot spots" with a large number of cases among
Bosnian military. 350 of the 400 reported Bosnian cases have been
confirmed by IgM ELISA and plaque neutralization [neut] using Hantaan
and Puumula virus.
Neutralization patterns suggest that Hantaan, Puumula and either
variants of these or a third HFRS type is circulating in the area. Seoul
virus was not included in the neut test but has been confirmed in one
Canadian peace-keeper.
