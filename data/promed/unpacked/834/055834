Sidi Bel Abbes - 26 cases of human brucellosis recorded in 2022
---------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 26 cases of human brucellosis have been recorded since January 2022, and the majority during the month of Ramadhan when raw milk and its derivatives are widely consumed by fasting people.

Following these cases, the veterinary services, the trade department and the health department have consulted and worked to draw up an order defining the conditions for the sale of raw milk to consumers.

Sales will be regulated at the points of sale of raw milk. Sellers must have a pasteurization device to eliminate any risk that could alter the quality of the milk in order to protect the consumer from diseases, mainly brucellosis, which is still reported, especially between May and July, our sources say.

Sellers of raw milk will have to equip themselves with a pasteurizer, the points of sale will be listed and the sale governed by an order, non-compliance with which will lead to the closure of the business. Unannounced checks will be carried out by the authorities with a firm hand, our source told us.

The cases (26) recorded in 2022 are almost half compared to those of 2021 with 42 cases during the same period and 166 cases in total from January 2021 to December 2021.

[This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the USA and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.

Each species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.

Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _B. melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis, with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with a mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications.

Sidi Bel Abbès, also called Bel Abbès, is the capital of the Sidi Bel Abbès wilaya or province in Algeria and is located in the north of the country. - Mod.LL
