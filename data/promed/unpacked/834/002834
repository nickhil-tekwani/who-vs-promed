The Public Health Agency of Canada says it is investigating an outbreak of salmonellosis in Western Canada after at least 46 people became ill from the infection.

The agency says it is still trying to determine the cause of the outbreak in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and 1 case in Ontario linked to travel from Alberta.

Three people have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported. The agency says in a release that people who became sick reported eating fresh produce before their illness.

Anyone can become sick with _Salmonella_, but young children, the elderly, pregnant women or people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk.

The agency says it is working with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada.

Since Wednesday [10 Nov 2021], 18 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in British Columbia and another 18 in Alberta. There were also 3 cases in Saskatchewan and 6 in Manitoba. The agency said Friday [12 Nov 2021], that people became sick between late September and mid-October [2021], and are between the ages of 9 and 89 years old.

There are no food recall warnings associated with the outbreak.
