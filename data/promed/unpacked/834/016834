China has brought the blue-ear pig disease under control, Gao Hongbin, vice
minister of agriculture, said at a press conference held [in Beijing] on
Monday [29 Oct 2007].

By 25 Oct 2007, the blue ear pig disease, also known as porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome [PRRS], had infected 310 134 pigs in
304 counties in 26 Chinese provincial areas, of which 81 030 died and 235
380 were culled, he said.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Dan Silver

[Previously (24 Sep 2007, see ProMED-mail 20070925.3183) the official total
for the number of pigs infected with blue ear pig disease was around 290
000 (compared with 257 000 in late August 2007). The accuracy of these
official figures has been contested by several international experts,
mainly in view of the Chinese media reports and the fact that the disease
is reported officially from practically all China's territories, namely 26,
out of China's 33 provincial areas. It is to be hoped that the reported
reduced number of outbreaks reflects reduced circulation of the causative
agent(s) and will herald the end of the epizootic.

Highly pathogenic PRRS has also been officially reported from Viet Nam, and
unofficially from Myanmar (see ProMED-mail 20071014.3372). - Mod.AS
