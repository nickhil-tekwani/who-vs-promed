What about influenza viruses? There is a known mutation/transmission route
of duck-pig-human for new strains of flu viruses? Are we opening the
possibility of another pandemic a la 1918? And I assume it is well
documented that immunosuppressed people are susceptible to normally
innocuous organisms. I have seen a reference for an immunosuppressed person
catching _Bordetella bronchiseptica_ (Canine Infectious Tracheobronchitis
aka Kennel Cough)from their dog. Isn't something of this order possible
from transplanted organs?
Are donors (i.e. Pigs) checked for diseases or are they raised as germ free
animals as transplant sources? Can pigs be raised virus free?

[To quote Marie Cornu of (02) of this thread: "Only gnotobiotic (or axenic)
pigs, which would have grown in perfectly sterile conditions, could be
candidates for xenotransplantation. So, the risk of pathogens inhabiting
pig's tissue would be therefore very limited, as long as it concerns
microorganisms." Now read on. - Mod.MHJ

Expression of the Gal(a1-3)Gal epitope in tissues from non-human mammals
like the pig is responsible for the hyperacute rejection of xenotransplants
where preformed Gal(a1-3)Gal antibodies in human serum react with the
endothelium of transplanted organs (Bach FH et al. Nature Med 1:869-873,
1995).
In recent years much effort has been spent on creating transgenic pigs and
other potential donor animals where the Gal(a1-3)Gal epitope is not exposed
and where hyperacute rejection would not take place. This, however, would
also break down the defensive barrier which protects humans against viruses
endogenous in the donor species, because such viruses would no longer be
immediately recognized by preformed antibodies in human serum (Patience C
et al. Nature Med 3:282-286, 1997).
Concern has therefore been raised that endogenous retroviruses foreign to
the human species would be allowed inside our evolutionally developed
defence and could act as Trojan horses with potentially devastating
consequences not only to recipients of a xenotransplant but also to the
population as a whole (Weiss R. Nature 391:327-328, 1998).
