Thailand's Department of Livestock Development confirmed Thursday [1 Feb
2007] that it has found the H5N1 virus in samples of fighting cocks and
native chickens in the central province of Ang Thong, the 3rd location in
which the deadly virus detected this year. [Central Thailand; see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_Thong_Province>. - Mod.AS].
Livestock Development Department director-general Pirom Srichan said the
lab tests confirmed the samples of 6 fighting cocks and native chickens
from Samko district in the province tested positive to H5N1 virus.
All poultry in the flock were culled on 23 Jan 2007. Officials sprayed
disinfectant and checkpoints have been set up to prevent poultry movement
in the area.
Since the beginning of 2007, the H5N1 virus was found in Phisanulok, Nong
Khai, and now, Ang Thong. [See comment for their respective sites].
Nirandorn Uangtrakulsuk, Director of the Bureau of Disease Control
Veterinary Service said that some migratory birds were believed to have
carried the disease to Ang Thong's chicken population since last month.
Speaking about the bird flu situation, he said officials are waiting for
lab test results of 12 144 samples of poultry from all 53 196 samples.
Three samples have been tested positive so far.
Of the 25 human cases of bird flu infection confirmed to date in Thailand,
17 have been fatal.

other, situated in different provinces. On the interactive map of
Thailand's provinces, available at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand>, Phisanulok is No 12
in the North listing, Nong Khai is No 12 in North East, and the most recent
one, Ang Thong, is No 1 in Centre. - Mod.AS]

Three chickens were found dead and positively identified as [having died

[4] Georgia (Abkhazia), suspected, request for information

The 1st case of H5N1 virus was recorded in Gudauta a week ago. Examinations
have been carried out by Russian experts, who are carrying out surveillance
and disease monitoring activities along Abkhazia's coast. This information,
however, has not been circulated [Probably due to the political
constraints, namely sovereignty issues?! - Mod.AS].
The recording of this virus in Gudauta is linked with its spread in
[neighbouring, to the north west] Krasnodar territory.
The Abkhazian de facto government hides this information from the
population, but people are seeking help because of massive numbers of cases
of Bird Flu. [This might be interpreted by some as a politically tainted
allegation; see commentary. - Mod.AS]
The presence of this virus in Abkhazia poses a threat to other territories
of Georgia.

[The above information was denied, on 1 Feb 2007, by the Abkhazian
authorities who said: "As for the Georgian-Abkhaz border, import of poultry
through this section has been banned since the beginning of last year,
after a bird flu [outbreak] was reported in Georgia"; see
<http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=14551>. Absent or deficient
epidemiological information is a phenomenon characteristic of politically
unstable territories.
Could the relevant international organisations, such as FAO, WHO and OIE,
verify the actual situation in situ?
Gudauta is a town in Georgia's breakaway region, Abkhazia. It is situated
on the north-eastern coast of the Black Sea, 37 km northwest of Sokhumi,
the capital of Abkhazia. H5N1 has been reported from neighbouring
Krasnodar, similarly on the Black Sea coast, earlier this week (see
archived 20070129.0384).
The coasts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, as well as those of the
Caspian Sea, have witnessed extensive H5N1 outbreaks during the same season
a year ago, starting in December 2005 and continuing throughout the winter
and spring months of 2006. The region is situated on main flyways of birds
migrating from Siberia.- Mod.AS]
