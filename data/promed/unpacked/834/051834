--------------------------------------------------------------
I have no specific information about this particular case/outbreak,
but comment generally that strangles, caused by _Streptococcus equi_
infection, often does not spread very widely in Thoroughbred
racehorses in the UK. There is a low prevalence of the infection in
breeding studs in UK/Ireland/France and infection can enter training
yards from them and from other infected premises. The infection is
controlled in the Thoroughbred industry in the UK through a voluntary
code of practice, recommending detection and isolation of cases and
subsequent treatment -- and which also requires notification to local
premises to allow them to take preventive measures.

It is not particularly uncommon for individual cases to occur in
racing yards and to be controlled through isolation and treatment.
Researchers at the Animal Health Trust (AHT) have pioneered work into
the detection of carrier animals, which are often infected
asymptomatically in their guttural pouches, blind ending diverticula
of Eustachian tubes (structures unique to equidae).

I would regard this as a small local difficulty and other than
commending the local industry for their far-sighted attitude to
disease control that many could learn from, would find this of little
interest to your readers.
