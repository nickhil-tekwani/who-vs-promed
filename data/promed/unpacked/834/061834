https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/young-kids-more-likely-older-kids-spread-covid-19-household


A Canadian study today [16 Aug 2021] in JAMA Pediatrics suggests that while younger children are less likely than older children to be the index COVID-19 patient in their home, they are more likely to spread it to household members [see citation below]. Led by researchers from Public Health Ontario in Toronto, the study involved 6280 households with COVID-19 index patients 17 years and younger from 1 Jun-31 Dec 2020.

Of the 6280 households, 1717 (27.3%) experienced SARS-CoV-2 transmission to a median of 2 siblings or caregivers in the household 1-14 days after index patient diagnosis. Children aged 0-8 had higher odds of transmitting the virus, but those 3 years and younger had the greatest infectivity (odds ratio [OR], 1.43 vs those 14-17 years).

Similar odds were seen when restricting secondary cases to those occurring 2-14 days or 4-14 days after diagnosis of the index patient, regardless of symptoms or link to a school or childcare outbreak or reopening.

Consistent with increasing degrees of autonomy, proportions of index patients in each age-group rose with age, with 12% of those 0-3 years, 20% of those 4-8, 30% of those 9-13, and 38% of those 14-17. Mean COVID-19 index patient age was 10.7 years, and 45.6% were girls.

Children of all ages most often spread SARS-CoV-2 to household members 20 years or younger or 30-50 years old. When analyzing data on just older children, however, the authors found that they tend to transmit infection to older adults in those age groups.

Also, children 4-8 and 9-13 years were less likely than those 0-3 or 14-17 to have no symptoms.

Kids were more likely to spread the coronavirus amid COVID-19 testing delays (OR for one-day delay, 1.24 vs 2.98 for 5 or more days). Larger family size also increased the chances of transmission (OR, 1.63 per person increase).

The study authors noted that because there were fewer COVID-19 diagnoses in children than in adults amid lockdowns and limited testing capacity early in the pandemic, pediatric household transmission hasn't been well characterized. In addition, household studies have typically compared spread among only young versus old patients, potentially missing more granular differences among age-groups.

But because the number of pediatric COVID-19 diagnoses has risen since jurisdictions eased public health measures and reopened schools in fall 2020, more data are now available to better elucidate child-to-household virus spread.

The findings, the authors said, suggest that household members, schools, and childcare facilities need to consider the differential infectivity of pediatric age-groups.

"Although children do not appear to transmit infection as frequently as adults, caregivers should be aware of the risk of transmission while caring for sick children in the household setting," the researchers wrote. "As it is challenging and often impossible to socially isolate from sick children, caregivers should apply other infection control measures where feasible, such as use of masks, increased hand washing, and separation from siblings."

In an editorial in the same journal, [see citation below] Susan Coffin, MD, MPH, and David Rubin, MD, MSCE, both of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said that sick infants and toddlers may be more likely to spread SARS-CoV-2 to household members than older children because they require close contact with their caregivers.

Because physical distancing and continual masking is unlikely in such settings, Coffin and Rubin recommended vaccination of eligible household members. "The obvious solution to protect a household with a sick young infant or toddler is to make sure that all eligible members of the household are vaccinated," they said.

"Cloaked with the protection of vaccine, household members need not fear the youngest family members with a runny nose come fall; the solution -- vaccination -- is now within their grasp."

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/who-77-billion-needed-covid-variant-detection-oxygen


As many parts of the world battle the more transmissible delta (B1617.2) variant, the World Health Organization (WHO) today [16 Aug 2021] said USD 7.7 billion is needed to track new variants and boost the supply of oxygen.

Meanwhile, countries such as Iran, Japan, and Australia expanded their COVID-19 measures to slow their latest COVID-19 surges.

In a statement, the WHO said the delta variant's transmissibility ramps up vaccination urgency and that rising infection rates are overwhelming health systems. The agency added that low testing levels, especially in low- and middle-income countries, is leaving the world blind to how the virus is evolving, leaving it vulnerable to new variants. [https://www.who.int/news/item/16-08-2021-act-accelerator-launches-urgent-appeal-to-stem-surge-of-dangerous-variants-and-save-lives-everywhere]

The group noted that cases in the 1st 5 months of 2021 had already exceeded infections for all of 2020 and that the world is still in the acute phase of the pandemic. Since the pandemic began, 207 604 434 cases have been reported, along with 4 367 603 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html]

The USD 7.7 billion appeal -- needed over the next 4 months -- is part of the ACT Accelerator's 2021 budget and would go toward increased testing and surveillance, oxygen supplies, and personal protective equipment. The funding would also support other tools to battle the pandemic, such as diagnostics and treatments, and include research and development to ensure that they remain effective.

Also, the WHO said an additional USD 3.8 billion is needed to reserve 760 million vaccine doses in the last quarter of the year [2021], which would ensure that deliveries will continue into 2022.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, the WHO's director-general, said in the statement, "If these funds aren't made available now to stop the transmission of delta in the most vulnerable countries, we will undoubtedly all pay the consequences later in the year."

Iran, the hardest hit country in the Middle East, reported a new single-day high for deaths, with 655 more fatalities reported, according to media outlets. Today [16 Aug 2021] the country started a 6-day lockdown, along with a ban on travel between Iranian cities, according to the Washington Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/16/covid-delta-variant-live-updates/#link-4ED6PLBXPZDX7HGTEQ53TQFP2I]

Since the country began its 3rd major surge in early July [2021], it has been averaging about 35 000 cases a day over the past few weeks.

In Asia, Japan extended the state of emergency for Tokyo and other hot-spot areas until 12 Sep [2021] and also expanded measures to 7 other prefectures, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-extend-state-emergency-lockdown-through-mid-sept-report-2021-08-16/]

Elsewhere, the Australian city of Melbourne extended its lockdown for 2 more weeks, and New South Wales state reported a record 478 new cases in an outbreak mainly centered in the region around Sydney, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/roadblocks-erected-sydney-australia-battles-delta-outbreak-2021-08-15/]

Also, officials in the Darwin area ordered a 3-day "circuit breaker" lockdown after a local case was detected, according to Australia's ABC News. [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-16/covid-update-vic-new-restrictions-nt-lockdown-act-latest/100380486]

[3] CIDRAP News scan
[A] COVID and wildfires

US wildfires were associated with excess COVID-19 cases and deaths from mid-August to mid-October 2020, according to a study published late last week in Science Advances [see citation below].

The researchers looked at 92 counties in California, Oregon, and Washington -- the states most affected by 2020 US wildfires -- creating a distributed lag model from synthesized county- and daily-level data on fine particulate air pollution, wildfire days, and COVID-19 cases and deaths. After accounting for weather, population size, and physical distancing data, they say that an average daily increase of 10 micrograms of particulates per cubic meters each day for 28 days was tied with an 11.7% increase in COVID-19 cases and an 8.4% increase in deaths.

In absolute numbers, the data projected that US wildfires were associated with 19 700 more cases and 750 more deaths from 15 Aug-15 Oct 2020.

During this peak time of wildfire activity, daily levels of fine particulate air pollution were significantly higher during wildfire than non-wildfire days (median, 31.2 micrograms per cubic meter vs 6.4). Some days had much higher concentrations, they noted, such as the Creek Fire in Mono County, California, which had fine particulate air pollution reaching over 500 micrograms per cubic meter for 4 consecutive days.

Sonoma, California, and Whitman, Washington, saw the largest change in COVID-19 cases, with a 65.3% and 71.6% increase, respectively, while Calaveras, California, and San Bernardino, California, saw the largest rise in deaths, with a 52.8% and 65.9% increase, respectively.

"Climate change will likely bring warmer and drier conditions to the West, providing more fuel for fires to consume and further enhancing fire activity. This study provides policymakers with key information regarding how the effects of one global crisis -- climate change -- can have cascading effects on concurrent global crises -- in this case, the COVID-19 pandemic," said senior author Francesca Dominici, PhD, in a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health press release.

It would be interesting to determine whether other respiratory diseases active during fire season are affected in the same way. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has increased this summer; perhaps the fires have contributed to that, although the increases have mostly been observed in the southern US rather than in the west where the fires are. - Mod.LK]

Four out of 5 patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had lingering symptoms 8 months later, according to a study published late last week in the Journal of Infection [see citation below].

The researchers looked at 113 patients with COVID-associated ARDS who were admitted to a Barcelona, Spain, hospital from 28 Feb-15 Apr 2020 (median age, 64 years; 70% male).

At a median of 240 days (8 months) after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis, 81% still had persistent symptoms, most commonly shortness of breath (55%), joint and muscle pain (50%), weakness/lack of energy (45.5%), memory loss (42.5%), and lack of concentration (40.7%). Additionally, 57% had not returned to baseline physical health, including an inability to complete 80% or more of their theoretical 6-minute walking distance (53.5%). Almost all (93%) developed a new mental health condition, including moderate-to-severe post-traumatic stress disorder (49.5%), depression (36%), and anxiety at or above the 75th percentile (34%).

Overall, average SF-36 Health Assessment scores were worse than in the general population. Age was associated with a better prognosis, while being female, not White, or having a Charlson comorbidity index score greater than 2 was associated with a worse mental health component summary score. Being female or having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with a worse physical component summary score.

A subanalysis suggested that, while Latino patients in the cohort were younger (52 vs 67 years) and had lower rates of high blood pressure and dyslipidemia, they had worse outcomes at 8 months, including mental composite score on the SF-36, 6-minute walking time results, and exercise capacity.

"COVID-19 associated ARDS survivors have long-term consequences in health status, exercise capacity, and [health-related quality of life]. Strategies addressed to prevent these sequelae are needed," the researchers conclude.

[C] Saliva testing

COVID-19 diagnosis via saliva samples was most sensitive during the 1st week of infection and was never higher than 60% in asymptomatic people, according to a research letter published late last week in JAMA [see citation below].

The researchers looked at nasopharyngeal and saliva samples collected every 3-7 days up to 4 weeks from people exposed to household members who had COVID-19. Of the 889 paired samples from 404 participants, 58.9% of nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for COVID-19, whereas 35.7% of saliva samples were. Both types of samples in the pair were positive 29.0% of the time.

The peak of saliva sensitivity was 71.2%, during the 1st week of COVID-19 infection (95% confidence interval [CI], 62.6% to 78.8%). The researchers note that those who were symptomatic during their 1st week of infection had an 88.2% saliva sensitivity, while those who were asymptomatic had 58.2%.

Overall, the odds ratio for saliva detection was 0.94 compared with the previous day (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.96). Symptomatic people had a 2.8-fold higher likelihood of having saliva detection than those who were asymptomatic, and those with high nasopharyngeal viral loads had a 5.2-fold higher likelihood than those with low viral loads.

"Saliva was sensitive for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals during initial weeks of infection, but sensitivity in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers was less than 60% at all time points," the researchers write. "This study suggests saliva-based RT-PCR should not be used for asymptomatic COVID-19 screening."

All participants were recruited from the Los Angeles area from 17 Jun 2020-15 Feb 2021.

This prospective, longitudinal study to investigate the testing timeframe that optimizes saliva sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection is important since saliva tests are so much easier to do compared with nasopharyngeal swabs. But it is clear the test has limitations. - Mod.LK]
