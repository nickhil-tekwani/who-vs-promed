Report on the 3rd day, respiratory disease investigation at Konkuk University:
The Korea Center for Disease Control & Prevention [KCDC] (director, Yang Byung Guk) said as of 31 Oct 2015, a total of 44 cases are currently being investigated, and there are confirmed pneumonia radiological patterns in 41 cases who are identified as suspected patients. They are distributed in 7 hospitals receiving treatment.
* Suspected patients: people who visited Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building after 8 Oct 2015 with fever of 37.5 C [99 F] and chest x-ray findings of pneumonia.
* The remaining 3 are being monitored at home (currently they have mild symptoms; if there are any unusual symptoms, they will take chest x-rays).
The 41 suspected cases show fever, muscle pain, and mild pneumonia symptoms; and respiratory symptoms show relatively rare pneumonia findings that there are no severe cases.

Clinical features
Total: Fever / Chills / Muscle pain / Headache / Cough / Body ache / Sputum / Chest ache / Sore throat / Diarrhea
(number (percentage) of patients with particular features)
41: 39 / 18 / 15 / 14 / 11 / 7 / 5 / 4 / 4 / 2
(100): (95) / (44) / (37) / (34) / (27) / (17) / (12) / (10) / (10) / (5)

- According to epidemiology studies, the 41 suspected cases are all the workers from Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building. Out of 41 cases, 40 are laboratory workers on the 4th-7th floors.
* One is from research laboratory for professors

Case distribution: location (floor, room numbers), incidence (percentages)
Category 3rd floor, 318
Patients 1
Workers 1
Incidence -
Category 4th floor / 406-1 / 407 / 409
Patients 3 / 4 / 2
Workers 6 / 14 / 16
Incidence 50 / 29 / 13
Category 5th floor / 502 / 503 / 504 / 505
Patients 1 / 8 / 8 / 3
Workers 7 / 13 / 12 / 14
Incidence 14 / 62 / 67 / 21
Category 6th floor, 602
Patients 1
Workers 15
Incidence 7
Category 7th floor / 708 / 708-2 / 708-3 / 710-1
Patients 3 / 4 / 2 / 1
Workers 5 / 8 / 5 / 3
Incidence 60 / 50 / 40 / 33

70 individuals who are living with the 41 suspected patients show no signs of respiratory symptoms or fever.
Since there are no confirmed cases in close contacts, there is low probability that the disease spreads between people, and yet, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of spread.
Clinical symptoms are relatively minor, and non-specific pneumonia findings appear common on chest x-ray.
For the abnormalities found in some lung CT scans, lung tissues are [being] collected for testing.
Specific findings were not found from the result of the human samples test (conducted until 30 Oct 15) for 16 species of bacterial and viral pathogens.
* 4 were confirmed to be positive for rhinovirus, but currently it is a common virus, so that they have low relevance to Konkuk University respiratory disease.
In addition, there are no unusual cases confirmed until now as a result of monitoring specifically on the building entrants.
KCDC are investigating and taking necessary steps to find the cause and manage the respiratory disease.
KCDC will actively cooperate with relevant ministries and academic-medical specialists, and will plan to inform the public and the media often.

Daily update on the outbreak:
83 individuals who are living with the 49 suspected patients show no signs of respiratory symptoms or fever.
In order to identify the risk factors and trace the routes of disease transmission, the KCDC will proceed bacterial and viral testing by collecting patient samples from the building.
* Case control study: epidemiological studies that compare the group (patients) with specific disease and the group (controlled) without the disease
Patient group: suspected patients
Control group: workers from the building without symptoms

Clinical aspects: symptoms proceed relatively lightly, and non-specific pneumonia findings appear common on chest x-ray.
For the abnormalities found in some lung CT scans, lung tissues are collected for pathological tests.
Specific findings were not found from the result of the human samples test (conducted until 31 Oct 2015) for 16 species of bacterial and viral pathogens.
* 4 were confirmed to be positive for rhinovirus, but currently it is a common virus, so that they have low relevance to Konkuk University respiratory disease.
In addition to 964 existing students and the faculty from the department of Animal Life Science, 508 students from other departments who take classes in the building are currently monitored (a total of 1472).
So far, unusual cases are not confirmed from the result of monitoring.
* The system to encourage 527 applicants of the SK Group employment exam to report to the KCDC Call Center (109) is retained.
The KCDC are investigating and taking necessary steps to find the cause and manage the respiratory disease.
The KCDC will actively cooperate with relevant ministries and academic-medical specialists, and will plan to inform the public and the media often.

Report on the 5th day respiratory disease investigation arising from Konkuk University:
KCDC (director, Yang Byung Guk) said as of 2 Nov 2015, a total of 76 cases (cumulative) were reported in relation to Konkuk University's respiratory disease outbreak. Out of 76, 50 were confirmed to have chest X-ray findings of pneumonia; they are classified as suspected patients and are being treated in isolation at 7 medical facilities.
* Suspected patients: people who visited Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building after 8 Oct 2015 with fever of 37.5 C [99 F] and chest x-ray findings of pneumonia.
* After results of chest X-rays, cases that do not meet the classification as suspected cases: 26
* Cases that are waiting to be classified without taking chest x-rays because they have minor symptoms: 0
50 suspected inpatients have a symptom [syndrome?] of acute atypical pneumonia, and there are no severe cases. After hospitalized, 19 patients show improvement in symptoms.

Epidemiology studies: time and place of occurrence, and the contacts of 50 suspected cases were conducted for basic data analysis.
The date of the 1st suspected case is 19 Oct 2015, and the outbreak occurred intensively in between 25-27 Oct 2015 (29 cases, 58 per cent of total cases)
After the building shutdown, occurrence of new cases decreased.

Daily update on the outbreak (28 Oct 2015: building shutdown):
Place of occurrence: the 50 suspected cases are all the workers from Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building. 50 are laboratory workers on the 3rd -7th floor.
It is estimated that the outbreak happened because they were exposed to contaminants through laboratory environment.
* Number of laboratories in the building: 24 (a total of 234 workers, subject to monitoring)

Daily update on the outbreak:
87 individuals who are living with the 50 suspected patients show no sign of respiratory symptoms or fever.
Since there are no confirmed cases in close contacts, there is low probability that the disease spreads between people, and yet, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of spread.
In order to identify the cause of the outbreak and trace the routes of disease transmission, KCDC will proceed with a case control study.
On 1 Nov 2015, a group of patients (suspected patients) were surveyed. On 2 Nov 2015, controlled group (the building workers without symptoms) were investigated with the same survey, and it is planned to compare the 2 groups.

Clinical aspects: at the initial stage, mild symptoms such as fever, muscle pain appeared; and respiratory symptoms showed relatively rare pneumonia findings

Clinical features
Total: Fever / Chills / Muscle pain / Headache / Cough / Body ache / Sputum / Chest ache / Sore throat / Diarrhea
(number (percentage) of patients with particular features)
50: 48 / 22 / 20 / 18 / 16 / 10 / 7 / 4 / 4 / 2 / 1 /- /
(100): (96) / (44) / (40 ) / (36) / (32) / (20) / (14) / (8) / (8) / (4) / (2)

Non-specific pneumonia findings appear common on chest x-ray
After hospitalization, 48 cases showed symptoms of fever initially; but now only 2 remain with fever. It is estimated that the disease has low severity since its progression is relatively slow.
* 2 out of 50 suspected patients who did not show symptoms of a fever initially:
Case 1: (initial) headache, muscle aches, chills, (currently) no fever, improvement in symptoms, improvement in pneumonia findings.
Case 2: (initial) cough, headache, (currently) no fever, but the presence of symptoms and pneumonia findings
For the abnormalities found in some lung CT scans, lung tissues are collected for testing.
Pathogen test: There is 90 per cent progress on genetic and antibody testing for the 7 kinds of bacteria and 9 kinds of virus of all the suspected patients. Brucellosis, Q fever, legionellosis shall be reassayed through secondary antibody inspection after 3 weeks.
In addition, the test for fungal culture is in progress for 30 suspected patients using the remaining samples after bacteria and virus scan. This may take a few days to few months, and it usually takes 2 to 4 weeks of observation.
Environmental studies: environmental samples were collected from inside the building, which is currently under investigation (started 28 Oct 2015), and it will take about 2 weeks.
On the other hand, another 192 students from other departments who entered the building are currently monitored by the KCDC Call Center (109) (a total of 1664).
* Number of people who are subjected to be monitored: (30 Oct 2015) 964; (31 Oct 2015) 1472; (1 Nov 15) 1664
87 individuals who are living with the 50 suspected patients are being monitored by public health center for unusual symptoms.
So far, unusual cases are not confirmed from the result of monitoring.
* The system to encourage 527 applicants of the SK Group employment exam to report to the KCDC Call Center (109) is retained.
KCDC are investigating and taking necessary steps to find the cause and manage the respiratory disease.
KCDC will actively cooperate with relevant ministries and academic-medical specialists, and will plan to inform the public and the media often.

[The translations were requested of colleagues in Seoul by ProMED-mail consultant, Daniel Lucey, MD of Georgetown University and Jayoung Park. ProMED-mail would like to thank volunteer Korean subscribers for assisting with translations of the daily South Korean MOH reports.

As of today (2 Nov 2015), the latest tally of cases of an acute febrile illness with chest x-ray findings of pneumonia at Konkuk University is 50. All cases have been hospitalized in isolation, but all apparently have mild illness. 96 per cent had fever (temperature above 37.5 C) (99 F), but we are not told the height of the fever. Only 32 per cent had a cough, and only 14 per cent had a cough productive of sputum. We are not told if any had difficulty breathing. Though we are told 8 per cent had "chest aches", we are not told if the chest pain was pleuritic in nature.

The 1st reports of the outbreak at Konkuk University said only graduate students in the veterinary school were affected, but now the affected individuals are only characterized as "workers" in the university's Animal Life Sciences Building; however, we are not told the nature of their work. The outbreak has involved workers on the 3rd-7th floors, but the attack rates were usually highest among workers on the 5th and 7th floors.

There are an additional 26 cases who were in the Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building after 8 Oct 2015 with fever, but apparently failed to have radiographic evidence of pneumonia. There has been no evidence of secondary spread among contacts of the patients.

The 1st case became symptomatic on 19 Oct 2015, and the outbreak intensified between 25 and 27 Oct 2015 (29 cases, 58 per cent of total cases). The Animal Life Sciences building was closed on 28 Oct 2015 and there have been no new cases in the past 2 days. So far, no etiologic agent has been identified. We await further reports of the investigation.

Konkuk University is a private university located in Seoul and Chungju. Gyeonggi Province surrounds Seoul. Chungju is a city in North Chungcheong Province, which is south east of Seoul.
