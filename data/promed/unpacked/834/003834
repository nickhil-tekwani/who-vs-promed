The World Health Organization (WHO) warns a spike in the number of measles cases globally is putting hard-won progress toward the elimination of this highly contagious, deadly disease at risk. Measles immunizations have saved more than 21 million lives globally since 2000.

But, unveiling a new report, WHO says multiple outbreaks of this killer disease since 2016 have caused an estimated 110 000 deaths in all regions of the globe. In addition, WHO's director of immunization, vaccines and biologicals, Martin Friede, says there has been a very worrying jump of more than 30% in reported measles cases worldwide.

"We are seeing sustained measles transmission in countries that had previously not seen measles transmission for many years. So, the countries had eliminated measles, but it has now been re-established in the country. This is very worrying. This suggests that we are actually regressing in certain cases," Friede said.

The report finds the Americas, the eastern Mediterranean region, and Europe have experienced the greatest surges in cases, with the western Pacific the only region where the number of cases has fallen. But, it notes the biggest increases continue to be in areas with low immunization coverage where measles is endemic. For instance, the report finds a 2-fold increase in cases of the disease in Africa.

Health officials attribute the growth of measles cases to a sense of complacency, especially in industrialized countries where the disease has not been seen for many years. They also warn the spread of falsehoods and misinformation, such as the debunked link between measles vaccinations and autism, discourages many parents from immunizing their children against the disease.

Measles cases worldwide jumped more than 30% last year [2017] compared with 2016. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) on Friday [30 Nov 2018] reported a big jump in measles cases in the Americas in 2018, with Brazil surpassing crisis-hit Venezuela as the nation with the most confirmed cases.

As of 30 Nov 2018, the region has seen 16 766 confirmed cases, but more than half of those have been reported in the past month, the UN agency said in its regular update on the situation. Brazil now has nearly 10 000 confirmed cases, but more than three-quarters of them were reported since October [2018]. The vast majority of cases have been reported in Amazonas state, the PAHO said. A total of 13 people have died of measles in the vast South American country.

In Venezuela, which is in the throes of a major economic crisis that has led to widespread shortages of medicine, there have been more than 6300 cases confirmed in 2018 -- and more than 70 deaths.

PAHO is the regional arm of the World Health Organization, which on Thursday [29 Nov 2018] reported a more than 30% spike in measles cases worldwide in 2017 compared with 2016. PAHO urged Latin American countries to work harder on vaccination campaigns in at-risk areas and border zones.

[Before the 1990s, measles was a major cause of infant mortality in Brazil, along with its Central and South American neighbours. The country faced epidemics every 2 years: In 1991, Brazil registered 61 400 measles cases, resulting in 475 deaths.

Measles elimination programmes began in 1992, during which more than 47 million people between 9 months and 14 years of age were vaccinated in just over a month, resulting in 96% vaccine coverage. The number of cases fell dramatically and immediately, resulting in an 81% reduction in the number of cases of the disease across the country. This led to "measles-free" status. But recently, outbreaks in Venezuela are spilling over into northern Brazil. In October 2018, among the confirmed cases, 66.1% were Venezuelans, 33.2% were Brazilians and 0.6% were from Guyana and Argentina. Among Brazilians, 55% of the cases occurred among children from 6 months to 4 years of age.

Brazil has successfully eradicated smallpox (1971), poliomyelitis (1989), measles (2016) and maternal and neonatal tetanus (2017). But the current measles situation is cause for concern (excerpted from https://www.vaccinestoday.eu/stories/measles-in-brazil-an-unwelcome-return/). - Mod.LK

A case of measles was reported at an East Ramapo elementary school on Friday [30 Nov 2018]. This marks the 1st report of measles at a public school during the Rockland County outbreak that began in October [2018].

"Yesterday, the Rockland County Department of Health (RCDOH) notified the East Ramapo Central School District and administrators at Hempstead Elementary School of a confirmed case of measles within that school." John Lyon, communications director for County Executive Ed Day, told The Journal News/Lohud today [1 Dec 2018] by e-mail.

Students were sent home Friday [30 Nov 2018] with a letter warning that the measles outbreak had reached their school. The letter warned parents and guardians that a single case of measles was confirmed and told them to be on the lookout for measles symptoms.

Lyon said the Health Department notified the school and asked for more information about vaccination efforts. "RCDOH instructed the school, through a letter, to monitor the students for signs and symptoms of measles, and asked for a list of every student's immunization status," Lyon wrote. The school will not need to keep any students from going to school, Lyon said.

"RCDOH was notified of the case after the 21-day incubation period had ended, so no students will need to be excluded at this time," Lyon wrote. "From previous records, it is known that Hempstead Elementary School has a very high rate of immunization."

The Rockland outbreak reached 87 confirmed cases and 7 suspected as of Friday [30 Nov 2018], county officials said. Students at private schools were stricken in the early stages of the outbreak, with patients primarily in Spring Valley, New Square and Monsey. But shoppers at the Palisades Center mall and 2 places in Spring Valley may have been exposed over Thanksgiving weekend [23-25 Nov 2018].

At the end of September 2018, an international traveler arrived in Rockland County, New York, with a suspected case of the measles. Per protocol, the Rockland County Department of Health (RCDOH) was notified and immediately activated its Communicable Disease Team to investigate. There have been additional cases of measles from international travelers to Rockland County, exposing more people to measles. People who are unvaccinated risk getting infected with measles and spreading it to others.

These cases are presently clustered in eastern Ramapo (New Square, Spring Valley, Monsey); however, because of Rockland County's small geographic size, exposure to the measles may occur anywhere in the county.

Because measles is highly contagious, the health department, with additional support from the New York State Department of Health and local partners, is working to limit exposures and offer free vaccines to boost the county's immunization rate and protect its residents from the harmful effects of the measles virus. The RCDOH, Refuah Health Center, and private pediatricians and family doctors have administered more than 6100 doses of the MMR vaccine.

A school near the border in Tak's Mae Ramat district has been closed indefinitely after public health officials found 13 students contagious with measles. A total of 6 students from New Road Learning Centre are in serious condition in hospital. Most of the school's students are Myanmar children, and many have never been vaccinated. Health officials have advised parents to keep children at home if they show any measles symptoms.
