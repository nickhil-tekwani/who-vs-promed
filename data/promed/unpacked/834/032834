Since the beginning of 2022, 22 episodes of botulism have been registered in Kyrgyzstan, the head of the Office for Supervision over Food Safety and Prevention of Nutritional Diseases of the Department for Disease Prevention and State Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance of the Ministry of Health Azamat Imakeev said at a press conference. According to him, 31 people have fallen ill in total. He added that most often a person gets affected with botulism when eating home-canned products.

Botulism is an acute infectious disease caused by the specific action of _Clostridium botulinum_ neurotoxin, the strongest known toxin. The incubation period is from 8 hours to 10 days. The 1st and most constant symptoms of botulism are fatigue, dizziness, and dry mouth. The central nervous system, the muscles of the neck and limbs are affected.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1). In Eastern Europe, many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish.
