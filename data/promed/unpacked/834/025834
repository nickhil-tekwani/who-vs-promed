[The report at the above URL includes a map,
which shows that the disease is already present
in 4 out of Morocco's 7 provinces. This may be an
indication that the epizootic started much
earlier than the date mentioned in the report,
namely 12 Jun 2008.

Mass vaccination, involving all small ruminants,
is the only practical control measure in such a
situation.

It will not surprise if the disease is found in
other Maghreb country(ies); surveillance, at
least in neighboring Algeria, deserves to be
considered the earliest. - Mod.AS]
