The Government has given warning that wild birds migrating to Britain
over the next few weeks may be carrying the H5N1 strain of avian flu.
Debby Reynolds, the Chief Veterinary Officer, is ready to order poultry
to be kept indoors if farms are deemed to be at risk. A risk
assessment published by the Department for Environment, Food, and
Rural Affairs [DEFRA] states that the highest risk is from birds that
have passed through the Czech Republic, Germany, and France. Last
month [June 2007] there were 3 outbreaks of the flu strain in the
Czech Republic, and 3 cases in southern Germany. There was also an
outbreak in France this month [July 2007], and experts expect more
cases.
The greatest threat is believed to be from the black-headed gull,
which returns to Britain from the area around the Baltic Sea. About
50 000 to 100 000 pairs of these gulls breed in the Czech Republic
before leaving for other parts of Western Europe, including Britain.
These birds could appear this month [July 2007]. The other imminent
threat is from the mallard, which will start returning to Britain
next month [August 2007]. Mallards breed in large numbers throughout
Europe, with 25 000 to 45 000 pairs in the Czech Republic and 200 000
to 400 000 pairs in Germany.
The experts do not yet know which bird species is spreading the
virus, but they believe that several species will move to Britain
from infected areas.
Customs officers are making secret checks on [presumably commercial -
MHJ] flights from affected areas. Sniffer dogs are being used at
Heathrow and Gatwick [airports] to identify illegal imports of
poultry meat, cooked and raw, and eggs that may carry the H5N1 virus.
Among the flights [from which] passengers and baggage being screened for
possible smuggled food are those from China, Russia, Egypt, Thailand,
and Viet Nam.

[To reach the UK these species will overfly a number of intervening
countries, which may also find it of value to monitor if they are
harbouring HPAI & LPAI virus strains, and if so, in what percentage. -

Epidemiological situation of avian influenza (AI) in Germany
Bulletin Nr.06/2007
------------------------------------------------------------
Results of AI surveillance in wild birds:
So far during 2007, 240 wild birds have been found AI positive. Of
these, 72 were found H5N1 positive by the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Federal Research Institute for Animal
Health on the Island of Riems, while 168 wild birds were found
H5-positive by veterinary laboratories elsewhere. Though, for
technical reasons, their neuraminidase component was not analysed,
there are epidemiological grounds to assume that these birds were also
infected by the HPAI H5N1 virus.
