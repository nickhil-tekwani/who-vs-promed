Tropica north Queensland faced increasingly frequent dengue fever
outbreaks, a doctor warned today as another epidemic took hold.
2 Torres Strait women are in intensive care in Cairns with dengue
haemorrhagic fever, the potentially deadly form of the mosquito-borne
disease; 37 cases of dengue have been diagnosed in the Torres Strait and 5
have been detected in Townsville, amid fears the disease could spread further.
Cairns Base Hospital emergency medicine director Peter Pereira said the
disease re-emerged in the north in the 1980s after a 30-year absence. Since
then, there have been 15 outbreaks. "That's basically parallel with the
increase of tourism in the area," Dr Pereira said. "Dengue has to be
imported to Australia each time, so it comes from travellers from places
like Papua New Guinea or South East Asia. "That's why I believe it is
something that is going to happen increasingly frequently as we attract
more and more tourists into the area."
Dr Pereira said the chances of developing the potentially fatal form of the
disease increased 15-fold for people who had suffered more than one strain.
"We've had dengue[types] 1, 2 & 3 in north Queensland over the past few
years, so there's only one more strain to have," he said. "With more and
more travellers coming from different parts of the world, obviously the
variety of strains will increase."
An outbreak earlier this year in Cairns led to more than 450 cases.

An outbreak of dengue fever in Menggatal, about 20 km from Kota Kinabalu,
has caused much concern among its residents, but extra measures have been
taken by the State Health Department to prevent it from spreading.
Some 18 cases of suspected dengue fever were reported since 25 Sep 2003,
but only 5 tested positive, Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Musa Aman said.
Musa said all the cases involved residents from various villages around
Menggatal and that all patients had been discharged.
"The State Health Department is also taking preventive measures such as
fogging and making checks on premises. We have the situation under control
and the people need not worry or panic," Musa said after being briefed by
Health Department deputy director Dr Yusof Ibrahim at his office in Wisma
Innoprise.
Musa added that Sabah was one of the States with the lowest dengue fever
rates in the country, with 600 incidents this year including 3 deaths in
Penampang, Pitas and Tawau, all involving babies.
Dr Yusof said the 5 who were diagnosed to be dengue-positive were in the
early stages of the fever known as classical dengue, which is not dangerous.

Dengue affects 33 Lucena barangays
-------------------------------------
In a letter dated 10 Nov 2003, city health officer Wilfredo Frondoza has
informed Mayor Ramon Talaga Jr. of Lucena City that in the surveillance
report of the city health office field operations, there are 136 listed
dengue cases in September and October [2003] out of the total 228 [sic: 218
below] cases from January to October this year.
The mayor of Lucena city is urging the city council to declare under a
state of calamity the 33 barangays here owing to a dramatic increase of the
number of dengue cases from September to October [2003]. He is also asking
the Sangguniang Panlungsod for the passage of an ordinance realigning PHP 1
million [USD 18 000] out of the calamity fund to be used in the purchase of
fogging machines.
The latest report on dengue cases in this city showed that from January to
15 Nov 2003 there were 218 listed suspected cases of dengue, 31 confirmed.
It included the death of a 7-year-old boy from barangay Dalahican.
