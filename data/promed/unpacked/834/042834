4 cases of botulism reported in Volgograd
-----------------------------------------------
4 cases of botulism were reported in Volgograd, Russia, one with a fatal
outcome. The affected persons were admitted to the Krasnooktyabrskiy and
Sovetskiy hospitals on 19 May 2004. According to the Sanitary
Epidemiological Surveillance Center's Hygiene Department chief, Igor
Krasnov, all 4 of the patients ate dried fish bought from the "Petrovskiy"
shop. On Tue 25 May 2004, a 73-year-old woman died from the poisoning.
Another young 20-year-old woman is currently in serious condition in the
intensive care unit. The condition of 2 other patients -- a 53-year-old
man, and a 73-year-old man -- is estimated, by physicians, to be
satisfactory. So far, the precise cause of poisoning has not been
identified. Nevertheless, health officials are warning people to avoid
buying fish from the "Petrovskiy" shop.

[The method of diagnosis of botulism is not stated here. Individual cases
of the paralysis can be confused with other diseases, but a cluster of such
cases is certainly likely to be botulism. Type E botulism is the type
frequently associated with fish products. Botulinum toxin is considered to
be one of the category-A biowarfare agents by the US CDC.
Classically, botulism is a food-borne disease caused by the ingestion of
preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _C.
botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the
spores germinate in the intestinal tract). In the USA, infant botulism is
the most common form of the disease. Inhalation botulism, or, food/water
deliberate contamination, may be biowarfare events. An accidental exposure
of lab workers to aerosolized toxin occurred in the early 1960s in Germany
(1). probably due, in part, to a sub-lethal dose. Lethal disease has been
caused in primates exposed to a botulinum toxin aerosol (2).
