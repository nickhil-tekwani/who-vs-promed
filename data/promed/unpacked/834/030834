Hong Kong: mystery infection is neither SARS nor influenza
----------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Hong Kong are investigating the outbreak of a
mysterious respiratory illness in a hospital that has infected 28 children.
Tests conducted late last week [2nd week of November 2004] showed the
children were not infected with SARS coronavirus or influenza virus. "We
will see if they need to be further isolated, and to see if we need staff
reinforcements," Health Minister York Chow told reporters on Monday [15 Nov
2004].
The children are all long term residents at 2 wards in the Caritas Medical
Center, a hospital for mentally handicapped children. 4 more children
developed fever and symptoms of respiratory infection on Mon 15 Nov 2004.
An 11 year old girl, who had chronic medical problems, died of a chest
infection in the same hospital on 9 Nov 2004, but authorities have yet to
confirm whether the girl died of the same disease now afflicting the other
children. "Tests on the children have turned up negative for SARS
coronavirus, influenza A virus, and influenza B virus, and other
respiratory related diseases. We are still checking," a health department
spokeswoman said.
Some local newspapers have sharply criticized the government for its
handling of the case, which evoked memories of health disasters that have
dogged Hong Kong in recent years, including SARS and the deadly H5N1 bird
flu. Hong Kong was badly hit by severe acute respiratory syndrome last year
[2003]. This new disease, which originated in southern China, infected
nearly 1800 people in Hong Kong, killing 299 of them. Inquiries into the
outbreak highlighted deficiencies in the health care system and a poor
chain of command.
