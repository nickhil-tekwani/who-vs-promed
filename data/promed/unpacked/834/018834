As of 4 Sep 2001 the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) Oslo,
Norway has reported a total of 19 cases (17 confirmed by urinary antigen
detection and 2 probable cases) including 2 deaths in Stavanger on the west
coast of Norway.
The first patient presented with symptoms on 26 Jul 2001, while the latest
case presented with symptoms on 1 Sep 2001. All the patients had visited a
limited area of the center of Stavanger within 10 days of the onset of
symptoms.
Local health authorities in collaboration with NIPH have identified several
possible sources of legionellosis within this area, including a water
fountain situated in a park and several cooling towers. Results from
samples taken from these possible sources are pending. The fountain in
question has been closed down and all cooling towers in the vicinity have
been disinfected.
WHO encourages those who have information regarding possible cases in
persons who may have been in Stavanger during this period to contact
directly one of the following:
