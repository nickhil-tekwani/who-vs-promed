Norwegian island may hold clues to flu virus.

A Canadian-led research team is hoping a tiny graveyard on a remote
Norwegian island may hold the secret to a flu virus that ravaged the world
earlier this century, killing tens of millions of people. The team will
fly to Norway this month to probe the graves of seven young miners who
succumbed to the so-called Spanish flu in the autumn of 1918. They hope
the bodies -- buried in the small mining town of Longyearbyen, north of
the Arctic Circle -- still hold traces of the lethal virus and can provide
clues to fighting future epidemics.

The first known case of Spanish flu was reported in March 1918 at a U.S.
military camp in Kansas. The virus spread quickly through the United
States and then to Europe as U.S. troops arrived for the final battles of
the World War I. By autumn it had swept through every continent, killing
between 20 million and 40 million people, including the seven young
Norwegian miners. Aside from a painful death -- the victims essentially
drowned from too much fluid in their lungs -- the Spanish flu's favorite
target made it unique. Unlike other viruses, which targeted the
elderly or children with weak immune systems, the Spanish flu tended to
kill young,
healthy adults. The seven Longyearbyen miners were between 19 and 27
years old. Since nobody kept a sample of the virus in 1918, the researchers
hope to unlock its genetic code from tissue samples and compile information to
help prevent similar outbreaks in the future.

This month, the research team will chart the graves and use special radar
to determine if the bodies were buried deep enough to have remained frozen
for the past eight decades. If the bodies have stayed frozen, the team
will return next year to excavate the site and take core samples of frozen
tissue from the bodies. Since there is a chance the virus itself could be
revived if the tissue was thawed, the scientists will wear special suits
and take other precautions to protect themselves.

[A previous ProMED-mail posting has referred us to Science, 275:1793-1796,
1997 reporting the work of Taubenberger et al. who partially sequenced the
1918 influenza virus genome using RT-PCR amplification of RNA extracted
from a formalin fixed lung tissue sample. Their results are consistent
with the long-suspected H1N1 swine flu identity of the 1918 virus. I
believe that previous attempts to isolate intact virus from permafrost
samples have not been successful, so this experiment could yield
interesting results. -Mod ES
