1. On Monday, 28 Jan 2008, suspected clinical cases of FMD were
reported from the beef cattle herd of Kibbutz Snir.
2. A sample was collected and sent to the Department of Virology at
the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit Dagan, where FMD virus was
isolated.
3. The affected herd has been put under quarantine.
4. An area in a radius of approximately 15 km around the affected
location has been declared infected (a detailed description and a map
are included). Animal movement restrictions and other relevant
control measures are being applied within the said area.

[Snir, a kibbutz in the upper Galilee, northeast Israel, adjacent to
the Golan heights, is about 2 km from the Lebanese border and about
15 km from the Syrian border. Its location can be seen in square 1 of
the interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.htm>
(go to: x = 468.95, y = 134). The beef herd is a grazing one.

From a reliable source, we have information on recent FMD outbreaks in
southern Lebanon; official information and details are requested.

FMD is known to have a seasonal pattern in Israel, with primary
outbreaks expected during January-February, peaking April-May. Most
of the outbreaks begin in the north (Hazafon district), on Israel's
frontiers with Lebanon and Syria. Interestingly, this area is rife
with wild boar. These animals have been suspected to play a
yet-to-be-quantified role in the seasonal dissemination of the virus,
though they are not regarded to be FMDV carriers.

Young, pre-vaccinated beef cattle in Snir were found infected also in
the past.

To our knowledge, the current virus has been serotyped as FMDV O. - Mod.AS]

[2] South Israel, threat

Israeli veterinary experts who have seen in the media the pictures
taken at the border between the Gaza strip and Egypt (Sinai), showing
sheep and cattle crossing into the Gaza strip by cranes, cars and by
foot, have expressed their concerns about the possible introduction
of animal diseases currently prevailing in Egypt, such as FMD, avian
influenza and RVF. "The 1st to be affected are the settlements around
the Gaza strip," said a security source; we had a similar spread
about 2 years ago, with grave outcome" [This relates to the
introduction of lumpy skin disease. - Mod.AS].

The said concerns have led to a meeting, held today [Wed 30 Jan 2008]
between the Israeli and Palestinian Chief Veterinary Officers. It was
agreed that samples from suspected animals in the Gaza strip will be
delivered to Israel's central Veterinary Institute [Kimron] at
Beit-Dagan to identify possible infectious diseases threatening
animals or humans.

One of the main concerns in relation to the possible introduction,
via Gaza, of animal diseases from Egypt is the new FMD strain
circulating there since 2006, identified by the World FMD Reference
laboratory WRL at Pirbright as serotype A, topotype Africa.

In addition, recently (in October 2007), the WRL identified in Egypt
FMDV serotype O-GD, topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia 2.

The Gaza strip is suspected to be endemically infected by lumpy skin
disease at least since 2006 and probably earlier. - Mod.AS]
