[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.1.18 "Rift Valley Fever (Infection with Rift Valley Fever virus)", from which the following commentary is quoted, (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf; adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2016):

"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the Phenuiviridae family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease.

There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an unapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality and abortion occurs and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.

Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures. It is recommended that laboratory workers be vaccinated if possible.

RVFV is endemic in many African countries and may involve several countries in the region at the same time or progressively expand geographically over the course of a few years. In addition to Africa, large outbreaks have been observed in the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean Islands. These generally, but not exclusively, follow the periodic cycles of unusually heavy rainfall, which may occur at intervals of several years, or the flooding of wide areas favoring the proliferation of mosquitoes".
