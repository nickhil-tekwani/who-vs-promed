BACTERIAL WILT, BANANA - BURUNDI: FIRST REPORT

A disease affecting banana plants has spread to 5 provinces of
Burundi, raising concern among agricultural officials who fear the
disease could hit the country's food security.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, "Banana Xanthomonas Wilt"
was 1st detected in November 2010 in Cankuzo province near the border
with Tanzania. In January 2011, the disease was reported in the
eastern province of Ruyigi and Makamba in the south; the disease has
also been identified at Cibitoke and Bujumbura Rural provinces.

The Food and Agriculture Organization said that the disease is now
confirmed and has spread to 5 provinces within 6 months. It will not
only mean great problems for farmers but also a socio-economic problem
for Burundi.

The disease spreads slowly in some banana varieties, especially those
that grow in the highlands. However, no variety resists the disease.
The banana variety grown in Cibitoke, Makamba and Rutana can be
totally decimated in a few months.

Agricultural officials are making the population aware of the best
field practices. Farmers have been encouraged to remove male buds
since insects can spread the disease [up] to 60 km in one day. Once a
banana field is infected, the only remedy is to cut off all the
infected plants.

Farmers have also been advised not to re-plant bananas on the same
land within 6 months and to use clean field tools and planting
materials. The Burundian government plans to distribute at least 750
000 selected bananas shoots in September [2011] to ensure that farmers
have plants free from the disease.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of
banana bacterial wilt in central Africa (BXW; bacterial wilts due to
_Ralstonia_ species are present elsewhere). It affects all banana
types causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit. An incidence of
70-80 percent in many plantations and yield losses of up to 90 percent
have been reported.

The bacteria survive in soil and plant debris and are mainly spread
via infected planting material, by insects, mechanical means, and
contaminated tools. A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen
reservoirs. An integrated approach is needed for disease management,
including cultural methods (such as crop rotation), use of certified
clean material for replanting, as well as phytosanitation to reduce
inoculum and prevent re-introduction and plant-to-plant spread of the
pathogen.

BXW 1st appeared in Uganda in 2001 (ProMED-mail post 20020105.3162)
and has been spreading in the region since then. According to the
Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) it
is present in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and DR Congo.
Now Burundi has to be added to the list.
