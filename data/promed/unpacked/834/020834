A change in sanitary regulations benefits Uruguayan beef
--------------------------------------------------
The changes proposed by the Animal Health Code Commission of the Office
International des Epizooties, OIE, (World Organization for Animal Health)
to the standard on Foot and Mouth Disease, which will be submitted for
adoption next May, could benefit exporting countries such as Uruguay,
because they will facilitate the introduction into markets of products such
as beef, when reaching the status of free country with vaccination.
The current listing of animal diseases into Lists A and B within the
International Animal Health Code will be eliminated to create a single list
of notifiable diseases. Dr. Alejandro Thiermann, president of the Animal
Health Code Commission, explained that this is consistent with the WTO-SPS
Agreement and that it would take into account epidemiological events to
determine whether the notification is to be urgent.
For example, if Foot-and-Mouth Disease [FMD] is reported in a state where
it is endemic, the disease is not regarded as urgently notifiable because
the situation is already known. Contrary, if it were to appear in a country
free of the disease, its notification would be considered urgent. The same
urgency will be applicable if the behavior of the disease changed and it
began to affect a different host, or exhibits a different epidemiological
pattern.
The OIE is also trying to discourage a country from accelerating its
request for recognition as "free of the disease without vaccination", when
regional conditions are not ready for maintaining this status.
Based on the proposed changes that would be approved in May, the
credibility of a country and of its veterinary services and surveillance
and monitoring system, will carry increasing weight.
"It is important to focus on the quality and credibility of veterinary
services, rather than on any country's status regarding presence of a
disease. Today, there are countries that declare themselves free of the
disease, not having the ability to detect it. The OIE does not have the
judicial power to impose sanitary sanctions" and, therefore, it cannot
punish countries that are not transparent in their animal health reports.
Thiermann estimates that "with time, both importing and exporting countries
will begin to value the transparency and honesty in communications."

[The said article has been slightly modified following comments and
clarifications obtained from Dr. Thiermann, for which ProMED-mail is grateful.
The proposed changes in the International Animal Health Code are
significant. They are expected to improve the rate and quality of disease
reporting by OIE's 162 member countries, and have consequent impact upon
their control measures and upon the international trade in animals and
their products.
Eliminating the lists A and B to produce a single list of notifiable animal
diseases is in line with the Sanitary-Phytosanitary rules of the WTO, as
there will be no different categories of importance of diseases. Currently,
there are 15 diseases in list A and 93 in list B (for details see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/en_classification.htm>).
Another important issue is trying to discourage countries from putting so
much emphasis on recognition of "disease-free" status, which has often led
them to seek this recognition before it is safe -- or before the conditions
in neighboring countries can support disease-free status; there are many
examples. One of them was Uruguay's decision several years ago to stop
vaccination against FMD in order to become an "FMD-free country without
vaccination." Dr Thiermann indicated the wish to focus more on a Code that
is more risk-based.
Regarding the proposed changes to the FMD chapter, the Code Commission is
trying to make changes in the recommendations for trading meat -- though
not for live animals -- from countries FMD-free with vaccination. - Mod.AS]
