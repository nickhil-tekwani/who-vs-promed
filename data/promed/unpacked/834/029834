People are catching Ebola when seeking out treatment for malaria -- experts say there have been 8 times more malaria cases this year [2018] than last [2017] in North Kivu, and aid workers are proactively handing out drugs and mosquito nets to 450 000 residents. In addition, experts say people suffering from Ebola and malaria are becoming mixed up, making it more difficult to control the fast-spreading virus.

The number of people catching malaria has spiked this year [2018] in the North Kivu province where the [Ebola] outbreak is happening -- there are now 2000 cases of malaria a week. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the 2nd worst in the world for malaria, after Nigeria.

Health workers say half of people turning up at medical centres with suspected Ebola virus actually have malaria, but the Ebola outbreak is spreading this way when people go near infected areas. Many children are catching the incurable fever when visiting medical centres with malaria, and half of people suspected of having Ebola actually had malaria.

"It will make things a lot easier if malaria is taken out of the equation," said Stefan Hoyer of the World Health Organization (WHO). Health workers in the city of Beni, at the centre of the [Ebola] outbreak, have launched a 4-day door-to-door blitz to try and stem the flow of malaria cases. Mr. Hoyer said there were no more mosquito-blocking bed nets left in North Kivu, an eastern province that is battling both conflict and disease.

They will be giving out mosquito nets and antimalarial drugs to 450 000 people to stop them going to medical centres where they may catch Ebola. The WHO thinks it can cut Ebola cases in half by separating the 2 groups of patients [Ebola and malaria].

Malaria can normally be diagnosed with a rapid blood test, but the risk of transmitting Ebola through blood means health workers have to rely on an assessment of symptoms, he said. This normally results in an over-reported number of cases, but not as many as 8 times more, Mr. Hoyer added. "We can assume that the suspected Ebola cases to be triaged would at least go down by half," Mr Hoyer said. Of the 422 people thought to have been infected with Ebola during the DRC's outbreak, 375 of those have been confirmed.

The outbreak [Ebola] has been plagued by security problems, with health workers attacked by rebels in districts where the virus has been spreading. Health workers had to be evacuated from their hotel after it was hit by a shell in a nearby armed rebel attack earlier this month [November 2018]. Some 16 WHO staff were taken out of the city of Beni.

The organisation's director general said he heard "heavy gunfire" over the phone, and a shell hit the workers' hotel but did not explode. Violence is common in the central African country and has made it difficult to stop the Ebola outbreak -- earlier in the same week 8 UN peacekeepers and 12 local soldiers died in an ambush.

Armed groups have kidnapped and killed people trying to treat the sick, and ongoing conflict has made locals suspicious of official health workers. WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: "We honour the memory of those who have died battling this outbreak, and deplore the continuing threats on the security of those still working to end it." Because of the difficulties facing health workers, experts have warned the epidemic is likely to rage on into the middle of next year [2019].

A spike in malaria cases is threatening the health of people in parts of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where health workers are also battling an Ebola outbreak. In response, a 4-day mass drug administration campaign was launched today [28 Nov 2018] in the Northern Kivu province town of Beni, with a target to reach up to 450 000 people with antimalarial drugs combined with the distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets.

The malaria control campaign is being led by the DRC National Malaria Control Programme, supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the Global Fund and the US President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). The campaign is modelled after the campaign implemented in Sierra Leone during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which was instrumental in reducing illness and deaths from malaria in the areas reached.

"Controlling malaria is critical in areas like North Kivu, as it causes widespread disease and death, especially among the region's children," says Dr. Yokouide Allarangar, WHO's Representative to the DRC. "This antimalaria campaign will also help reduce the pressure on the overall health system, which is currently striving to protect people from the ongoing Ebola threat in the region."

North Kivu's malaria outbreak has overburdened Ebola responders; many suspected cases of Ebola have turned out to be malaria, as early symptoms of both diseases are similar. Up to 50% of people screened in Ebola treatment centers have been found to have malaria.

Therefore, the antimalaria campaign has 2 main aims. First, the distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets will prevent malaria transmission and its accompanying health consequences, thus saving lives. Second, the mass drug administration will treat people who have already contracted malaria and curtail transmission of malaria among Ebola-affected populations and health centres. Having fewer people present with malaria will lessen the workload on already stretched Ebola treatment centres.

From 2016 to 2017, DRC observed an estimated increase of more than 500 000 malaria cases (24.4 million to 25 million), according to the WHO World malaria report 2018. DRC is the 2nd-leading country in the world for malaria cases, after Nigeria, accounting for 11% of the 219 million cases and 435 000 deaths from malaria in 2017.

In North Kivu province, the area experiencing the brunt of the Ebola outbreak, there has already been an up to 8-fold increase in malaria incidence as of early September 2018 (or approximately 2000 cases registered per week) compared with the same period in 2017. Despite recent improvements in coverage of malaria interventions, DRC continues to experience challenges in access to preventive and curative malaria interventions, as well as an environment that supports high transmission rates. Funding, infrastructure challenges and insecurity are all key obstacles to achieving the intervention coverage needed to protect populations at risk.

North Kivu province is the epicentre of an Ebola outbreak that was announced on 2 Aug [2018] and has caused more than 365 cases and 236 deaths. The town of Beni has been one of the most affected. Political instability, violence, and a refugee and internally displaced people crisis have made the current Ebola outbreak one of the most complex and difficult public health challenges in recent history.

[ProMED thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for alerting us to the report from WHO Africa. The DRC is highly endemic of malaria; therefore, ProMED has not previously reported on malaria there.

The clinical symptoms of Ebola virus infection and _ Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria overlap considerably: high fever, muscle and joint pains, headache and later somnolence. In the laboratory tests, both infections cause thrombocytopenia. Bleeding is rare in malaria, and malaria does not induce a rash. In the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, it was a standard procedure to give all patients a course of antimalaria treatment as soon as Ebola was suspected. - Mod.EP
