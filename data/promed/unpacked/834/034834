[Sporadic cases continue to occur in Saudi Arabia, with 2 reported in today's (28 Jun 2016) update, one from Hufoof in the Eastern Province, and the other from Alaflaj in the south of Riyadh province, approximately 205 miles (330 km) south of Riyadh city. Both of today's newly confirmed cases have been classified as primary cases, (defined as no known history of contact with other known cases), one with a definite history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, the other currently under investigation as to whether there is a history of contact with camels.

It has been 2 days since the last report of a case associated with the nosocomial transmission of the MERS-CoV in Riyadh city.

The locations of today's (28 Jun 2016) newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL.

Hufoof is located in the Eastern Province (also known as Ash SharqÄ«yah). Alaflaj is an oasis in central Riyadh province. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4315196,131. - Mod.MPP]

In response to an RFI (request for information) on the case of MERS-CoV infection reported from Qatar on 13 Jun 2016, we received the following updated information:

A 23-year-old non-national male (Bangladeshi) who works as a camel racer at the Camel Race Track in the Al Shahaniya area, Qatar presented to the Al-Shahaniya Health Center on 8 Jun 2016 with a history of fever, cough, runny nose, and backache. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on RT-PCR (UpE and Orf1a) at the Hamad Medical Corporation virology laboratories on 9 Jun 2016, at which time he was immediately transferred from the Shahaniya Health center to the Hamad Medical Corporation by Emergency Medical Services, where he was kept under full isolation. He did not have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. He does have a history of frequent contact with camels and consuming their raw milk. He also has history of travel to Saudi Arabia with his camels, having arrived back in Doha on 28 May 2016. He is currently in stable condition.

All contacts were identified and monitored for 14 days following their last date of exposure to the case. None of the contacts developed symptoms.

[We are very grateful to our EpiCore members for helping to provide additional information and follow-up on reported cases and outcomes of epidemiologic investigations and control measures. Following the 1st publication of the confirmation of MERS-CoV in this case, another EpiCore Surveillance Project Member provided additional epidemiologic information suggesting the possibility that transmission may have occurred in Saudi Arabia (see prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV (62): Qatar ex Saudi Arabia, additional details 20160614.4287582). Using the Saudi classification, this case would be classified as a primary case with a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Fortunately, there were no secondary cases associated with this case.
