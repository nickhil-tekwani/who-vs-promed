[The paragraph in question in this post states:
"Chronic wasting disease is a highly contagious fatal disease that strikes down hoofed ungulates like deer, moose, and elk. It has been found in 21 states and '4 Canadian provinces', and wildlife officials and hunter advocacy groups say transporting pen-raised deer puts the state's wild deer herd and the USD 2.2 billion that Texas deer hunters spend annually at risk."

The issue is it seems there are not 4 Canadian providences affected. Dr Pybus has provided the following comment.]

"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is known to occur in 2 provinces in Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan), with an historic report of occurrence in a situation involving captive deer in a 3rd province (Ontario). CWD is well-established and expanding its distribution in Alberta and Saskatchewan. There is also an historic report of CWD in a small number of deer in the Toronto Zoo (source identified as a captive mule deer imported from Colorado); however, following immediate and rigorous disease control efforts, there is no evidence that the disease escaped the zoo."
