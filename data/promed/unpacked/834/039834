Growers in the department of Risaralda are worried about the new coffee shoots being affected by a fungus that has been the subject of an alert by the Coffee Growers Federation.

So far, the department has a low disease incidence of around 2 per cent, but it is recommended that farmers keep monitoring their plantations. Spread of the fungus can seriously affect coffee yield. Other parts of the country are also at risk.

[Ojo de gallo (OG; "rooster's eye", American coffee leaf spot disease) is caused by the fungus _Mycena citricolor_. It is found in subtropical and tropical America and affects at least 150 known host species including both arabica and robusta coffee. The fungus is naturally present in
virgin forests from where it is thought to have spread to coffee. OG is a major disease in higher altitude coffee plantations in Latin America with up to 75 per cent yield loss reported.

Symptoms on coffee include brown spots with a yellow halo on leaves and berries, causing them to drop off prematurely. Defoliated trees eventually die. Disease development is favoured by cool, moist conditions. The pathogen is spread by splashing rain, with infected materials or by mechanical means. Once established, eradication is usually impossible because of its wide host range.

Disease management is costly and mainly relies on fungicides. Cultural methods, such as shade control, are sometimes used to reduce losses. No real resistance to OG has been found in coffee, although some cultivars appear to be more susceptible than others. Research on biocontrol using bacterial strains is in progress. This pathogen is a serious quarantine risk for coffee growing areas in other parts of the world, but it is of special scientific interest as a bioluminescent fungus.

In Colombia, ojo de gallo has been identified as a major risk to coffee production and is considered to be on the increase due to climate change (see links below).
