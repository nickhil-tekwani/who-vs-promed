[Classical swine fever (CSF) has been reported to be present in Russia for many years. During 2013, 2 outbreaks have been officially reported.

A look at OIE's 2014 global CSF interactive map (http://tinyurl.com/oj2hqlt) will show the above mentioned new CSF outbreak in domestic pigs in the Bryan province (Bryanskaya oblast), adjacent to the border with Belarus. In addition, 4 previous outbreaks during 2014 are to be seen in the far east (Amur province), 1 in domestic pigs and 3 in wild boars (click on the locations, zoom in).

The 2014 map will show multiple CSF outbreaks in Latvia (all in wild boar), located on the borders with Belarus (Vitebsk province) and Russia (Pskov province). The apparent absence of CSF in wild boar in the adjacent territories in Belarus and Russia may reflect deficient surveillance or underreporting; clarification from both would be helpful. - Mod.AS
