[The current FMD epizootic in North Korea reportedly started on 8 Jan 2014, in the Pyongyang capital city area, affecting swine. So far it has caused a total of 23 outbreaks (see summary report at http://tinyurl.com/qyjlv4m), all in swine farms. As can be seen on the interactive map in the summary report, one cluster of the disease has been recorded in the southern part of North Korea, adjacent to the border with South Korea. Is the causative strain not pathogenic to cattle? Have cattle in North Korea been vaccinated, unlike swine?

The following media report by South Korea's news agency Yonhap, published Wed 26 Mar 2014 (summarised), describes South Korea's response (http://tinyurl.com/osmlp8s):

"South Korea has stepped up quarantine measures after North Korea reported another outbreak of FMD, concentrating its efforts on the border, the South Korean government said Wednesday [26 Mar 2014].

"The ministry has continued to intensify its quarantine efforts in all border areas of Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces since it was notified of an outbreak in North Korea by the OIE in February [2014]," the ministry said. The North reported its 1st outbreak of the animal disease on 19 Feb 2014, over a month after it confirmed outbreaks at farms in Pyongyang and North Hwanghae Province on 8 Jan 2014. South Korea has since offered to provide vaccines and disinfectants to the impoverished North. Pyongyang has so far failed to respond to Seoul's offer."

Earlier reports said the UN Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] had dispatched 3 experts to North Korea to help contain the animal disease."

Genotyping of the FMDV serotype O strain currently spreading in North Korea may help in clarifying its origin and in identifying the vaccine strain(s) to be applied. In June 2011, North Korea submitted a sample of a circulating FMDV O strain for genotyping to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, UK; it was identified as topotype SEA, strain Mya 98. According to WRLFMD data, phylogenetic studies of the FMD viruses belonging to the O/SEA/Mya-98 lineage, detected during 2010 in Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region), China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Mongolia and eastern Russia indicate a close relationship between this virus and those present in Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand in 2009 and point to at least 2 independent virus introductions into the region from Southeast Asia [see ProMED 2011 archive below]. - Mod.AS
