Cruise ship disinfected after Legionnaires' disease appears
Health experts began disinfecting a cruise ship's water system Sunday
after tests showed a high concentration of the bacterium that causes
Legionnaires' disease. About 800 passengers and 400 crew members
disembarked from the SS Edinburgh Castle at this port near Glasgow on
Sunday. They were told to seek medical attention quickly if they developed
any signs of the flu-like illness in the next 10 days, including a fever,
cough, diarrhea, headache, confusion or shortness of breath. The ship was
suspected of carrying the _Legionella_ organism after two passengers on
different cruises -- one in April, the other in June-- contracted
Legionnaires' disease.
Direct Cruises, which operates the ship, said tests for the _Legionella_
organism in the Edinburgh Castle's water supply were done in Liverpool on
June 15 after the second Legionnaires' case was discovered. But there were
technical difficulties, so the tests were repeated on June 21 when the ship
reached Greenock, its next port of call, said Rick Green, operations
manager of Direct Cruises.
Those results, released Wednesday, showed a high concentration of
_Legionella_ in some parts of the water system, he said. At the time, the
ship was cruising in Norway. The captain immediately ordered bottled water
for all passengers and had the water on board heated to the point where 95
percent of the _Legionella_ present would have been killed, Green said. The
company told 900 new passengers who were to board the Edinburgh Castle on
Sunday that their cruise will be delayed and offered compensation if they
decided to cancel.
