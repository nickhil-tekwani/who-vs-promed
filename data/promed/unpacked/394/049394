The Department of Health (DOH) - Center for Health Development 6 (CHD 6)
regional director Lydia-Depra Ramos alerted residents of this city [Iloilo
City] against typhoid fever due to the increasing number of suspected cases
since the start of 2008.

DOH - CHD 6 reported a total of 217 suspected typhoid fever cases with one
confirmed fatality and 3 more deaths subject for further validation in
Iloilo City from 1 Jan to 8 Mar 2008. Data showed that most of the typhoid
fever cases come from the City Proper District, ages ranging from one to 68
years old with a median of 11 years old.

The DOH-CHD 6 Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU)
immediately coordinated with Iloilo City Health Office for a visual
epidemiologic investigation after it was alerted of the increasing number
of suspected cases most particularly in the Waterfront Area in the City
Proper District on 4 Mar 2008.

The environmental survey showed that the area is thickly populated. It also
pointed out the possible sources of infection as the following:
contaminated wells; water from water system due to seepage through leaking
pipes; water sold by water vendors; and possible ingestion of contaminated
food from food establishments and ambulant food vendors.

Contaminated water triggered the outbreak of typhoid fever that has downed
nearly 2000 people and killed a 14 year old girl in Calamba City, health
secretary Francisco Duque III said yesterday [10 Mar 2008]. Tests showed
that the water supplied by the Calamba Water District contained the
salmonella bacteria and did not have enough chlorine to kill the microbes,
he said.

Duque said the number of people with typhoid fever had gone down to 876
from a high of 1800, but the health department could not yet declare that
the outbreak had been contained. The department said earlier it suspected
that the city's reservoir had been contaminated, but officials of Calamba's
water district on Monday [10 Mar 2008] claimed that the city's water was
safe for drinking.

The department is now inspecting the city's water system with a view to
disinfecting infected areas. It urged residents to boil their water and to
use chlorinated water when cooking food.
