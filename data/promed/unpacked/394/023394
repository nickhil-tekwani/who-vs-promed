According to information from the State Health Institute (SZÚ), there are more cases of tick-borne diseases this year [2022] by the end of August than in the same period last year [2021]. Doctors reported 441 cases of tick-borne encephalitis and 2035 cases of Lyme disease this year [2022], last year's [2021] numbers were about a quarter lower for Lyme disease and about 13% lower for encephalitis. At the same time, roughly a third of people become infected every year in autumn.

Ticks are usually found in grassy and leafy vegetation until day or night temperatures permanently drop below 5 degrees Celsius. As a result of global warming, they are also found in the Czech Republic in November and at higher altitudes than was previously common.

Doctors reported 589 cases of tick-borne encephalitis by the end of August 2020, which was the most since 2013. A total of 2429 people were infected with Lyme disease in the same period, there were more in 2016 and 2018, for example. While for other infectious diseases, the number of cases dropped in the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation was the opposite for tick-borne diseases. At the time, experts stated that more people headed to nature at a time when other opportunities for enjoyment, whether sports or culture, were closed.

After returning from the forest, but also from the garden or park, people should therefore always look around. In tick-borne encephalitis, the virus is transmitted from a bitten tick in just a few tens of minutes. The disease, against which vaccination is possible, cannot be stopped. Doctors only suppress its symptoms, such as headaches, high fevers, vomiting, and photophobia, but also brain swelling, as the virus attacks the brain and spinal cord.

"We see long-term and permanent consequences in a number of patients. Frequent headaches, memory and concentration disorders, deterioration or loss of hearing, but also severe, often permanent paralysis of the limbs. Several patients with tick-borne encephalitis die every year," said the doctor in a press release about the suitability of vaccination from the Department of Infectious Diseases of the 2nd Faculty of Medicine of Charles University and Bulovka Faculty Hospital Dita Smíšková.

Lyme disease, against which vaccines are not yet available, is about 5 times more common. However, the virus is transmitted to humans only 24 hours after the tick bite [starts]. The disease is most often treated with antibiotics.

Health insurance companies cover the tick-borne encephalitis vaccine for people over 50 this year [2022]. According to earlier data from the SZÚ, people aged 60 to 64 are the most frequently infected. For young people, the health insurance company reimburses part of the cost of the vaccination from the prevention fund after payment at the doctor's office or at the vaccination center against proof.

Incidence of tick-borne diseases from 2013 to 2022 (January to August):
Year / Tick-borne encephalitis / Lyme disease
2013 / 350 / 2392
2014 / 233 / 2255
2015 / 231 / 1803
2016 / 435 / 2702
2017 / 390 / 2167
2018 / 480 / 2808
2019 / 432 / 2311
2020 / 589 / 2429

[A 2 Jun 2022 report indicated that there is a significant risk of tick-born encephalitis virus and Lyme borreliosis infections this year but without giving case numbers at that time. The above report indicates that there are 441 cases of TBE and 2035 cases of Lyme disease so far this year (2022). Both pathogens are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _ixodes_ ticks and are endemic in the Czech Republic. As previously noted, a 2016 ProMED post indicated that although Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of TBE virus and cases occur there yearly, cases have declined significantly in Austria and remain low in Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, while remaining high in recent years in the Czech Republic (see Tick-borne encephalitis - Czech Republic (02): background 20160210.4009410 and the yearly case numbers in the above report).

The World Health Organization has stated that, "approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total."

"Immunization offers the most effective protection against tickborne encephalitis. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively [and based on European strains of the virus], and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation [and based on Far Eastern strains]. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (https://www.who.int/news/item/19-02-2020-immunization-is-the-best-protection-against-tick-borne-encephalitis)

TBE is a viral infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). - Mod.TY

Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease or LD) is the commonest human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominantly in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. Of the more than 20 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bbsl) complex genospecies, only a few (for example, _B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are human pathogens: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (Bbss) is the predominant cause of LD in North America; Bbss also occurs in Europe, but is less prevalent than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.

The vectors of Bbsl, which feed on both humans and reservoir species are 4 species of hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks: _I. scapularis_ is the main vector of Bbsl for humans in the eastern half of the US; _I. pacificus_, in the far-western US; _I. ricinus_, in Europe; and _I. persulcatus_, in Asia. The Central European region (Austria, Czech Republic, southern Germany, Switzerland, Slovakia, and Slovenia) has been reported to have the highest _Borrelia_ infection rates in _I. ricinus_ ticks (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/); in Switzerland, 13.6 to 49% of ticks were infected. In the Austria/Switzerland region, of positive ticks, 25% were infected with _B. afzelii_, 44% with _B. garinii_, and 25% with Bbss. The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6%) was higher than in nymphs (10.1%).

The clinical manifestations of LD also vary by geographical location. For example, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are commoner in Europe, whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States. Lyme neuroborreliosis is multifaceted, causing symptoms as a result of central and/or peripheral nervous system involvement; LD can cause meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, peripheral neuropathy, and/or encephalopathy.

Individual hard-bodied ixodes ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of the Bbsl complex, as well as multiple other pathogens, including _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Babesia microti_, the cause of babesiosis, _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness, and tick-borne encephalitis virus or TBEV, the cause of tickborne encephalitis (TBE). It is, therefore, possible that co-infections with 2 or more of these tick-borne pathogens may occur. - Mod.ML
