[The outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis included in these updates have the
characteristics of "winter vomiting disease", and are presumed to be caused
by Norwalk-like viruses (i.e., caliciviruses classified in the genus
_Norovirus_), although this is rarely confirmed microbiologically. The UK
and Ireland seem to be particularly prone at present to outbreaks of
"winter-vomiting" disease in institutional settings. - Mod.CP]

Australian Experience
---------------------
Earlier this year in Randwick (a suburb of Sydney, Australia ) some members
of the community, hospitals, and nursing homes in the surrounding areas
experienced a viral gastroenteritis diagnosed at my hospital as human
calicivirus type 2. Many people were affected by this infectious illness.
Symptoms included lower abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, and or nausea.
At 2 of the teaching hospitals infection control strategies included the
mandatory use of a high filtration respiratory masks when caring for
infected cases (the mask is normally used when caring for patients with
tuberculosis), infected staff remained away from work until 48 hours after
the resolution of symptoms, isolation for 48 hours after the resolution of
symptoms of all infected patient cases, and those exposed to the illness
were cohorted or isolated for 72 hours.
At both teaching hospitals we were able to remain open and accept elective
admissions. The attack rate in staff was high when staff were exposed to the
aerosolised vomitus/ fomites of infected patients or the patients were
immunosuppressed. The immuno-suppressed patients excreted for long periods.
A high level of cleaning and disinfection was necessary. We paid particular
attention to the bathrooms (patient and staff and community) and full
personal protective equipment PPE was used by the cleaning staff (including
a high filtration mask).

Scotland: Viral Gastroenteritis Closes Wards in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
------------------------------------------------
So far 3 wards at the old [building of] Edinburgh Royal Infirmary have been
closed to new admissions following an outbreak of the winter vomiting virus
[a calicivirus classified in the genus _Norovirus_, formerly called
"Norwalk-like viruses". - Mod.CP]. The virus has affected 23 patients, more
than half of whom are thought to be elderly. Several staff have also caught
the virus, which causes sickness and diarrhoea, although it is not thought
that any of those infected are in a serious condition.
Hospital bosses are today said to be reviewing the situation in the hope
that 2 of the 3 outbreak-hit wards, which can hold over 90 patients in
total, will be able to reopen soon. It is thought that no new cases have
been reported in either of the 2 wards within the last 24 hours. It has not
yet been confirmed when the third virus-hit ward will be able to reopen to
new admissions. But officials today said that they remain optimistic it will
be sometime next week. Each of the 3 wards at the old infirmary can hold a
maximum of 32 patients.
A spokesman for the hospital today confirmed that there had been an outbreak
of the winter vomiting virus at the Capital's older Royal Infirmary. She
added that the situation was currently "under review" and said a "small
number" of patients had been infected. However, a spokeswoman for Age
Concern today said that the virus outbreak at the hospital was "extremely
concerning." She added: "The important thing now is that this outbreak is
contained and isn't allowed to spread to further wards, and of course that
the people infected with the virus get fast and effective treatment to get
better."
It is not the first time wards have been closed in Edinburgh because of the
virus. Back in January 2002, a care of the elderly ward at Edinburgh's
Liberton Hospital was closed to new patients after 12 people caught the
virus. A total of 21 patients and staff at the Eastern General Hospital also
came down with the virus, which led to 2 wards being closed. At St John's in
Livingston, 2 wards and the stroke unit were also closed to new admissions
for 12 days after 33 patients and 15 staff were affected.
In previous cases, patient watchdog Lothian Health Council and Age Concern
said the outbreaks highlighted the need to improve hygiene standards at
hospitals across the region. The winter vomiting virus first hit the
headlines earlier in 2002 after an outbreak affecting some 300 patients and
staff forced Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary to close its doors to all
non-emergency admissions. Wards were also shut at Stirling Royal Infirmary
and Falkirk Royal Infirmary because of a similar virus outbreak.

Scotland: Wards Closed in Eight Hospitals in the Central Belt
--------------------------------------------------
Yesterday 2 wards at the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow remained closed to
admissions after being shut at the weekend as the winter vomiting virus [a
Norwalk-like virus belonging to the genus _Norovirus_ of the family
_Caliciviridae_. - Mod.CP] continued to sweep hospitals. Though 4 patients
were affected, none was giving cause for concern. Although attacks tend to
be short-lived, the virus is having a disruptive effect on the National
Health Service (NHS) and has proved fatal to some elderly patients. At
Glasgow's Southern General hospital 2 wards also remained closed to
admissions due to the winter vomiting virus. One ward has been closed for a
week and the other since last Wednesday [20 Nov 2002]. But no further
patients were affected yesterday, and the wards are due to reopen if they
remain clear for 48 hours. Meanwhile, one of 3 care of the elderly wards at
Gartnavel General, Glasgow, which were closed at the end of last week, has
re-opened, but 2 medical wards at the city's Royal Infirmary were closed.
Edinburgh Royal, which had 3 wards closed at the weekend, closed a fourth
yesterday, although the number of patients affected had fallen from 23 to
17.
The virus also hit Argyll and Clyde Acute Hospitals Trust over the past 3
weeks, including the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Inverclyde
Royal in Greenock.
Hairmyres Hospital, where an elderly patient died 10 days ago, was still
affected yesterday, with 4 wards closed. But one ward at Wishaw General has
reopened and a second is expected to open tomorrow.

England: Viral Gastroenteritis Outbreak at Blackpool Hotel
-------------------------------------------------
A bus load of Scots holiday-makers has been hit by an outbreak of the winter
vomiting [disease] at their hotel. At least 16 victims were floored by
sickness and diarrhoea during a 3-night break in Blackpool [Lancashire,
north west England]. But they only found out too late that the virus had
been spreading through their hotel for more than a week [prior to their
arrival]. They were horrified when the hotel owner broke the news and
confirmed that the hotel had just been fumigated. Many spent their entire
trip holed up in bed. The Hotel boss claimed that the travel firm in East
Kilbride had been informed about the virus a week before the trip. The
travel firm has issued a statement saying: "We regret to learn that some of
our customers appear to have been affected but we have acted responsibly in
light of advice given."
