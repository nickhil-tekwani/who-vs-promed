The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food & Forestry announced [Tue 30 Jul 2019] that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been confirmed in a horse in Tillman County, OK.

So far in 2019, VSV has been reported in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming. This is the 1st case in Oklahoma since the 1990s, according to the Oklahoma State University Center for Veterinary Health Sciences (CVHS). VSV is a viral disease affecting horses and all clovened-hooved animals.

VSV does not typically cause death in animals, and human infection is rare. Clinical signs are most commonly seen in horses and cattle and include excessive salivation, decreased appetite, fever, vesicles (blisters) or sores in the mouth and on the lips, lameness, and sores or crusts on the underline and legs.

Transmission of the disease is not well understood, but insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals can all play a role, CVHS said. Owners and veterinarians should monitor all susceptible animals closely, as VSV can resemble foot-and-mouth disease and other foreign animal diseases. Biosecurity measures should be increased to help control the spread.

Diagnosis of positive animals is done by a blood test, and quarantine is required for positive or exposed animals. Owners and veterinarians should prepare well in advance of travel for restrictions that may be placed on susceptible species moving interstate or internationally, CVHS advised.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture has confirmed cases of vesicular stomatitis (VSV) in Adams, Archuleta, Boulder, Broomfield, Delta, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Montezuma, Morgan, and Weld counties in Colorado. All confirmed cases in Colorado have been in horses with the exception of one bovine case.

"We understand that the VSV outbreak and quarantines are impacting the ability for people to bring their horses and livestock to fairs and shows," said Dr. Keith Roehr, Colorado state veterinarian. "The quarantines and hold orders must be followed, however, for the health and protection of all equine and livestock in Colorado."

The total count of premises under quarantine for VSV by county is outlined in the table at https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/agmain/news/vesicular-stomatitis-cases-confirmed-11-colorado-counties?fbclid=IwAR30q897y6I2Bs5VbyRqg7uGBhh7N0vEwdejTNp2DpeTNEzLJngkoJ6nK_k. CDA's Animal Health division is updating this table regularly with the latest data on its CDA VSV website.

[The 2nd Oklahoma report includes a map of the US showing the locations of counties with confirmed VS cases and a full listing. This OK outbreak is right on the border with Texas and abuts an affected TX county. I fear this epidemic will continue until the 1st frosts. - Mod.MHJ]
