Peru: Hepatitis D Virus-related Deaths of Children in Villa Rica
----------------------------------------------------------------
There is an outbreak of hepatitis D in the village of Cedropampa, Villa
Rica-Peru. A total of 4 deaths have been reported, 3 of them children
belonging to the same family. The other case was a 27-year-old man from
Maine (Villa Rica).
The first case was an 8-year-old boy with abdominal pain and somnolence
that rapidly progressed to lethargy, severe pain, and icterus. He was
transferred to a hospital of Lima (the Peruvian capital) where he died 3
days later on 14 April 2003. The Instituto Nacional de Salud (National
Institute of Health, NIH) tested a serum sample finding total anti-HBc
(+ve), IgM anti-HBc (-ve), HBsAg (+ve), total anti-D (+ve).
The second case was his sister, a 16-year-old girl, and the third case was
their brother, a 13-year-old boy. All of them have similar symptoms,
serology, and a diagnosis of acute liver failure. The fourth case died on
Sun 6 Jul 2003. He had no contact with these children before, but this
cirrhotic patient was hospitalized due to gastrointestinal bleeding in
April in a bed near the 8-year-old boy.
Villa Rica is a jungle-like area, endemic for viral hepatitis B, but there
has been no previous report of hepatitis delta virus. Yellow fever,
malaria, and listeriosis have been occasionally reported in this district.
Currently, there are no data about the transmission of hepatitis delta
virus to the first case. Nevertheless, [this boy and his brother may have
had contact with migrants] from endemic areas for hepatitis B, and probably
hepatitis D. The Ministry of Health may declare an epidemiologic emergency
for Villa Rica this Monday [13 Jul 2003]. The plan is: education about
transmission, vaccination [against hepatitis B virus] for all the people
living in Cedropampa, and serologic surveillance.

[Because hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is dependent on hepatitis B virus
(HBV) for replication, HBV/HDV co-infection can be prevented with either
pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis for HBV. HDV infection can be acquired
either as a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection of persons with
chronic HBV infection. Persons with HBV/HDV co-infection may have more
severe acute disease and a higher risk of fulminant hepatitis (2-20
percent) compared with those infected with HBV alone; however, chronic HBV
infection appears to occur less frequently in individuals with HBV/HDV
co-infection. Chronic HBV carriers who acquire HDV superinfection usually
develop chronic HDV infection. In long-term studies of chronic HBV carriers
with HDV superinfection, 70-80 percent have developed evidence of chronic
liver diseases with cirrhosis compared with 15-30 percent of patients with
chronic HBV infection alone. Thus, prevention of HDV superinfection depends
primarily on education to reduce risk behaviors. In some Latin American
countries in the Amazon River Basin, periodic epidemics of HDV infection
have occurred among chronic HBV carriers in relatively isolated regions.
Disease related to HDV infection in these outbreaks has been very severe,
with rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis and case-fatality rates of
10-20 percent. The cause of the atypical course of HDV infection in these
populations is unknown.
The modes of HDV transmission are similar to those for HBV, with
percutaneous exposures the most efficient. Sexual transmission of HDV is
less efficient than for HBV. Perinatal HDV transmission is rare. The
serologic course of HDV infection varies depending on whether the virus is
acquired as a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection of a person with
chronic HBV infection. In most persons with HBV/HDV co-infection, both IgM
antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) and IgG anti-HDV are detectable during the
course of infection. However, in about 15 percent of patients the only
evidence of HDV infection may be the detection of either IgM anti-HDV alone
during the early acute period of illness or IgG anti-HDV alone during
convalescence. Anti-HDV generally declines to sub-detectable levels after
the infection resolves, and there is no serologic marker that persists to
indicate that the patient was ever infected with HDV. Hepatitis Delta
antigen (HDAg) can be detected in serum in only about 25 percent of
patients with HBV-HDV co-infection. When HDAg is detectable it generally
disappears as HBsAg disappears and most patients do not develop chronic
infection. - Mod.CP]
