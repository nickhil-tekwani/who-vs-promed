Amidst a spike in COVID-19 cases, at least 5 fresh suspected cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have brought the health department on its toes. Officials from the State Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (SVBDCP) said that the Central Health team during a virtual conference with the local counterparts alerted the health department and ordered them to take preventive measures.

The suspected cases have been reported from East Singhbhum district, and the Civil Surgeon (SC) concerned has been asked to pay special attention to the most affected areas in the district. In previous years too several cases of JE were reported from the district. In 2013, a maximum 46 cases were reported.

The district administration has asked civic bodies to inspect households to find and destroy mosquito larvae in different colonies. JE too is spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms usually take 5-15 days to develop and include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty in moving. JE is a serious disease that may cause death.

The local civic bodies have decided to step up cleanliness and awareness drives, concerned over positive dengue cases reported from different parts of steel city.

According to experts, drastic change in weather conditions and fast depleting forest cover may have let the virus that hitherto has been confined to wild animals, prey on human beings. Unusual weather conditions seem to have triggered viral fevers on a large scale with scores of children and adults being admitted to the hospital with such complaints.

An official of the Centre's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), who monitors the cases of vector-borne diseases in the city, said that the situation is under control, but they have called a meeting to chalk strategy and also review progress made so far.

The department is taking preventive measures like coordinating with the district health department (read district malaria officer) in carrying out spraying of bleaching powders, DDT and anti-larvicidal in affected areas identified on the basis of location of patients undergoing treatment at health centers.

However, areas like Birsanagar, Baridih Basti, Carriage Colony and at certain places in Govindpur where people live in bustees [registered slums], a great number drainage or sewerage systems have gone haywire.

[Jharkhand State is adjacent to Bihar State, a locality that annually has many cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE). The JE transmission season occurs at this time of year. Interestingly, the above report does not mention the acute encephalitis syndrome into which JE is often placed. The report indicates that JE is suspected and not laboratory confirmed.

Although the above report indicates that attempts are being made for control of JE vector mosquitoes, because they can breed over a very large area, control may be very difficult. There is no mention of JE vaccination in the above report, which is the most effective preventive measure that can be taken. - Mod.TY
