Yemen: myiasis affects thousands of animals
-------------------------------------------
The General Department for Animal Resources (GDAR) at Yemen's
Ministry of Agriculture has warned that more than 8000 livestock in 3
of the country's provinces have been affected by myiasis, a disease
by which human or animal tissue is infested with fly larvae or
maggots.

The potentially fatal disease has been found in 838 villages in Saada
and Hajjah provinces and at least 5 villages in al-Hudeidah province
in northwest Yemen since it first appeared in the country in December
2007, GDAR added.

According to Ghaleb al-Eryani, director-general of GDAR, there are 15
million sheep, 1.4 million cattle, and 250 000 camels in Yemen. If
the disease is not brought under control, he said, the initial
economic loss Yemen might face is 22 billion riyals [about USD 111
million] in terms of livestock.

Mohammed al-Hayyal, head of GDAR's Myiasis Combating National Team,
told IRIN on 1 Mar 2008 that his department was preparing to send 24
teams to al-Hudeidah Governorate, in western Yemen, 5 teams to Saada,
and 3 to Hajjah to support GDAR teams already there.

There are currently 12 teams in Saada and the same number in Hajjah.
Each team consists of a vehicle, an insecticide sprayer, a veterinary
officer, and an assistant. The teams give animals anti-parasite
medicines and spray parasiticides in an effort to prevent the disease
from spreading.

So far, the number of affected animals has reached 8500. The teams
have sprayed 120 000 animals and 9000 barns in Saada and Hajjah,
al-Hayyal said, adding that there were no means of monitoring the
disease and the extent of its spread.

In al-Hudeidah Governorate, where the disease has spread to more than
5 villages, officials at Tehama Development Authority (TDA), a
government body there, have declared a state of emergency because the
province is home to almost half the whole country's livestock.

Saeed Abdul-Wasei, an information officer at TDA, told IRIN on 2 Mar
2008 that 25 sheep died over the past few days in Tehama, but he
could not give the exact number of infected animals.

"Tehama region has 40 percent of Yemen's livestock. If there is no
action to combat the disease, it will be disastrous," he said, adding
that TDA is on high alert and is combating the disease in
coordination with GDAR.

"Efforts are really being made to prevent the spread of the disease.
We are raising awareness among locals to observe, combat, and prevent
the spread of the disease. The TDA has 57 awareness centres,"
Abdul-Wasei said.

[The style of the report above, posted by IRIN -- the news agency of
UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, is alarming.
Unfortunately, this seemingly emerging, exceptional outbreak has not
been notified to the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health).
This, in spite the fact that "Screwworm myiasis" is an OIE reportable
disease and that according to IRIN it had started already in December
2007!

For further background information subscribers are referred to
ProMED-mail posting 20080222.0722. The said posting included a
request for information on the exact identity of the fly larvae
(maggots) responsible for the described, widely spread condition. In
particular, whether it is the Old World screwworm (_Chrysomya
bezziana_, OWS) or the New World screwworm (_Cochliomyia
hominivorax_, NWS), which is known to be present exclusively in the
western hemisphere and which was named in the original newswire. The
request for information is herewith repeated.

Further information can be found in chapter 2.2.8 of OIE's Manual of
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00047.htm> and in the Center for
Food Security and Public Health (CFSPH) at Iowa State University
College of Veterinary Medicine website at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/screwworm_myiasis.pdf>,
which includes illustrations.
