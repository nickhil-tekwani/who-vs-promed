Yellow fever in Senegal - WHO Update 4
--------------------------------------
As of Thu 31 Oct 2002, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 45 cases and 4
deaths of yellow fever. The outbreak has affected Touba, Mbacke, and Bambey
districts, Diourbel region; Gossas and Fatick districts, Fatick region and
Tambacounda district in Tambacounda region (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/october/25october2002.html>).
There were 33 cases reported from Touba, where urban transmission was
occurring. The date of onset of illness for the 2 most recent confirmed
cases was 20 Oct 2002 in Fatick and Tambacounda districts. Surveillance has
been intensified in all districts in the country, including active
surveillance in Dakar. To date, there has been no evidence of virus
transmission in Dakar.
The ongoing immunization campaigns in Diourbel region have achieved
coverage rates of 94-99 percent (Touba = 99 percent) and no cases have been
confirmed in this region since 14 Oct 2002. An immunization campaign has
begun in Gossas and Fatick districts, and one is planned for Tambacounda
district, but additional vaccine and operational support are needed to
begin the campaign.
Laboratory testing is being performed by the WHO Collaborating Centre at
the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (IPD). The Institut de Recherche pour le
Developpement and IPD are carrying out entomological investigations, and
with WHO have been assisting the Ministry of Health with surveillance and
epidemiological investigations. WHO is supporting the immunization campaign
with both technical assistance and vaccine supplies. In response to an
appeal for financial support for the outbreak response, WHO wishes to
acknowledge the support of the Government of Norway and UNFPA.
