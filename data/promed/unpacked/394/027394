West Nile virus found in Massachusetts bird
-------------------------------------------
The first evidence of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus, which killed 7
people in New York in 1999, has been discovered in Massachusetts in the
body of a dead crow, state public health officials said Wednesday.
Massachusetts Department of Health officials said that the dead bird had
been found on 22 Jul 2000 by workers with the Boston Parks Department in
the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. The officials said the state was
testing mosquitoes in the area to determine if the [virus was present.
Results of those tests will be available Thursday morning.
"I wouldn't be surprised if the West Nile virus was found in mosquitoes
because they feed on the birds," said Anita Barry, director of communicable
disease control for the Boston public health commission. "We're making the
assumption the virus will be found in the mosquitoes". She said that he
peak time for [potential human infection [would be late August and
September.
West Nile virus, named for the region in Uganda where it first appeared in
1937, had never been detected in the Western Hemisphere until it killed 7
people and sickened 62 others in the New York region in 1999. The virus
survived the winter and was found this year in mosquitoes or dead birds in
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. No one [has been found to be
infected with West Nile virus this year. The virus is spread to humans by
infected mosquitoes that have picked up the virus by biting a bird
carrying it. It can cause potentially lethal brain diseases such as
encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation
of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms can include high
fever, headache and body aches, muscle weakness, loss of consciousness or
rash.

School. This report stated, however, that the Willow Pond area of the
Jamaica Plain neighborhood would be sprayed. - Mod.CP

Re: Lyme disease in Hyde Park, London - Correction to Moderator's comment
-------------------------------------
The Moderator's comment following the posting on West Nile virus
surveillance - USA (09) stated that both deer and Lyme disease-infected
ticks had been found in Central Park, New York, and in Hyde Park, London.
It is extremely unlikely that there are Lyme disease-infected ticks in Hyde
Park in London - pet dogs and horses, but no deer, to my knowledge. But
there are plenty of deer in Richmond Park, on the outskirts of London, and
Lyme-infected ticks have been known there for many years.
