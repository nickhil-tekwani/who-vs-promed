WEST NILE FEVER VIRUS, LEMURS - MADAGASCAR: RFI
===============================================
From: REJunge@aol.com
Date: Thu, 8 May 1997 17:13:19 -0400 (EDT)
I am a veterinarian involved with medical care of captive (US) and free -
ranging (Madagascar) lemur populations. As part of that involvement, I have
collected a database of diseases reported from both wild and captive lemurs,
with particular attention to communicable diseases. Few agents pose zoonotic
risks. However, there are a few brief reports of experimental induction and
serological surveys of West Nile Virus disease in lemurs in Madagascar. I am
having trouble determining how significant the disease is. It does not
appear to cause disease in lemurs, however they may serve as reservoirs.
Can anyone comment on the significance of the disease in humans? Or
specifically, in Madagascar? I can only find references to serological
incidences, but little else.
