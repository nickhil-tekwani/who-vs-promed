Known as 'the Asian Ebola virus', the CCHF or the Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, is now believed to be prevalent across the country. A study by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) here has determined 17 outbreaks so far, affecting 50 people, most of whom succumbed to the virus.

The CCHF [virus infection] has a fatality rate of up to 80 percent [This is too high. The usual CFR is 10-40 percent]. First detected in January 2011 in Ahmedabad, the virus that spreads from animals to humans is now active across almost all states, with Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Gujarat reporting cases, a serosurvey shows.

NIV Director Dr Devendra Mourya, along with scientist Pragya Yadav and others, published these findings in the October issue of the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta.

The disease is usually transmitted to humans by bites of _Hyalomma_ ticks, which are found on cattle, buffalo, goats, and sheep. Humans can also acquire the virus through exposure to CCHF-infected blood and tissues or to body secretions of an affected animal, during slaughtering or allied procedures or at a hospital.

While there is a lot of awareness in India about the threat posed by the Ebola virus, Mourya told The Indian Express, the real threat posed by the CCHF is little understood.

The virus could also go undetected and the cause of death misunderstood as the symptoms of dengue and CCHF are overlapping, Pragya Yadav said, adding that CCHF belonged to the high-risk group IV, as per the CDC and WHO.

"A large section of the Indian economy as well as rural development are dependent on agriculture, livestock farming, and dairy industry. India exports over USD 400 million of meat and beef every year. India also has many animal-trading fairs (such as Pushkar, Rajasthan; Sonepur, Bihar) where there is extensive movement of tick-infested animals. There is a high threat of transmission of the CCHF virus to new areas via such trade," Mourya said.

Detected in India for the 1st time only in 2011, the CCHF virus is widespread in several countries of Africa, Asia, South-East Europe, and Eurasia. Hard ticks, especially _Hyalomma_ ticks, are both a reservoir and a vector for the virus. Numerous wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep, and hare, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus.

"Animal husbandry and abattoir workers are at high risk, as they are always in close contact with live animals or carcasses that may be infested with CCHFV-infected ticks. Infected animals do not develop severe disease as viraemia (presence of virus in the body) in livestock is short-lived (up to 2 weeks), and of low intensity," Mourya said.

He added that, for the study, 5636 samples (bovine, goat, and sheep) were obtained through foot-and-mouth disease centres, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. CCHF virus-specific IgG antibodies were detected in serum samples of domestic animals using 2 ELISA kits, developed indigenously by the NIV.

Overall, 260 out of 4781 (5.4 percent) bovine samples and 94 out of 855 (11 percent) sheep/goat samples were found to be positive for anti-CCHF virus antibodies. "The maximum IgG antibody positivity in bovine samples was seen in Orissa (31.3 percent). In the case of sheep and goat samples, the maximum IgG positivity was seen in Himachal Pradesh (53.1 percent). We also recorded higher seropositivity in sheep and goats than bovines," Mourya said.

Yadav stressed the need for more higher-level laboratories to check the samples. The diagnosis of high-risk group pathogens is a major concern in India, where only few Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories and just one BSL-4 laboratory exist, Yadav said.

[It is clear that CCHF virus is fairly widespread in India. Not only does transmission occur from contact with blood and tissues of CCHF virus-infected animals and ticks, but with blood and secretions of infected individual people as well, usually in a hospital setting. It is indeed unfortunate that the report states that CCHF is "Asian Ebola". The only Ebola-related virus in Asia is Reston virus, that causes disease in animals but not in people. These 2 viruses are not related. One hopes that consideration of CCHF virus as the "Asian ebolavirus" is not widespread in the country.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

The CDC states, "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (_Nairovirus_) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was initially characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the disease.

The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin, and it has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients, reportedly with some benefit (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/). However, since the patient died so soon after admission, effective use of the drug in the treatment of the case above would not have been possible.
