People who have a COVID-19 rebound after treatment with the antiviral drug Paxlovid can be contagious and may not know it because they might not have symptoms, researchers warn. "People who experience rebound are at risk of transmitting to other people, even though they're outside what people accept as the usual window for being able to transmit," said Dr Michael Charness of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Boston.

Charness and his colleagues recently collaborated with a team of researchers at Columbia University to look into cases of COVID-19 that return after Paxlovid treatment. He said they've found at least 2 instances in which people have transmitted to others when their infection recurs.

In one case, a 67 year old man infected a 6 month old after a half-hour near the child. The man was 12 days past his 1st positive COVID-19 test. He had taken a 5-day course of Paxlovid and was feeling better. He didn't have any symptoms when he saw the baby, who was his grandson, but about 8 hours later, he started to feel ill again. The baby tested positive about 3 days later, as did both of his parents. Neither the baby nor its parents had any other close contacts before they got sick.

"It indicates that you can transmit during rebound even before you develop symptoms," Charness said. "And you know, we studied a small number of people. It's certainly conceivable that there are other people out there who don't have symptoms and still have a viral rebound."

In another instance, a 63 year old man infected 2 family members during 3 days of relapse after Paxlovid.

Based on this research, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance last week for people experiencing COVID-19 rebound after Paxlovid. CDC said people who test positive again and whose symptoms come back after finishing their antiviral pills should restart their isolation period and isolate for 5 full days. The agency says people can end their isolation period after those 5 additional days as long as their fever has been gone for 24 hours without fever-reducing medication and they're feeling better. The agency also recommends that people wear a mask for 10 days after their symptoms come back.

The findings and guidance come as Paxlovid use has increased in the United States. According to the White House, over the past 2 months, filled prescriptions for Paxlovid have climbed from about 27 000 a week to 182 000 a week. The administration credits the increase to its test-to-treat program, which created one-stop hubs in grocery and drug stores where people could take a COVID-19 test and immediately receive and fill a prescription for antiviral medications. The antiviral drugs should be taken within the 1st few days of symptoms.

The drug works well. In clinical trials, Paxlovid reduced the odds that a person at risk of severe COVID-19 would need to be hospitalized by almost 90% compared with a placebo. For that reason, CDC says, early treatment with this medication is still recommended. As helpful as it is, though, researchers say people should be aware the drug may not completely extinguish the infection.

Charness and his co-authors have now collected at least 10 such cases of COVID-19 recurrence after Paxlovid. Half of them have come from just 2 families, leading the researchers to conclude that such cases are not all that rare.

The research is shared as a preprint [see citation below]. It has not been scrutinized by outside researchers or published in a medical journal.

Genetic testing suggests that when people get a 2nd round of COVID-19 after Paxlovid, it's not because they've been infected by a different strain of the virus. There's also no sign that the virus has changed or mutated to develop some kind of resistance to the drug. So far, rebound cases have been mild.

Why this might be happening is still a mystery. In his studies, Charness said, the researchers watched the amount of virus in a person's body -- called their viral load -- go down on Paxlovid treatment. "People take Paxlovid, and what we know it does very well is, it blocks viral replication," he said. And so the levels of virus go down. But then in some people -- no one knows how many, because not enough people have been studied -- levels of the virus begin to climb again 9-12 days after they 1st test positive, Charness said.

It's not entirely clear that that rebound is linked to Paxlovid. In studies of more than 2200 COVID-19 patients, Pfizer, the company that makes the drug, said there were a few patients who had their COVID-19 come bouncing back after a negative test, but they were in the group that took Paxlovid as well as in those who got the placebo, suggesting that COVID just reappears in some people, even without treatment.

Charness' own team has done comparison study, however, and found something different. When researchers looked at 1000 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed between December [2021] and March [2022] in players and support staff of the National Basketball Association who had not taken the drug, they didn't find any cases of COVID-19 returning. This study is still unpublished. They say more research is needed to understand whether there could be any connection to the drug.

Charness said the fact that the infection can come back this way after treatment presents some questions. For one, would rebound be as common in people who started the drug later, maybe on day 4 or 5 after their 1st symptoms, after their immune systems have had longer to initially see the virus? Would a longer course of treatment -- maybe taking the drug for 6 or 7 days, rather than 5 -- lower the risk that the virus would come back? "No one knows," he said. "Somebody should be studying this."

[2] Long COVID
Date: Sun 31 Jul 2022

More than 2 years after [GL] first got sick with COVID, her heart still races at random times. She's often exhausted. She can't digest certain foods. Most days, she runs a fever, and when her temperature gets up past a certain point, her brain feels like goo, she says. These are commonly reported symptoms of long COVID....

As the number of people with post-COVID symptoms soars, researchers and the government are trying to get a handle on how big an impact long COVID is having on the US workforce. It's a pressing question, given the fragile state of the economy. For more than a year, employers have faced staffing problems, with jobs going unfilled month after month.

Now, millions of people may be sidelined from their jobs due to long COVID. Katie Bach, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, drew on survey data from the Census Bureau, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and the Lancet to come up with what she says is a conservative estimate: 4 million full-time equivalent workers out of work because of long COVID. "That is just a shocking number," says Bach. "That's 2.4% of the US working population."

The Biden administration has already taken some steps to try to protect workers and keep them on the job, issuing guidance that makes clear that long COVID can be a disability, and relevant laws would apply. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, employers must offer accommodations to workers with disabilities unless doing so presents an undue burden....

Dr Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, has seen COVID play out in similar ways in other patients. "If someone has to go back 100% when they start feeling a little bit better, they are going to crash and burn fast," she says.

The problem with coming up with accommodations for long COVID is that there are so many unknowns. The duration and severity of symptoms varies wildly from person to person. Gutierrez finds herself stumped by questions on disability forms that ask how long an individual might be out or how long their illness may last. "This is a new condition," she says. "We don't know."

Accommodations in the workplace might include flexibility in where someone works, extended leave, or a new role in a different department. The goal is to get workers on a path back, says Roberta Etcheverry, CEO of Diversified Management Group, a disability management consulting firm. But with long COVID, it's difficult to measure whether an employee is in fact on a path back.

"This isn't a sprain or strain where somebody turns an ankle and we know in x amount of months, they're going to be at this point," she says. "It's not somebody was helping move a patient, and they hurt their back, and they can't do that kind of work anymore. They need to do something else."

With long COVID, symptoms come and go, and new symptoms may arise. The Labor Department is urging employers not to rule out accommodations for employees who don't get an official long COVID diagnosis. "Rather than determining whether an employee has a disability, your focus should be on the employee's limitations and whether there are effective accommodations that would enable the employee to perform essential job functions," the Labor Department says in its long COVID guide for employers [https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ODEP/topics/pdf/long-covid-report-v2-accessibilized.pdf]....

[According to [US] federal government estimates released last month [July 2022], nearly 1 in 5 adults who have had COVID-19 in the past were still experiencing at least one symptom of long COVID -- fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, chest pain, and headaches, among others -- as of midJune [2022]. The number jumps to more than 1 in 3 when considering adults who have experienced the condition at any point in the pandemic after COVID-19 infection.

". . . the resources to handle the tens of millions of Americans with long COVID are insufficient. Ashley Drapeau, the director of the [George Washington University Center for Integrative Medicine's] long COVID program, says some clinics dedicated to treating the condition have a waiting period of months or even years before patients can be seen."

"That number could amass into a new wave of chronic illness that will continue to grow with guaranteed implications for the economy as well as health-care systems. A Government Accountability Office report [https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105666] published in March [2022] found that long COVID has "potentially affected up to 23 million Americans, pushing an estimated 1 million people out of work," and that number is likely higher now."

"In fact, one study published in May [https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00126-6] found that roughly half of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, at the start of the pandemic reported symptoms of long COVID 2 years later. Authors said it was the longest follow-up study to date."
(https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-07-08/how-many-people-have-long-covid-the-statistics-are-pretty-scary)

One thought that has been circulating to address the number of individuals affected by long COVID is allowing continued work at home and adoption of a 4-day work week.

". . . There here has been a 15% rise in companies [in the UK] offering a 4-day week since the pandemic began. A recent survey found that nearly 60% of the British public support a 4-day week, and other polling shows an increase in managers warming to the idea. Earlier this month [July 2022], the 4 Day Week Global and the thinktank Autonomy launched a new trial where 3000 people across 70 companies will adopt a 4-day week."
(https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/29/could-long-covid-lead-to-the-rise-of-a-four-day-work-week)

However, this plan may not work well for blue-collar workers, who unfortunately have not been part of most of the studies under way. Certainly, more resources need to be devoted to long COVID as it is a major public health problem. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries; Japan (196 812), the USA (142 915), South Korea (111 700), Italy (19 520), Brazil (22 905), Australia (42 365), India (13 620), Taiwan (16 576), Moldova (11 608), Russia (10 824), and Georgia (10 953) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1904 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (31 Jul-1 Aug 2022).

A total of 42 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 42 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and none is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 1.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 18.2%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 2.7% decrease in daily reported cases and 2.6% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Worldwide over 0.73 million newly confirmed infections have been reported in the past 24 hours. The cumulative totals exceed 582.90 million reported cases and 6.42 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
