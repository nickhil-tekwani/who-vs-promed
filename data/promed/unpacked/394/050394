Jails See Outbreak of Skin Infections
-------------------------------------
A painful skin infection not treatable with most common antibiotics is
spreading through the Los Angeles County jail system, affecting more than
1000 inmates in the last year and causing at least 57 hospitalizations.
Federal health officials believe that the outbreak of drug-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_, commonly called staph, is the largest of its kind
in any of the nation's correctional systems. By comparison, a similar
outbreak in Mississippi prisons in 1999-2000 infected 59 inmates.
For months, the Los Angeles infections were misdiagnosed as spider bites and
jail officials brought in exterminators. Now sure of the staph cluster, jail
doctors are using more powerful drugs to treat all skin lesions and stepping
up hygiene measures.
"The problem at the jail is not under control yet," said Dr. Jonathan
Fielding, the county's public health director. More than 100 infections have
been reported this month.
Staph infections are believed to be spread by skin-to-skin contact or shared
personal items in the county's jails, officials said Thu, 30 Jan 2003. The
infection causes boils, deep skin abscesses and widespread surrounding
inflammation.
Similar outbreaks of the same strain have been found elsewhere in the Los
Angeles area since the summer -- among gay men, members of a sports team,
and newborns in a hospital's nursery. Some inmates are entering the jails
with infections picked up in the community and are spreading the staph
behind bars, doctors said.
The problem is believed to be more widespread and difficult to control in
jails because hygiene is poor, inmates are in close
contact, and laundry is not cleaned often enough, health officials said.
Those same factors also explain why jails are incubators for other diseases.
Most of the 57 inmates hospitalized in the first 8 months of 2002 had
aggressive skin infections that required intravenous antibiotics or the
surgical removal of tissue. Some of the infections spread into bones and
blood, but no one is believed to have died, said Dr. Elizabeth A. Bancroft,
a medical epidemiologist with the Los Angeles County Department of Health
Services.
Since inmates and officials first blamed spider bites, jail doctors didn't
contact the county health department until June 2002, 5 months after they
started tracking the outbreak. "We spent a considerable amount of time
screening all of our facilities, making sure that pest control measures were
in place and actually trying to capture a specimen so we would have some
idea what we were dealing with," said Dr. John H. Clark, the Sheriff's
Department's chief medical officer. The jail sent 4 or 5 spiders to the
county entomologist, or bug specialist. "As it turns out, they were
non-biting spiders," Clark said.
Clark said the confirmed staph cases represent a small fraction of the 165
000 people who spent time in the county jail facilities last year. About 20
000 stay there at any given time.
Although 928 inmates tested positive for drug-resistant staph in 2002, more
may have been infected, because jail staff did not
routinely culture skin sores until after the health department got involved
in June.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California has received
dozens of calls recently from inmates who complained about having "spider
bites." Ben Wizner, a staff attorney with the group, attributed the staph
outbreak to "too many inmates, not enough doctors." Because the men's
central jail is chronically overcrowded, he said, many inmates stay in
cramped dormitories with their mattresses touching.
To control the outbreak, federal and county health authorities recommend
improved access to showers and clean laundry for inmates, and jail officials
said they are taking such steps. In addition, medical staff are draining
abscesses and administering 2 powerful antibiotics in tandem. Inmates are
being told to seek help if they develop skin sores.
But that may not be enough. According to data from the jail, 9 percent of
infected inmates reported sores within 5 days of booking, meaning that they
probably came in contact with the bacteria before they were incarcerated.
"Control is not as easy as saying, 'We'll take care of everyone today and
give them antibiotics,' " said Bancroft, who is leading the health
investigation. "Every day, you have people coming in from the outside."
Health officials said they don't have the luxury of closing the jails in the
way that cruise ships were taken out of operation recently to disinfect them
of a gastrointestinal virus. "When you have 20 000 people who sleep in your
jails ... it would be very, very difficult to do something like that,"
Bancroft said.
Authorities said they are uncertain whether inmates with other chronic
illnesses are more likely to contract the staph infections.
The jail outbreak is affecting men and women, and their average age is 35.
Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, a medical epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said his agency has limited knowledge
of resistant staph outbreaks outside of hospital settings because there is
no requirement that they be reported. In addition to helping with the
Mississippi outbreak, the CDC also has assisted authorities in Georgia,
Texas, and now California in dealing with resistant staph in prisons and
jails, which he said is particularly difficult to control.
Some hygienic precautions that are routine in a hospital can't be followed
in jails. Replacing bar soap with plastic soap dispensers poses a security
risk, and jails won't use paper towels instead of cloth towels because
inmates could use them to stuff toilets.

[It would not be surprising if typing analysis of the correctional facility
strains reveal identity with those from the outbreak
described on ProMED on 28 Jan 2003 -- see ref. below. Epidemiologic data
would help in determining whether patterns of transmission in the
correctional facility over time can be seen. - Mod.LL]
