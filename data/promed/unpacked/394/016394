In Nicaragua, authorities reported the first 21 cases of cholera and
32 of dengue fever. Thousands of people also reportedly suffer from
acute respiratory infections.
Authorities counted about 11 500 bodies, most of them in Honduras and
Nicaragua. An estimated 14 000 people are missing and may never be
accounted for.
To make matters worse, the threat of killer diseases rose rapidly as
safe drinking water dwindled and sanitary conditions deteriorated.
Some 2.8 million people have been left homeless by the tragedy, and
many crowded emergency shelters.
