Thousands of acres of farmland with potato in Lakhimpur [district] are witnessing an abnormal growth of produce. Farmers who have been growing potatoes for generations say they have never experienced such a crop failure, nor have they heard of such a thing from the past.

The tiny size of the potatoes was preceded by the shrinking of the potato plants after the spreading of the leaves, finally leading to its complete withering. A farmer says that the entire potato plantation gets affected following the start of the germination of the seeds. Then the potato leaves shrink after some time, leading the plants to die quickly. Last year [2018], some farmers could get only 10-20% of the production due to the disease.

The outbreak of the unknown disease and the small size in production has left farmers in dire straits and needing urgent intervention by concerned departments.

[According to the picture and symptom description supplied with this report, a fungal or bacterial pathogen appears unlikely. Rather, the problems may be due to viruses, viroids, or phytoplasmas, perhaps with some damage on the top of the shoots from their insect vectors; cyst nematodes, which are known to be a problem in northern India (ProMED-mail post 20181123.6160544); or quite possibly a combination of any of these. Many of these pathogens can also be spread with seed tubers and/or soil, which could account for the reported local carry-over of the "disease" between crops.

Reliable molecular diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved will be needed before effective management strategies can be designed for the affected areas.
