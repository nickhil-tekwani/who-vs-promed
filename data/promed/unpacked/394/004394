Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak May Have Spread to the Capital
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Marburg virus outbreak that has killed 98 people in northern Angola, has
now spread to the capital Luanda, killing two people there. A 15-year-old
boy and an Italian paediatrician, Maria Bonino, who had both been in the
northern Uige province to which the virus had previously been confined, died
yesterday from the virus in Luanda, local health officials said. At least
three other people have been diagnosed with the virus in the capital, they
said. Marburg disease, a severe form of haemorrhagic fever, [is caused by a
virus belonging to the same family as Ebola virus -- the family
_Filoviridae_.] Marburg virus was first identified in 1967, affecting
laboratory workers in Marburg, Germany and also in Frankfurt and Belgrade
who had come into contact with infected monkeys from Uganda.

Mr Bonino worked for the Italian medical aid group Medici con Africa Cuamm
and had 11 years experience as a volunteer in Africa with the last two years
as paediatrician in the provincial hospital of Uige. Angolan health
officials are battling to contain the outbreak detected in October in Uige
that has claimed the lives of scores of children. "Two nurses died of
Marburg fever on Tue 22 Mar 2005 at the Uige provincial hospital," said
Filomena Wilson, the spokeswoman of a commission tasked with monitoring the
outbreak. A total of five nurses have died over the past weeks from the
virus that is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids of infected
people, she said.

The largest outbreak on record of Marburg virus occurred from late 1998 to
2000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, killing 123 people. The World
Health Organisation said that 75 per cent of the victims of the disease had
been children under the age of five. Angolan health officials assisted by
WHO experts and teams from Medecins Sans Frontieres and the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were in Uige to try to shore up
measures to stamp out the outbreak. "The situation is bad, very bad," said
health ministry spokesman Carlos Alberto. "There is no isolation room. We
are setting them up."

Angolan health officials said this week there was no need to quarantine the
region bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo, but tests were being
conducted on the body of a man in Luanda who had exhibited the same
symptoms. Victims of the Marburg virus can suffer from a severe watery
diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting early on in the illness
followed by severe chest and lung pains, sore throat and cough, according to
the WHO. Many cases result in severe bleeding, beginning from the fifth day
and affecting the gastrointestinal tract and the lungs, accompanied by a
rash, sometimes involving the entire body.

Angola: Marburg Virus Outbreak Spreads to Luanda: Death Toll Now 111
--------------------------------------------------------------------
LUANDA: The death toll in an outbreak of the deadly Ebola-like Marburg virus
in Angola has risen to 113, with 111 deaths in the northern province of Uige
and two in the capital Luanda, health officials said on Fri 25 Mar 2005.

"The death toll is 111... in the Uige provincial hospital," Carlos Alberto,
a health ministry spokesperson told Agence France Presse from Uige, about
300km north of Luanda. The provincial health director for Luanda, Vita
Mvemba, said there were two deaths in the capital. "We have registered one
death at the Josina Machel hospital of a 15-year-old boy who had been to the
Uige province ... and a case of an Italian doctor, who had also been to
Uige, who died on Thursday night in the Sagrada Esperanca clinic," Mvemba
said. The doctor was identified as Italian paediatrician Maria Bonino.

[The two fatal cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever reported from Luanda, the
capital city of Angola, appear to be individuals who had recently visited or
worked in Uige province and were being treated in separate hospitals in
Luanda. So far there has been no confirmation of spread of infection to the
local inhabitants of Luanda, although at least one suspected case is under
surveillance. - Mod.CP]
