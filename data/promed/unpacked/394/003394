Cambodia: Study Suggests Mild Bird Flu Cases Aren't Going Undetected
-----------------------------------------------
New data from Cambodia presented at an international conference Mon 20 Mar
2006 suggest mild or symptomless human cases of H5N1 avian flu may not be
occurring. Many have hoped that the world is overestimating the virulence
of the H5N1 virus, based on an assumption the disease surveillance systems
in affected countries might not be sensitive enough to pick up mild infections.
But if the work presented at the International Conference on Emerging
Infectious Diseases is borne out by additional larger studies, it would
suggest the current case fatality rate of roughly 54 percent might indeed
be close to reality.
Lead researcher Dr. Philippe Buchy of the Institut Pasteur in Phnom Penh
put a positive spin on his findings. "In our experience, it seems that the
virus still has difficulty jumping from avian to humans," he said in an
interview. But the head of the influenza branch at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control said the findings have both positive and negative
implications. "You can look at it in the way that it's encouraging, because
it means that the virus is not jumping to humans very readily. And that of
course is very important, and that's a positive thing," said Dr. Nancy Cox.
"But on the other side of the coin, it means that the case fatality rate is
still very high. And that is a negative thing." Cox said it will be
important to do this type of work on a larger scale, to get a more
definitive picture of whether mild or asymptomatic H5N1 human cases are
occurring. She said some larger studies are planned.
Buchy and his colleagues reported on work they conducted last spring in a
Cambodian village that had H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and where one of that
country's 4 recorded cases lived. (All 4 Cambodians known to have been
infected with the virus died.) The researchers tested blood samples from
351 of the villagers looking for the antibodies to the virus that would be
proof of mild or asymptomatic infections. They found no signs of additional
infections, this despite the fact that many of the villagers had
significant exposure to infected poultry. Even a doctor who was involved in
a difficult process to insert a ventilator tube into the windpipe of an
H5N1 patient did not became infected, said Buchy, who noted the doctor wore
no protective gear, because he didn't realize what his patient was
suffering from.
"We didn't find any case of H5N1," Buchy said in an interview. "So nobody
seems to have been asymptomatic or with mild symptoms during this outbreak
in Cambodia." "It was also true with several other doctors and nurses, and
none of them were positive." Buchy said blood samples taken from 2
veterinarians who had autopsied birds that had died from H5N1 showed no
sign of antibodies to the virus either. Like the doctor, the veterinarians
hadn't taken any precautions; they hadn't realized the birds had been
killed by H5N1.
After the 1st human cases of H5N1 were reported in Hong Kong in 1997,
so-called serological surveys -- checking blood samples for antibodies --
were done to see whether all the cases had come to light. At that time, a
small number of people, mainly healthcare workers, were found to have
developed antibodies without having become sick enough to be diagnosed with
the disease. But the virus has changed a great deal since then, and the
virulence of current circulating H5N1 viruses has risen. And experts have
called for more of this work to be done to ensure that the world gets a
better handle on what is actually happening with the virus. Cox suggested
the Cambodian study is a start. "The work in Cambodia is extremely
important, because it shows that we really aren't missing that much," she said.

[This survey provides much needed information on the potential existence of
asymptomatic avian influenza virus infection in an exposed population. Dr.
Philippe Buchy, who conducted the survey, drew the optimistic conclusion
that the results favor the interpretation that human-to-human transmission
of H5N1 avian influenza virus occurs rarely, if at all. However, Dr. Cox is
more cautious in her interpretation, drawing attention to the circumstance
that the situation in Cambodia may not be typical. Only 4 cases of human
infection (all fatal) were recorded in Cambodia during early 2005, and
unlike the situation in neighboring countries, the outbreak did not run out
of control. It is to be hoped that these results will stimulate others to
undertake similar surveys in other affected countries. - Mod.CP]

[2] Egypt - 4th suspected case of human infection reported

Egypt: 4th Suspected Human Case of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Egypt reported a 4th suspected case of bird flu in humans on Tuesday [21
Mar 2006], in a 17-year-old boy whose father had an outbreak of the disease
on his chicken farm in the Nile Delta on Saturday and Sunday [18 & 19 Mar
2006].
Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali, quoted by the state news agency MENA, said
the boy was taken to hospital in the town of Tanta on Sun 19 Mar 2006 and
was being treated with Tamiflu, the drug used to fight bird flu in humans.
His condition was "good and stable," he added.
The teenager was the 4th Egyptian suspected of contracting the disease from
infected birds. Of the 1st 3, one died, one recovered and the 3rd is
receiving treatment. In preliminary tests, the 1st 3 were positive for the
H5N1 avian influenza virus, which can pass to humans who come into contact
with infected birds. Gabali said that 2825 of the chickens at the family's
farm in Gharbia province northwest of Cairo died at the weekend, and the
rest of the 4000 flock had been culled.
The boy had been working on the farm and on Saturday [18 Mar 2006] showed
symptoms including an inflamed throat and muscle pain. The minister said
health authorities were testing samples from the boy for the deadly virus
and examining members of his family and other people who had handled the
chickens.
Hassan el-Bushra, the World Health Organization's regional adviser for
emerging diseases, said on Tuesday [21 Mar 2006] that a sample from the 3rd
Egyptian had tested positive for H5N1. "Specimens have been sent abroad for
a 3rd test. If this tests positive, then it is officially confirmed. ...
Since the 1st 2 tests were positive, it is most likely that all 3 cases
will be positive," Bushra added.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus was 1st found in birds in Egypt last month
[February 2006]. So far, 17 of Egypt's 26 governorates and the city of
Luxor have reported cases, and millions of birds have been culled in an
attempt to stop it from spreading. Veterinary experts say it is difficult
to contain the disease in a country such as Egypt, because so many people
traditionally keep poultry at home, and some parts of the countryside have
a high density of chicken farms. Egypt might have to prepare itself for the
possibility that the disease would be endemic for years, with devastating
effects on an important industry, said one expert who asked not to be
identified.

None of these 4 cases have been confirmed by WHO as yet. Consequently,
Egypt is not one of the 8 countries in the WHO Table of Confirmed Human
Cases of avian influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP]
