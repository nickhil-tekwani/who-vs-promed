In several recent incidents Escherichia coli O157 infections in children
have been linked to contact with farm animals or visits to farms (1-4). In
last week's editorial I asked whether the infection could be eliminated
from livestock? Many thanks to Sam McConkey (of Washington University, St
Louis, Missouri) for telling me about a recent paper in Science, which
describes the effect of different animal feeds on the number and type of E.
coli shed in cattle faeces (5). Bacteria responsible for infectious
intestinal disease in humans have to be able to survive the strongly acidic
secretions of the stomach: E. coli cultures grown at neutral pH are killed
by gastric acid, but E. coli grown in mildly acidic conditions acquire acid
resistance (5).
Fermentation of starch, a major constituent of grain (which is widely used
for fattening beef cattle) in the bovine colon produces volatile fatty
acids, which decrease pH (5). The authors found that the colonic pH of
cattle fed with hay or fresh grass was greater than 7 (i.e., alkali), and
that almost all the E. coli in colonic digesta were acid-sensitive (5).
Increasing the proportion of grain in the cattle's diet reduced the pH and
increased both the total and acid-resistant counts of E. coli. The acid
sensitive E. coli count of cattle fed on grain fell by a factor of almost a
million after they were fed on hay for five days, and the authors suggest
that feeding cattle on hay for a brief period before slaughter could reduce
the risk of foodborne (and presumably faecal oral) E. coli infection (5).
The data are based on fairly small numbers of cattle and do not refer
specifically to E. coli O157. Their applicability may also depend on animal
husbandry practices. Other factors that may increase shedding include
starvation before slaughter, stress, contaminated water, and the season
(commoner in summer).
A recent review of E. coli O157 cited evidence of the organism's
persistence in manure, water troughs, and other places on farms (6). It
acknowledged that people living in rural areas might be more at risk of
infection, because of exposure to livestock. It recommended that ground
beef should be irradiated to kill pathogens introduced into the interior of
the meat (where it is more likely to survive cooking) during slaughter. The
authors noted that humans, particularly young children, may shed E. coli
O157 in stools for several weeks after recovering from diarrhoea, but said
that the implications for public health of such shedding had not been
established (6). Current guidance in England and Wales recommends exclusion
from nurseries, nursery schools, and playgroups for children under 5 years
of age with Vero cytotoxin producing E. coli infection until
microbiological clearance has been established (two negative faecal
specimens at least 48 hours apart) (7).
