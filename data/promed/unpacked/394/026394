[East Kazakhstan is the largest industrial, power, transport, and cultural
region in the Republic of Kazakhstan. It is located in the northeast of the
Republic, on the River Irtysh. In the north it borders Russia's Altay
Mountains, and in the east and southeast borders China. The population is 1
455 400. The administrative centre is Ust-Kamenogorsk with 294 500. -

The anthrax sources in East Kazakhstan are usually sick cattle. The fact
that 9 people are under medical supervision would indicate that it was
either a family shade-tree slaughter or from the sale of contaminated meat
in a local market. - Mod.MHJ]
