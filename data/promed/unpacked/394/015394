It's worrying to see that US food disparagement laws are returning to
prominence: I though this had gone quiet. Are we to look out for tobacco
disparagement laws, firearms disparagement laws, motor vehicle disparagement
laws etc. in future?
While few would deny that the food industry is entitled to legal protection
against (for example) malicious falsehood, how will public health
practitioners bound by such laws inform the public that a product MAY
present a RISK (in the not-infrequent situation where this is still under
investigation but the balance of probability and the need to alert consumers
early point to going public without delay)? They will just not do so if they
are in constant fear of expensive litigation against them or their employing
authorities. It looks like a prime example of private interests overriding
public policy considerations.
Sovereign immunity may be a partial answer where the person giving the
warning is employed by a public authority, but it doesn't help NGOs or
concerned individuals. Are there any lawyers out there who'd like to comment
on whether food disparagement laws could be blocked (in the USA or
elsewhere) on the grounds of infringement of people's constitutional rights
to freedom of expression?

While these laws could be a public health disaster, there is one way around
them. Editiorial comment has been upheld by the Supreme Court as
unabridgeable. That means that you can say anything about the product as
long as you preface it with an "in my opinion", " I believe", etc. It is
inconvienient, not exactly rigerous, but it works. However, it would be very
sad if the health of the US became dependant on word games.

At least in Texas, it would be more accurate to refer to the law as the
FALSE food disparagement act. A warning against a potentially contaminated
food item, based on a reasonable scientific investigation of the facts, is
not covered by the law. The law would not and has not prevented us from
issuing public health alerts when we have epidemiologic evidence to
implicate a food item.
