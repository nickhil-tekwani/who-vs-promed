An outbreak of shigellosis was recently reported in Denmark
associated with the consumption of imported baby corn from Thailand
(1). We report a similar outbreak of shigellosis in Queensland,
Australia that is possibly linked to the Danish outbreak through a
common source in Thailand.
Queensland Health has investigated 11 laboratory-confirmed cases of
_Shigella sonnei_ (biotype g) with most cases having reported either
consuming imported baby corn from Thailand or eating at a venue where
imported baby corn was commonly served. These cases included 2 from
another Australian State, Victoria, who had traveled to Queensland. 4
cases were part of a larger outbreak among a film production crew
where there were a further 43 probable cases (with symptoms including
acute diarrhea with or without vomiting, stomach cramps, and fever
between 9 and 14 Aug 2007), although it was not possible to conduct a
cohort study. Another 2 cases were infected while hospitalized and a
further 2 cases ate at a common holiday resort. All case isolates
were resistant to augmentin, ampicillin, tetracycline, sulphonamides,
trimethoprim, and streptomycin but susceptible to nalidixic acid,
norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and ceftriaxone.
The dates of onset of illness among the 11 laboratory-confirmed cases
were from 9 to 27 Aug 2007. The median age of cases was 31 years
(range 18-76 years) and 7 cases were female.
Results of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) testing of the
human isolates from Queensland show a profile that is
indistinguishable from that of human isolates from the outbreak in
Denmark using the enzyme XbaI and the same running conditions as
Denmark. We plan to run further gels on Australian _S. sonnei_
isolates from the past 3 years to review the diversity of strains. We
also plan to conduct further PFGE using a second enzyme BlnI (AvrII).
The traceback investigation to date shows that 8 of the 11 cases may
have eaten baby corn that was part of a very small consignment
imported in late July 2007 by a single wholesaler in Queensland from
an agent in Thailand. This Thai agent appears to be different from
the Thai business that exported baby corn to Denmark, but the
producer of the baby corn may still be the same, which remains to be
investigated. Microbiological testing of baby corn from current
batches is currently underway, although there was no leftover baby
corn from the original consignment for testing.
Australia is attempting to trace the source of the baby corn with the
assistance of Thai authorities. Onset date of illness for the last
reported case was 27 Aug 2007, and therefore no product recall has
been initiated. Enhanced case surveillance has commenced to enable a
more rapid response to the investigation of cases.

[Given the data, the Australian cases may well be related to the
Danish shigellosis cases. It would not be surprising if additional
clusters occur elsewhere.
Many varieties of corn (<http://ask.yahoo.com/20030203.html>) can be
used to produce baby corn. Seed companies offer special types of seed
to grow baby corn, but all of these grow plants and corn ears that
are just as big as the usual corn. The secret is in the harvesting.
Baby corn ears are picked by hand immediately when the silks emerge
from the ear tips or a few days after. Corn matures quickly, so the
harvest must be timed carefully to avoid ending up with normal corn
ears. Baby corn ears are generally 4.5 cm to 10 cm (approx. 2-4 in)
in length and 7 mm to 17 mm (0.3-0.7 in) in diameter.
Most baby corn commercially available is grown and processed in Asia,
particularly in Thailand. Because baby corn must be picked by hand,
it is too labor-intensive for most western farms. It has been an
extremely important crop in Thailand since 1976, and other Asian
nations have also begun producing and exporting it. Perhaps this is
why baby corn is so often found in Asian recipes. - Mod.LL]
