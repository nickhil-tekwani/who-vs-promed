According to Vitali Sapunov, chief of Kamchatka regional veterinary
services, a mass vaccination of cattle is under way in Kamchatka.
25 000 doses of vaccine against foot and mouth disease virus (FMD) serotype
A, O and Asia-1 have been delivered to the region. There have not been any
cases of FMD in Kamchatka, but there is a risk of introduction by travel
from East Asian countries and by illegal imports of meat from China.
According to the Russian Ministry of Agriculture, Sakhalin and Magadan
regions will also vaccinate cattle against FMD.

[FMD, serotype Asia 1, most probably introduced from neighbouring China,
caused outbreaks in 3 of Russia's far-eastern provinces -- Amur, Khabarovsk
and Primorsk -- from June to September 2005. The control measures applied
included culling of infected cattle and mass vaccinations in the affected
areas, now extended to cover the adjacent Kamchatka, Sakhalin and Magadan
regions. See map at <http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/maps/fareast.gif>. -
