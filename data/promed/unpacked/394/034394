[1] Chile (Los Lagos), suspected

The Epidemiology Unit of the Los Lagos Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial
Secretariat] has reported the case of a 25 year old woman suspected of
having contracted [a] hantavirus [infection], being treated at the Base
Hospital of Puerto Montt. The woman, a resident of the Colaco sector
(Callbuco community), is a direct family member of a previous case of [a]
hantavirus [infection], who was [also] admitted to the Puerto Montt Base
Hospital. This case was a man of 39 years, who died in April this year [2010].

An epidemiological team is today (Friday [7 May 2010]) carrying out an
environmental and epidemiological investigation in order to determine the
risk factors which could have caused the infection, which has not been
confirmed by the ISP [Instituto de Salud Publica - Public Health
Institute]. And so, in Osorno province, there have been 4 hantavirus
[infections -- probably of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). - Mod.TY],
one of whom died -- a man of 48 years, a resident of a locality near San
Juan de la Costa.

In the agricultural lands of the ANCHILE company, in the La Cumbre area (on
the route to Puacho), Monica Winkler of the Los Lagos Health SEREMI
together with a team of health professionals and zoonoses, addressed the
monitoring of forestry workers of the company as well as gave an
educational talk about hantaviruses to the more than 15 workers who were on
the job.

"Our concern is to protect the workers from [acquiring] hantavirus
infections, verifying the environmental conditions such as, for example,
garbage disposal, water or elements that could be incident to the
appearance of the pygmy long-tailed rat [_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_], the
vector [reservoir] of the hantavirus [Andes virus]," said Winkler, who
added, "we could show that the workers have good infrastructure and
adequate conditions."

After carrying out the inspection, with the zoonoses [unit] of the
institution in charge, together with this health authority, they gave an
educational talk to the more than 15 workers of the company, provided
educational material, insisting that self-care measures [such as], "good
garbage disposal [which] is basic to keeping the long-tailed rat away,
ventilation of places that have been unoccupied and also not eating wild
fruits without washing them are measures which could be very useful in
these types of occupations," Monica Winkler explained.

[The relationship of the suspected female HPS case to the agricultural
company and workers is not clear in this report. Presumably, the
epidemiological and environmental investigations were carried out in the
place where the infection may have been acquired. Although not stated in
this report, the hantavirus involved is doubtless Andes virus. Andes virus
is the only hantavirus thus far demonstrated to be transmissible among
family members in very close contact.

One wonders if there was transmission of the virus to the woman from the
man mentioned as being a "direct" family member of hers. ProMED-mail would
appreciate receiving confirmation (or not) of the Andes virus etiology of
this case.

the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at

[2] USA (New Mexico), suspected
Date: Thu 6 May 2010

<http://www.santafenewmexican.com/LocalNews/NM-confirms-first-hantavirus-case-of-the-year>


A McKinley County woman is hospitalized in Albuquerque with [a] hantavirus
[infection], making her the 1st person in New Mexico to contract the deadly
disease so far this year [2010]. The state Health Department says an
environmental investigation will be done to determine where the 44 year old
woman may have been exposed to [virus infection and developed] hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome [HPS].

[A] hantavirus is contracted by breathing particles of rodent droppings,
urine or saliva. Early symptoms include fever and muscle aches, a headache,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough. Health Department
veterinarian Paul Ettestad says officials want everyone to be aware that
[a] hantavirus is present throughout the state and precautions need to be
taken to avoid exposure.

In 2009, New Mexico had 4 cases of hantavirus [infection, probably HPS. -
Mod.TY], none fatal. In 2008, there were 2 cases, both fatal.

[It is unfortunate that this and other reports refer to "hantavirus" as
though there was just one species that causes human infection and HPS. The
hantavirus responsible for this and the previous cases mentioned is almost
certain to be Sin Nombre virus.
