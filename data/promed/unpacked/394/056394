DRC reported 2 #Ebola cases on [27 Jan 2020]. Both were at Beni. There were no deaths reported. Outbreak totals: 3420 cases, 2240 deaths.
2. A little more #Ebola: The @WHOAFRO weekly report is out. It says there were 27 cases in the 3 week period from [6 to 26 Jan 2020]. That's almost the lowest the number for a 3 week period since before the outbreak went thermonuclear last March [2019]. (See figure of cases by H Branswell)
4.@WHOAFRO notes that all 4 #Ebola cases last week were part of a transmission chain that started in December [2019] when someone who had recovered relapsed, & infected 29 people who infected dozens more. This is the last chain; but for that event I think the outbreak would be over.]

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) grew by 2 cases today [28 Jan 2020], bringing the total to 3420, including 2240 deaths. 600 are still under investigation, according to the online Ebola dashboard maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO) [see updated numbers below].

Yesterday [27 Jan 2020] the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) confirmed that one new case was located in Beni. The CMRE also updated vaccination numbers. As of yesterday 7611 people had been vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccine, and 276 520 had received Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV.

According to the latest weekly update from the WHO's African regional office, Beni and Mabalako remain the outbreak hot spots, with 51% of cases confirmed in the last 3 weeks coming from Beni.

"Enhanced surveillance performance has helped ensure faster isolation of sick individuals, which in turn decreases the likelihood of infection in the community," the regional office said. "Continued access and heightened vigilance is required to sustain these gains in case investigation and contact tracing activities."

Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies
Week 4: 20-26 Jan 2020. Data as reported by 17:00; 26 Jan 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------
Event description
-----------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues, with 4 health zones and 7 health areas reporting 28 new confirmed cases in the past 21 days (5 to 25 Jan 2020). Since our last report on 19 Jan 2020 (Weekly Bulletin 3; https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330529/OEW03-1319012020.pdf), there have been 5 new confirmed cases and 3 new deaths. The principle hot spots of the outbreak in the past 21 days are Beni (54%; n=15), Mabalako (36%; n=10 cases), and Butembo (12%; n=4). One health zone, Beni, has reported new confirmed cases in the past 7 days.

As of 25 Jan 2019, a total of 3417 EVD cases, including 3298 confirmed and 119 probable cases have been reported. To date, confirmed cases have been reported from 29 health zones: Ariwara (1), Bunia (4), Komanda (56), Lolwa (6), Mambasa (82), Mandima (347), Nyakunde (2), Rwampara (8), and Tchomia (2) in Ituri Province; Alimbongo (5), Beni (710), Biena (19), Butembo (295), Goma (1), Kalunguta (198), Katwa (653), Kayna (28), Kyondo (25), Lubero (31), Mabalako (462), Manguredjipa (18), Masereka (50), Musienene (85), Mutwanga (32), Nyiragongo (3), Oicha (65), Pinga (1), and Vuhovi (103) in North Kivu Province; and Mwenga (6) in South Kivu Province.

As of 25 Jan 2020, a total of 2240 deaths were recorded, including 2121 among confirmed cases, resulting in a case fatality ratio among confirmed cases of 64% (2121/3298). As of 25 Jan 2020, the total number of health workers affected has risen to 172, still representing 5% of confirmed and probable cases.

Contact tracing is ongoing in 5 health zones. A total of 2112 contacts are under follow-up as of 25 Jan 2020, of which 2017 (95.5%) have been seen in the past 24 hours. Alerts in the affected provinces continue to be raised and investigated. Of 5572 alerts processed (of which 5471 were new) in reporting health zones on 25 Jan 2020, 5439 were investigated and 494 (9.1%) were validated as suspected cases.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
New confirmed cases continue to be reported in Beni and Mabalako and Butembo in North Kivu Province. Enhanced surveillance performance has helped ensure faster isolation of sick individuals, which in turn decreases the likelihood of infection in the community. Continued access and heightened vigilance is required to sustain these gains in case investigation and contact tracing activities.
