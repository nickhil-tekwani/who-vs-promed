A 2nd Japanese encephalitis (JE) case has been confirmed in Chiayi County, bringing to 14 the total number of such cases in Taiwan this year [2017], health officials of the southern Taiwan county said [Sun 16 Jul 2017].

The patient was a 57-year-old man and resident of Shuishang Township [Chiayi County], who developed a fever and a stiff neck and temporarily lost consciousness on [7 Jul 2017] and sought emergency treatment at a hospital. He was confirmed to have been infected with Japanese encephalitis [virus] on [14 Jul 2017]. He is now being treated in an intensive care unit.

The man, who did not live near pig, pigeon, or fowl farms, which are often breeding grounds for mosquitoes, is the 14th Japanese encephalitis case in Taiwan.

A 54-year-old woman in Chiayi county was confirmed to have been infected with Japanese encephalitis [virus] earlier this month [July 2017].

Health officials said vaccination is the best way to guard against the mosquito-borne disease.

[The number of JE cases continues to increase in Taiwan and has now reached 14. JE virus is endemic in Taiwan and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individual above probably had not been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.
