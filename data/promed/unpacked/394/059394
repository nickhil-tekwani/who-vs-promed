South China's booming city of Guangzhou reported 3650 cases of
measles in the first 11 months of [2006], the highest number for the
same period over the past 20 years, the city's health bureau said.
The figure was 88 percent higher than that for the same period in
2005, said the bureau. The measles patients were mostly preschool
children, 69 percent of them under 7 years of age, it said, adding
that the occurrence peak was between April and August [2006]. The
city will carry out free vaccinations against measles for children
aged between 8 months and 14 years to control this outbreak, the bureau said.
An acute, contagious viral disease, measles usually occurs in
childhood with symptoms of red spots on the skin and fevers. The
disease can be life-threatening if patients are not treated in time.
In 2005, China recorded about 130 000 measles cases nationwide. The
incidence rate had decreased by 95 percent since the 1990s thanks to
planned immunizations that started in 1978, with the lowest figure in
1995 of about 5 per 100 000, according to official statistics.
However, since 1995, the incidence of measles has been rising across
the country. The year 2005 saw the highest incidence rate of 10 per
100 000 in a decade. Some provinces were still seeing a high
prevalence in 2006. The Chinese government has set a 5-year action
plan to eradicate measles.
