At least 10 residents Pangke Village, Kecamatan Meral, Karimun were
attacked by chikungunya disease [virus]. "The illness began to
spread, since a week ago, in the Meral Subdistrict. The data
collected indicate that [people in] 2 villages have already been
infected with the illness [virus], 1st in the Pangke Village
totalling 10 people and in the Sidorejo Village totalling 7 people,"
said the Head of the Meral Community Health Centre, Rusdi Hendra, in
the Meral Community Health Centre, yesterday [7 Oct 2008].

Rusdi expected the [families of those persons who are ill], to not
panic because the virus that causes chikungunya will disappear by
itself in several days. "The incubation period is approximately 2-4
days. The virus that causes the spread [of disease] is an alphavirus
transmitted by mosquito bites of the _Aedes aegypti_ species.

He explained that the 17 residents who are suffering chikungunya
[disease] are currently recuperating. Asked about the characteristics
of the disease, he explained, the patient initially experienced high
fever, followed by pain in muscles and joints, and lymph gland
enlargement. Not infrequently, the symptoms of pain in the joints and
muscles are very dominant and sufficient to cause temporary paralysis
[probably inability or unwillingness to move because of the pain. - Mod.TY].

In addition, he said although the disease is not so dangerous [as
dengue], health authorities still are taking steps in anticipation
and are spraying and [treating water catchments with] abate in 2 of
the villages.
