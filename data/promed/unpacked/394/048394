[For a discussion of chickenpox, please see ProMED-mail posts Chickenpox - India (02): (Chennai) 20120415.1102085 and Chickenpox - Venezuela: (DF) nosocomial, vaccine shortage 20150628.3470583.

Chickenpox is usually a mild, vaccine-preventable childhood illness. However, chickenpox lesions are prone to secondary infection with group A streptococci (GAS) (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), and chickenpox secondarily infected with GAS can lead to potentially serious complications.

Scarlet fever is caused by erythrogenic (i.e., causing reddening of the skin) toxin-producing GAS and usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, or the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever). Scarlet fever usually occurs in children. Community-wide outbreaks still occur, as happened in Hong Kong in 2011 (see prior ProMED-mail posts in 2011 on scarlet fever in Hong Kong).

Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever is less than one percent. With proper antibiotic treatment, complications of GAS infection are uncommon: penicillin therapy for treatment of GAS pharyngitis within 9 days of onset of symptoms has been shown to decrease the incidence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF); however, unlike ARF, antimicrobial therapy does not prevent acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [kidney disease].

Plovdiv is the 2nd-largest city in Bulgaria, with a population of 341 567 inhabitants in 2015 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plovdiv); the city of Plovdiv is one 18 municipalities in Plovdiv Province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Bulgaria#Plovdiv_Province). The term "district" in the news report above may refer to the province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Bulgaria).
