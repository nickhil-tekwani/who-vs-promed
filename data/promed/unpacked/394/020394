CHOLERA, DIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY UPDATE 2011 (07): HAITI, UPSWING IN

The months-long rainy season is just beginning in Haiti, boosting the
number of cases of cholera just as critical sanitation services are in
limbo. Cholera is waterborne and often spreads through sewage, making
it harder to contain in rainy, wet conditions. In the 3 weeks prior to
the rains, the Partners in Health cholera center in Mirebalais, Haiti,
saw 500 cases combined, but the weather has brought a new rise in
cases.

"Since the rainy season began in the last 2 weeks, we've seen 1000
cases," said David Walton, who runs the center. While many of the new
cases are less severe than the deadly wave that first hit the country
last fall [2010], Walton said the uptick could be an indicator of
things to come. "I worry that given what I've seen, we could be
overwhelmed again at the cholera centers," he said.

The country is seeing about 2000 new cases of cholera a week,
according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs [OCHA], but a lack of funds for sanitation
services could make the situation worse.

Just 17 percent of OCHA's USD 915 million appeal for Haiti is funded,
said spokesperson Emmanuelle Schneider from Port-au-Prince. And while
some activities are being transitioned to the Haitian government, the
money available is simply "not enough," she said. "If we are not able
to keep sanitation activities in camps, latrines are going to
overflow, it's going to be a source of cholera contamination, there
will be open defecation," Schneider said.

The mortality rate for the disease has dropped to 1.7 percent
nationally, OCHA says, down from close to 9 percent, but the
distribution of deaths is uneven and rural areas without access to
services are still at risk. There have been an estimated 250 000
reported cases since October 2010, and more than 4600 deaths,
according to the Pan American Health Organization.

[It was indeed expected that, with the onset of the rainy season,
Haiti would recognize a significant upswing in the cases of cholera.
This is the rule in the parts of the world where cholera is endemic
such as Africa and the Indian subcontinent. That the epidemic of
cholera in Haiti began in the absence of the wet season underscores
how inadequate the sanitary infrastructure of the country is. -
