The Agriculture Ministry of Zambia is slaughtering 1800 cattle in the
western part of the country in an effort to stop the spread of contagious
bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP). Livestock owners will be compensated at
market value through a fund raised jointly by the Zambian government and the
FAO. However, since the fund cannot cover all animals that may be infected,
strict control on the movement of cattle has been established, especially in
and out of the Selanga district where the outbreak began in April, 1977.
According to the media report, the disease has been reported by neighboring
countries -- Angola, Botswana and Namibia.
