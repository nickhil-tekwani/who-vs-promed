Schmallenberg virus also in Switzerland
-----------------------------
SBV (Virus) has been confirmed in cows displaying fever/diarrhoea from 2 farms in the Canton of Berne.

This means that the virus is circulating in Switzerland and that an increase in the occurrence of abortions or birth of malformed offspring in cattle, sheep and goats can be expected next winter/spring.

[[This 1st confirmed circulation of SBV in Switzerland, following the start of the vector (culicoides) season, may herald a southwardly spread of the virus from the regions which have been affected since mid 2011, predominantly the lowlands, Germany, France and (south) England. Since serological tests have already been developed, results of serosurvey throughout Europe are anticipated with interest. The origin and introduction route of this teratogenic Orthobunyavirus to northern Europe remains to be elucidated. Recently, multiple diarrhea cases in bovines have been reported from north-west Ukraine; SBV deserves yet to be excluded there.

Earlier in 2012, Switzerland reported about herds with malformed offspring which were tested by RT-PCR, and their dams by serological testing, all results found negative (see posting 20120506.1124602). This may indicate that this country remained free of infection during the previous vector season and thus may have currently a fully susceptible animal population.

Switzerland may consider notifying the 1st diagnosis of SBV to the OIE as an emerging disease.
