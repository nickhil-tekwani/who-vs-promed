50 cattle dead in suspected anthrax
-----------------------------------
More than 50 cattle have died due to suspected anthrax in several
villages of Odisha's tribal-dominated Malkangiri district, official
sources said today [9 Dec 2011]. According to the Malkangiri
veterinary officer in-charge Rajesh Kumar Kuanr cattle deaths of
cattle were reported from about 8 villages under Tandik gram panchayat
in the Korkunda block of the district in the past 5 days.

A veterinary team has reached the affected villages and anti-anthrax
vaccination was undertaken in the entire area to contain the spread of
the disease, he said. Besides, an awareness campaign has been launched
in the area asking villagers not to consume meat of the dead livestock
and instead bury them.

Official sources state that the postmortem of the dead cattle would
reveal the exact cause of their death.

[Malkangiri district is the SW point of the state of Orissa and
distant in many ways from the state capital, Bhubaneswa; see:

Orissa was renamed Odisha on 5 Nov 2011.

In general the Indian tribal areas are poorly served by the state
veterinary services and thus situations can be well developed before a
response gets called in. Plus Orissa (for consistency I am using the
old name) has enzootic anthrax in 18/30 districts. In 2005 there were
a total of 6 outbreaks, all involving cattle (32 cases); 2006, 3
outbreaks and 23 cattle cases; 2007, 10 outbreaks with 65 cattle and 4
sheep/goats affected; 2008, 5 outbreaks with 56 cattle cases; 2009, 4
outbreaks and 36 cattle cases; and 2010, 10 outbreaks with 32 cattle
cases. A proactive control and surveillance programme would be more
cost effective than their present reactive response.

Our local members are asked to pass on any information concerning the
confirmation, or not, of bovine anthrax in these 8 villages. -
