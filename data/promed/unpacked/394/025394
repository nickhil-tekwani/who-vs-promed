The Health Secretary of Parana confirmed today the first case of hantavirus
infection in the rural area of Cruz Machado, about 280 km from Curitiba, in
the south of the state.
The victim was a 50-year old female farm worker, who worked at cutting mate
tea plants & transporting firewood for making charcoal. She died after a
severe
respiratory infection with persistent cough, shortness of breath, severe
sweating,
diarrhea & hemorrhage from the stomach (sic).
The Instituto Adolfo Lutz, in Sao Paulo [Brazil confirmed the diagnosis.
Teams from the Center for Environmental Health went to Uniao da Vitoria, a
municipality neighboring Cruz Machado, where they began epidemiological
enquiries and health education for the people.
The first 3 cases in Brazil were discovered in Sao Paulo State in 1993.
Since then 23 cases with 17 deaths have been notified.
