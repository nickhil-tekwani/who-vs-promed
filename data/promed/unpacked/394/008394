The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) on 13 Nov 2015, said a 1.5-year-old buck suspected of carrying chronic wasting disease [CWD] was killed in DeWitt Township [Clinton County]. Now, tests confirm the suspicion.

A sample from the deer was sent to the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory (USDA, NVSL) in Iowa, where it tested positive for CWD. The results were returned Mon 30 Nov 2015.

This is the 4th wild deer in the state to test positive for the disease.

[Sadly, it seems when an area is found to have CWD, there will not be just one case. Seek and you will find other cases.

CWD is a member of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or TSE group of diseases. This particular TSE has, thus far, not shown to be transmissible to humans. However, caution is urged regarding consumption of known TSE-infected meat.

The state has established hunter-killed testing for animals in the state taken during this hunting season. - Mod.TG
