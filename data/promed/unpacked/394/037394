Guatemala: Dengue Fever Alert
-----------------------------
The Guatemalan government put the country on alert for dengue fever on Sat
28 Jun 2003 after 2 people died and 171 others were affected by the disease
during the rainy season, according to reports from that country.
The Guatemalan Health Ministry decided to intensify epidemiological
security measures and called on people to take preventive actions, said the
reports. The ministry also asked people to avoid keeping water in
containers such as pots, which could be a breeding place for _Aedes_ spp.
mosquitoes, the vector of the disease.
According to officials, dengue fever has reappeared in the Central American
country and there have been 2 dengue hemorrhagic fever deaths. One person
died in the south and the other at the Caribbean littoral. However, among
the 1782 presumed dengue fever cases, only 171 have been confirmed. Last
year, 1027 cases of dengue fever were reported in the country, with 51
confirmed.

Germany: Dengue Fever Cases Increasing Among Returning Tourists
---------------------------------------------------------------
The number of dengue fever cases in Germany is dramatically rising as more
people go on holiday to places where the infection is endemic, according to
public health authorities. The Robert Koch Institute in Berlin reported
this week that cases of the viral infection rose to 230 in 2002, up from 60
the year before.
The disease, which is transmitted through mosquito bites, is characterized
by high fever, bone and muscle pain and -- in the most serious cases --
hemorrhage and fatal shock. Experts estimate that about 50 million people
are affected by dengue each year, with about 5 percent of patients dying of
the illness. The Robert Koch Institute warned that there could be a large
number of unregistered cases in Germany, as many people who develop a short
fever after returning home from holiday might not be tested for dengue.
The areas that researchers named as sources of European infections include
the holiday regions of Southeast Asia and the western Pacific. Experts at
the Robert Koch Institute estimate that 42 percent of German cases are
among people who had been on holiday in Southeast Asia, primarily Thailand.
The disease incubates for 2 to 10 days before a mild fever develops. Around
10 percent of those infected develop high fever, with a strong headache and
accompanying aches and pains. In a small number of cases, the illness
develops into dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. This is
mostly observed in children younger than 15 years old.

New Caledonia: Surveillance Report No. 7 (Activity for June 2003)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Number of patients investigated : 742 (since 2 Jun 2003).
New positive cases since 2 Jun 2003 (aggregate 2003) : Dengue serotype 1
(PCR) : 28 (539) Unidentified type (IgM only) : 287 (1778) Total : 315 (2317).
As of Tue 1 Jul 2003, 5147 cases had been reported to the Department of
Health and Social Affairs (DASS) since the beginning of the year, including
2317 confirmed by laboratory tests at the New Caledonia Pasteur Institute.
No new deaths from dengue fever have been reported since early June (13
since 1 Jan 2003).
The decrease in the number of cases, which began in May, has been confirmed
and undoubtedly shows a downward trend in the current outbreak. This can be
explained by the effectiveness of the various prevention and vector control
measures taken, as well as by the arrival of the cool season, which is not
favorable to breeding of _Aedes_ mosquitoes. In Noumea, entomological
surveillance in June showed very low indexes, which confirm this situation.
This apparent calm must be balanced against the undoubtedly growing number
of unreported cases and so is not a sign of the end of transmission, as the
still significant number of cases confirmed each week (45 for the Week of
23 to 29 Jun 2003) prove. Moreover, these recent cases have been widely
spread out over the whole Territory.
In this period in which other viral diseases circulate respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) infection, others are likely to arrive (influenza),
and during which a few cases of leptospirosis have been confirmed (in June
on the east coast), the clinical diagnosis of dengue fever becomes less
specific.
Put on hold during the height of the epidemic, sentinel activity again
becomes relevant and will allow [identification of] those foci that are
still active, once the warm season returns.

Cuba: Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Reported in Havana
-------------------------------------------------
The ecological association NATURPAZ reported that there have been outbreaks
of diseases such as leptospirosis, dengue hemorrhagic fever, mycotic
stomatitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea in the Cuban capital. Osmani Garcia
Ballart, President of NATURPAZ, commented that young children and residents
of suburbs and small towns are more susceptible to illness.
The municipalities most affected by dengue hemorrhagic fever are Habana
Vieja [Old Havana] and Habana Centro [Central Havana], while leptospirosis
has been reported in the municipalities of Arroyo Naranjo and San Miguel
del Padron. Stomatitis has been detected in La Lisa and Marianao, and cases
of pneumonia and diarrheal diseases have been detected in most of the
municipalities of the capital.
The ecologist concluded that these diseases can be prevented by measures
such as water treatment, installation of plumbing systems, cleaning of the
city, and garbage and debris collection, but that these measures will not
be implemented until the [head of the government] gives the order.

[Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) occurs as a minor component of outbreaks of
dengue fever, usually but not always following the appearance of a new
serotype in an endemic region. In 2002, 2999 cases of dengue fever and 12
cases of DHF (one death) were reported to PAHO by the Cuban Ministry of
Health (serotype of the virus not stated). Up to week 15 of 2003 no cases
of dengue fever or DHF were reported from Cuba to PAHO. The statement from
NATURPAZ citing an outbreak of DHF must be treated with caution, since it
fails to mention presence of dengue fever or indicate that eradication of
the _Aedes_ mosquito vector is the principal defence against dengue fever.
Further information from an informed source would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
