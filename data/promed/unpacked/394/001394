Infectious salmon anemia (ISA), already confirmed in Norway and Canada, is
suspected in farmed salmon in Scotland, specifically in Loch Nevis and Loch
Snizort in the West Highlands.
At present, no fish may be moved from the two farms and from seven
additional farms in the same lake areas.
If confirmed, it will be the first time is found in Scotland. All fish
will then be destroyed and the farms closed until disinfection can be
achieved.
