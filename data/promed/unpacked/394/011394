The grocery chain News Seasons Market has again expanded its recall of ground beef products possibly contaminated with _E. coli_, issuing a new notice [Sat 16 Nov 2019]. The Portland-based company is recalling beef products sold from 19 Oct 2019 up to Fri 15 Nov 2019.

The Oregon Health Authority has reported that 4 people have fallen ill after eating contaminated beef purchased at various New Seasons stores. All have recovered. Previously, New Seasons had recommended customers who bought the ground beef between 19 Oct 2019 and 8 Nov 2019 return the recalled meat. But the company expanded its recall dates after more beef tested positive for the bacteria as recently as 8 Nov 2019, according to a news release.

The possibly contaminated beef products were sold with "Packed On" dates of [19 Oct to 15 Nov 2019] and "Sell By" dates of [23 Oct to 18 Nov 2019]. People who have bought beef recently at New Seasons should check the dates of the beef product and check any beef that may be in their freezers.

The expanded recall applies to beef products including steaks, roast, ready-to-cook mixes, frozen beef bones, and in-house made beef products. That includes meat loaf, meat balls, kabobs, hamburger patties from New Season's meat and seafood departments and grab-and-go cases at all of its 21 locations in Oregon, Washington, and California.

_E. coli_ is a bacterium that causes diarrhea and bloody stools. While most people recover within a week, some illnesses lead to kidney failure, causing serious damage to the kidneys and possible death. Those most at risk are young children, people with compromised immune systems and the elderly.

[Ground beef is the classical vehicle for the transmission of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and the original one as reported in 1983:

Riley LW, Remis RS, Helgerson SD, et al: Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype. N Engl J Med. 1983; 308(12): 681-5; https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198303243081203

Abstract
--------
We investigated 2 outbreaks of an unusual gastrointestinal illness that affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan in February through March and May through June 1982. The illness was characterized by severe crampy abdominal pain, initially watery diarrhea followed by grossly bloody diarrhea, and little or no fever. It was associated with eating at restaurants belonging to the same fast-food restaurant chain in Oregon (P less than 0.005) and Michigan (P = 0.0005) and with eating any of 3 sandwiches containing 3 ingredients in common (beef patty, rehydrated onions, and pickles). Stool cultures did not yield previously recognized pathogens. However, a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype, O157:H7, that was not invasive or toxigenic by standard tests was isolated from 9 of 12 stools collected within four days of onset of illness in both outbreaks combined, and from a beef patty from a suspected lot of meat in Michigan. The only known previous isolation of this serotype was from a sporadic case of hemorrhagic colitis in 1975. This report describes a clinically distinctive gastrointestinal illness associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, apparently transmitted by undercooked meat."
