Case Count Update
----------------------
Since the last update on 4 Dec 2015, 1 more ill person has been reported from Pennsylvania. This person did not report eating at Chipotle Mexican Grill in the week before 14 Nov 2015, when illness started.

53 people infected with the outbreak strain of EHEC O26 have been reported from 9 states. The majority of illnesses have been reported from Washington and Oregon during October 2015. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: California (3), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Minnesota (2), New York (1), Ohio (3), Oregon (13), Pennsylvania (2), and Washington (27). Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Oct 2015 to 14 Nov 2015. Ill people range in age from 1 year to 94, with a median age of 21. 59 percent of ill people are female. 20 (38 percent) people reported being hospitalized. There have been no reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome and no deaths.

Investigation Update
------------
State and local public health officials continue to interview ill people to obtain information about foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week before their illness started. To date, 46 (88 percent) of 52 people interviewed reported eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant. The investigation is still ongoing to identify common meal items or ingredients causing illness.

Investigators are also using whole genome sequencing (WGS), an advanced laboratory technique, to get more information about the DNA fingerprint of the EHEC O26 bacteria causing illness. WGS has been performed on EHEC O26 isolates from 29 ill people in Washington (16), California (2), Maryland (1), Minnesota (2), New York (1), Ohio (3), Oregon (3), and Pennsylvania (1). All 29 isolates were highly related genetically to each another. This provides additional evidence that illnesses outside the Pacific Northwest are related to the illnesses in Oregon and Washington.

Additionally, 5 people infected with a different, rare DNA fingerprint of EHEC O26 have been identified in Kansas (1), North Dakota (1), and Oklahoma (3) and appear to be linked to Chipotle Mexican Grill. The infections started on dates ranging from 18 Nov 2015 to 26 Nov 2015. All 5 (100 percent) reported eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in the week before illness started. All 3 Oklahoma ill people ate at a single Chipotle location in Oklahoma, and the North Dakota ill person traveled to Kansas during their exposure period and ate at the same Chipotle location as the Kansas ill person. It is not known if these infections are related to the larger outbreak of EHEC O26 infections; this investigation is ongoing. WGS is being used to determine if this strain is genetically related to the EHEC O26 causing the larger outbreak.
