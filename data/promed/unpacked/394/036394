[1] WHO global update

Update number 352 (based on data up to 29 Sep 2019)
--------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
----------
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was low in most countries and appeared to decrease in Chile after a 2nd wave of influenza activity of predominately B viruses.
- In the Caribbean and tropical South American countries, influenza activity was low overall. In Central American countries, influenza activity increased in El Salvador and Nicaragua.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries except for some countries in Western Africa.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries except in Bhutan, where influenza activity continued to be reported above alert threshold.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity was low in most reporting countries but appeared to increase in Laos.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at interseasonal levels in most countries. Influenza season appeared to have started across the countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses continued to account for the majority of detections, though the proportion of influenza B viruses increased in recent weeks.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 94 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from [16 Sep 2019 to 29 Sep 2019] (data as of 11 Oct 2019 01:51:30 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 63 162 specimens during that time period. A total of 3494 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1946 (55.7%) were typed as influenza A and 1548 (44.3%) as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A viruses, 447 (35.5%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 813 (64.5%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 56 (14.3%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 336 (85.7%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2020 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on [23-26 Sep 2019] in Geneva, Switzerland. It was recommended that trivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/South Australia/34/2019 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Washington/02/2019-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. It was also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus.

Source of data
----------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[2] CDC monitors influenza activity - media report
Date: Sun 13 Oct 2019

The CDC began monitoring the 2019-2020 flu season this weekend [11-13 Oct 2019]. And doctors are urging people to get their flu shots to protect themselves from the virus.

Dr. Jonathan Morris with Columbia Urgent Care said it's also important to get your flu shot to protect the people who can't get it. "All ages are affected. Anyone can get the flu. I would say the most worrisome people in the population would be children and older adults and anyone who is immune compromised. They have the highest rate of fatality," Dr. Morris said.

Doctors advise patients 6 months and older to get their flu vaccines now because it can typically take about 2 weeks for your body to build up immunity. "If you're vaccinated, you are doing the best you can," Dr. Morris said. "You want to make sure you get plenty of rest, eat [well and follow a] healthy lifestyle. In January [and] February, you want to avoid well-populated areas [where] lots of people gather."

According to NBC News, researchers are looking at Australia's flu season, which could predict America's flu season. They said the flu season in Australia was particularly severe with 6 times as many cases as last year [2018]. The 2018-2019 flu season broke records as the longest running flu season lasting 21 weeks of elevated flu virus.

The CDC said symptoms typically start about 2 days after a person is infected, and a person can be considered contagious 3 to 4 days after the flu begins.

Columbia Urgent Care is just one of the places offering flu shots in mid-Missouri this season. You can call your insurance to see what places are covered under your plan.

A child death has already been reported in California, where a 4-year-old with underlying health problems died after contracting the flu.

[3] ECDC report on influenza virus characterisation, September 2019
Date: Mon 14 Oct 2019
Source: ECDC [edited]
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/influenza-virus-characterisation-september-2019


This is the 10th and final report for the 2018-2019 influenza season. As of week 39/2019, 205 947 influenza detections across the WHO European Region had been reported: 99% type A viruses, with A(H1N1)pdm09 prevailing over A(H3N2), and 1.2% type B viruses, with 86 of 165 (52%) ascribed to a lineage being B/Yamagata.

Since the July 2019 characterisation report, a further 3 shipments of influenza-positive specimens from EU/EEA countries were received at the London WHO CC, the Francis Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre (WIC). A total of 1511 virus specimens, with collection dates after [31 Aug 2018], have been received.

The 85 A(H1N1)pdm09 test viruses characterised antigenically since the last report showed equivalent good reactivity with antisera raised against both the A/Michigan/45/2015 2018-2019 vaccine virus and the A/Brisbane/02/2018 2019-2020 vaccine virus. The 613 test viruses with collection dates from week 40/2018 genetically characterised at the WIC, including 2 H1N2 reassortants, have all fallen in subclade 6B.1A, defined by S74R, S164T and I295V HA1 substitutions; 564 of these viruses also have HA1 S183P substitution, often with additional substitutions in HA1 and/or HA2.

Since the last report, 37 A(H3N2) viruses successfully recovered had sufficient HA titre to allow antigenic characterisation by HI assay in the presence of oseltamivir; all were poorly recognised by antisera raised against the vaccine virus, egg propagated A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016. Of the 505 viruses with collection dates from week 40/2018 genetically characterised at the WIC, 399 were clade 3C.2a (with 43 3C.2a2, 17 3C.2a3, 8 3C.2a4 and 331 3C.2a1b); 106 were clade 3C.3a.

A total of 10 B/Victoria lineage viruses have been characterised in this reporting period. All recent viruses have HA1 amino acid substitutions of I117V, N129D, and V146I compared with B/Brisbane/60/2008 (clade 1A), a previous vaccine virus. Groups of viruses defined by deletions of 2 ([delta]162-163, 1A([delta]2)) or 3 ([delta]162-164, 1A([delta]3)) amino acids in HA1 have emerged, with the [delta]162-164 group having subgroups of Asian and African origin. These virus groups are antigenically distinguishable by HI assay. Of 20 viruses from EU/EEA countries this season that have been characterised genetically, one has been clade 1A, 2 1A([delta]2) and 17 1A([delta]3) (16 African and one Asian subgroup).

Also 9 B/Yamagata lineage viruses have been characterised antigenically in this reporting period, giving a total of 23 for the 2018-2019 season. All have HA genes that encode HA1 amino acid substitutions of L172Q and M251V compared with, but remain antigenically similar to, the vaccine virus B/Phuket/3073/2013 (clade 3) recommended for use in quadrivalent vaccines for the next northern hemisphere influenza season.

[Based on the above report, it seems that the A/H1N1(pdm)09 and influenza B/Yam lineage are similar to recommended vaccine strains, whereas the influenza A/H3N2 viruses do not match with the respective vaccine component very well; this will certainly affect the vaccine efficacy in the upcoming influenza season 2019-2020. - Mod.UBA]
