Drexel University confirmed on Friday [14 Mar 2014] that a student died this week from the rare strain of meningitis that hit Princeton University and the University of California at Santa Barbara last fall [2013].

[The 19 year-old student], a mechanical engineering major from the Pittsburgh area, was found unresponsive in her room at Phi Mu sorority last week, according to a letter sent to the university community by school President John Fry. Lab tests confirmed that the rare "serogroup B" strain was responsible for her death, the university said in a statement.

Drexel, located in downtown Philadelphia, is tracking down anyone who had recent contact with [this student] in an effort to provide prophylactic antibiotics to ward off infection, school officials said in a statement. [The student] recently attended a regional officer training conference for the Phi Mu sorority. The sorority's national chapter said in a statement that it has contacted other conference attendees.

Meningitis is generally spread through close personal contact such as kissing, sharing drinks, or coughing. Most college students are required to get a meningitis vaccination, but that does not protect against this particular strain.

After 8 students were infected at Princeton University, the US Food and Drug Administration in November [2013] allowed the school to import a vaccine [Bexsero] that is not approved in the United States but is licensed in Europe and Australia.

In February [2014], students at the University of California at Santa Barbara began receiving the vaccine -- known as Bexsero -- after an outbreak sickened 4 and led to one student having a foot amputated. No one died at either school.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there are about 160 serotype B infections in the United States every year.

[Another student], a biomedical engineering student at Drexel, said students on Friday [14 Mar 2014] were made aware of the death and the risk to those who were in contact with [the deceased student], but were going about their daily business. "I know the school is taking it seriously because they've sent several emails," he said.

[Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B recently occurred at Princeton University (8 cases) and the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) outbreak (4 cases). However, molecular typing showed that these 2 outbreaks were caused by 2 different serogroup B strains, indicating that the outbreaks were not related.

The news report above states that a student at Drexel University died of invasive meningococcal disease caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B. We are not told if there is an epidemiologic linkage between the Drexel case and the cases at Princeton or UCSB, nor if molecular typing has been done or if so, whether the Drexel strain is related to either the Princeton or UCSB strain. The distance between Princeton and Philadelphia is about 45 miles (72 km).

Chemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts whose risk for acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Effective antibiotic regimens for adults include: rifampin 600 mg orally twice daily for 2 days; ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally as a single dose; and ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular injection.

Although there are several vaccines based on the meningococcal capsular polysaccharide that cover serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y, they are not effective against infection caused by serogroup B. There has been no licensed serogroup B vaccine in the US. Because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen, serogroup B vaccines cannot be based on capsular polysaccharide. Vaccines that use outer membrane vesicle protein from an outbreak strain have been used successfully in New Zealand and Cuba to control epidemics in those countries caused by the targeted serogroup B strain, but these vaccines do not cover other strains of serogroup B organisms.

The Bexsero vaccine, a broad-spectrum serogroup B vaccine, is available only for investigational use in the US, and has been used in the outbreaks on the Princeton and UCSB campuses. The Bexsero vaccine contains surface proteins that occur across most serogroup B strains and elicits bactericidal antibodies that can confer protective immune responses (Donnelly J, Medini D, Boccadifuoco G, et al: Qualitative and quantitative assessment of meningococcal antigens to evaluate the potential strain coverage of protein-based vaccines.
