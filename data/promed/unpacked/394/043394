Some of the livestock at McClellan Ranch Preserve in Cupertino [Santa Clara County, California] is under quarantine after the discovery of active sore mouth, also known as the orf virus.

Sheep and goats are hanging out in the park barn until the pox-like virus subsides. A veterinarian and members of the Rolling Hills of Cupertino 4-H Club were on site last week [week of 25 Nov 2013] tending to the animals.

"It is something that mainly gets sheep and goats where they usually get sores around their mouth," said Barbara Banfield, the city's naturalist. The sores were discovered on the lower jaw on one of the pack goats last week.

Early infection will see sores appear as blisters and then become crusty scabs, which are typically found around the lips, muzzle and in the mouth. Sheep and goats can also get the sores or scabs on the lower leg and teats, especially when nursing infected lambs or kids, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

The animals received vaccinations the week of Thanksgiving [week of 25 Nov 2013] as a precaution. The animals typically recover completely from the infections in about a month, according to the CDC.

Sore mouth is not airborne. Humans can become infected with the virus; however, it requires direct contact with an infected animal or equipment that has been rubbed by the infected animal's sores or saliva, according to Banfield.

"An infected person cannot affect another person," she said. "People can get it, but it's not very common."

The disease does not pose a serious health risk. Infection in humans usually shows up as sores on the hands and can last up to 2 months. All those entering the pens are wearing gloves, long sleeves, long pants and boots. Signs were also placed on barns and nearby dumpsters warning that material from the pens could contain the virus. Gardeners are also not reusing animal bedding for compost.

McClellan Ranch Preserve is an 18-acre park that houses a nature museum and community garden, ranch house, milk barn, livestock barn, and replica blacksmith shop.

The Rolling Hills of Cupertino 4-H Club is a part of the Santa Clara County 4-H program and primarily serves the cities of Cupertino, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, Mountain View and Campbell.

[Orf has many synonyms. "Sore mouth," also known as "scabby mouth," or contagious ecthyma, is a viral infection caused by a member of the poxvirus group and is an infection primarily of sheep and goats. Sore mouth infection is commonly found throughout the world.

Clinical signs of orf/sore mouth include:
- Blisters that then become crusty scabs around the mouth early in the infection
- Sores are typically found on the lips, muzzle, and in the mouth.
- Sheep and goats may get similar sores/scabs on the lower legs and the teats, especially when ewes or does are nursing infected lambs or kids.
- Except in rare cases, animals recover completely from sore mouth infections within a month. But any immunity may be short lived, as animals may succumb to this virus more than once in their life.
- Young animals may have difficulty nursing/feeding and may require bottle or tube feeding. Nursing ewes may abandon their lambs, and older animals may also require nutritional support.
- Particular breeds (e.g., Boer goats) may be especially susceptible and have severe infections.

The sore mouth virus survives in soil, and carrier animals may not show symptoms; as a result it is difficult to prevent infection, but using the measures above may assist in prevention.

Sore mouth may be transmitted through saliva. Some owners choose to assist the judges at shows by opening their own animal's mouth. While there is no evidence to prove that this will prevent sore mouth, it is a logical measure to decrease the spread of sore mouth by indirect contact (i.e., from infected animal to judge's hand to uninfected animal).

Currently, there are commercially available preparations of live virus marketed as vaccines. According to the 2001 NAHMS (National Animal Health Monitoring System) sheep survey, approximately 5 percent of operators reported using a vaccination for sore mouth in replacement or breeding ewes. More operators (14.0 percent) reported vaccinating their nursing lambs for orf.

Producers considering using an orf vaccine product in their flock should consult a veterinarian. Vaccination practices vary depending on breed and geographic location. Use of a vaccine is only suggested for previously infected flocks since the vaccination will cause an orf infection in the animals and lead to contamination of the operation with virus-containing scabs. Studies conducted by experts in Scotland suggest that if a vaccine product is used in a flock, it may decrease the severity of illness.

All sore mouth vaccines contain live virus, which, if proper protective measures are not taken, can cause infection in humans. A person who comes into contact with the virus from an infected animal or equipment (such as a harness that has rubbed the animal's sores) can potentially get infected. Some animals may or may not have visible sores but may still be able to spread the virus. People often develop sores on their hands. The sores may be painful and can last for 2 months. People do not infect other people. Sores usually heal without scarring.

Currently there is no approved treatment for Orf infection in humans. However, the sores may be painful and may become infected with bacteria if not properly managed. If you are experiencing pain, fever, or notice that the sore is becoming rapidly larger or spreading, you should see your primary care provider. A laboratory test for sore mouth in people is available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Contact your county health department for more information.

Ways to protect yourself and others include:
1. Wear non-porous (i.e., rubber or latex) gloves when handling sheep or goats, especially when you have an open cut or sore and are handling the animals' mouth/muzzle area.
2. Practice good hand hygiene by washing with clean, warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds (or use a waterless alcohol-based hand rub when soap is not available and hands are not visibly soiled) (http://www.cdc.gov/cleanhands/).
