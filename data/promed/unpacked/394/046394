Following the report from the Office of Epidemiology, Emergencies and Disasters of the Ayacucho Regional Health Office (DIRESA) of a possible case of yellow fever in a young person who died in the Llochegua district, Huanta province, in the Vraem area [valley of the Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro rivers), an epidemiological alert has been issued by that agency for the whole region.

The supposed victim of this disease was a 16-year-old adolescent, who went to the health center in Llochegua presenting with some of the symptoms of yellow fever, such as high fever, headache, pale skin, and diarrhea.

Given this situation, the Director of Public Health Surveillance in the DIRESA, Tania Cardenas Gomez, exhorted people traveling to that area in coming days to get vaccinated against yellow fever in any health establishment, 10 days before going. "This vaccine is completely free. Children over one year of age and people less than 60 years of age can be vaccinated," she stated.

She said the disease [virus] is transmitted by mosquitoes infected with the yellow fever virus. An infected person can present with a variable clinical picture from asymptomatic (without signs and symptoms) or a moderate fever (90 percent) with favorable progression, to serious types of disease with massive bleeding and fatality of up to 50 percent. The disease can be prevented by vaccination.

The specialist recalled that the last important yellow fever outbreak registered in Ayacucho was in the year 2006, in the Vrae area [valley of the Apurimac and Ene rivers], in the Llochegua and Santa Rosa districts, where 7 cases were registered with a 100 percent death rate. [But there have been sporadic cases as recent as 2012 (see comment below).]

[If this case proves to be yellow fever (YF), it doubtless involves the sylvan (jungle or forest) cycle of transmission involving non-human primates and forest mosquitoes. The Vraem area in Huanta province is endemic for sylvatic YF virus, and sporadic YF cases can be expected in unvaccinated people, particularly those working or traveling in the forest. There were 2 previous fatal cases of YF virus infection in the general area reported in March and July 2012 (see ProMED-mail archives no. 20120308.1064957 and 20120801.1225038). Since there are _Aedes aegypti_, efficient YF virus vectors, present in the general lowlands of the eastern Peru area, abundant enough to transmit dengue viruses, there is risk of spill-over of the sylvan transmission cycle into the urban one. That makes YF vaccination of people living in these areas an important preventive measure. ProMED-mail would appreciate confirmation of the case above as a YF virus infection, or not.
