Brucellosis
-----------
There have been 8 ProMED-mail posts (see below) on brucellosis in
Russia in the past 2 years (4 in 2008 and 4 in 2007 -- see below)
that document brucellosis is endemic in the local animals (mainly
sheep and goats) in certain regions, and that brucellosis is a hazard
for the local human population. Outbreaks of human brucellosis in
Russia likely occur as a result of consumption of raw milk or milk
products from infected animals, and occupational exposure to infected
animals' tissues or secretions among farmers, veterinarians, and meat
industry workers.

ProMED-mail Russian Mod.NP attributed the ongoing problem to
"violations of veterinary-sanitary rules, such as: import of animals
without veterinary assessment, lack of quarantine measures for
imported animals, or limited veterinary control over the levels of
vaccine coverage (see ProMED-mail post Brucellosis, livestock, human
- Azerbaijan, Russia 20080518.1658).
