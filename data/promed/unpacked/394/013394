High rate of toxoplasma infections in goats
------------------------------------------
Goat meat and goat satay [marinated meat grilled on skewers sellers have
been experiencing tough times since the City Husbandry Agency revealed on
Thursday the presence of toxoplasma parasites in some goats slaughtered here.
A goat meat vendor in Jatinegara market in East Jakarta said the trade in
goat meat had dropped by up to 30 percent over the last few days.
City Husbandry Agency head Edy Setiarto announced on Thursday that a
investigation conducted in July revealed that 42 percent of 500 goats
tested at the city's 3 slaughterhouses carried toxoplasma, which can cause
reproductive and neurological problems in people [we assume they refer to
congenital infections. He warned that all goat meat must be properly
cooked. Mardi, a meat vendor in Pasar Minggu in South Jakarta, complained
that the announcement was "inaccurate." "I sell meat that I get from a city
slaughterhouse. The veterinarian there always checks the livestock, so I
don't think the meat is diseased," he remarked, adding that he had never
received any complaints from his customers.

[_Toxoplasma gondii_ in husbandry is seen as an indicator of the animals'
exposure to the environment, and high rates of infection are not unusual.
For free-living animals like goats, an infection rate of 42 percent is not
surprising, and the health education message is indeed as mentioned in the
article, to cook the meat properly. Primary infection in humans is usually
asymptomatic except for immunosuppressed persons and for pregnant women. In
pregnant women the infection may cause damage to the fetus if transmitted.
