Excerpt from transcript of CDC press conference on diagnostics
--------------------------------------------------------------
[The following information was contributed by Dr Jay Epstein of the Food
and Drug Administration.]
The FDA has cooperated closely with CDC and National Institutes of Health,
as well as the blood organizations in both the laboratory and
epidemiological investigations of West Nile virus, and we continue to work
cooperatively to develop appropriate responses to protect the blood supply.
Also, we've worked closely with the product manufacturers to expedite
development of necessary medical products, such as screening and diagnostic
tests for West Nile Virus. And I would emphasize that FDA is highly
committed to working with the industry to help bring safe and effective
products to market. More specifically, since August of 2002, FDA provided
alert notices, and then later in October, guidance to blood establishments
on procedures to avoid the collection and use of blood that might be at
risk for transmitting West Nile virus. FDA updated its current guidance in
May 2003, based on experience with the 2002 epidemic.
Also, we've worked with device manufacturers and the blood organizations to
facilitate the development and rapid availability of experimental donor
screening tests for West Nile virus. These tests were put into place in the
areas of highest risk, starting in mid-June and have been available
nationwide throughout the country since 1 Jul 2003. Because of this
screening test, as well as the recent policies on acceptance of donors, the
blood supply is even safer this year than before.
In addition, FDA recently cleared the first diagnostic test for uses and
aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of infection with West Nile virus,
and we're also cooperating with early stage efforts to develop a vaccine
for West Nile virus and potentially to facilitate use under approved
research of a possible therapy, based on use of antibodies.
Regarding the donor screening tests, there are two West Nile virus test kit
manufacturers, namely GemProbe, Incorporated, of San Diego, California, and
Roche Molecular Systems, Incorporated, of Pleasanton, California, that are
making investigational tests available to the blood collection centers
under FDA-approved procedures. Although still experimental, these tests are
very sensitive, and we believe that they can prevent contaminated blood
from entering the nation's blood supply and therefore add a safety measure.
These tests detect RNA of the West Nile virus, and they're similar to tests
already licensed to screen blood donors for evidence of infection with HIV
and hepatitis C virus. In fact, these investigative procedures successfully
identified the first human West Nile infection in an asymptomatic blood
donor, and the products in question were removed prior to distribution,
thereby, preventing exposure of blood recipients. This was also the first
case report in 2003 of a human infection by West Nile virus, although later
reports have indicated that there were some earlier cases.
Now, in regard to the recently approved or actually cleared diagnostic
test, this clearance took place on 8 Jul 2003. It is a test for West Nile
virus antibodies that is manufactured by PANBIO. That's a medical
diagnostic corporation located in Queensland, Australia. The test is
intended to be used along with a physician's examination of the patient and
other laboratory tests as part of a comprehensive evaluation of symptomatic
persons to diagnose the disease. The test measures IgM, which is a type of
antibody that emerges early in the infection. The assay itself can be
performed rapidly, that is to say, within a few hours. Although not a
screening test, it is used if someone presents with symptoms such as fever
or fatigue or a stiff neck. The test was evaluated in over 1000 patients
and very high sensitivity and specificity were demonstrated, in particular
in patients with evidence of neurological disease, meningitis or
encephalitis. However, the test is not in itself a definitive. It's
considered presumptive and must be confirmed with additional more specific
testing, but its availability is thought to be a major contribution to the
fight against West Nile virus. It also has the potential to help identify
the scope and spread of the disease, to determine if there's a need for
further work-up in a patient, and as I said, it is rapid, and so it has
reduced the turn-around time to the reporting of laboratory results.
Let me just mention immune therapies. The National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Disease at the NIH has awarded a grant to accompany a canvass to
develop a vaccine against the West Nile virus [described later by Dr
Meegan]. Also scientists at FDA are working developing a live attenuated
West Nile vaccine and we have projects to try to develop improved assays to
measure the neutralizing antibody that would be expected to be a protective
response based on vaccination, and then we are cooperating with sponsors to
permit investigational use at NIH of antibody preparations that may prove
useful in the treatment of West Nile illness.

Virginia: first (probable) human case of West Nile virus infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Virginia health officials said yesterday that a Botetourt County man is the
state's first probable case of human West Nile infection this year.
Preliminary tests taken on 30 Jul 2003 in Virginia were returned
"presumptive positive," then sent for confirmation to CDC. The CDC results
are expected in several weeks. The unidentified man from south western
Virginia, in his late 40s, was admitted to hospital with encephalitis and
flu-like symptoms. He has since been released and is recovering, according
to the Virginia Department of Health.
CDC officials reported 112 cases in 4 states by this time last year,
compared with 197 cases and 5 deaths so far this year. Last year's totals
were 4155 cases and 284 deaths. Ten states (Alaska, Arizona, California,
Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington) have not
reported a human West Nile virus case since the virus was detected in the
US 4 years ago. Last year, Maryland had 36 cases and 7 deaths, the District
had 39 cases and one death, and Virginia had 29 cases and 2 deaths -- one
in Loudoun County and one in Fairfax County. There have been no confirmed
cases in Maryland or the District this year.
According to CDC, 65 per cent of cases occur from mid-August to late
September because that is also the high season for the mosquito population
and because many people are outdoors at that time. Officials are also
concerned because the virus is moving west, though they expected the trend.
So far, the virus has reached Colorado, which has reported 72 cases and one
death this year. Last year at this time, Colorado had no human cases of
West Nile.

Maryland: blood donor is first suspected case of West Nile virus infection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEWARK (Delaware): Blood Bank of Delaware/ Eastern Shore announced on Fri 8
Aug 2003 that a unit of blood donated in Talbot County (Maryland) in late
July tested positive for West Nile Virus, marking what could be the first
human case in Maryland this year.
Blood bank workers destroyed the infected unit of blood and notified the
donor and Maryland health officials. Additional tests next week will
confirm whether the case is actually West Nile virus infection, said Kathy
Foster, directior of the Talbot County Health Department.
Emily Fowlie, the blood bank's spokeswoman, said that the donor, a young
woman, "did not show any symptoms before she made the donation, though
afterwards, she had a slight reaction. But as far as I know, she's doing
really well now. Although of course it's unfortunate that West Nile virus
was found in our area, we're really confident in our tests and ability to
catch any unit of blood infected by West Nile virus. Our blood supply is
safer than it's ever been,".
Health officials warned the general population to view this case as a
reminder to take seriously preventive methods such as wearing insect
repellent or avoiding standing water in backyards and driveways. The virus
is typically transmitted by mosquitoes. Foster said. "We are continuing to
trap mosquitoes in Talbot County and to date, we have not had [a West Nile
virus-positive mosquito pool]. The case comes days after a Denton horse
died of the virus, and Foster said other Eastern Shore counties, including
Dorchester, have found West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes.

[It is really beginning to look like blood donor screening is an excellent
sentinel system for West Nile virus surveillance in humans. This is now the
tenth location (Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New
Mexico, South Dakota, and Texas in the United States, plus Alberta and
Saskatchewan in Canada)) where a positive blood donor is found as the first
evidence of human infection in an area. This is mounting evidence that:

Utah: sentinel chickens may be West Nile virus-positive
-------------------------------------------------------
Utah health officials sent blood samples from chickens this week to a
national laboratory to determine whether the mosquitoborne West Nile virus
has arrived in the state. [If confirmed this will be the first indiction
that West Nile virus has reached the western state of Utah. - Mod.CP] Blood
samples from the pair of Carbon County sentinel chickens tested last week
"appear to have evidence of West Nile," said Charles Brokopp, director of
epidemiology and laboratory services for the state Department of Health.
However, he cautioned this does not mean the virus is here yet. "We've done
some additional blood tests for the chickens," said Jana Kettering, a
department spokeswoman.
Utah maintains several flocks of sentinel chickens statewide to watch for
the virus, which can be deadly to humans. While chickens rarely become ill
following West Nile virus infection, their blood can show signs of the
virus. Fresh blood samples from the chickens were drawn earlier this week
and sent to the National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Ames, Iowa,
for a second opinion, Brokopp said. Test results should be back this week.
The original tests were run at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Utah
State University in Logan. Kettering said this marks first time in the
state's West Nile monitoring efforts that re-testing has been needed with
sentinel chickens.

New Mexico: 5 more human West Nile virus cases
----------------------------------------------
SANTA FE: There are 5 more human West Nile virus cases in New Mexico,
according to the state Department of Health Wednesday, bringing the number
of human cases in New Mexico to 8. Two of the latest cases were the severe
form of West Nile virus infection. The Health Department says both victims
were admitted to hospital with meningitis or encephalitis. One of the
victims, a 69 year old man from Bernalillo County, remains in hospital.
New Mexico has had no fatalities from the virus. The state confirms the new
cases of West Nile infections in 4 adults and a child from Taos, Santa Fe,
Dona Ana, and Bernalillo counties. Two of the cases are in Bernalillo
County, the state's most populous.

Detection of West Nile virus in blood donations: United States, 2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 2002 epidemic of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States, a
total of 23 people were reported to have acquired WNV infection after
receipt of blood components from 16 WNV-viremic blood donors (1), and an
estimated 500 viremic donations might have been collected (B Biggerstaff,
personal communication, 2003). Because of the possibility of recurrent WNV
epidemics in the US, blood collection agencies (BCAs) recently implemented
WNV nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) to screen all donations and
quarantine and retrieve potentially infectious blood components. In
addition to NAT screening, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
recommended that BCAs enhance donor deferral questions by specifically
asking about fever with headache occurring in the week before donation and
defer persons reporting such symptoms (2). This report describes the NAT
screening process for two WNV-viremic donors and presents data summarizing
the testing results for about 95 per cent of the civilian blood donations
collected during late June to early August. These preliminary data suggest
that investigational screening tests are effective in identifying viremic
donations and preventing the implicated blood components from entering the
blood supply.
Screening Procedures
--------------------
Two commercial WNV-screening NATs have been distributed under phase III
investigational new drug (IND) approval by FDA. The Roche assay is based on
a real-time, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) format (Taqman®), and the GenProbe-Chiron assay is based on a
transcription-mediated amplification format. Both assays identify highly
conserved regions of the WNV genome. Depending on the test format, aliquots
of the donation are combined with aliquots from other donors into pools of
six (Roche assay) or 16 (GenProbe-Chiron assay) for NAT. If the pool is
NAT-reactive, the individual samples that had been combined are tested
separately by using the same NAT-screening format. Some laboratories test
individual donations with no pooling. When an individual donation is
NAT-reactive, all blood components associated with that donation are
quarantined; unused components from any donation given by the same donor
within the preceding 14 to 28 days are retrieved. As part of the test
evaluation under the investigational status, a series of additional NATs
are performed on alternate samples from the implicated donation (that is,
an aliquot from the donated plasma). Additional amplification testing is
usually performed by a second laboratory using a different amplification
format or primers that are reactive with a different part of the WNV genome.
The original donation sample and blood samples collected after the donation
are assayed for WNV-specific IgM antibody to document seroconversion in the
donor. Donor information, including recent travel history, other exposure
history, and review of symptoms compatible with WNV illness before or after
donation, is collected by questionnaire within 14 days of donation.
To assist with national WNV surveillance and control efforts, BCAs share
WNV NAT-screening data with state health departments. Full confirmatory
testing under the IND protocols might not be completed in time to serve
public health needs; therefore, preliminary screening results are reported
to the state health department of the donor's state of residence. Donors
are presumed to be WNV viremic when samples from the initial donation are
reactive in the screening NATs of the pool, reactive using the screening
NAT as individual samples, and repeatedly reactive as individual samples
using an additional NAT. The American Association of Blood Banks, CDC, and
FDA collaborated to request BCAs to report the state of residence, age,
sex, postal code, and date of donation of presumptive viremic donors (3).
Examples of NAT screening process
---------------------------------
Donor 1:
On 25 Jun 2003, a resident of Harris County, Texas, aged 47 years donated
blood locally. A pool of 6 samples, including this donation, was reactive
on NAT screening performed the same day. When individual donations were
tested, this person's donation was the only reactive donation identified
from the initially reactive pool. A sample of the plasma component (that
is, alternate sample) was tested on June 26 by using the same NAT format
and was found to be reactive. On June 27, the BCA reported this case to the
Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services as a presumptive WNV
infection. Subsequent PCR testing using alternate primers and NAT formats
at 3 different laboratories, including CDC, confirmed the presence of WNV
RNA in the blood with an estimated viral load of 7200 copies/mL (18
plaque-forming units [pfu]/mL). Plasma samples collected from this donor by
the BCA 14 and 28 days post-donation did not contain WNV RNA; serologic
testing is pending. The donor reported no symptoms suggestive of WNV
illness either before donation or during the 4 weeks post-donation. On 2
Jul 2003, the NAT manufacturer reported having sequenced an amplicon (that
is, the amplified segment of viral genome generated by PCR) that was
homologous with the 1999 New York strain of WNV. At CDC, WNV was isolated
from the plasma. This donor would be eligible to donate blood again 28 days
after the original donation (that is, the most recent reactive NAT result)
according to the IND protocol.
Donor 2:
On 9 Jul 2003, a South Dakota resident aged 24 years donated blood locally.
On July 10, initial screening of the pool of 6 samples was NAT-reactive.
Testing of the individual donor's sample also was reactive on this date,
and the BCA notified the South Dakota Department of Health. Aliquots of the
donated plasma were tested by using alternate WNV primers and NAT formats
at a second laboratory, the South Dakota Public Department of Health State
Laboratory, and CDC; all tests were reactive. The viral load was estimated
to be 160 000 copies/mL (400 pfu/mL). WNV-specific antibody was identified
in a sample collected 14 days post-donation; the donor reported fever and
malaise from the 2nd day to the 4th day post-donation.
Status of blood donation screening for WNV
------------------------------------------
Of the approximately one million donations screened as of 5 Aug 2003, a
total of 329 (about 0.03 per cent) were found reactive for WNV infection by
using the NAT format. Of these 329 donations, 163 (about 0.015 per cent of
total donations) were repeatedly reactive when tested with an additional
NAT; results of additional NATs for 28 screening test-reactive donations
are pending. The more than one million donations screened represent about
95 per cent of the blood collected in the US during that period; however,
testing was performed on all donations. As of 5 Aug 2003, state health
departments have reported 38 presumptive WNV-viremic donors to ArboNET, the
cooperative surveillance project between CDC and 57 state and
local health departments. These presumptive WNV-viremic donors have been
reported from Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, South
Dakota, and Texas. The remaining donors identified by the BCA community
have yet to be reported to public health officials in the donors' states of
residence or have not yet been reported to ArboNET by public health
departments.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
On the basis of information gathered from BCAs, the investigational
screening tests currently in use are successfully identifying viremic
donations and preventing the implicated blood components from entering the
blood supply. Follow-up testing and data collection performed by BCAs on
all presumptive viremic donors identified by the initial screening tests is
necessary to confirm these infections, but identification of probable
infections might be valuable to surveillance efforts at the state level.
The WNV-screening NAT was commercially developed and implemented during a 9
month period, from September 2002, when the need was identified, to the
initiation of donation testing in June 2003. As of 14 Jul 2003, all
civilian blood donations collected in the US, including Puerto Rico, have
been screened for WNV by using NATs. WNV nucleic-acid detection was
identified as the most efficient means of interdicting viremic donations,
as opposed to donor deferral on the basis of
donor symptoms or serologic testing. In addition, since 1999, all blood
donations have been screened for HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus by virus
detection using NAT-based methods in a pooled screening format. As a
result, testing infrastructure and familiarity with these methods and
formats were in place at regional blood screening laboratories. Although
the technology for NAT of sample pools will probably detect the majority of
viremic donations, the sensitivity of testing in field settings is still
under investigation. As a result, patients who have received blood
transfusions within 4 weeks preceding the development of febrile illness
compatible with WNV infection should be reported to CDC through the local
public health authorities to initiate an investigation.
WNV viremia in humans typically lasts an average of 6 days (4,5) and is
thought to peak shortly before or within a few days of the onset of
symptoms among persons who have WNV illness (6). After illness onset, the
concentration of virus in the bloodstream decreases, and detectable amounts
of WNV-specific IgM antibody increase. During the investigations of
clinical illness resulting from transfusion of WNV-infectious blood
products in 2002, the implicated donors were estimated to have had viremia
as low as 0.8 pfu/mL, and many were asymptomatic in the week before or
after donation. In all cases in which transfusion transmission of WNV
infection was proven, the donated blood was negative for IgM. However, the
possibility of transfusion transmission from donors with detectable IgM
concurrent with low-level viremia has not been excluded.
After the issuance of industry-wide guidelines from the American
Association of Blood Banks (3), which allow for protection of blood donor
confidentiality, reporting to public health officials of presumed positive
donors has been performed voluntarily by blood banks in several states. The
current investigational screening tests are designed to be sensitive for
the initial testing of pooled samples from as many as 16 donors. Because of
the high sensitivity of these tests, public health officials should be
cautious in the use of preliminary test result data because false-positive
results can occur. As part of the protocols for evaluation of these
investigational tests, all blood products from a donation found to be
WNV-reactive on initial individual donation screening are excluded from the
blood supply.
Because the majority of WNV-infected persons remain asymptomatic,
collection of data about viremic donors might serve as an essential
surveillance tool in addition to screening for removal of potentially
infectious products from the blood supply. State health departments
receiving reports of these donors are encouraged to notify CDC through
ArboNET as part of the national surveillance of human WNV infection.

United States: West Nile virus activity; Thu 7 to Wed 13 Aug 2003
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to
CDC through ArboNET as of 3 am, Mountain Daylight Time, Wed 13 Aug 2003.
During the reporting week of Thu 7 to Wed 13 Aug 2003, a total of 240 human
cases of WNV infection were reported from 18 states (Alabama, Arkansas,
Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming), including 5 fatal cases from 2 states
(Alabama and Colorado). During the same period, WNV infections were
reported in 492 dead birds, 212 horses, one squirrel, and 430 mosquito pools.
During 2003, a total of 393 human cases of WNV infection have been reported
from Colorado (195), South Dakota (51), Texas (39), Louisiana (21),
Mississippi (14), Pennsylvania (12), Alabama (10), Minnesota (7), Ohio (7),
Nebraska (6), North Dakota (6), Florida (4), Iowa (4), Kentucky (3), New
Mexico (3), Wyoming (3), Oklahoma (2), Arkansas (1), Georgia (1), Kansas
(1), Missouri (1), South Carolina (1), and Wisconsin (1). Among 383 (97 per
cent) cases for which demographic data were available, 213 (54 per cent)
were men; the median age was 46 years (range: 17 months to 89 years). Of
the 393 cases, 9 fatal cases were reported from Colorado (5), Alabama (2),
and Texas (2). In addition, 2262 dead birds with WNV infection were
reported from 38 states and New York City; 403 WNV infections in horses
have been reported from 27 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming), 3 WNV infections were reported in dogs,
one infection was reported in a squirrel, and 5 infections were reported in
unidentified animal species. During 2003, WNV seroconversions have been
reported in 261 sentinel chicken flocks from 10 states (Colorado, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
and Virginia). Louisiana and South Dakota each reported 3 seropositive
sentinel horses. A total of 1468 WNV-positive mosquito pools have been
reported from 28 states (Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
