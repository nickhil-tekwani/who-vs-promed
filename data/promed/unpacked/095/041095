A Yarmouth, N.S. horse owner wants others to know about anaplasma, a tick-borne disease her horse, Sloane, contracted before Halloween.

"If you see swollen legs on your horse, it means something; do something," said Sarah LeBlanc, Sloane's owner.

Anaplasma causes serious fevers, loss of appetite and swollen and painful limbs. If a fever is left untreated, it can lead to other complications like laminitis, which can damage a horse's hooves. Anaplasma is rarely fatal and usually responds well to treatment.

On Monday (4 Oct 2019), LeBlanc received confirmation a blood test determined Sloane had anaplasma and Lyme disease.

LeBlanc said she 1st realized something was wrong with her 10-year-old barrel racing horse last Wednesday (30 Oct 2019).

Sloane is responding well to treatment of anaplasma. Her owner, Sarah LeBlanc, says she 1st knew something was wrong when she saw Sloane's legs were swollen.

"If you have a horse with 4 swollen legs, it's not the result of an injury; it's got to be the result of a side effect or something," LeBlanc said. "And so I thought I would give it 24 hours to see if it goes away on its own."

Swollen legs aside, LeBlanc said Sloane seemed pretty normal and she was still eating.

But when a horse farrier, a person whose job it is to put horseshoes on horses, saw Sloane that night, she was advised to speak with a vet as soon as possible.

LeBlanc called Dr. Megan Crouse, a veterinarian from the South Shore Veterinary Services in Wileville, N.S. and described the clinical signs. Crouse told her it could be anaplasma, a disease LeBlanc had never heard of.

Crouse told CBC News in an email that anaplasma pops up at this time of year. She said it can be treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications, and supportive care.

Crouse said her clinic has treated between 10 to 12 cases this year [2019], and all have been in the last 4 weeks. She said it is spread through tick bites.

"The carrier must bite and be attached for 24 to 48 hours to spread infection," Crouse said.

Tick prevention is key. "Things such as keeping pastures clipped short, using fly/tick repellent daily, and daily thorough tick checks are all things to help prevent exposure," she said.

LeBlanc said she always checks Sloane and her other horse for ticks. She said there are a lot of them in her area.

"I've been picking hundreds of the ticks off the horses," she said.

LeBlanc posted about the ordeal on Facebook last week and as of Monday [4 Nov 2019], it has been shared about 500 times.

"It's an illness; it's a disease, and you just can't ignore it and let it go untreated," she said.

The good news, LeBlanc said, is that Sloane's temperature continues to be normal, and she's responding well to the medicine.

"She seems happy and content, so she is certainly on the road to recovery," she said.

["Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease caused by the bacterium _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (formerly known as _Ehrlichia phagocytophila_ and _Ehrlichia equi_) that infects white blood cells. It's commonly confused with Potomac horse fever (PHF), which causes similar signs.

"Scientists have determined the_ Anaplasma_ organism typically infects horses from late fall to early spring and is spread via Ixodes ticks (deer tick and Western black-legged tick), which also spread Lyme disease. The disease has been reported in the United States, Europe, and Israel. 20 percent of Ixodes ticks in equine-inhabited areas of the southwestern United States are infected with the organism (Roellig DM, et al. 2012).

"Clinical signs can appear in an infected horse 1-3 weeks after exposure to ticks carrying _A. phagocytophilum_. Fever is the principal clinical sign and might last up to 10 days. Other common signs include depression, inappetence, ventral edema (swelling of the limbs and beneath the chest/abdomen), orchitis (swelling of the testes), petechiation (small purple spots on mucous membranes), and icterus (yellow mucous membranes). Occasionally, practitioners have reported ataxia, recumbency (inability to rise), muscle stiffness, and, rarely, death.

"A veterinarian should suspect anaplasmosis in a horse based on season, clinical signs, and bloodwork abnormalities such as decreased white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count. He or she can make a definitive diagnosis via blood buffy coat (white blood cell) smears showing at least three inclusion bodies called morulae in the white blood cells. However, since these are only visible about 3 days after onset of fever and can be missed on the smear, a negative blood smear does not necessarily mean the horse is uninfected. A more sensitive tool for diagnosis is a molecular test called a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This can detect disease as early as 3 days prior to clinical signs appearing and as late as 9 days after signs resolve (Franzen P, et al. 2005)

"Since it can be difficult to obtain an immediate definitive diagnosis, and because treatments for PHF and anaplasmosis, are similar, many veterinarians pursue treatment prior to confirming infection. Tiffany Hall, DVM, Dipl. ACVIM, associate veterinarian at Brazos Valley Equine Hospital in Navasota, Texas, says, 'Often, as veterinarians, we are able to recognize the classic symptoms and lab results that characterize _Anaplasma_ infection and begin therapy while we wait for official test results.'

"Intravenous antimicrobial oxytetracycline treatment usually helps resolve fever after 48 hours, but veterinarians might need to administer it longer. In a recent report Davies et al. (2011) noted limb edema resolved after corticosteroid dexamethasone treatment on Days 4 and 8 of infection.

"Owners can prevent _Anaplasma_ infection by inspecting horses daily for ticks and applying tick repellent. No vaccine is currently in development, but horses that spontaneously recover might maintain immunity for up to 20 months.

"The more widely recognized PHF can cause similar clinical signs as anaplasmosis of fever, depression, anorexia, edema, and decreased white blood cell count/red blood cell count/platelet count, during the late summer/early fall. The key difference between the 2 diseases is PHF more frequently causes laminitis (15-25 percent of cases), colic (5-10 percent), and severe diarrhea (10-30 percent) and results in a case fatality rate of up to 30 percent (Reed SM, et al. 2004). PHF is caused by a different agent, _Neorickettsia risticii_, a bacterium that infects the horse's macrophages and intestinal cells and is usually spread by ingesting infected aquatic insects (mayflies and caddisflies) or freshwater snails near a water source such as a river."
