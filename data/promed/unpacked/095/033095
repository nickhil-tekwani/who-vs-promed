Over 50 cases of fever have been reported so far in the District Hospital, Panchthar. A viral fever outbreak has hit hard Prangbung, Lungrupa, Memeng, Angsarang VDCs [Village Development Committees] and their headquarters, Phidim. In fact, Angsarang has been the most affected VDC. The number of students attending schools has dropped in the Angsarang-based Jyoti Secondary School after children suffered from the disease.

In the same way, Prangbung-based Kalika Secondary School also faced similar problems after a number of students fell sick.

According to the Principal Lungrungpa Parbat Lal Dangal of the Siddheshwori Secondary School, more than 60 students have remained absent in their terminal examinations.

Health workers said when the symptoms of viral fever are found, then the disease will affect the patient for a week. However, since it is transmissible, most of the people in the village have taken ill.

The number of viral fever patients has increased in the District Hospital. Over 50 cases of fever are reported so far. The viral outbreak which spread in Parbat's southern Barrachaur and Ranipani VDCs has not been controlled.

With the spread of viral fever and typhoid since a week, hundreds of people are being affected daily. A team of health workers along with the medicine has been sent to the affected areas.

Barrachar-based Jana Sewa Secondary School has been closed after the outbreak, while the numbers of students in the Ambari Secondary School and surrounding schools have decreased by 50 per cent. Ambari School's Principal, Ganesh Poudel, said that schools could not be conducted for the whole day as there are very few students, and most of them have been ill. More than 100 patients are reported in local clinics. Health worker Surya Bahadur Karki reported that among them, 80 per cent are fever patients and 20 per cent typhoid.

Similarly, maternal health worker Kopila Sharma said that over 80 cases of fever are reported in the Barrachaur Health Post. Dr Sagar Rajbhandari of the District Hospital, Parbat said viral fever has spread due to climate change and unclean drinking water consumption.

Likewise, Lamjung's Duipiple-ba-sed Bhairavkali Higher Secondary School has been shut after most students were affected by viral fever. The number of students going to school has dropped since a week, so the school has been closed after an emergency meeting of the School Management Committee held today [29 Aug 2012], reported committee chairperson Nirmal Gautam. He said that after the suggestions of doctors and health workers of the nearby health posts, they have decided to shut the school.

Viral fever has spread in Gorkha's Gumda 6, 7, 8 and 9 since Sunday [26 Aug 2012]. With its spread, the local Suryodaya Secondary School was shut for 3 days as the teachers and students have taken ill, reported the school's management committee chairperson Bhim Prasad Gurung. According to him, over 250 households have been affected with at least one member in each family taken ill. Patients have the symptoms of runny nose, headache and fever, reported Gurung. Local health centres have started to face the shortage of medicine after fever spread in their areas.

[The description of the symptoms of the illness is insufficient to suggest a possible diagnosis. It appears to be prevalent in 2 separate districts of Nepal and to involve both children and adults, necessitating closure of schools. No fatalities are reported.
