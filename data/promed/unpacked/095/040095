12 cases, 2 deaths, vaccination program in progress
*************************
Medinfo (a medical information service here in South Africa) is receiving
reports that meningococcal meningitis has erupted in a province of
Mozambique. At least 12 confirmed cases have been reported in the district
of Namuno, in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. Two have subsequently
died.
Reports have also been received of cases of meningitis in the neighbouring
province of Nampula. A spokesman for the Health Ministry has denied
knowledge of this outbreak. A regional, state run vaccination programme
has been launched in an attempt to control the incidence of the disease.
