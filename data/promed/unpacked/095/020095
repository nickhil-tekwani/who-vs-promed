We will be posting updates on our BAH website as we receive
additional information on anthrax this year 2006. Our website address is:

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have
on these investigations.
MN Anthrax Summary 20 Jun 2006:
Two cattle herds in northwest Minnesota have lost animals to anthrax
this year [2006]. Over the weekend of 10-11 Jun 2006, 5 cows and one
bull were found dead in a Kittson County beef herd. A blood sample
was collected and sent to the North Dakota State University (NDSU)
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fargo, North Dakota. The clinical
diagnosis was anthrax, and on 12 Jun 2006, the remaining cattle on
this pasture were given one dose of anthrax vaccine and a therapeutic
dose of benzathine penicillin. This herd had not been vaccinated for
anthrax previously. On 14 Jun 2006, the Board received confirmation
from the lab that the sample was positive for the disease. No
additional deaths have been reported in this herd. The herd is
quarantined for 30 days.
On 15 Jun 2006, another farm in the same township reported a dead
bull on pasture. This beef herd had been vaccinated for anthrax in
2004 but not in 2005 or 2006. Testing at NDSU confirmed anthrax. On
15 Jun 2006, the herd was vaccinated for anthrax and treated with
penicillin. The herd was removed from the pasture, quarantined, and
carcasses incinerated. On 19 Jun 2006, the farmer reported that 3
additional animals were found dead.

[I made some queries of the District Veterinarian, Randy Lindemann,
and the 2 herds are some 2-3 miles apart. The 1st herd had never been
vaccinated, and the 2nd herd of 200 head had been vaccinated in 2004,
possibly in earlier years, but not in 2005 nor 2006. This 2nd farm
appears to be a jumble of pastures and woodland. The 1st death was a
5-year-old Angus bull found on Thu 15 Jun 2006 lying next to a
man-made watering hole some 200 meters from the farm buildings. The
cattle in that pasture were collected up, vaccinated and treated with
benzathine penicillin, and moved to a 2nd pasture. Last Sunday night
18 Jun 2006 -- 3 days after the 1st death was noted -- they checked
the stock and found 3 more deaths; these included 2 cows each in
separate pastures from the dead index bull. These 2 were separated by
a fence but in distant sight of each other. The 3rd Sunday "death"
was another bull in a wooded pasture with standing water found close
to another water hole. From the state of the carcass, he had been
dead longer than the 2 cows. Animals sick with anthrax and fevered
will seek out shade and water in an attempt to cool themselves. All
the deaths on this farm were in the same half-section. The latter
deaths were reported on Mon 19 Jun 2006. As of this morning, Wed 21
Jun 2006, there have been no more deaths.
On the face of it, it would seem that the antibiotic herd treatment
with benzathine penicillin failed. Why, I am unsure, but it may be
related to the mixed cocktail nature of this product (short and long
acting components) and difficulties in delivery. But on further
questioning, it was only the animals in the pasture with the index
case that received benzathine penicillin. As this family has nearly
200 head scattered throughout different pasture lots, vaccinating
them requires considerable effort and time. It is unclear whether
they were completely done with one round of vaccination or whether
they were still in progress when the latest deaths occurred. So these
later 3 may not have received any antibiotics. Also, the spread of
cases from 15 to 18 Jun 2006 is within one incubation period, and so
the primary case may be elsewhere, and the spread could have been via
horseflies. Local chat has a dead horse between the 2 farms. The
latter is being investigated.
I have gone over this before, but Midwest experience to the contrary,
it is pointless treating possibly incubating stock with antibiotics
and simultaneously vaccinating them, as Sterne is a live vaccine and
the antibiotics will rapidly negate the vaccine. LA200 followed 7 to
10 days later with the Sterne vaccine is the optimum for cattle. If
you are handling the animals twice a day, i.e. a small to medium
dairy herd, you can get away with just vaccinating, while for the
next week, regularly checking each and every animal for a raised
temperature; any animal with a fever should be pulled out of the line
and treated with antibiotics immediately and later re-vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ]
