[Hungary was close to eliminating rabies. The last reported case was in 2010, but a case was then reported in a red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) in 2017 (ProMED post 20170310.4893209). Oral rabies vaccination of red foxes (_V. vulpes_) has been successful, but this episode alerts that campaigns should be continued and perhaps improved. - Mod.PMB
