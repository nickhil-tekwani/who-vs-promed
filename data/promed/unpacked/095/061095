More and more people are developing gonorrhea and syphilis in the US, according to a new government report examining cases of 3 sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

The report, released Wednesday [8 Jan 2014] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows that there were 334 826 cases of gonorrhea reported in 2012, which is a 4.1 percent increase from 2011. Gonorrhea is caused by a bacterium called _Neisseria gonorrhea_, which grows in warm and moist parts of the body (including in a woman's reproductive tract). Gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics, though the CDC noted that antibiotic resistance is becoming a growing concern.

"With increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones and the declining susceptibility to cefixime, dual therapy with ceftriaxone and either azithromycin or doxycycline is now the only CDC recommended treatment for gonorrhea," according to the report. "Continued monitoring of susceptibility patterns to these antibiotics is critical."

There were 15 667 cases of primary and secondary syphilis (the 1st 2 stages of syphilis) in 2012. The rate of primary and secondary syphilis increased 11.1 percent since 2011, with most cases accounting for the increase occurring in gay and bisexual men. Syphilis is also caused by a bacterium called _Treponema palladium_.

Fortunately, the rate of congenital syphilis (when an infected mother passes the disease on to her offspring) decreased from 2011 to 2012 by 10 percent.

Meanwhile, the chlamydia rate remained largely the same between 2011 and 2012, increasing by only 0.7 percent. There were 1 422 976 cases of chlamydia reported in 2012. Chlamydia is caused by the _Chlamydia trachomatis_ bacterium.

[The news report above refers to the CDC fact sheet / Reported STDs in the United States 2012 National Data for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis, available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/STD-Trends-508.pdf:

"This fact sheet summarizes 2012 data on chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis published in CDC's annual report, Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance, 2012 (available at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats). The data are based on state and local STD case reports from a variety of private and public sources, which indicate that the majority of cases are reported in non-STD clinic settings, such as private physician offices and health maintenance organizations.

"Many cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis continue to go undiagnosed and unreported, and data on several additional STDs such as human papillomavirus, herpes simplex virus, and trichomoniasis -- are not routinely reported to CDC. As a result, the annual surveillance report captures only a fraction of the true burden of STDs in America. However, it provides important insights into the scope and trends in STD diagnoses in the country.

"STDs inflict significant human and economic costs
--------------------------------------------------
"STDs are a significant health challenge facing the United States. CDC estimates that nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted infections occur every year in this country, half among young people ages 15-24. Each of these infections is a potential threat to an individual's immediate and long-term health and wellbeing. In addition to increasing a person's risk for HIV infection, STDs can lead to severe reproductive health complications, such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy.

"STDs are also a serious drain on the US health care system, costing the nation almost USD 16 billion in health care costs every year.
