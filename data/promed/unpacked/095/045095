As the 1000th Ebola survivor returns home, United Nations agencies working to stop the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) today [Fri 4 Oct 2019] commended the strong leadership of the DRC health authorities and the tireless efforts of thousands of local health workers and partners that have led to 1000 people surviving the disease.

United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres handed Kavira her Ebola survivor certificate in early September [2019]. "I never thought I would make it at 1st, but now that I am cured, I want to go back to my community and tell them to seek treatment early if they are affected, because you can actually survive," said Kavira.

The outbreak, declared on 1 Aug 2018, started in North Kivu and has since spread to parts of Ituri and South Kivu provinces. Currently, active transmission is confined to Ituri in several hotspots -- Mambasa and Mandima -- but the epidemic is evolving in an extremely complex environment, marked by poor health infrastructure, political instability, insecurity, community mistrust and resistance, and ongoing conflict involving scores of armed groups.

Through an integrated UN system-wide approach, the UN scaled-up its efforts in May [2019] in support of the DRC government-led response in the areas of public health, assistance to Ebola-affected communities, political engagement, security, and strengthened financial management.

"Every survivor gives us reason and motivation to continue to enhance our fight against Ebola, but every survivor is also a reminder that there are lives we were not able to save," David Gressly, emergency Ebola response coordinator, said. "We have to continue gaining access through improved security for health workers and populations alike, along with continuous efforts to engage communities to be empowered with the response. We cannot win the battle against this outbreak without the full support of the Congolese people. We have seen how the acceptance of the people of towns like Rwangoma or Mabolio have led to a rapid reduction of Ebola cases there," he added.

[2] Summaries

[MSF (Medecins sans Frontier), abridged, edited]
https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/ebola-outbreak-democratic-republic-congo-october-crisis-update

The current Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is the worst on record in the country and the 2nd-largest epidemic of the disease recorded anywhere. Almost a year after the declaration of the outbreak, more than 2100 people have died from the virus.

The Ebola crisis in DRC continues to pose a threat to local communities, despite a massive international response, promising new vaccines and treatments, and improvements in the medical management of the disease.

Ebola is not the only public health emergency in DRC. The main causes of mortality in the eastern region remain preventable diseases such as malaria and measles. In many health zones, only limited health care is available, as was even before the Ebola epidemic. Many health workers are now missing in hospitals and health centers across the region because they have been recruited by the internationally funded and well-paying Ebola response elsewhere. The staff shortages and a lack of financial resources and medical supplies for non-Ebola medical needs threatens to further weaken the health system and lower communities' acceptance of the Ebola response.

A substantial amount of resources has been invested in the Ebola response since the beginning of the epidemic. MSF strongly encourages actors and donors to consider the wider needs of the population rather than focusing response efforts on Ebola alone.

Key challenges
Ending the Ebola outbreak remains a complex endeavor. While fewer people have been confirmed to have Ebola in recent weeks, the epidemiological data show that further efforts are needed to improve the response. New Ebola patients are confirmed with an average delay of 5 days from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis, a time in which they are infectious to others and miss out on the benefits of receiving early treatment that would improve their chances of survival.

Only 25% of new Ebola cases in the overall outbreak -- 33% in the last 2 months -- are identified and monitored as contacts of people previously confirmed to have Ebola, and 2/3 of direct and indirect contacts are lost or never followed-up with, risking further transmission.

The new treatments for confirmed Ebola patients that are available in ETCs are used under a study protocol framework that does not allow access beyond a particular patient or health worker. Extended use, like for additional protection for high-risk contacts, is not currently supported by the protocol. While confirmed patients and health workers benefit from the medication, their overall use remains restricted.

Persisting fears and misconceptions around Ebola treatment facilities and vaccination activities in local communities pose an additional challenge. Of all deaths, 1/3 have occurred in people's homes and communities where treatment was not available, and people weren't properly isolated to minimize the risk of spreading the disease.

Additionally, fighting between armed groups as well as targeted violence can limit crucial activities like vaccination, surveillance, and contact tracing, community health promotion, and safe burials in some areas. While it is paramount that healthcare providers and their facilities are respected, it is equally as important that healthcare providers work to truly earn the trust of the communities they seek to serve.

Community engagement
Putting communities and patients 1st -- and treating patients as people, not biological threats -- is crucial to ending the epidemic. Community dialogue and engagement must form the cornerstone of the Ebola response.

For many communities across the affected region, the Ebola outbreak is only one of several pressing medical concerns. Of patients admitted to Ebola transit and treatment centers with symptoms like fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, only 4% have tested positive for Ebola, while 96% have other health needs. For most of the epidemic, the response has too narrowly focused on fighting Ebola while other concerns have gone unheard and neglected. As a consequence, health and humanitarian workers risk losing the trust and acceptance of the very communities they are trying to serve.

Where communities ask for healthcare services for illnesses other than Ebola, their needs should be taken seriously and an appropriate response implemented alongside, or sometimes before, direct Ebola-response actions. Several MSF projects have adjusted their approach based on lessons learned since the outbreak began.

In all our Ebola emergency and regular projects in the region, MSF is committed to planning, implementing, and evaluating activities with input from the communities we serve. MSF projects start with an open community dialogue exploring needs and assessing what MSF can do to meet those needs. In Biakato, the community asked MSF 1st to build water points and support primary healthcare before asking for a transit center for suspect Ebola patients. In Beni, MSF decentralized isolation zones to local health centers bringing them closer to communities. All MSF ETCs and Ebola transit centers are supported by community outreach and health promotion activities, including messaging on the Ebola epidemic as well as other key health and hygiene information.

Vaccination
The main vaccine that has been used throughout the outbreak -- one that's produced by Merck pharmaceutical corporation -- is estimated to offer effective protection for 97.5% of participants 10 days after vaccination and is a promising tool in the fight to contain the outbreak.

However, due to the limited use and investigational status of the vaccine, the vaccination strategy is limited to a "ring approach." This means only contacts of people who likely or have been confirmed to have Ebola and their contacts -- plus frontline workers like doctors and humanitarian staff who are most likely to interact with people who have Ebola -- are eligible to be vaccinated.

The "ring vaccination approach" strongly depends on successful contact tracing, which has been notoriously difficult in DRC with an estimated 66% of contacts in the last 3 months not being followed, and 75% in the outbreak overall. MSF supports the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts' (SAGE) recommendations to begin geographic vaccination, use pop-up sites, and expand vaccination activities.

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo Disease Outbreak News: update

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this week with 20 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces from 25 Sep-1 Oct 2019, versus 29 in the previous week. This decrease in the number of cases should be interpreted with caution, as operational and security challenges in certain health zones make it difficult to undertake case detection and response functions. With over half (55%) of cases in the past week coming from Mambasa and Mandima health zones, there is a clear shift in the hot spots of the outbreak from high-density, urban settings, such as Butembo, Katwa, and Beni, to more rural areas with a lower population density. This results in a change in the transmission dynamics, with more community-based transmission and less possible transmission in healthcare facilities. Conversely, this may introduce new issues in terms of accessibility and logistical challenges to reach affected villages, especially as we enter the rainy season.

In Mambasa health zone, delays in raising EVD awareness and involving the community and civil society in the response have led to community mistrust. To strengthen the participation of local communities in the response, WHO is working with the community, civil society, and partners in Mambasa health zone to engage women's groups and enhance community-based surveillance. While in Lwemba, within Mandima health zone, poor EVD awareness compounded with armed conflict has led to heightened tensions between local communities and Ebola response teams. This has resulted in difficulties in investigating community deaths. Therefore, it is likely that the number of cases and community deaths in this area is under-reported.

During the past 21 days (from 11 Sep through 1 Oct 2019), a total of 106 confirmed cases were reported from 13 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), with the majority of cases from Mandima (26%, n=27), Mambasa (25%, n=26), Kalunguta (15%, n=16), and Komanda (12%, n=13) health zones.

As of 1 Oct [2019], a total of 3197 EVD cases were reported, including 3083 confirmed and 114 probable cases, of which 2136 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1790) were female, 28% (906) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (161) were health workers. [See updated numbers in case updates above. - Mod.LK]

Under Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July-December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120-140 million for WHO. As of 2 Oct 2019, USD 61 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019 as well as into Q1 2020. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/funding.

[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Researchers who last year [2018] assessed the infection prevention and control (IPC) capacities at 4 Ugandan hospitals that border the Ebola outbreak region in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) today [Thu 3 Oct 2019] detailed the gaps they identified and ways Ugandan authorities responded to better prepare for when cases ultimately appeared in the country this summer.

The IPC recommendations made to these hospitals came from lessons learned during the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016, the experts said in their Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) assessment. Though Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) should be the 1st point of care for suspected patients, often general health clinics fulfill that role during an outbreak.

In West Africa's outbreak, which was included urban areas, the implementation of IPC practices in general healthcare facilities was critical to ending healthcare-associated transmission, the authors said.

In August 2018, just days after the current outbreak in the DRC began, baseline IPC assessments were made at 4 Ugandan general healthcare facilities that bordered North Kivu and Ituri provinces. A team from Makerere University's Infectious Disease Institute and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made the assessments based on interviews and surveys of staff, examination of facilities, and observation of practices.

The assessment teams found the facilities lacking in several areas, including the use of multiple Ebola case definitions, improper use of thermometers, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), and poor adherence to social distancing measures when screening patients.

"In some facilities, isolation areas were currently in use, and several deviations from best practices were seen, including patients with suspected Ebola being unattended, improper chlorine dilution, and improper disposal of PPE and other waste," the authors said.

The results of the assessments were presented to Ugandan health officials in late August 2018; by September [2018], dozens of medical personnel had received proper IPC training. When a handful of cases from the DRC crossed into Uganda in the summer of 2019, the heath facilities further amped up their IPC practices and stopped further spread of the virus in country.

The authors conclude by stating that IPC readiness at general health facilities is critical in Ebola outbreaks.

"Recognition of this necessity in Uganda led to the rapid development and implementation of a plan to enable general healthcare facilities to promptly identify patients with suspected Ebola and refer them for appropriate management," they said.

Ebola cases confirmed in DR Congo North and South Kivu and Ituri provinces. Cases now total 3197 with 2136 deaths

In its weekly situation report on the outbreak, the WHO said yesterday [Tue 1 Oct 2019] that officials confirmed 20 new Ebola cases in the past week and 12 deaths but warned that the decrease in cases could be misleading.

"This perceived decrease in the number of cases should be interpreted with caution, as operational and security challenges in certain health zones make it difficult to undertake case detection and response functions. An increase in the number of reported cases is expected in the coming weeks once response activities resume in full," the WHO said.

There were no major security incidents reported in the past week, but response efforts in Lwemba, which is in Mambasa, remain delayed after a security incident took place there in early September [2019].

"The lack of response activities for a full 2 weeks in Mandima health zone (Lwemba Aire de Sante) has resulted in a multitude of consequences, as it is likely that contacts are being lost to follow-up, and new cases are not being reported. In Mambasa, delays in facilitating community involvement and providing engagement activities has resulted in community resistance and diminished response activities," the WHO said.

Overall, the WHO said in the past 21 days that 63% of Ebola transmissions occurred in social networks, and 7% were due to possible nosocomial transmission. At various points in this outbreak, nosocomial, or hospital-based, transmission has accounted for more than 10% of cases.

Women and girls account for 58% of the patients in this outbreak. A story yesterday from the WHO's Africa office said pregnant women who survive the outbreak are facing new challenges as they reintegrate into their communities.

Women are more likely to be caregivers in the DRC, and thus be exposed to sick family members, the WHO said. Now, with better treatments, pregnant women who contract the virus are surviving, as are their children. But they can face survivors' stigma.

The community can be reluctant to accept a baby born to an Ebola-infected woman, similar to how other survivors are treated, the story said [see ProMED-mail Ebola update (95): Congo DR (NK,IT,SK) cases, WHO, survivors, vaccine 20191003.6706383].

In other news, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced yesterday [Tue 1 Oct 2019] in a news release that it will support the simultaneous development of individual vaccine candidates against Marburg virus and Sudan ebolavirus infections.

The current Ebola outbreak is caused by the Ebola Zaire strain.

HHS will provide USD 20.5 million and technical expertise to the Albert B. Sabin Vaccine Institute Inc. of Washington, DC, which is working on the vaccines.

The Sudan vaccine candidate is the 1st for this virus strain to receive BARDA support, and the Marburg vaccine candidate is the 2nd for that disease, HHS said in the release. BARDA supports [and] enhances US preparedness for the 2 viruses [see ProMED-mail Ebola update (95): Congo DR (NK,IT,SK) cases, WHO, survivors, vaccine 20191003.6706383].

According to HHS, the most recent outbreaks of Marburg occurred in 2012, 2014, and 2017 in Uganda, with a case-fatality rate of 25%. The last Sudan ebolavirus outbreak also took place in Uganda, in 2012, killing 57% of people infected.
