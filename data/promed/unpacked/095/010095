Bird flu has struck the Sidenreng Rappang regency, South Sulawesi and as of yesterday [Fri 1 Apr 2016], the avian flu virus is reported to have killed about 11 000 birds, mostly ducks.

The Jakarta Post quoted the province's Husbandry Agency head Abdul Aziz as saying that approximately 7000 ducks and 4000 chickens had died, thus far. "The figure is based on reports which we have received. It could be higher," he was quoted by the newspaper.

He said his agency had ordered the Sidenreng Rappang Husbandry Agency to isolate the area affected by the H5N1 virus to prevent the spread of the disease.

Abdul Aziz claimed the province was low in stocks of the vaccine and no longer had any medicine. The agency required a further one million doses of the vaccine as the province was home to about 10 million poultry, he said.
