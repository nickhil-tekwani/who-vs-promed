In response to the ongoing circulation wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in sewage samples in southern Israel, on [4 Aug 2013], the Israeli Ministry of Health officially launched a supplementary oral poliovirus vaccine campaign directed at 150 000 children ages 0-9 [years] in Israel's Southern District. Health officials emphasize that the campaign may in the near future be extended to cover Israel's entire 0-9 year population, based upon ongoing evaluation of the situation. No polio cases have been detected despite enhanced acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance and supplementary surveillance for aseptic meningitis.

Israel has maintained a routine environmental polio surveillance program since 1988. In June 2013, wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was 1st detected in sewage samples in southern Israel. Reanalysis of earlier samples indicated that WPV1 had been circulating in Israel since February 2013, primarily in the Southern District. Upon confirmation of the presence of WPV1 in multiple sites, Israel undertook an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) campaign aimed at bringing all children up-to-date on their routine polio vaccines, and offering a single IPV dose to adults in affected areas. In parallel, in order to inform pending policy decisions, environmental sampling was expanded and intensified, and stool sampling was initiated in the affected areas. These investigations confirmed that WPV1 was circulating predominantly in the south among children aged 0-9. WPV1 has been detected in sewage in several locations in Israel's Central District but in far lower concentrations. Based on these geographic and demographic characteristics, the Ministry of Health yesterday [6 Aug 2013] launched a supplementary immunization program of bivalent OPV (types 1 and 3) focused on children 0-9 [years] in the Southern District. In the 1st 3 days of the campaign, approximately 11 000 children have been vaccinated.

The Israeli polio response, led by the Minister of Health and the Director General of the ministry, has been fully coordinated with leading local epidemiology, infection disease, and pediatric experts, and with international organizations including the WHO and the United States CDC. A joint WHO/CDC mission visited Israel in June [2013], and its experts have been consulted at every stage of the outbreak response. Evaluation and consultations are ongoing regarding expansion of the campaign.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Anis and colleagues for this concise update and clarification of the situation in Israel. Newswires had erroneously mentioned that there had been cases of polio.

The estimate that the wild poliovirus (WPV) has been circulating in the south of Israel since February 2013 raises questions as to how long WPV circulation can continue in populations with high coverages with the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and the ultimate implications vis a vis the endgame strategy for polio eradication.

In 1990, Israel began vaccination against polio using a combined vaccine program with 3 doses of IPV followed by 3 doses of OPV (oral polio vaccine). This schedule was used until 2005, when OPV was eliminated from the schedule to use 4 doses of IPV by the age of 15 months and an IPV booster dose in 1st grade (ages 5-6 years) (ref: Shulman LM, Manor Y, Sofer D, Handsher R, Swartz T, Delpeyroux F, Mendelson E. Neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses in sewage from highly immune populations. PLoS One. 2006 Dec 20;1:e69). Having used IPV exclusively since 2005, information on the individuals found to be WPV carriers, such as age distribution and vaccination history, will be potentially helpful in furthering the policy discussions on the endgame strategy related to vaccination cessation.

This moderator has been a strong proponent of the use of IPV when the risk of exposure to WPV is significantly less than the risk of infection and illness from a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). The information that there has been circulation of WPV in a highly vaccinated population for 5 or more months is disconcerting. There are many questions that arise related to the timing of vaccine switch (OPV to IPV) and necessary monitoring to identify "silent" circulation of IPV at the global level, before vaccination can be ended.

We anxiously await results of investigations in Israel.
