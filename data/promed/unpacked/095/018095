[2] Myanmar: transmission among non-human primates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Nonhuman primates living in proximity to humans increase risks for sylvatic arbovirus transmission. We collected serum samples from nonhuman primates in Hlawga National Park near Yangon, Myanmar, and detected antibodies against chikungunya (33%) and Japanese encephalitis (4%) viruses. Buffer zones between primate and human communities might reduce cross-species arbovirus transmission.

Conclusions
Our study demonstrates the importance of conducting surveillance of peri-urban primates in regions of high arbovirus transmission and the need for less invasive methods that improve feasibility. Future research on molecular epidemiology of arboviruses in humans, NHPs, and mosquitoes is needed to confirm whether exposures result from potential sylvatic cycles of ongoing transmission or spillback events from urban strains. A heightened awareness of new CHIKV outbreak potential in humans living near NHPs in Hlawga National Park is warranted. Buffer zones between parks and human settlements might reduce future cross-species arbovirus transmission.

[It is difficult to tell if chikungunya virus (CIKV) transmission in the above situation is going from infected humans to non-human primates (NHP), is established in these NHP populations with transmission among them and if there is spill-back from NHP to humans. Knowing which mosquito vectors are involved with CHIKV transmission in areas where NHP are infected may provide some clues about the establishment of the virus in these populations and its sustainability there. - Mod.TY]

[3] India: infected infant

A 26 day old newborn girl suffering from chikungunya [virus infection] was treated successfully at a private hospital here.

Dr Amit Nagpal, a consultant of pediatrics and neonatology who treated the baby, said the [baby presented with 2 days of] fever, poor feeding, excessive crying, lethargy, and abnormal eye movement with stiffness of neck. During admission, her cardio-respiratory examination was unremarkable. Her investigation revealed septicemia, hypoglycemia, meningitis, raised CRP, thrombocytopenia, and hypocaleemia.

She had developed rashes over the trunk and legs associated with the dark coloration of the face. On suspicion, the test sent for chikungunya turned out to be positive, said Doctor Nagapal. The baby was managed with intravenous fluid, antibiotics and other supportive treatment. Her condition improved gradually. Feeds were started on day 6 of the admission and gradually built up.

Repeat investigations revealed normal [results]. The baby was discharged in a stable condition after 2 weeks of treatment. On follow-up, the baby was accepting full feeds, gaining weight, and had no complaints.

Chikungunya is a viral disease caused by infected aedes or culex mosquitoes. Its incubation period varies from 2-12 days. The commonest symptoms in neonates are fever, lethargy and seizures.

[ProMED has not received previous case reports of infants infected by chikungunya virus. This is a very young case. The tests used to confirm the infection (virus isolation or serological response) are not mentioned. It would be of interest to know if there were other cases in the child's household that might have been the source of the virus that infected the vector mosquito (probably _Aedes aegypti_) that then transmitted the virus onward to the infant. - Mod.TY]
