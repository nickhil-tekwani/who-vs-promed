Tests confirm Chesapeake yearling died of EEE
--------------------------------
Laboratory tests confirmed on Wednesday a yearling in southern Chesapeake
is the state's first horse to die in 2003 from Eastern equine encephalitis
(EEE).

The horse, kept in a stable off of Ballahack Road, had been vaccinated by
its owner, said Dr. John Sangenario Jr., a veterinarian. The horse had not
received a booster to the shot administered in early spring, Sangenario said.

Tests in sentinel chickens and a mosquito pool in Deep Creek and Western
Branch were positive last week for EEE, a disease spread to humans and
horses [and emus - Mod.TG] through the bite of an infected mosquito. The
mosquito becomes infected after biting an infected bird.

EEE is fatal to horses in 90 percent of the cases. It can cause severe
illness and even death in humans. The disease is especially dangerous for
the very young, the elderly, and those with weak immune systems.

Veterinarians say horses should be vaccinated for EEE at least twice a year.

[EEE is endemic in many parts of the Southern and Eastern United States.
The vaccine to prevent EEE in horses must be given in a series of 2
injections, separated by approximately 3 weeks. Also protective titers for
EEE generally last only for a relatively short time (e.g. less than 6
months). - Mod.TG]
