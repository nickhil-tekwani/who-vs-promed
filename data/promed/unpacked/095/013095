Chickenpox outbreak in adults has docs worried
-----------------------------------------
Blame it on the change in temperature, increasing number of Mumbaikars are being diagnosed with chickenpox. The city's only hospital for infectious diseases, Kasturba, has admitted over 90 cases in the last week. However, contrary to the norm, only eight patients are children and the rest are adults.

Dr Umesh Aigal, medical superintendent, Kasturba hospital, said, "Majority of the patients who have been admitted to the hospital are male adults and most of them are migrants. They may have not been exposed to the virus in their childhood and must have contracted the disease after coming to the city."

Private hospitals in the city do not admit patients suffering from chickenpox, as it is highly contagious and requires isolation. Admission is advised only in cases where the patient has developed complications. Consultant physician Dr Pratit Samdani of Jaslok hospital said, "Chickenpox is mild in children, but it can lead to a variety of complications like pneumonia and encephalitis when adults contract it. A second attack happens only in 10-12 per cent of patients."

Dr S R Shenoy, who runs a clinic in Goregaon (East), said, "In the last few days, I have seen six adult cases of chickenpox, which is ironical. There is a need for awareness of vaccination. Latest recommendations suggest that a booster dose should be taken after four years which not many are aware of."

The varicella virus vaccine has been known to prevent the disease in up to 90 per cent of cases. People who contract chickenpox after getting the shot suffer from a milder form of it. The cost of the vaccine ranges between Rs 1,150 and Rs 1,450 and it is optional in India.

Explaining the cause behind the rising number of cases, Dr Samdani said, "Humidity is favourable for [transmission of] the virus. There will be cases of chickenpox in the next few months."

[Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) -- a herpes virus. It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads easily from infected people to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters.

Varicella-zoster virus also causes shingles. A person with shingles can spread the virus to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. In these cases, the exposed person might develop chickenpox.

A person with chickenpox can spread the disease from 1 to 2 days before they get the rash until all their chickenpox blisters have formed scabs. This may takes from 10 to 21 days after exposure to a person with chickenpox or shingles for someone to develop chickenpox. For most people, getting chickenpox once provides immunity for life. However, for a few people, they can get chickenpox more than once, although this is not common.

Ultraviolet (UV) rays help prevent the spread of chickenpox, therefore people in milder climates should be more at risk of catching the disease. However the peak incidence of chickenpox in India and Sri Lanka is during the hot, dry, sunny season. This anomaly has been explained because UV rays are actually much lower in the dry season compared with the monsoon period. In the dry season, the pollution in the atmosphere reflects the UV rays back into space. Whereas in the monsoon season, the rains wash away the pollution, and UV irradiation is increased.
