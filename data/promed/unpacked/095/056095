The President of the Bio-Bio Cordillera territory called that rural
sectors not be stigmatized this season due to hanta [virus] cases.
This is because so far this year [2010] there have been 4 cases, 3 of
which were fatal, and one not at risk of death, and [information on]
a 5th suspected [of having a hantavirus infection] was released in
the last few hours.

The Mayor of Antuco, Claudio Solar, President of Biobio Cordillera,
pointed out that one must learn to live with the virus because it is
present everywhere, so it is necessary to prevent extreme [risky]
behaviors. Moreover, he referred to statements by the Health SEREMI
[The Department of Public Health and Health Planning] epidemiologist,
who stated that it is risky to live in Santa Barbara due to the
occurrence of cases that are concentrated in the community. In that
sense the Antucano mayor said that this statement is an exaggeration
as the long-tailed mouse [long-tailed pigmy rice rat] is present
throughout the country, so that in his opinion stigmatizing the
Andean areas of the province does not contribute to tourism.

The the leader of the territory, which comprises the communities that
are east of Route 5 South, stressed that the authorities are taking
the necessary precautions regarding the cleanup of areas of risk. He
also pointed out that the tourism offices are giving information to
visitors concerning the lethal virus, with the goal of avoiding infections.
