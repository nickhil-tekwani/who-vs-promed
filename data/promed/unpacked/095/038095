Deaths as a result of measles fell by 60 percent worldwide between
1999 and 2005, it was announced this week by the Measles
Initiative -- a partnership between the World Health Organization
(WHO), the United Nations (UN), the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), the American Red Cross and other organisations
(1). This figure surpasses the target set by the UN in 2002 to reduce
deaths due to measles by half in this period. According to recently
published data, the number of measles deaths worldwide fell from an
estimated 873 000 (uncertainty bounds 634 000 to 1 140 000) in 1999
to 345 000 (247 000 to 458 000) in 2005 (2).
Measles is extremely contagious. Outbreaks in Europe remain common
although fatalities are now rare: 12 deaths were reported in the
European Union in 2005, 11 in Romania and one in Germany (3). In many
developing nations, however, case fatality rates range from 1 to 5
percent, and can reach 30 percent in refugee settings and among
malnourished children. Despite there being a safe and effective
vaccine available for over 4 decades, measles is still a leading
cause of death for young children.
The Measles Initiative, launched in 2001, is focusing on 4 key strategies:
- providing one dose of measles vaccine to all infants via routine
health services;
- a second opportunity for measles immunisation for all children,
generally through mass vaccination campaigns;
- effective surveillance for measles; and
- enhanced care, including the provision of supplemental vitamin A.
As a result of these measures, measles immunisation coverage with the
1st routine dose increased from 71 to 77 percent globally between
1999 and 2005, and over 360 million children aged between 9 months
and 15 years received measles vaccines through immunisation
campaigns. The largest percentage reduction in estimated measles
mortality between 1999 and 2005 was in the western Pacific region (81
percent), followed by Africa (75 percent) and the eastern
Mediterranean region (62 percent). Africa achieved the largest total
reduction; 72 percent of the global reduction in measles mortality.
Nearly 7.5 million deaths from measles were prevented through
immunisation in this period, with the Measles Initiative's activities
and improved routine immunisation accounting for 2.3 million of these
prevented deaths.
The Measles Initiative has now set a new target: to cut measles
deaths to 90 percent of the level they were in 2000 by 2010,
primarily through ensuring children receive a second dose of measles
vaccine shortly after the first. The WHO Regional Office for Europe
has targeted measles for elimination from the 52 member states of the
WHO European Region by 2010. Over 29 000 measles cases from the
region were reported to the WHO in 2004, and the WHO has estimated
that 4850 measles deaths may have occurred in the region in 2003 [4].
The Measles Initiative will now target India, Indonesia, Pakistan and
other large countries who have yet to increase routine coverage and
address susceptible adults through mass vaccination campaigns more
aggressively, in the hope of making further progress in the worldwide
target of mortality reduction.
