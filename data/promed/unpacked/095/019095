A 17-year-old girl from Zeeland has died from complications after contracting measles, the Netherlands Public Health Institute [RIVM] said on Monday [28 Oct 2013]. The girl, who died on Sat 26 Oct 2013, had not been vaccinated against measles. The Dutch Bible belt has been hit by a measles epidemic in recent months, and over 2000 people have been officially diagnosed with the disease. The real total is likely to be far higher because many people do not report the illness to their doctors, the RIVM said.

Three people died during the last outbreak, which ran from 1996 to 2000.

[In a press statement on the Ministry of Health Welfare and Sport website, there is a press release on this case and outbreak: "Since May, cases of measles are being reported in The Netherlands, especially among the unvaccinated population. The last measles outbreak was in 1999/2000. More than 3000 patients have been reported in that period, 3 patients died.

"Up to now, a number of 2016 patients with measles were reported. The actual number of patients is probably much higher because many patients do not visit the doctor. 121 Patients have been hospitalized, including 61 patients with pneumonia and 1 patient with a brain inflammation (encephalitis)." http://www.rivm.nl/en/Documents_and_publications/Common_and_Present/Newsmessages/2013/Teenage_girl_dies_after_measles_infection.

As in previous outbreaks, there has been significant morbidity and now mortality associated with a vaccine preventable disease in a predominantly unvaccinated population group. - Mod.MPP]

In the Chelyabinsk region, for the 1st time in 7 years, 38 cases of measles have been registered, an unacceptable situation according to the Chief Public Health physician in the Chelyabinsk Oblast [region]. Measles cases were reported during September and October 2013 in the Troitskii and Kokinskoi regions and in Chelyabinsk.

36 of the 38 cases occurred in the Roma community; one was the child of an immigrant from Kyrgyzstan, and one child in Chelyabinsk contracted the disease from care providers. These cases comprised 4 adults and 34 children. Of these cases, 28 had not been vaccinated against measles; another 8 had received only one vaccination, and 2 had received the required 2 vaccinations.

The diagnosis of 27 cases of suspected measles, including 17 children in the Stavropol Region during the month of October 2013 indicated that an outbreak of measles virus infection was imminent.

According to the website STRC "Stavropol" on Friday [1 Nov 2013], the press service of the Regional Ministry of Health announced laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis in 11 of these cases. Virtually all the affected individuals had not been vaccinated.

Meanwhile, doctors throughout the cities and districts of the region initiated a number of measures aimed at preventing further spread of the disease. According to the Regional Ministry of Health, outbreaks of infection had occurred in neighbouring regions as a consequence of incomplete vaccine coverage of both adults and children, resulting in multiple epidemic foci. In contrast, the Stavropol region has maintained an annual routine measles vaccination programme, achieving at least 95 percent coverage. However, some adults and children had avoided or declined vaccination, creating a risk of outbreaks of infection.

Vaccination is the only effective measure to protect against this dangerous disease. Measles is transmitted by airborne droplets. Susceptibility to it is very high. Clinically, measles virus infection is accompanied by fever, runny nose, and conjunctivitis. On the 4th or 5th day after infection, a rash appears. Possible complications are pneumonia, encephalitis, otitis [inflammation/infection of the ear], laryngitis, stomatitis [inflammation in the mouth], keratitis [corneal/eye inflammation], etc. At present, a complex of preventive and control activities have been initiated, including home visits. Adults and children found to be at risk will be vaccinated, either at home or at their place of work.

South Sudanese health officials have launched an emergency vaccination campaign against measles after 14 children died in a suspected outbreak of this contagious viral illness in a payam [administrative subdivision] of the Eastern Equatoria state. The deaths occurred over the past week in Lotimor payam. All of the children who died were under the age of 5, state Health Ministry director Elijio Omoro Tahir said.

Health officials learned of the deaths on Tuesday [29 Oct 2013] and immediately lodged a request with the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) for a flight to take health workers to Lotimor to conduct tests to determine whether the outbreak was indeed measles, Tahir said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said that as many children under 5 years old as possible will be vaccinated over the next 3 days in Lotimor. If the measles outbreak is confirmed, the Ministry of Health will put together a statewide immunization campaign, Tahir said.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. South Sudan's Health Ministry said only 9 percent of South Sudanese children under the age of one have been immunized against all the so-called childhood diseases, including measles. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunizing children against measles once between the ages of 12 months and 15 months and again between 4 and 6 years of age.

More than 440 cases of measles have been reported in South Sudan this year [2013]. If confirmed, the cases in Lotimor payam would be the 1st incidence of measles in Eastern Equatoria state, the WHO said.

In South Darfur's El Serif camp for the displaced, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Belgium) has reported 4 suspected cases of measles. Samples have been taken for laboratory testing.

A highly contagious disease, measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Overcrowding in the Darfur camps for the displaced greatly increases the risk of infection, according to the World Health Organisation.

A total of 114 cases of measles have been confirmed in Brazil, 98 of them in Pernambuco, 7 in Paraiba, 5 in Sao Paulo, 2 in Mato Grosso, one in Santa Catarina, and one in the Federal District. According to the Pan American Health Organisation, Brazil had been free of measles for a period of 10 years until the 1st imported case was recorded on 21 Jan 2013. For this reason, tourists travelling [from Argentina] to Brazil should ensure that they have been vaccinated to provide protection against mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) at least 15 days prior to their departure.

The Ministry of Health of Argentina, through the National Programme for Control of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (PRONACEI) has reviewed the various vaccine requirements by age:
- Children 13 months to 5 years: must demonstrate one dose of MMR vaccine.
- People aged 6 to 50 years: must have documentation of at least 2 doses of measles vaccine.
- People over 50 years are considered immune.
- Those who do not have vaccination accreditation will be required to be serology- (IgG-) positive for measles and rubella.
- When in doubt, a dose of vaccine must be administered at least 10 days before traveling.

There are now 4 confirmed cases of measles in Southern Alberta. A large number of possible cases are also being investigated. Already, over 20 people have been treated [vaccinated?] in the triage tents outside Chinook Regional Hospital.

For staff, each person who is assessed goes through a very strict procedure before entering the hospital building. "Anyone sharing an airspace with a measles case is going to be infected and especially if they are not immune or have not been vaccinated," says Dr. Vivien Suttorp, Medical Officer of Health, Alberta Health. The hospital has designated areas within units to ensure the illness does not spread. "We made sure there are appropriate rooms at Chinook Regional Hospital that we call negative pressure rooms, so the air is not pumped in, but out of the building," says Dr. Suttorp.

"Before anyone is taken into a health care facility, they are assessed over the phone or by their family doctor, then they come to the Temporary Assessment Centre at the hospital. Patients are then masked and transported through a separate elevator directly into the designated room," says Dr. Suttorp. When patients are transported to the hospital by ambulance, the vehicle needs to sit for a few hours before it can be used for other EMS calls. "In confined airspace, it takes 2 hours settling time for the measles suspended in the air to not be active anymore, so it can also impact our EMS services if we have a number of individuals who need transport," says Dr. Suttorp.

AHS staff have been working on implementing all of the safety precautions and procedures for a few months to ensure minimal exposure to other patients, families, and staff.

Queensland Health is grappling with a measles outbreak in a prison north of Brisbane. Queensland Health says 4 prisoners at the Woodford Correctional Centre, near the Sunshine Coast, have tested positive to the highly-contagious disease. Another is also highly likely to have contracted the disease. There are concerns there will be many more measles cases at the jail due to the highly condensed population inside the facility.

The Health Authorities will investigate any links between the prison cases and others in Brisbane and across Ipswich. To mitigate further risk to staff, visitors, and prisoners, a mass immunisation campaign will be rolled out at the jail, according to Queensland Health communicable diseases unit acting director Stephen Lambert. "We are dealing with a highly condensed population of around 150 staff and 900 prisoners who work and live in close proximity," he said. "This means more cases are highly likely, as a large number of staff and prisoners have potentially been exposed."

The health authorities urged anyone born in or after 1966 who has visited the Woodford prison since 21 Oct 2013 to check their immunisation status.

Measles infection causes fever, cough, and a red spotty rash. Anyone that has been at the prison and has symptoms should contact a GP immediately, Queensland Health says.
