Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update - [20 Apr 2014]
------------------------
On [18 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health of Greece reported one laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The following details were provided to WHO by the Ministry of Health, Greece, on [18 Apr 2014]:

The patient is a 69-year old male Greek citizen residing in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, who travelled back to Greece on [17 Apr 2014]. While in Jeddah, the patient consulted a hospital on [8 and 10 Apr 2014] for a febrile illness with diarrhoea, and was given a probable diagnosis of typhoid fever. Of note, he regularly visited his wife who was hospitalised from[ 31 Mar 2014 to 5 Apr 2014] in the same hospital for a confirmed typhoid fever.

The patient sought medical care upon arrival in Greece on [17 Apr 2014]. The evaluation revealed a bilateral pneumonia and the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was made at the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza. The patient is in stable condition and is receiving appropriate treatment.

This is the 1st case of MERS-CoV infection in the country.

Individuals who had close contacts with the case in the plane, the hospital in Greece and in the community have been identified and are being followed up. So far, none of the contacts became ill. Hellenic health authorities issued a press release to inform the population and informed all Greek hospitals on measures that need be taken to identify suspect patients and implement appropriate preventive measures.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 250 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 93 deaths.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients - regardless of their diagnosis - in all work practices all the time.

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[From the above history, it appears that this MERS-CoV infection is related to the nosocomial outbreak(s) in Jeddah. It would be interesting to know it the patient's wife was hospitalized in one of the hospitals with known laboratory confirmed case(s) of MERS-CoV infection, or if she had contact with other patients (or healthcare workers) that had clinical illness compatible with MERS-CoV infection. If not, a next step would be to identify if any staff or patients with whom she/they had contact with were asymptomatic contacts of yet other MERS-CoV infected individuals. The opportunity to further identify and describe potential chains of transmission of the MERS-CoV should not be missed.

Press conference with the Scientific Committee, headed by the Minister of Health - 20 Apr 2014
-----------------------
The Minister of Health Dr. Abdullah Al rabi'a revealed there were 13 new cases of MERS Co-V confirmed, including 7 cases in Jeddah, 4 in Riyadh, one in Al Madina Al Monawwarah and one in Najran, bringing the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in the Kingdom to 244. The Minister assured [the public] that the ministry is working as hard as it could to contain the virus, giving assurances that the ministry is read for the Hajj and Umrah seasons with what it has of wide experiences as it became a scientific reference in mass gathering health issues.

This was revealed during a press conference the Minister held this afternoon [20 Apr 2014] with the presence of members of the National Scientific committee of infectious diseases[NSCID], and the national committees for fighting infections. The minister announced that the NSCID assured that the procedures currently undertaken in the health facilities are according to international and national standards for infection fighting [control], and there is no need for any additions for preparation as all tools and supplies are available to deal with cases.

The Minister addressed concerns by stating that no cases have been found at schools, which he considered a very positive sign, and that the reported cases among healthcare workers are in decline, as is mortality rates - which decreased from 60 percent at the beginning of the emergence of the virus to 35 percent last week, to 32 percent today [20 Apr 2014].

The Minister projects an increase in the number of confirmed cases in the coming few weeks as a result of the epidemiological investigations. The Minister indicated that 20 000 individuals have been tested for MERS-CoV, showing the magnitude of the work the Ministry is doing. The minister announced that the NSCID, and with the vote of all its members - who represent most of the country's Ministries and Health Sectors as well as private sector - will conduct a daily meeting to be continuously updated about the virus.

The Minister indicated that the ministry invited 22 experts from the WHO and Centers for Disease Control in Europe, America and East Asia, as well as experts from the Gulf region cooperation council to meet at the end of this week at the Ministry of Health headquarters to review these cases and come up with new recommendations. The Ministry also invited national and international experts as well as 5 international vaccine manufacturing companies to meet with the Ministry of Health to investigate possibilities to find a vaccine with the information currently known about the virus.

The NSCID mentioned that total number of cases confirmed in the province of Jeddah has reached 64, including 12 deaths bringing the case fatality rate in Jeddah to 18 percent and the overall mortality due to MERS-CoV infection in the Kingdom to 32 percent.

The committee also announced the total numbers of cases in the following health sectors: Defence Ministries, National Guard, Interior, Health and the Private Sector, University Hospitals and Saudi Aramco:
- MOH hospitals 103 cases,
- Ministry of Defence 46 cases
- National Guard Hospitals 30 cases
- Public Security Forces Hospitals 6 cases
- University Hospital 6 cases
- Aramco 14 cases
- Private Sector Hospitals 26 cases
- King Faisal Specialized Hospitals in Riyadh and Jeddah 13 cases

and this is since the 1st detection of the disease back in 2012, bringing the total to 244 cases, noting that the cases in the MOH hospitals includes patients and people who interacted with cases ["contacts"] whether they were in MOH hospitals or not.

The Minster stressed to the Committee that he and the MOH will provide all members of the community, the media and social networking guidelines of health and medical advice on the MERS-CoV and inform them of the developments in this field. They invite everyone to access the link on the disease through the Ministry's website <www.moh.gov.sa / coronanew>, or communicate via toll-free phone 800 249 4444 or center 937, or by contacting the Ministry in Twitter saudimoh @, and wish for all health and safety.

The Minister also mentioned that some of the allegations of medical in finding a cure for the disease or eliminate the virus in ambulances the committee said that there is no scientific evidence for this information. The SCNID confirmed that there was no vaccine or preventive treatment as yet, and as yet the source of contagion s unknown, and it is not as yet known how infection is transmitted from one person to another. The research is still ongoing with regard to the basic knowledge on the source of infection. Samples have been taken in several regions of the Kingdom and results are still pending.

[As mentioned above, the total global tally of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections is now over 300. Noteworthy is that according to the line listing of reported laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection this moderator has been keeping, there have been a total of 95 new cases reported since 1 Apr 2014 (over a 3 week period), including 17 deaths. Cases have been reported by Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan, Malaysia and Greece and one from Yemen that has not as yet been confirmed by official sources outside of media reports. During this period there has been an ongoing outbreak in hospital(s) in Jeddah Saudi Arabia (64 cases including 12 deaths, ongoing diagnoses of cases in Riyadh (16 cases including 2 deaths) with no apparent clustering (from limited information that is available) as well as 14 individuals in the UAE who had known contact with a single healthcare worker who died of MERS-CoV associated illness. In contrast, in April 2013 there were no cases report, but in May 2013 there was the nosocomial outbreak(s) in the Eastern Province, with 28 cases including 15 deaths. There is the suggestion of possible seasonality, but no confirmation of that. What awaits to be seen is whether this apparent "explosion" in the numbers of cases of MERS-CoV infection this month (April 2014) is a result of either a change in the virus itself with enhanced numbers of human infections, the appearance of superspreaders contributing to the increased transmission of virus between contacts, or perhaps more a function of the adage "seek and ye shall find", and there is more active surveillance ongoing now than previously. One suspects there is quite possibly a mix of all these possibilities contributing to the observed major increase in MERS-CoV infections. - Mod.MPP]
