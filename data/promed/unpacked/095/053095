Glanders, equidae: cross reaction, serology (UAE)
-------------------------------------------------
False positive results and cross reactions in the complement fixation
test (CFT) for glanders have been documented since many years and are
mentioned in the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals of the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE).

During the last 15 years the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory
(CVRL) in Dubai, an OIE Reference Laboratory for glanders, has tested
in excess of 50 000 equine sera for glanders. Less than 1 percent of
those sera showed cross reactions in the CFT, leading to unnecessary
movement restrictions and quarantine measures. Therefore, more
specific tests have been developed and were introduced into laboratory
practice, like western blot and cELISA. Currently more than 100
positive and inconclusive sera are being tested for antibodies to
_Burkholderia mallei_ (_B. mallei_) at 2 OIE Reference Laboratories
(Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Dubai, UAE, and the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Jena, Germany) and the Veterinary
Laboratory Agency, Surrey, UK, using different Antigens (CCPro, Ames,
Dubai7) and testing methods like western blot, CFT, and cELISA.

Almost all of the cross reacting samples have been tested negative
using the CVRL developed cELISA.

The cELISA also detects antibodies to _B. mallei_ earlier than the CFT
as shown in cases confirmed by clinical and pathological evidence or
agent identification in the recent outbreak in Bahrain. Hence, it is
recommended to include the cELISA test in the Terrestrial Manual of
the OIE.

Certain false positive reactions in the CFT for glanders may be
attributed to cross reactions caused by bacterial species, closely
related to _Burkholderia_. Therefore the CVRL has started an
immunization trial in horses and camels with killed bacterial
suspensions, which include several _Pseudomonas_ and _Pasteurella_
strains. In the light of recent reports from Belgium also equine
related _Streptococcus_ strains will be included in this study.

14.5 percent of donkey and mule sera, collected during a survey in the
UAE showed anticomplementary reactions in the CFT; hence the CVRL
presently intents to validate the glanders cELISA in donkeys.

The donkeys, which tested positive in the glanders CFT were
subsequently euthanized and did not show any clinical lesions in post
mortem and no _B. mallei_ was isolated.

[Earlier this year (2011), positive CF glanders tests which turned out
to be false positives by the additionally performed western blot
tests, were reported from Switzerland (ex Lebanon) and from Belgium
(ex Netherlands); see archived posts 20110729.2282 and 20110929.2946.

At present, 2 tests are prescribed by the OIE for international trade
in equines, namely the mallein test and CF. The report on the Belgian
observations, submitted by Dr Pierre Wattiau et al, included the
following comment: "Inter-laboratory variations in glanders CFT titers
originate from the absence of an international standard serum and the
use of antigens of different strain blends in individual
laboratories." This was interpreted by ProMED-mail as a call for
improved international standardisation of glanders diagnostic
biologicals.

Chapter 2.5.11. "Glanders" in OIE Terrestrial Manual 2008 includes the
following statement:
"A competitive ELISA that uses an uncharacterised
anti-lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody has also been developed
and found to be similar to the CF test in performance (15). Continuing
development of monoclonal antibody reagents specific for _B. mallei_
antigenic components offers the potential for more specific ELISAs in
the foreseeable future that will help resolve questionable test
results of quarantined imported horses (4, 7, 18, 25). At this time,
none of these tests has been validated."

[It is well recognized that immunologic cross reactivity in both
complement fixation antibody assays and the glanders delayed-type
hypersensitivity skin (mallein) test can be found between
_Burkholderia mallei_ and other bacterial species may occur,
particularly with the closely related agent of melioidosis, _B.
pseudomallei_ (which causes infections in humans and a variety of
animals including horses) but also with the taxonomically unrelated
_Streptococcus equi_ var. _equi_ (the agent that causes equine
strangles). Melioidosis primarily occurs in South East Asia and the
Northern Territory of Australia thus has a limited geographic range.
Strangles is found worldwide so that cross-reactivity in diagnostic
testing can be more problematic.

A recent German publication (1) compared 3 commercially available CF
tests for glanders and found high specificity of all 3 tests (100,
97.5 and 96.5 percent) using sera from animals from non-endemic areas
as a group of controls but it is not stated in the abstract if animals
from melioidosis-endemic areas or those with strangles were used as
controls as well. Another German study (2) also published this year,
reported that a Western blot assay (using partially purified
lipopolysaccharide of _B. mallei_) showed a higher specificity and
recommended this test as a confirmatory one with CF being the test pf
choice for screening.
