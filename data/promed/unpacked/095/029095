The One Health Center of Excellence for Research and Training in UF's [University of Florida] Emerging Pathogens Institute, in collaboration with US and Mongolian institutions, has identified the 1st known case of an equine influenza virus in camels. Their findings will be published in the December [2014] issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, but an ahead of print version of the report is available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/12/14-0435_article.

"Over the last 10 years, we've been amazed at all the cross-species jumps of influenza. Now we're finding yet another," said Gregory C. Gray, center director and environmental and global health professor in UF's College of Public Health and Health Professions.

Although there is no immediate risk, the inter-mammalian transmission of the virus is a major concern for public health researchers interested in controlling the threat of pandemic influenza, he said.

Camels [dromedary] have recently been implicated in the transfer of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome virus to man. This new discovery further demonstrates the potential role of camels in the ecology of zoonotic diseases, which are passed from animals to humans.
"Similar influenza viruses can move from horses to humans," Gray said. "If a camel has it, why couldn't they share it with humans?"

The study took place in 2012 in 3 Mongolian aimags, or provinces, where free-range [Bactrian] camels and horses intermingle. Hundreds of camel and horse nasal samples were collected, and one camel specimen was confirmed to have influenza A. Tests found it matched viruses in Mongolian horses.

This also illustrates the importance of improved surveillance for zoonotic diseases in camels to better understand the potential risk to humans, he said. "It adds another potential exposure to man where a novel virus could hide out, if you will, in camels and later surprise us and infect humans," Gray said. This could affect animal caretakers, especially in places where people have close contact with camels, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Australia.

More research is necessary to fully understand the virus -- for example, how it's transmitted -- but Gray said the discovery "adds another dimension to what we do." "Knowing that influenza virus can jump between horses and camels will reshape how we understand the ecology of novel influenza viruses which may affect man," he said.

[Bactrian (double-humped) camels, mainly kept in central Asia, make up about 10 percent of the world's camel population; most of the world's camels, present in the Middle East, Africa and Australia, are single-humped (dromedary) camels. The Abstract and Conclusions chapters of the recent UF paper, expected to be printed in the December 2014 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, are hereby copied for subscribers' convenience (references excluded).

"Abstract
---------
Because little is known about the ecology of influenza viruses in camels, 460 nasal swab specimens were collected from healthy (no overt illness) Bactrian camels in Mongolia during 2012. One specimen was positive for influenza A virus (A/camel/Mongolia/335/2012[H3N8]), which is phylogenetically related to equine influenza A(H3N8) viruses and probably represents natural horse-to-camel transmission.

Conclusions
-----------
The phylogeny indicates that A/camel/Mongolia/335/2012 probably represents a relatively recent horse-to-camel transmission event. Without additional isolates from camels or corresponding epidemiologic data, and given the close genetic relationship between A/camel/Mongolia/335/2012 and related equine viruses, it is impossible to determine at this time whether the virus has been successfully transmitted from camel to camel.

In recent years, enhanced surveillance has detected influenza A viruses across a wider range of mammalian hosts, including horses, swine, dogs, seals, cats, and now camels, providing a more complete picture of the ecology of influenza A viruses beyond their presence in birds. How influenza A viruses successfully jump from one host species to another and what the constraints on interspecies transmission are remain key questions about influenza virus ecology and assessments of pandemic threats. Our findings highlight the need to further elucidate the ecology of influenza viruses and other pathogens in free-ranging camel populations."

According to information included in the paper, major epizootics of equine influenza virus infection occurred in Mongolia during 2007-2008 (459 000 cases, 24 600 deaths) and again in 2011 (74 608 cases, 40 deaths).

The following information on equine influenza is extracted from OIE's Manual (updated 2012):

"Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys and mules caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2) of influenza A virus within the genus Influenzavirus A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s.

Equine influenza viruses of both subtypes are considered to be of avian ancestry and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 has recently been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in donkeys in Egypt. In fully susceptible equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia and a harsh dry cough followed by a mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent. Vaccinated infected horses can still shed the virus and serve as a source of virus to their cohorts. Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The disease is endemic in many countries with substantial equine populations. In recent years, infection has been introduced into Australia and re-introduced into South Africa and Japan; to date New Zealand and Iceland are reported to be free of equine influenza virus.

While normally confined to equidae, equine H3N8 influenza has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Extensive infection of dogs has been reported in North America where it normally produces mild fever and coughing but can cause fatal pneumonia. While equine influenza has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus. During 2004-2006 influenza surveillance in central China (People's Rep. of) 2 equine H3N8 influenza viruses were also isolated from pigs."

The reported isolation of the virus from a single specimen out of 460 collected nasal swabs may require continuation of surveillance efforts.
