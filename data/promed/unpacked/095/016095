An outbreak of 35 cases with 10 deaths, out of which 4 [deaths] were among
children, merits rapid investigation. The water tap supplies the whole
village and would result in a much wider outbreak. As 4 children from one
family have died, this outbreak might be the result of something
contaminating the stored food supplies.
The darkening/blackening of extremities with fever suggests gangrene. It is
critical to indentify the specific infectious agent responsible for the
gangrene. Such infections include disseminated tuberculosis (1), measles
(2), and varicella (3). Infectious gangrene such as streptococcal or
clostridial gangrene is almost always preceded by trauma. _Purpura
fulminans_, with disseminated intravascular coagulation and gangrene, has
been reported following various infections including meningococcal and
streptococcal bacteremia. The pathogenesis is thought to be due to a
hypersensitivity reaction leading to consumptive coagulopathy (4). The
lesions begin as ecchymoses and may progress to necrosis, with a fatal outcome.
Epidemics of ergotism have been described in Ethiopia, associated with
periods of drought and famine.(5) Ergotism results from the ingestion of
grain contaminated with the ergot fungus _Claviceps purpura_ and is
manifested by gangrene of the limbs. This usually requires several months
of ingestion of contaminated grain, and the gangrene may be preceded by
weakness and paresthesia.
An epidemic of ergotism occurred in Africa (Waro and Gazo-Belay sub-woredas
in Wollo Administrative Region) in 1977 and 1978. Ergot has been found on
hundreds of plants in almost every country of the world. The fungus is
highly adaptable and has many different varieties. Ergotism from consuming
alkaloid-contaminated cereal grains caused hundreds of thousands of deaths
in the Middle Ages, but in the past two decades there has been no recorded
outbreak of ergotism. The potential of an infection caused by ergot has
always existed (5).
Although involvement of both extremities has not been reported, another
possibility would be "idiopathic" symmetrical gangrene, first described in
1942 (6). Gelfand in 1947 described 6 cases of symmetrical gangrene of the
lower extremities in Rhodesian men, all of whom were previously healthy and
for whom no obvious cause was detected (7). In Uganda 11 patients with
single-limb involvement were reported, but no causative agent was
identified (8). The authors and subsequent workers suggested that a herbal
ergotamine-containing medicine may have been the causative agent (8,9).
Further information in terms of signs, symptoms, and cultures
(environmental/serum, etc.) on this outbreak is critical in determining the
cause of this outbreak.

[Dr Chotani raises some interesting possibilities. As mentioned, ergot has
been found worldwide (a sampling of recent identifications can be found in
the ProMED-mail archives mentioned in the "see also" section below). Given
the scant details we have available on this outbreak, this merits
consideration as part of the differential diagnosis. We await further
information on this outbreak from official sources. - Mod.MPP]
