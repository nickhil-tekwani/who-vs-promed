The Armed Force Research Institute for Medical Science [AFRIMS] in Bangkok, Thailand yesterday [8 Aug 2012] confirmed 12 of the 18 blood samples from Bhutan positive for chikungunya fever [virus infection]. [Of these], 6 of the positive samples were sent from Phuentsholing, and another 6 from Samtse.

The public health laboratory yesterday [8 Aug 2012] also received 59 additional suspected cases of the mosquito-borne viral disease, taking the total number of cases to 77 in a week's time. Of the total, 43 are from Samtse, 9 from Phuentsholing, 4 from Sipsu, 10 from Gomtu, 8 from Kamji, and 3 cases from Thimphu.

All new samples will be sent to Bangkok today [9 Aug 2012] for confirmation.

One of the samples that tested positive was of an 11-year-old student in Samtse. She had complained of joint pains and high fever. "It's been over a week now, and though she's recovering, her joint pains are persistent," her mother said.

Blood samples of patients with high fever and joint pains are sent to the public health laboratory in Thimphu for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing, which checks for the presence of antibodies the body develops against the virus, the lab's head and microbiologist Sonam Wangchuk said.

"It takes 7-10 days for the immune system to develop antibodies against viruses, which is why all 24 samples we've checked so far came out negative," he said.

Wangchuk said the chikungunya virus is now in the country, and no more passed from across the border. "Indigenous transmission has taken place, so people should be more aware of it, and take preventive measures against it," he said.

Chief officer of the vector control program Gelephu, Dr Lobzang Dorji, said the risk of chikungunya [disease] is more severe in young children and young adults than in healthy adults.

"The mosquito that spreads chikungunya [virus] bites during the day, especially in between dusk and dawn," he said. "People should use long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, even during the day, to protect babies and infants from mosquito bites."

The vector control team is also working on sharing information about the disease. "Weekly fever monitoring and analyzing is also ongoing in the southern region, especially Samtse, where fever cases are increasing," he said. "A team was also sent to Phuentsholing for vector control measures."

[The AFRIMS finding confirms the earlier report of chikungunya virus infections in Bhutan, and the above report adds to the number of cases. Clearly, this outbreak is now local and does not represent cases imported from neighboring areas of India. Given the presence and apparent abundance of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors of the virus, additional cases can be expected. Although morbidity may be high, mortality from the virus infection will be very few or none. However, the joint pain from chikungunya virus infections can be severe and debilitating and can persist for weeks to months.
