The following items may be of interest, and concern. This incident follows
the discovery earlier this week of traces of _Cryptosporidium_ and
_Giardia_ in the water supply for a small block within the City of Sydney,
which included the legislature building for New South Wales.

Sydney Water has warned hundreds of thousands of residents in southern,
eastern and inner western suburbs to boil all drinking water because
_Giardia_ and _Cryptosporidium_ had been identified in the water supply to
an area east of Bankstown and Silverwater, south of the Harbour and north
of the Georges River. The residents in Sydney's inner eastern suburbs were
warned early this week to boil their water.
The managing director of Sydney Water, Mr Chris Pollock, believes the
_Giardia_ parasite has come from catchment water, which flows from dams. "I
must stress that it is not right throughout the whole area," he said.
"We've picked it up in a few samples and this is a precautionary measure.
It is better to be safe in these situations."
Mr Pollock said the warning was for all water, including ice and water
bubblers in schools. He said all schools and hotels in the affected areas
had been encouraged to boil water. He warned water filters would not
eliminate the parasite.
The NSW director general of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Robyn
Napier, said people should boil water for at least 60 seconds but
preferably for three minutes.
Sydney Water has set up a 24-hour hotline on 1800 644 522.
Sydney's reputation was on the line because of the contamination of the
water supply to parts of the city, the New South Wales Opposition Leader,
Mr Peter Collins, said today. "Two years out from the Olympics, we get a
reputation for being a city whose water supply has to be boiled before you
can drink it," Mr Collins told ABC Radio. Mr Collins said the Olympics
Minister, Mr Michael Knight, would now be forced to explain whether Sydney
could guarantee a clean water supply system when visitors descended on the
city in 2000.
Sydney's water crisis emerged as the city hosted a visit by senior United
States government figures, including the Secretary of State, Mrs Madeleine
Albright, and the Defence Secretary, Mr William Cohen.
An independent inquiry would be held into the contamination of drinking
water in Sydney, the New South Wales Premier's office said today. A
spokeswoman for Mr Carr said he had cut short a visit to the state's north
coast and would be returning to Sydney this afternoon to deal with the
situation. "He is extremely angered ... he is extremely concerned," the
spokeswoman said.
Mr Carr's spokeswoman said the Premier had announced there would be an
independent inquiry into the contamination and further details released at
a press conference later today.

[In the two articles "_Cryptosporidium_" appears only once, while
"_Giardia_" is mentioned frequently. I am sure that the government response
would have been the same if the tainted water had been found affecting only
the distant suburbs of Sidney. - Mod.MHJ
