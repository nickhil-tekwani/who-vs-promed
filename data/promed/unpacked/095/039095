[1] Iraq: vaccination

A consignment of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine has been sent
by the European Commission (EC) to Iraq, as a contribution towards
the vaccination campaign against the disease in the eastern part of
the country.

The consignment of 500 000 doses of FMD vaccine is due to arrive in
Iraq on Monday [16 Mar 2009], said the EC in a statement [in
Brussels] Friday [13 Mar 2009].

FMD is a disease of ruminants and other cloven-hoofed animals that is
endemic in large parts of Iraq, where a new epidemic wave has started
in 2009 [see commentary for diagnostic details. - Mod.AS]

In Iraq, vaccination is the disease control measure, which can best
protect animals against infection from the FMD virus.

The EC said it received a request by Iraq to provide support for an
emergency vaccination campaign against FMD, to be carried out to
control the current outbreaks in the east of the country.

The EC said it will continue to assist Iraq in its efforts to
eradicate this disease that may also pose a threat to the EU.

[2] United Arab Emirates: imports from Egypt banned
Date: Mon 16 Mar 2009

<http://www.gulfnews.com/nation/General/10295323.html>


Imports of cloven-hoofed animals and all their products from Egypt to
the UAE have been banned.

Dr Rashid Ahmad Bin Fahad, Minister of Environment, issued the
decision based on reported cases of foot-and-mouth disease in Egypt.

The Ministry of Environment and Water urged all UAE animal resources
departments to coordinate to enforce the ban to prevent any spread of
disease [see commentary for details on the Egyptian situation. -Mod.AS]

[According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory (WRL) for
Foot and Mouth Disease, Pirbright, a new sub-lineage of A-Iran-05
appeared in Turkey in August 2007 and was predominating there during
2008. A-Iran-05 lineage (ASIA topotype), has reportedly been found to
be circulating during 2008 in Iran, and during 2009 in Iraq ,
Bahrain, and Kuwait. It may thus be presumed that the vaccine,
provided by the EC to Iraq, is meant to protect the Iraqi livestock
against this virus. Confirmation or otherwise, and details on the
included vaccine strain, will be useful.

A different genotype of FMDV serotype A was identified in another
Middle Eastern country, namely Egypt, in 2006. The isolates were
identified as topotype Africa, related to Ethiopian isolates from
2007 and 2008 and to viruses from Kenya (2005). Egypt has recently
reported new outbreaks of FMD serotype A (March 2009); genotyping of
this strain is not yet available. Hopefully, samples have been sent
to the WRL. It will be of importance, for all countries in the
region, to note if the FMD serotype A virus, currently active in
Egypt, is similar to the 2006 strain; if a homologous or other
serotype A vaccine (such as A-4165) is applied in Egypt; and if the
said vaccine is found to confer satisfactory protection in the field
(see detailed commentary in ProMED-mail archive no. 20090303.0865).

FMDV serotype O, belonging to the PanAsia-2 lineage of the ME-SA
topotype, continues to be the dominant strain circulating in the
Middle East. An epizootic, caused by FMDV serotype O, is currently
spreading in Israel; so far, outbreaks have been identified in 7
locations, mainly involving hitherto unvaccinated young animals.
Mortality in offspring (goats), has been typically recorded.

Serotyping of the recent Lebanese virus (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20090222.0734) and updated information on the FMD situation in other
countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Syria, are
anticipated.

An epizootic, caused by FMDV serotype O, is currently spreading in
Israel; so far, outbreaks have been identified in 7 locations, mainly
involving hitherto unvaccinated young animals. Mortality in offspring
(goats), has been typically recorded>. The following: Follow-up
