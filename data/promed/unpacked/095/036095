[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 50 cases with 2 new deaths, compared with 63 cases and no new death in the previous day (7 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 86 consecutive days. There were 28 locally transmitted cases: Gwangju (15), Daejeon (6), Seoul (4), Incheon (2), Gyeonggi (1), and 22 imported cases -- Gyeonggi (7), airport quarantine (5), Seoul (4), Gyeongnam (2), Chungnam (1), and Jeonnam (1), Jeonbuk (1), and Incheon (1). There were 8 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 6 provinces yesterday, 7 Jul 2020).

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been steady at 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/). It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +193 cases and +15 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (7 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +137 cases and +30 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in a slow decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (71); Emilia-Romagna (49), Piedmont (25) and Lazio (14) are the 4 provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 63 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 47 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. There are subtle signs that cases are starting to increase but time will tell. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now, 3 158 932 including 134 862 deaths, an increase from 3 097 084 cases and 133 972 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 214 570 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 8 Jul 2020, including 18 618 confirmed deaths and an additional 4606 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, Florida, California, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina, Alabama, and North Carolina,. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All but one of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 982 to 10 081.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.8%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 21.6% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country, although slowing down over the past 7 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay is 9% positive tests out of 39 208 278 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

The Americas region reported 52.7% of the global newly reported cases and 50.4% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 51.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 22.6%, Mexico 5.5%, Colombia 3.5%, Peru 3.2%, Argentina 2.9%, and Chile 2.7%. While Brazil had been reporting 30 000+ cases a day the past few days, the number of daily new cases is starting to decrease over the past week.

The European region reported 10.6% of the global newly reported cases and 14.5% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 36.5% of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 7.6%, Israel 6.0%, Turkey 5.8%, Ukraine 4.5%, the UK 3.2%, Azerbaijan and Armenia 2.9%, Germany and Romania 2.2%, Spain and France 1.9% each. These countries all merit keeping an eye on their case counts as the numbers of reported cases are increasing.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10.1% of the global newly reported cases and 13.5% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 19.8% of the regional newly reported cases followed Pakistan by 17.4%, Iran 14.4%, Iraq 14.2%, Oman 7.4%, Egypt 6.2%, Kuwait and Qatar at 3.5 % each, and UAE 3.1%.

The African region reported 9.1% of the global newly reported cases and 6.6% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 65.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 12.2 %, Nigeria 3.3%, Algeria 3.1%, Cameroon 2.5%, and DRC 1.2%. South Africa remains number 1 and other countries are varied. It appears as though Nigeria is slowing down in transmission. Of note is that South Africa reported over 10 000 cases today (8 Jul 2020).

The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of the global newly reported cases and 0.19% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 71.3% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 8.9%, Australia 7.8%, Singapore 7.2%, South Korea 2.1%, and China 0.97%. The Philippines is consistently reporting the highest number of cases with Japan at number 2.

The South East Asia region reported 16.1% of the global newly reported cases and 14.6% of global deaths. India reported 83.4% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 11.1%, Indonesia 4.6%, and Nepal 0.74%. India continues to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 8 Jul 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[*On 2 Jul 2020, the Worldometer (and the Johns Hopkins CSSE data) showed a decrease in 29 726 cases for the UK. From https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about: "Pillar 2 data for England has had duplicate tests for the same person removed by PHE from 2 Jul 2020. This means that the cumulative total number of UK lab-confirmed cases is now around 30 000 lower than reported on 1 Jul 2020." - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ
**On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 12 056 888, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. [As of 8 Jul 2020] the global total of cases crossed the 12 million mark, having crossed the 11 million mark on 3 Jul 2020. The global case count rose by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 3.12 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.9% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.68 million cases represents 14.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as India, Mexico, Chile, Peru, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (54.6%). A global total of 549 036 deaths have been reported, an increase of 2435 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Colombia Peru, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iraq. All countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases went from 3027 to 56 251.

The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 7 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, 2 each from the European region and African region, and 1 each from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.UBA]
