[As mentioned previously, this website is constantly updated as new information comes in, so it is likely that when you read this post, the numbers will not match the linked numbers because they will have been updated since the post was prepared.

According to the data on the Johns Hopkins website, there are now a total of 1013 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from outside mainland China, representing an increase of 117 cases reported in the past 24 hours. I notice that there have been 14 new cases added to the USA, presumably the 14 cases that were part of the airlift from Japan. It is unclear if these cases are also represented in the total number of cases on the Princess Diamond, thus possibly double counted. We await clarification of this. - Mod.MPP]

Excerpted:
"Biopsy samples were taken from lung, liver, and heart tissue of the patient. Histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates (figure 2A, B [available at source url]). The right lung showed evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; figure 2A [available at source url]). The left lung tissue displayed pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane formation, suggestive of early-phase ARDS (figure 2B [available at source URL]). Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, were seen in both lungs. Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterised by large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intra-alveolar spaces, showing viral cytopathic-like changes. No obvious intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified.

The pathological features of COVID-19 greatly resemble those seen in SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. /4, /5

Although corticosteroid treatment is not routinely recommended to be used for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, according to our pathological findings of pulmonary oedema and hyaline membrane formation, timely and appropriate use of corticosteroids together with ventilator support should be considered for the severe patients to prevent ARDS development.

[References are available at source URL. It is not surprising that the pathological findings are similar to those seen with SARS and MERS as the 3 diseases (including COVID-19) are caused by coronavirues, with the SARS and the SARS-CoV-2 being genetically related. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Selected media reports of transmission outside of mainland China
A. Japanese cruise ship: 99 new cases
Date: Wed 19 Feb 2020 [Borneo time]
Source: The Borneo Post / AFP [edited]
https://www.theborneopost.com/2020/02/19/coronavirus-cases-top-500-on-cruise-ship-off-japan/


Another 88 people aboard a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the coronavirus, authorities said yesterday [18 Feb 2020], as those free of the disease hoped they were spending their last night on board before disembarking.

The new cases take the total from the Diamond Princess to 542 - easily the biggest cluster outside the epicentre in China - as the cruise ship has proved an especially virulent breeding ground for the virus despite quarantine. The new cases will be sent to specialised hospitals, the ministry said in a statement, without giving further details such as their nationalities. 65 of those who tested positive were not yet showing symptoms.

Britain became the latest country to offer its citizens a way off the boat, saying it was 'working to organise a flight back to the UK' as doubts grow over the effectiveness of the quarantine measures with every spike in positive cases. Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and South Korea have already said they will evacuate their citizens from the ship, following the lead from the US, which flew home around 300 Americans on Monday -- including more than a dozen who had tested positive.

"We have done tests for everyone (on the ship)," Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters. "Some results have already come out... and for those whose test results are already clear, we are working to prepare disembarkation." In a letter sent to passengers, authorities explained that some test results would take time to process and that therefore "we plan the disembarkation to take place from [19 to 21 Feb 2020]".

"If you and your roommate are both negative and have no fever of respiratory symptoms, you will be able to prepare for disembarkation," the letter said. But those who had close contact with anyone who tested positive will have their quarantine reset to the last date.

Japan has been forced to defend its policy amid criticism for the way it handled the situation, with dozens of new infections detected almost daily since the ship arrived in early February. While foreign governments have couched their decision to remove citizens as an attempt to reduce the burden on Japanese authorities, many have interpreted the evacuations as tacit criticism of Tokyo's handling of the situation.

Japan has also confirmed at least 74 cases domestically - including many involving people with no history of recent travel to China. Authorities say the virus is now being transmitted locally, and have asked citizens to avoid crowds and non-essential gatherings.

[The number of positive laboratory confirmations among the Diamond Princess quarantined (passengers and crew) continues to grow. As I said previously one suspects there are a multitude of reasons behind this -- possible fomite contamination of surfaces, the air duct systems aboard the boat, crew living in dormitory-like conditions with multiple people to a room, sharing the same bathroom, individuals not following correct use of PPE (personal protective equipment) to name a few. In a media report from NHK World, an infectious disease expert in Japan had reviewed the situation on the ship and noted that the living and working conditions for the crew were such that person-to-person transmission was likely, and noted that the use of PPE by the crew was suboptimal https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200218_43/. The media report also mentioned that at the time the ship docked in Yokahama, there weren't facilities that could house 3700 individuals in quarantine. While at the time the ship docked it wasn't fully clear there was a change in the transmission to person-to-person ease of transmission, now with 20/20 hindsight over the past week is has become apparent that the ship served as an incubator for transmission rather than a safe quarantine location. - Mod.MPP]

B. Japan, newly confirmed cases
Date: 18 Feb 2020
Source: NHK World [edited]
https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200218_52/


Japanese authorities say nearly 100 people were confirmed on Tuesday [18 Feb 2020] to be infected with the new coronavirus, including one person under the age of 20.

Three men in Tokyo are among the new cases. 2 of them are in serious condition. 3 other infections were reported in the western prefecture of Wakayama. Most of the cases there have some link to a local hospital. The youngest of the new cases is the son of an infected doctor. And a man in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, has also tested positive.

The other 88 new cases are people aboard the quarantined cruise ship that's currently docked near Tokyo. [The Diamond Princess] That brings the total number of cases from the ship to 542, and the total number across all of Japan to 615.

Health ministry officials say among the people who were recently confirmed to be infected. 65 are not exhibiting any symptoms.

The Diamond Princess had around 3700 passengers and crew on board when it was quarantined earlier this month [February 2020]. The cruise ship is the largest hot spot for coronavirus infections outside mainland China. The 2-week quarantine period for those still aboard ends on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020]. Passengers will be able to leave the ship...if they test negative for the virus. A Japanese passenger says waiting for the results is making him anxious. He said, "I hear that results are often different between partners. If one of us tests positive, either my wife or I will be hospitalized. And the other will be put under surveillance for another 14 days. That would be a real problem.

Meanwhile, several countries and territories are pushing forward with plans to bring their citizens home. A South Korean presidential plane landed in Tokyo on Tuesday [18 Feb 2020]. The governments of Hong Kong and Australia also plan to bring back their citizens as early as Wednesday [19 Feb 2020] The US brought back home 330 of its citizens on 2 chartered flights on Monday [17 Feb 2020].

[According to the numbers provided in the above media report there are 73 individuals in Japan (not associated with the cruise ship) who have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

The Japanese MOH has a webpage with data on the Japanese testing for the coronavirus, current as of 12 noon 17 Feb 2020 when there were 59 confirmed cases. 46 of the 59 cases who tested positive by PCR were considered domestic cases (transmission was within Japan, the remaining 13 were returnees from China on a chartered flight. 12 of the 59 (20.3%) were asymptomatic. 30 (50.8%) are still hospitalized and 1 death has been reported. Interestingly only 13 out of 764 (1.7%) individuals testes from the charter flight returnees was positive, including 1 flight attendant. - Mod.MPP

[Mounting evidence there may now be community acquired disease in South Korea. Yesterday (17 Feb 2020), it was a 61-year-old woman living in Daegu, today in Seongdong-gu. Seongdong is just south of Seoul, and Daegu is 234 kms (145.4 miles) to the southeast of Seongdong (see https://www.mapsofworld.com/south-korea/cities-map.html for a map of South Korea showing cities).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) continues to gather and assess the needs of Member States for critical items such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). On 14 February, OSL started the dispatch of laboratory COVID-19 testing kits for 56 countries. As of 17 February, 37 shipments have been dispatched to 34 countries and three regional offices.

- Health care workers are on the front line of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak. WHO has developed guidance on the Rights, Roles and Responsibilities Of Health Workers, Including Key Considerations For Occupational Safety And Health (see https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-rights-roles-respon-hw-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=bcabd401_0).

Technical focus: operations support and logistics
--------------------------------------------------
WHO Operations Support and Logistics (OSL) continues to gather and assess the needs of Member States for critical items such as personal protective equipment (PPE). The country-level perspective is aggregated to obtain a global view on the overall demand for PPE necessary for frontline healthcare workers. Due to the growing demand and consumption of PPE, OSL is collaborating with WHO disease specialists to develop and disseminate a guiding document on the rational use of PPE.

In the meantime, OSL continues to accelerate the work of the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN), which includes manufacturers of medical products and medicines, medical distributors, and logistics providers.

Since the activation of the PSCN, the market for PPE continues to experience unprecedented demand. Government export restrictions have continued to limit the supply of products across borders. The PSCN is continuously exploring options with its stakeholders to alleviate the demand and increase the supply to ensure access to PPE for those countries most vulnerable and most in need. This includes working with WHO technical specialists to advocate via the PSCN on the proper use of PPE, understanding the potential for manufacturing expansion outside China (a major source of crucial commodities), and working with stakeholders to support the prioritization of PPE for frontline healthcare workers. The PSCN will also prepare for any bottlenecks in the market for other supplies as listed in the Disease Commodity Package https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov).

On [14 Feb 2020], OSL started the dispatch of COVID-19 laboratory testing kits for 56 countries. As of [17 Feb 2020], 37 shipments have been dispatched to 34 countries and 3 regional offices.

The WHO global supply team had already dispatched 28 PPE shipments totalling more than 12 000 kg [26 455 lbs] to priority countries in the Western Pacific, South-East Asia and African regions. Another 24 shipments are being processed this week to cover other priority countries.

With the technical support of the WHO Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) team, OSL continues to update the Disease Commodity Package (DCP) for COVID-19. This document provides the technical guidance and specifications on the critical supplies necessary to fight COVID-19. Responding organizations and countries preparing and responding to COVID-19 are able to use the DCP to secure the correct supplies in the areas of surveillance, prevention and control, and case management.

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China remains at 14 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, and Egypt). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan 1st identified in a quarantine officer, but continued transmission of the coronavirus has been occurring on the ship.

Please note that publications presented in these updates that come from bioRxiv are pre-peer review manuscripts, and final publications may be significantly different.

Also, it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
