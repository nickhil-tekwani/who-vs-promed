H1N1 influenza outbreak continues to rise
-----------------------------------------
At least 712 positive cases of influenza A/H1N1 virus infection and 8
deaths were recorded in the country during the past 3 weeks, according
to recent statements issued by the health minister Eugenia Sader. The
minister said that the deceased had "severe pathologies." "Patients
suffering from hypertension, heart disease, are likely to react
adversely to influenza virus infection".

Sader stressed that the epidemic barrier implemented in the state of
Merida was a consequence of reappearance of the virus, which had
affected 196 people, equivalent to 20 patients per 100 000 inhabitants
in the state. She stated that in the case of the capital, Caracas,
there were 174 cases, with 8 out of 100 000 affected.

Meanwhile, the national government through the MOH has implemented a
prevention and vaccination campaign, focusing on the population
considered to be at risk (the elderly, pregnant women and people with
respiratory or immune diseases).

[Normally ProMED-mail no longer posts individual country reports of
influenza A/H1N1 virus outbreaks. An exception is being made in the
case of Venezuela since the government of Venezuela has declared that
all infectious disease outbreaks are matters of state security and has
abolished its official epidemiological bulletin.
