Due to prolonged rainy weather, thousands of hectare of dragon fruit in the central Vietnamese province of Binh Thuan are struck with diseases.

Farmers suffer huge losses. Nobody buys diseased fruit; consequently, farmers used fruit as animal feed. Currently, dragon fruits [are grown] on over 27 000 hectares in Binh Thuan; there are some exports to China.

[Dragon fruit (also called pitaya, strawberry pear) is the common name for several cactus species and hybrids, mostly of the genus _Hylocereus_, but also _Stenocereus_ and some other related genera. These vine-like epiphytic cacti originate in Central and South America but are also widely grown in Southeast Asia. They are an important fruit crop in these regions because of their high nutritional value. Several varieties with varying skin and pulp colours are planted commercially.

Few diseases are known to affect dragon fruit, mainly bacterial stem rots and fungal fruit mottling (_Dothiorella_ species). Such diseases are often favoured by high moisture (as reported above) and their management is especially difficult since dragon fruit is propagated by cuttings, which may spread any pathogens. Reliable molecular diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems above is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
