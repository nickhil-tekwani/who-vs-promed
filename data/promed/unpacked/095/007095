Epizootics (non-human primate cases] notified to National Public Health: 6965 cases
729 confirmed
2378 under investigation
2287 undetermined
1571 discarded

Cases in humans notified: 6356
1218 confirmed (364 deaths)
1642 under investigation
3496 discarded

Beyond confirmation of new cases, the variation of case numbers and deaths between publication [of these bulletins] is due in part to constant review and reclassification of the cases in light of new data that are incorporated weekly in the database as epidemiological investigations of reported cases bring together key information that has implications for the critical assessment of these events. Thus, there may be a reduction in the number of confirmed cases when the reviewed and reclassified cases outweigh the new cases.

I. Background
-------------
In recent decades, yellow fever (YF) has been recorded beyond the limits of the area considered endemic (Amazon region). At the same time, the observation of a seasonal pattern of occurrence of human cases, based on the analysis of the historical series, supported the adoption of surveillance based on a pattern of seasonality. Thus, the YF monitoring period begins in July and ends in June of the following year. Human cases and epizootics in non-human primates (NHP) have recently been recorded in a wide area of the national territory. Initially, between 2014/2015, the transmission occurred in the North region, with subsequent expansion in the east and south of the country, where it affected primarily the Central West region between 2015/2016. More recently, between 2016/2017, the most significant outbreak in Brazil occurred, affecting mainly the states of the Southeast region, when 779 human cases and 262 deaths were registered, in addition to 1659 YF epizootics reported by [states and the Federal District] in Brazil (Figure 1).

II. Epidemiological situation
-----------------------------
Surveillance of epizootics in non-human primates - NHP (monkeys)

Surveillance of epizootics in non-human primates (NHP) consists of capturing information about the illness or death of NHP (monkeys) and to investigate them in a timely manner, in order to detect early circulation of the yellow virus and to support the decision making for adopting measures of prevention and control, in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the disease in the human population, mainly in the affected areas (with active transmission) and it extension (into adjacent areas).

In the monitoring period 2017/2018 (July 2017 to June 2018), up to epidemiological week (EW) 16, 6965 epizootics were reported to the Ministry of Health in NHP, of which 1571 were discarded, 2287 were indeterminate (without samples collected), 2378 remain under investigation, and 729 were confirmed (per laboratory). NHP epizootics were confirmed in: Tocantins (3), Mato Grosso (1), Espírito Santo (1), Rio de Janeiro (37), Minas Gerais (100), and São Paulo (587), with the highest number of epizootics confirmed in the Southeast region (99.4 percent, 725/729) (Table 1).

Totals / 6965 / 1571 / 2287 / 2378 / 729

The epidemic curve (Figure 2) shows the maintenance of viral circulation in the period of low occurrence (June to September), when low temperatures and rainfall generally imply conditions less favorable for transmission. Epizootics in confirmed NHP cases in the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, and Minas Gerais, were detected in the same affected areas and close to the previous outbreak (2016/2017) indicated the maintenance of regional transmission and risk to human populations. In the monitoring period from 2016/2017 to EW [epidemiological week] 16 [16-22 Apr 2017], 1507 epizootics were confirmed in NHP, of which 353 were confirmed by laboratory criteria, while in the current period (2017/2018), 729 epizootics were confirmed (by laboratory) (Figure 3).

Surveillance of human cases
---------------------------
Surveillance of human cases is done through the notification of cases with symptomatology compatible with YF. Every suspected case must be promptly communicated by telephone, fax or email to the authorities, (within 24 hours), as it is a serious disease with risk of dispersion to other areas of the national and international territories. It is important to fill out the Investigation form of the Notification of Injury Information System (Sinan).

In the monitoring period 2017/2018 (July 2017 to June 2018), up to EW 16, 6356 suspected human cases of YF were reported, of which 3496 were discarded, 1642 remain under investigation, and 1218 were confirmed. Of the total confirmed cases, 364 led to death (case fatality rate of 29.9 percent [364/1218]). Most of the confirmed cases were reported in the Southeast region (99.9 percent [1217 / 1218]) (Table 2).

The 1st confirmed human case in this period had the date of onset of symptoms in mid-July [2017] (Figure 4) with probable infection in Guapimirim, Rio de Janeiro [state], where YF epizootics in NHP were confirmed had been detected in the month prior to the occurrence of the case. The demographic profile of the confirmed cases coincides with that usually observed in outbreaks of wild-type [sylvan] yellow fever, with the majority of cases in patients that are males and of an economically active age, since these individuals are more frequently exposed to areas and situations of risk, mainly as a result of work activities (Figure 5).

Figure 6 [graph]. Distribution of confirmed cases reported to SVS/MS, by week of occurrence, monitoring period 2017-2018 (July 2017-June 2018), Brazil as of week 16.

In the monitoring period of 2016/2017 until SE 16, 752 cases of wild-type [sylvan] yellow fever were confirmed, while in the current period (2017/2018) 1218 were confirmed (Figure 6). In a preliminary comparison between the monitoring period 2016/2017 and the most recent period (2017/2018), it was observed that, although the absolute number of confirmed cases is higher in the current period (751 vs. 1208 included in the analysis, respectively), the incidence of YF per 100 000 inhabitants in municipalities with a record of confirmed human cases was lower (6.34 vs. 3.21) (Table 3). This fact can be explained by the more recent occurrence of YF in areas with a greater population contingent (population at risk), since the metropolitan areas of Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo were affected. On the other hand, the number of municipalities with confirmed human cases was higher in the most recent period (213) when compared to the previous one (143). However, the highest percentage of the population at risk in the current period is precisely that of newly affected areas (58.5 percent), where the vaccine was not [previously] recommended differently from the percentage of the population at risk during the previous period (42.2 percent) and that reinforces the importance of intensification strategies and vaccination campaigns in newly affected areas, as well as the intensification of selective vaccination where circulation of the virus has previously been documented. It is important to consider that part of the municipalities registered YF only in NHP, and the vaccinated portion of the population was not at risk, so this preliminary comparison should be interpreted with caution.

Table 3. Number of cases, affected municipalities, resident population, yellow fever incidence in municipalities with human confirmed cases, comparing the transmission periods of 2016/2017 with the most recent 2017/2018.

Transmission localities (affected areas)
----------------------------------------
The human cases and epizootics in NHP recorded during this monitoring period are presented in Tocantins, Federal District, Mato Grosso, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Espírito Santo (Figures 7 and 8), where actions to intensify vaccination and of surveillance are ongoing. All confirmed human cases had intensified surveillance in areas where YF epizootics in NHP were previously documented (Figures 7 and 8), except for the case confirmed by SES/DF (Federal District Health Secretariat).

Figure 9 [map]. Areas of recommended vaccination, areas without recommended vaccination, areas affected and increased and municipalities participating in the Campaign for Vaccination Against Yellow Fever.

Vaccination against yellow fever
--------------------------------
On 25 Jan 2018, the yellow fever vaccination campaign began in 77 municipalities selected from the states of Bahia (BA), São Paulo (SP), and Rio de Janeiro (RJ), namely: 8 municipalities (BA), 54 municipalities (SP) and 15 municipalities (RJ). It should be noted that during the course of the Campaign, São Paulo expanded vaccination gradually, to include another 52 municipalities, according to steps 1, 2, and 3 (Table 4).

With the closure of the campaign in these municipalities, the vaccination actions will continue in order to guarantee that they reach the vaccination coverage target of 95 percent of the eligible population, approximately 40 million people, considering the expansion of vaccination in the state of São Paulo.

The target population for vaccination consists of people from 9 months of age and up, without proof of vaccination, living in defined municipalities

For this strategy the yellow fever vaccine will be used at the standard dose (0.5 ml) and fractional dose (0.1 mL), that is, the use of a 1/5 of a standard dose (0.5 ml). This measure is in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), to be used in populated areas at risk of spread of the disease.

The Ministry of Health, from January to April 2018, forwarded to the Federated Units [states and the Federal District] the amount of approximately 25.1 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine. For the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, about 18.4 million doses were sent to the vaccination campaign: 13.4 million (SP), 4.7 million (RJ) and 300 000 (BA).

Before starting the vaccination campaign, the states of RJ and BA had already vaccinated about 6.7 million people. Considering the total accumulated doses and doses of the campaign, Rio de Janeiro vaccinated about 6.8 million people and Bahia vaccinated 1.8 million. The state of São Paulo during the Campaign vaccinated about 6.5 million people. The vaccination coverage of the states of RJ and BA corresponds to 55.46 percent and 55.03 percent, respectively [of their populations].

Considering the epidemiological history of the disease in the country, based on the evidence recorded up to June 2017, the area with recommended vaccination was considered according to the classification in Figure 9. The affected areas (in red on the map) indicate the municipalities with active transmission during the current monitoring period (2017/2018) and, added to the enlarged areas (in yellow), indicate the areas of risk, where surveillance and response actions are a priority.

Post yellow fever vaccination adverse events
--------------------------------------------
Post vaccination adverse events (PVAE) are any undesired medical occurrence after vaccination and that, not necessarily, have a causal relationship to the use of a vaccine or other immunobiologicals. They can be classified as severe adverse events (SAE) when they require hospitalization for at least 24 hours, cause sequelae, congenital anomaly, risk of death or death, and non-adverse events (NAE), which are those that are not included in the SAE.

The yellow fever vaccine is recognized as one of the most effective and safe vaccines; however, SAE have been reported and are related to the dissemination of the vaccine virus [in the body].

Results of the standard dose campaign
-------------------------------------
From 25 Jan-15 Apr [2018], 1292 PVAE were reported in the states of BA, RJ and SP with the standard dose of the yellow fever vaccine, with 41 (3.2 percent) in BA, 411 (32 percent) in RJ, and 840 (65 percent) in SP. Of the 1292 PVAE reported, 325 (25.2 percent) were SAE, 56 (17.2 percent) in RJ and 268 (82.5 percent) in SP. The data presented for the standard dose are reported cases and are still under investigation for completion and are subject to change.

Results of the fractionated dose campaign
-----------------------------------------
In the period from 25 Jan-15 Apr [2018], 906 PVAE were reported in the states of RJ and SP with the fractionated dose of the yellow fever vaccine, of which 164 (18.1 percent) were in RJ and 742 (81.9 percent) in SP. There was no BA state notification of any cases of PVAE with the fractional dose of the yellow fever vaccine in the above-mentioned period. Regarding severity, 137 SAE cases occurred, 25 (18.2 percent) in RJ and 112 (81.8 percent) in SP. The data presented for fractional dose are reported cases and are still under investigation for conclusion and are subject to change.

[The report above presents a detailed summary of the current yellow fever situation in Brazil, including cases in humans as well as in monkeys. Despite the occurrence of human cases in a relatively wide geographic area in the country, all are attributed to spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle and none to the urban cycle involving human-to-human transmission, via _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vectors. This is remarkable, considering that this mosquito is abundant and responsible for transmission of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses in recent outbreaks in Brazil. The vaccination campaign has been running behind schedule, but efforts are being made to catch up. A recent decision has been made to vaccinate the entire 77 million population of Brazil within the next 12 months. Apparently, supplies of the vaccine are adequate for the current phase of the campaign, doubtless facilitated by the application of fractionated dose that extends the supply 5-fold. One hopes that vaccination coverage of the population will soon reach the 80-95 percent level in areas at risk and end new human cases. The sylvan cycle will probably continue, since there is no way to vaccinate the non-human primate population.
