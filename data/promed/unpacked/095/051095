The Eastern Ontario Health Unit has reported that a horse in the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry has tested positive for the eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV).

The virus is normally found in wild birds, but, through transmission of infected mosquitoes, the virus can spread to horses and humans. While a vaccine exists for horses, there is not yet one available for humans.

"Although there's never been a reported human case of EEE in Ontario, it's a very serious disease in all ages and can even cause death. For this reason, we urge all residents to protect themselves against mosquito bites," said medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis.

The health unit continuously monitors mosquito pools for West Nile virus and EEEV, and, at this time, surveillance is being increased as a precaution. While no pools have tested positive yet this year [2014], most cases occur in the late summer and early fall.

"People tend to think they (mosquitoes) are not around this time of year," said Dr. Roumeliotis, "when in fact, they're here until 1st frost."

With a positive case of EEEV, the health unit is taking advantage of this time to remind residents to take the necessary precautions to stay safe. "We are at a higher risk of West Nile than we are EEEV," he said.

EEEV is a severe mosquito-borne disease acquired in North America; however, it is a rare illness in humans. It has been identified in Ontario in horses and mosquitoes, but to date, no human cases have been reported.

Most people who are bitten by an infected mosquito won't develop any symptoms, and if they do, they won't appear for 4 to 10 days after being bitten. Some symptoms are a mild flu-like illness with fever, headache and fatigue.

Severe cases of EEEV have reported encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain), which starts with a sudden headache, high fever, chills and vomiting. Of those cases, many will suffer permanent brain damage.

If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, please seek medical attention.

Two horses in Lanark County have tested positive for EEEV, which is found in wild birds, but can spread to horses and humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, according to the Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit.

Mosquitoes can transmit eastern equine encephalitis virus [EEEV] to humans, although there has never been a documented human case in Eastern Ontario. They said that while there has not been a reported human case of the virus in Ontario, it can be a very serious neurological disease across all age groups and can cause death. While a vaccine exists for horses, there is none for humans. They warn people to take precautions against mosquito bites and to avoid woodland areas where infected mosquitoes are commonly found.

The Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit recommends the following: Apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing and on all exposed skin, except for the palms of your hands and fingers or on children under the age of 2. Wear light-coloured clothing, long sleeves, pants and socks when outside. Avoid being outside at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are the most active. All containers in and around the house should be regularly emptied of standing water. Ensure that screens, windows and doors are sealed to prevent mosquitoes from entering.

[While there may be no human cases of EEE, the health unit is right to be concerned. There is a human case of EEE in New Hampshire. The EEE virus is already present in east Ontario, so the possibility of human infection is very real. (And these infections indicate the presence of EEE virus in mammal-biting mosquitoes. - Mod.LM)

Horse owners need to be especially vigilant about vaccinating their horses. Immunity to EEE wanes faster than does the other encephalidities. Equines should be vaccinated every 46 months to protect them from the virus.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. EEE is a rare illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United States each year. Most cases occur in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Most persons infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma. EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States, with approximately 33 percent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors. There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms. You can reduce your risk of being infected with EEEV by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active. If you think you or a family member may have EEE, it is important to consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis.
