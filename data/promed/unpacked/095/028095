FMD type O has been reported in sheep at Jiza, Amman [21 Feb 2017], goats at Deir Alla, Al Balqa [2 Mar 2017], cattle at Hwarah, Irbid [9 Mar 2017] and cattle at Kraymah, Jordan Valley, Al Balqa [14 Mar 2017].

VP1 sequencing (performed at the Jordan University of Science and Technology) has determined the genotype of these viruses as O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d.

[In ProMED-mail's post 20170516.5039513 "Foot & mouth disease - Palestinian Auth (03): (West Bank) bovine, ovine, serotype pending, OIE", caused by an FMD virus strain yet to be serotyped, we mentioned the FMDV strains currently circulating in the region. In relation to the FMDV serotype O, reportedly identified earlier this year in neighboring Jordan, we included the comment: "Hopefully... the Jordanian strain be genotyped".

As apparent from the above information from the new quarterly report of the WRLFMD, the strain has already been genotyped as O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d. This lineage that has been widely circulating for several years in the Indian subcontinent spread to southeast Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. During the past 4 months there have been new reports of field outbreaks due to this rapidly spreading genotype in the Republic of Korea (in February 2017) and in Xinjiang Province in the western part of China.

The Jordan University of Science and Technology deserves to be commended for the performance of the genotyping and, moreover, for the sharing of the results with the WRLFMD, demonstrating exemplary transparency. Hopefully, the sample has been submitted to the WRLFMD for further studies, in particular for the strain's identity rate with other strains, including vaccine strains.

The causative agent in the current West Bank (PA) event could be similar to any of the 3 strains circulating regionally, namely O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d, O/EA-3 or A/ASIA/GVII. Its serotyping and genotyping deserve urgency.

O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d has been recently circulating in Jordan's eastern neighbour, Saudi Arabia. A total of 3 matching vaccine strains for the named Saudi strain have been identified by VNT at the WRLFMD (Pirbright). They are: O 3039, O Manisa and O/TUR/5/2009. For details, and for other matching data, please refer to table 6 (page 18) of the WRLFMD Quarterly Report April to June 2016, available at

Subscribers engaged in FMD prevention and control may consider participation in the due EUFMD webinar addressing "Optimizing emergency vaccination strategies for FMD: use of simulation models from an FMD control perspective". This webinar -- open for guests as well -- is planned to be held on [Wed 24 May 2017], at 11:30 CET (note that CEST is local time in Italy).
