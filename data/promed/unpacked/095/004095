A puppy adopted from the Washington County/Johnson City Animal Shelter was euthanized and tested positive for rabies after it began to show signs of the fatal disease.

Animal Shelter Director Tammy Davis said she hopes the incident won't cause a knee-jerk reaction for the public or anyone looking for a pet.

"No one should be concerned ... the puppy showed no signs of rabies while at the shelter," she said. Davis said she learned about the case from the Tennessee Department of Health after the puppy was euthanized and tested.

"We want everyone to know this was an isolated incident and very uncommon," Davis said. "No one who has been to the shelter is at risk and no other dogs at the shelter are at risk."

According to Davis, the puppy was likely infected by a wild animal such as a bat, raccoon or skunk. People who adopted other puppies from that same litter have been notified. The affected puppy was one of a litter of 5 that came to the shelter at 10 weeks old. Davis said they were too young to be vaccinated.

The puppies were in isolation for 5 days to ensure they didn't have parvo, then became available for adoption. They were on the adoption floor for 2 days, and 3 were adopted during that time.

Rabies "is not contagious until it gets to the brain and the animal begins showing signs," she said. The puppy confirmed to have rabies "was lethargic and didn't want to eat or drink. It began to stagger and become aggressive." The owner realized something was wrong and took the pup to the vet.

Davis said while this particular situation could not have been avoided by vaccination, it is state law pet owners have their animals vaccinated against rabies. She said the health department is continuing its investigation.

[This is a little bit of an unusual case. The article does not indicate the owner of the puppy was exposed. Therefore, there may not have been a bite or scratch.

However, the shelter did not mention if the puppy was co-mingled with other puppies or housed singularly. The wording of "no others exposed" may imply it was housed singularly. However, puppies are often given play time and socialization time, so it could be other puppies may have been exposed. - Mod.TG]

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) reported 3 people in the Midlands have been exposed to rabies.

Two people in the Newberry County town of Prosperity were referred to their healthcare providers after being potentially exposed to rabies by their pet cat having tested positive for the disease [rabies]. The potential exposures occurred 1 Aug 2019 when the victims were bitten by the cat in Prosperity. The cat was described as a large, gray domestic short-haired tabby. The cat was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing 2 Aug 2019 and was confirmed to have rabies 5 Aug 2019.

One person in the town of Lexington was referred to their healthcare provider after coming into contact with a fox testing positive for rabies. The potential exposure occurred 2 Aug 2019 when the victim was attacked by a fox on their property in the town of Lexington. The fox was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing 2 Aug 2019 and was confirmed to have rabies 5 Aug 2019.

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal. However, saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose, or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said David Vaughan, Director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space. If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator," said Vaughan.

It is also important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family, and your pets from this fatal disease.

If you have reason to believe you, family members, or pets have come into contact with an animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Columbia office.

Be sure to immediately wash any part of your body having come into contact with saliva or neural tissue with plenty of soap and water and seek medical attention.

To report a bite or exposure on holidays and/or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

[3] Florida - raccoon, human exposure

https://weartv.com/news/local/rabies-alert-fdoh-escambia-confirms-three-bitten-by-rabid-raccoons


The Florida Department of Health in Escambia County (FDOH) has issued a rabies alert after 3 people were reportedly bitten by raccoons. The report says FDOH-Escambia health educator consultant, Kimberly Pace, declined to specify the area in which the individuals were bitten. However, she said, "at this time FDOH-Escambia wants to ensure all county residents are taking the precautions."

The FDOH has provided the following tips to protect your family from rabies:

- Teach your children not to go near wild and stray animals, and never keep them as pets.
- Vaccinate your dog, cat, ferret, or horse to protect against rabies. Keep vaccinations up-to-date.
- Do not feed your pets outside. The food may attract wild animals.
- Make sure your garbage is securely covered. Open garbage attracts wild and stray animals.
- Spay or neuter your pet to reduce its tendency to roam or fight.
- Do not let your pets roam freely or allow them to interact with wild or stray animals. Keep them in a fenced yard or on a leash.
- Call Escambia County Animal Control to remove stray animals from your neighborhood.
- Prevent bats from entering living quarters or occupied spaces in homes, churches, schools, and other similar areas, where they might come into contact with people and pets.
- If your pet is bitten by another animal, immediately seek veterinary assistance for your animal and contact Escambia County Animal Control.
- If you are bitten by a wild animal, or by any animal acting strangely, seek medical care as soon as possible so a physician can evaluate your risk of rabies infection and administer the rabies [post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)] vaccine if appropriate.

[4] Texas - fox, human exposure

https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/fox-that-attacked-nw-travis-co-woman-inside-home-tests-positive-for-rabies


Authorities say a fox that got into a northwest Travis County home on Saturday [3 Aug 2019] and attacked a resident has tested positive for rabies. City of Austin officials say it happened at a home on Pace Bend Road. The resident was bitten on the foot by the fox, and a family member had to kill the fox to stop the attack.

The fox was taken and submitted to the Texas Department of State Health Services for testing. A positive rabies result was confirmed, and now public health officials are canvassing the area to determine if any other people or pets may have had contact with the fox.

If someone is bitten by a wild animal, Animal Protection should be called immediately. The victim should also contact a physician immediately.

Animal Services offers the following tips to protect pets and family from exposure to wild animals:

- Vaccinate your dogs and cats as well as livestock.
- Restrain your pets. Do not allow them to roam freely in public.
- Avoid contact with wild animals and unknown dogs and cats.
- If your pet is bitten, scratched or in a fight with any animal, report it to the authorities.
- Any contact with these high-risk wild animals or any sign of sick or dead wildlife should also be reported.

[Vaccination of your pets is an extremely important way to protect your pet, and to protect yourself. This helps to build a barrier between you and the virus.

Rabies virus is deadly. There are fewer than a handful of humans who have survived rabies, and their lives are NOT the same as they were before. These people have permanent effects to their neurological systems. So please protect yourself and your pets.

Vaccinate your pets. It is effective and is so much cheaper than the heartache of euthanizing your pet or risking death to yourself or a loved one.

While post-exposure prophylaxis is available if you are bitten, it must be administered within a certain time following the bite. Furthermore, for those in the USA, this is a very expensive (however lifesaving) procedure. For those unfamiliar, this treatment can cost many thousands of dollars -- I have heard reports ranging from USD 30 000 to 50 000 and even as much as USD 100 000.

Again, rabies is a deadly virus. Please vaccinate your pets and exercise extreme caution around animals you are unfamiliar with. - Mod.TG
