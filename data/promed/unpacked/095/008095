Notifications (p.192)

Brazil has notified 22 cases (7 deaths) from yellow fever, occurring
between 1 Feb and 16 May 1998 in the states of Amapa, Amazonas, Mato Grosso
and Para (all in the Amazon region). According to the WHO report, these
were notified during the week 12-18 Jun 1998. Eighteen of the cases were
in Para State, which is situated south of the mouth of the Amazon. The
distribution of the 7 deaths between states was not given in full.
This is not the way yellow fever is supposed to be reported. According to
the International Health Regulations, any suspected case of YF must be
reported to WHO Geneva within 24 hours, and the lab confirmation should
follow as soon as it is available. This gives time for vaccination to be
carried out in the affected areas, and for warnings to be given to
travellers to those areas -- nationals as well as visitors.
***********************
This is also not the way ProMED-mail is supposed to work -- to pick up this
important report from a paper copy of the WER forwarded to me from my old
address in New York & received weeks later. But the problem is I simply do
not have the time to check the Notifications on the WHO/WER website every
Friday. I would like to find a volunteer who would do that and e-mail the
Notifications to me. Please contact me direct at the e-mail address below.
