Rabies was discovered and lab-confirmed in 3 jackals found in the 3 kibbutz settlements Shluhot, Maoz Hayim, and Kfar Ruppin, situated in the [Bet-She'an area, north east [NE] Israel], the Ministry of Health [MoH] announced today [2 Jan 2018]. [Later, 2 more cases were lab confirmed. The locations of the 5 cases in jackals confirmed in northern Israel since 1 Jan 2018 are presented in a map, dated 2 Jan 2018, at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Documents/mapa_kalevet_02.01.18.jpg]. The MoH emphasizes that anyone who has had contact, or whose animals had or suspected to have had contact with an infected or free-roaming animal should contact the nearest health office to consider preventive treatment.

The regional councils 'Valley of Springs' and 'Gilboah', in NE Israel, notified the Ministry of Agriculture: "In view of the continuing, unending outbreak and the emergency situation, we are obliged to rely only on ourselves; it has been decided at our last meeting to recruit and immediately put in action veterinarians, trappers, inspectors, and vehicles, as well as supply the volunteering agriculturists with weapons and increase field activities as prescribed by the worsening situation. This, on top of the actions already undertaken by the councils."

The government is concerned about the possible infection of people -- in particular children -- if the disease spreads into additional regions in central and southern Israel. The director general of the Ministry of Health has submitted to his counterpart in the Ministry of Agriculture a call to urgently apply measures in order to decrease the density of wildlife populations which are rabies vectors. "Any adequate measure should be applied, including controlled use of poisoning in defined areas and any other means if deemed necessary to prevent losing control."

Following the publication, minister of agriculture Ariel responded: "I have no intention of sanctioning poisoning as a means of rabies control; I have already rejected this possibility and there is no need for it." Nevertheless, his office was already preparing for the start of the poisoning.

Israel's Nature Protection Society expressed concern about the publication: "Poisoning methods have brought disaster to the Israeli fauna during the previous century, bringing many species to the brink of extinction and even to extinction, such as biblical vultures, Egyptian vultures [_Neophron percnopterus_], striped hyenas [_Hyaena hyaena_] and cinereous vultures [_Aegypius monachus_]. In addition, poisoning is not in state to solve the problem of the spread of rabies: this can be stopped by a combination of solutions: by stopping the unacceptable availability of food sources to wild animals from neglected garbage and waste; by vaccination of wildlife, livestock, and pets; by selective dilution of wild animals applied professionally by authorized specialists; by pet sterilization and neutering; and by the enforcement of existing laws and regulations concerning the maintenance of these animals."

A total of 18 IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers operating on the northern border were taken to Ziv Medical Center in Tzefat [Northern district], all suspected of being in contact with a rabid animal. They were all given prophylactic treatment and released.

Dr Joseph Nabia, director of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Ziv Medical Center, praised the commanders for their vigilance and prompt and efficient treatment of the soldiers' medical treatment. "During this period there was a significant increase in rabies and in cases of contact with infected animals or suspected of being rabid. As a result, the number of vaccinations held in emergency room inventory was increased. The emergency doctors from various fields in the internal field, surgery, and orthopedic professions are all experienced in providing the appropriate treatment and each case is documented and reported to the district health office."

It should be noted that rabies is life-threatening and any person who fears s/he may have been in contact with a rabid animal must report to a hospital for treatment."

[In view of the increased number of rabies cases in animals in certain areas in the Northern [HaZafon] and Haifa districts, the Ministry of Health (MoH) issued, on 5 Dec 2017, 'temporary guidelines for the prevention of rabies following exposure among caregivers in farm animals' (reference 7133713710). The temporary directive is addressing the treatment of personnel on rabies-affected farms, where the attending personnel (all those whose work includes the handling of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats on farms) may be exposed to the virus. In case of proven rabies in one or more of the animals on the farm, the district medical officer 'will consider' the application of active post-exposure rabies vaccination (without passive immunization) to all workers on the premises, not exclusively to those who reported direct contact with the rabid or suspected-as-rabid animal. In case a direct contact has been reported, in particular licking by the animal of non-intact skin, both active and passive post-exposure treatment should be applied.

Recent media reports which said that pre-exposure rabies vaccination is to be more widely applied, to cover all personnel of animal farms in the affected region, have been denied by the MoH.

During 2017, a total of 74 rabid animals were diagnosed in Israel by the OIE-reference laboratory for rabies at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan. This is the highest annual number since 1999 (76) while becoming Israel's all-time record for rabies in golden jackals (47 confirmed cases, overtaking the previous record, in 1949, with 39 rabid jackals reported). The event is particularly remarkable since it has taken place 13 years after the introduction of countrywide oral vaccination (2004), a project regarded very successful hitherto. The number of confirmed rabies-positive jackals during the previous 5 years (2012-2016) was 2, 1, 2, 3, and 5 (4 of the 5 cases in 2016 were distant from the area currently affected; see map at https://tinyurl.com/yc8orxt3).

The event, which started during the last semester of 2017, is probably yet to peak; during the 1st 2 days of 2018, 5 new cases in jackals have been confirmed, 3 of them on the eastern and 2 on the western sides of the affected area, which can be viewed on the 2017 summarizing map, at https://tinyurl.com/yaolcmyd.

A summarising report on the oral vaccination project for the years 1998-2015 was published in early 2017 and is electronically available (Vet Serv report 2014-2015, Hebrew, with some English in tables/maps, 360 pages, http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/dochot-shnatiim/Pages/doch_shnati_2014-2015.aspx).

The oral vaccination report, including text, a table and a map, appears in pages 207-209. The text is herewith translated:

"This project, aiming to vaccinate foxes and jackals against rabies, is being carried out by air dispersion of baits which contain the vaccine. It began with a limited field experiment in northern Israel in 1998, and was gradually expanded during subsequent years. According to the government's decision, the project was significantly expanded in 2003. Following 2 challenging outbreaks in central Israel, namely in the Modi'in area in 2002-2003 and in the Sharon region in 2003, it was decided to spread the vaccine-baits also in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank], thus creating a continuum of bait-vaccinated wildlife population throughout the extensive area covering the entire territories of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). The project currently covers an area of about 20 000 square kilometers [about 7722 sq mi], including most of the populated areas within the borders of Israel and the PA, from the northern border to Eilat in the south, and from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.

"Until 2005, 2 dissemination operations were conducted each year, in spring and autumn. In view of the significant decrease in the number of diagnosed rabies-positive cases in the affected areas, and the encouraging results of immunization as monitored in the fox and jackal populations, since 2006 only one operation is applied annually, namely in the autumn.

"In view of the deteriorated rabies situation on the Syrian and Lebanese borders (penetrating rabid dogs and wildlife), increased coverage intensity was applied during the fall 2014 operation on the Golan heights, to try prevent the disease from entering the local wildlife population.

"Reinforcement of the aerial dispersion is done by ground dispersion from cars. This dispersion is mainly carried out on the margins of settlements and is concentrated on places where foxes and jackals were observed. The monitoring activity has been continued, to try to evaluate the rate of bait consumption. This was done by adding tetracycline to some bait as a marker to be detected in bones of the target animals, as well as by testing antibodies in sampled animal sera.

"According to a 2007 government decision, funding for the oral vaccination project was earmarked from the state budget until 2011. Funding for the years 2012-14, carried out on similar scale and format as in the previous years, came from the budget of the veterinary services.

"In 2015, the government's budget approval was delayed, and it was not possible to timely start the distribution of the vaccine baits, namely in October. The bait dispersion commenced in March 2016 and ended at the end of April 2016. The dispersion took place in the Golan Heights, the Galilee, the Jordan Valley, and Judea/Samaria [West Bank] and the Arava, all along the border to Eilat.

"In addition, vaccines were also distributed in Jordan's territory at a depth of 7-10 km [about 4.4-6.2 mi] along the Jordan Valley and the Jordanian side of the Arava."

The report includes (page 208) a table titled "the scope of the oral vaccination project. 1998-2015" from which the following data for the years 2004-2015 are presented:

Season / Quantity of baits / Space (sq/km)
Spring 2004 / 250 000 / 14 000
Fall 2004 / 350 000 / 20 000
Spring 2005 / 184 000 / 13 000
Fall 2005 / 362 000 / 20 000
Fall 2006 / 362 000 / 20 000
Fall 2007 / 367 300 / 20 000
Fall 2008 / 367 500 / 20 000
Fall 2009 / 367 500 / 20 000
Fall 2010 / 450 000 / 20 000
Fall 2011 / 500 000 / 20 000
Fall 2012 / 500 000 / 20 000
Fall 2013 / 365 000 / 20 000
Fall 2014 / 365 000 / 20 000
Spring 2016 / 180 000 / 10 000

The timing and quantity of bait dispersal operations since spring 2016 are not (yet) officially available. According to media reports, the number of baits was increased to 475 000 (see 20171118.5452455 and 20171201.5477348). Confirmation, and in particular spatial and chronological data, would be helpful.

The budgetary cuts, leading to the delayed performance of the 2015/16 operation and its reduction as expressed in terms of number of baits and size of the territory covered, were subject to criticism, in November 2015, by concerned professionals indicating the consequential public health risk and effect upon wildlife (https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/.premium-1.684253). - Mod.AS
