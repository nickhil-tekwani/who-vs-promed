An 18-month-old girl is among three children seriously ill with possible
kidney failure after an ougbreak of E. coli food poisoning in Cumbria.
Twenty-five people have been affected, 11 of whom are still in hospital.
The spate of infections is one of the biggest since the outbreak in
Lanarkshire that killed 21 elderly people in 1996.
Health officials are investigating a possible link to milk supplied by
Scales Farm at Brigham, near Cockermouth. The farm had made milk deliveries
to all of those affected, but it has not been confirmed as the source of
the infection.
Of the 11 people taken to hospital, eight are still at the West Cumberland
Hospital at Whitehaven. Last night one was said to be "poorly" while the
rest were "settling".
The 18-month-old girl and two other seriously ill children, one of them a
girl aged three, were transferred to a renal unit at the Royal Victoria
Infirmary at Newcastle upon Tyne. They were all said to be in a stable
condition.
The North Cumberland Health Authority last night urged people who might
have bought milk from Scales Farm up to Wednesday to throw it away. The
authority has also set up a helpline for those worried about E. coli on
01946-523111.
The incidence of E. coli poisoning in England and Wales has risen from 250
cases in 1990 to more than 1,000 in 1997 (Nigel Hawkes writes). Fewer than
100 of the bacteria, which are carried by cows and passed to humans in
meat, milk and other foods, can cause symptoms ranging from diarrhoea to
kidney failure. The symptoms usually become apparent three to four days
after eating food contaminated by cattle faeces.
