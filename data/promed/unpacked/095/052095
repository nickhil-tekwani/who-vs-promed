Invasive _Haemophilus influenzae_ serotype a is increasing in the United States overall, with the greatest burden occurring in American Indian and Alaska Native children, according to findings published in Clinical Infectious Diseases [1].

"This study was initiated in response to a finding in our 2018 article describing current epidemiology and trends in invasive _Haemophilus influenzae_ disease in the United States, which showed that _H. influenzae_ serotype a (Hia) is of particular concern because incidence increased by an average of 13% annually from 2002 to 2015," CDC epidemiologist Heidi M Soeters told Healio. "We also knew that elevated Hia incidence had been reported among children and indigenous populations in the US and Canada."

Soeters and colleagues aimed to "dig deeper into this topic by describing the current epidemiology of invasive Hia disease in the US overall and in Alaska specifically, as the epidemiology of Hia in Alaska is distinct from that in the rest of the US, and multiple invasive Hia disease outbreaks have occurred there."

The researchers performed active population-based and laboratory-based surveillance for invasive Hia disease through the Active Bacterial Core surveillance sites, which are supported by the CDC as part of the Emerging Infections Program Network, and from statewide invasive bacterial disease surveillance in Alaska. The researchers serotyped sterile-site isolates via slide agglutination or real-time PCR and determined incidences in cases per 100 000.

From 2008 to 2017, an estimated average of 306 invasive Hia disease cases occurred annually in the US, with the incidence increasing by an average of 11.1% each year. Overall, 42.7% of cases occurred in children aged less than 5 years (incidence 0.64/100 000), with the greatest incidence among children aged less than one year (incidence, 1.60/100 000). The researchers also found that 7.8% of all patients with Hia died; 15.1% of adults aged 65 years and older died, representing the highest case fatality rate.

According to Soeters, American Indian and Alaska Native children aged younger than 5 years experienced the highest Hia disease burden. These children experienced 8 times more disease than children of all other races combined.

In Alaska, people of all ages experienced an Hia disease incidence nearly 6 times higher than in the rest of the US overall, and children aged younger than one year experienced a disease incidence nearly 14 times higher than children in the US overall. The case fatality rate in Alaska was 10.2%, with the vast majority of cases (93.9%) occurring among American Indians and Alaska Natives.

"In the context of increasing Hia incidence and clinical severity similar to _H. influenzae_ serotype b, new prevention strategies, including development of an Hia vaccine, could prevent morbidity and mortality among these vulnerable populations," Soeters said. "Additional questions remain regarding the frequency with which secondary Hia transmission occurs, the potential need for updated chemoprophylaxis recommendations, and appropriate target populations for a potential Hia vaccine."

Abstract
--------
"Background. _Haemophilus influenzae_ serotype a (Hia) can cause invasive disease similar to serotype b; no Hia vaccine is available. We describe the epidemiology of invasive Hia disease in the United States overall and specifically in Alaska during 2008-2017.

"Methods. Active population- and laboratory-based surveillance for invasive Hia disease was conducted through Active Bacterial Core surveillance sites and from Alaska statewide invasive bacterial disease surveillance. Sterile-site isolates were serotyped via slide agglutination or real-time polymerase chain reaction. Incidences in cases per 100 000 were calculated.

"Results. From 2008-2017, an estimated average of 306 invasive Hia disease cases occurred annually in the United States (estimated annual incidence: 0.10); incidence increased by an average of 11.1% annually. Overall, 42.7% of cases were in children aged under 5 years (incidence: 0.64), with highest incidence among children aged under one year (1.60). Case fatality was 7.8% overall and was highest among adults aged 65 years and older (15.1%). Among children aged under 5 years, incidence was 17 times higher among American Indians and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children (8.29) than among children of all other races combined (0.49). In Alaska, incidences among all ages (0.68) and among children aged under one year (24.73) were nearly 6 and 14 times higher, respectively, than corresponding U.S. incidences. Case fatality in Alaska was 10.2%, and the vast majority (93.9%) of cases occurred among AI/AN.

"Conclusions. Incidence of invasive Hia disease has increased since 2008, with the highest burden among AI/AN children. These data can inform prevention strategies, including Hia vaccine development."

Abstract
--------
"Background. Incidence of invasive disease due to _H. influenzae_ serotype a (Hia) increased an average of 13% annually from 2002-2015. We described clinical characteristics and adverse clinical outcomes of US invasive Hia cases detected through multi-state surveillance during 2011-2015.

"Methods. Medical record data were abstracted for cases reported in eight jurisdictions conducting active population- and laboratory-based surveillance for invasive Hia disease across the United States. Isolates from sterile sites were serotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Adverse clinical outcomes were defined as any possible complication of meningitis, bacteremic pneumonia, or bacteremia (including hearing loss, developmental delay, and speech delay, but excluding death), and were assessed at hospital discharge and one-year post-disease onset.

"Results. During 2011-2015, 190 Hia cases were reported to the 8 participating sites; 169 (88.9%) had data abstracted. Many patients were aged under 5 years (42.6%) or 65 years and older (20.7%). Meningitis was the most common clinical presentation among under one-year old children (71.4%); bacteremic pneumonia was the most common presentation among persons aged 50 years and over (78.7%). Overall, 95.9% of patients were hospitalized: among those hospitalized, 47.5% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 6.2% died during hospitalization. At hospital discharge and one-year post-disease onset, adverse outcomes were identified in 17.7% and 17.8% of patients overall, and in 43.9% and 48.5% of patients with meningitis (primarily children).

"Conclusions. Hia infection can cause severe disease requiring hospitalization and may also cause short- and long-term adverse clinical outcomes, especially among children. Novel vaccines could prevent morbidity and mortality."

_H. influenzae_ is a small, at times pleomorphic, Gram negative bacillus that requires blood-derived factors for in vitro growth. Strains of _H. influenzae_ may be either encapsulated or non-encapsulated. There are 6 antigenically distinct encapsulated types, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharide, designated types a-f.

Type b strains are important invasive pathogens in non-immune humans, causing meningitis, bacteremia, epiglottitis, facial cellulitis, pneumonia, empyema, and septic arthritis. The _H. influenzae_ type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine was introduced in the US in 1987. Before Hib vaccination, about 20 000 children younger than 5 years of age developed severe Hib disease in the US each year, and about 1000 died. By 2006, the number of reported Hib cases was down to only 29 for the year. Before introduction of Hib conjugate vaccine, rates of Hib disease in Alaska's indigenous people were among the highest in the world (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713835/). The concern was that use of Hib vaccine would be associated with replacement of Hib by non-type b strains of _H. influenzae_ causing invasive disease. In fact, since introduction of the Hib conjugate vaccine, Hia infection has become a major invasive bacterial disease in Alaska Native children.

Although no _H. influenzae_ type a (Hia) disease was identified in Alaska before 2002, 32 cases of invasive disease due to Hia were seen during the years 2002-2011; 27 cases occurred in Alaskan Indigenous children (18/100 000) versus 2 cases in non-Indigenous children, with the median age of cases being 0.7 years; 3 infants died (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3713835/).

Another study that analyzed population-based surveillance for invasive _H. influenzae_ disease across the North American Arctic identified a high proportion of non-b serotypes over the 6-year study period, with particularly high rates of invasive disease caused by _H. influenzae_ type a, 92 per cent of which occurred in indigenous people in Alaska and northern Canada (Bruce MG, Deeks SL, Zulz T, Navarro C, Palacios C, Case C, et al. Epidemiology of _Haemophilus influenzae_ serotype a, North American Arctic, 2000-2005. Emerg Infect Dis. 2008 Jan; 14(1): 48-55. doi:10.3201/eid1401.070822 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600153/).

Alaska, with an estimated population of 738 432 residents in 2015, is the largest by area and most sparsely populated US state, located in the northwest extremity of the US west coast, just across the Bering Strait from Asia, bordering the Canadian province of British Columbia and Yukon Territory to the east; 15 per cent of Alaska's population are Indigenous, the highest proportion of indigenous people of any US state (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska). - Mod.ML
