Public health officials in France are investigating a foodborne illness outbreak suspected to be caused by fuet, a type of sausage from Spain. The product was also sent to Belgium. In total, 18 patients with salmonellosis have been identified. They became ill between 8 Jul 2020 and 3 Aug 2020, according to Sante Publique [Public Health] France. All patients, including 12 children, had consumed the Spanish dry-cured sausage.

A link between illness and the Spanish company Embutidos Sola SA was confirmed at the start of September 2020, according to the Directorate General for Food (DGAL), the Directorate General for Health, and Sante Publique [Public Health] France. Several batches consumed by those sick were found to be contaminated with a _Salmonella_ strain that is a variant of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium.

A withdrawal of several batches of fuet, from a single supermarket in Gironde, took place on 21 Aug 2020, based on initial findings of the investigation. Now, a withdrawal and recall of all fuet with all dates and bearing the mark ES-10.12147/B-CE, will be carried out in various stores across France. Auchan was one supermarket to publish a product recall notice.

Public health authorities advised people who still have the affected products not to consume them and to return them to the place of purchase.

In 2018, French authorities reported a foodborne outbreak caused by monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium 1,4,[5],12:i:-) in fuet sausage from Spain, but it is not known if the incidents are connected. In July 2020, an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis was suspected to be caused by eggs from France. In April 2020, _Salmonella_ Miami in chilled vacuum-packed cooked sliced pork shoulder from Spain was linked to an outbreak, but no details have been released on these incidents by French authorities.

Food contaminated with _Salmonella_ bacteria does not usually look, smell, or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a _Salmonella_ infection. Infants, children, seniors, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled food and developed symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to _Salmonella_ bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. _Salmonella_ infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis.

Symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise, healthy adults are usually sick for 4 to 7 days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients require hospitalization. Older adults, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions.

Fuet (translated as "whip" for the sausage's shape) is a Catalan, thin, dry-cured sausage of pork meat in a pork gut. The most famous is made in the comarca (county) of Osona and is also known as Vic fuet (fuet de Vic, after the city of Vic, capital of Osona). - Mod.LL
