Outbreak reports on other lists: RFI 990909214939
Date: Fri 10 Sep 1999
From: alex mcnees <amcnees_ceip@mindspring.com>

I have a request similar to that of the search for outbreak reports on
other lists. I work for the California Emerging Infections Program,
FoodNet project and am interested in up-to-date reports on food recalls. I
currently use the following sites for information, but am interested in
finding additional resources. Could ProMED help?
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), USDA - meat, poultry, and
processed egg products
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), FDA - seafood,
fruits, vegetables, shell eggs and other non-meat foods
CDC
www.foodsafety.com
Any other sites would be helpful.
