Minnesota health officials say a Carver County cat has been confirmed to be infected with the virus causing COVID-19. It's the 1st confirmed case in a cat in the state.

On Tuesday [2 Jun 2020], the Minnesota Board of Animal Health released the findings, saying the cat was confirmed to be infected with coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 7 days after its owner was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.

The cat was brought into the vet with 105-degree temperature and signs consistent with upper respiratory illness. The cat was tested based on the signs and its owner's confirmed COVID-19 illness.

The animal health board says the cat was healthy 5 days after the initial clinic visit, but recommended the cat remain isolated for 14 days following the positive test result. [If the cat was healthy 5 days after diagnosis, then the disease certainly did not last long in this cat. - Mod.TG]

"At this time, there is no evidence pets play a role in spreading COVID-19 to people or other animals," said State Veterinarian, Dr Beth Thompson. "It's always important to isolate ill pets from healthy people and pets when possible, just as ill people should be isolated from healthy people and pets. If you suspect your pet is ill, contact your veterinarian."

According to animal health board representative Michael Crusan, it's assumed the owner infected the cat, but further investigation would be needed for confirmation.

A dog at the household remains healthy at this time.

In April [2020], the USDA announced cases of coronavirus infections in 2 household cats in New York.

Routine testing of animals is not recommended at this time.

[From the time the article indicates the animal was tested until it seems recovered was only 5 days. So, it does not seem to last long in the cats. Nevertheless, this illness could be distressing to the cats, and certainly to the caregivers of this cat. Perhaps this should emphasize the importance of handwashing before we handle our animal's food or the animal itself. This should further serve as a warning to cover mouth and nose for any sneeze or cough, even if not related to COVID-19. - Mod.TG
