New Cholera Outbreak in Maputo
------------------------------
At least 10 patients have been admitted to the cholera ward at the Mavalane
General Hospital in Maputo over the last few days, and the health
authorities blame the early outbreak of the disease, before the onset of
the rainy season, on deteriorating sanitation conditions in the town,
reports the 23 Oct 2002 issue of the daily paper "Noticias".
Maputo is going through yet another of its periodic garbage crises, with
heaps of rubbish piled on the streets. The menace to public health is
aggravated by leaks in the obsolete sewerage system.
The health authorities are once again urging Maputo residents to observe
basic measures of hygiene and to treat all drinking water to try and
prevent the spread of the disease.
The health source did not specify the areas from where the hospitalized
cholera patients come, but the suburbs that are usually worst hit by this
disease are Maxaquene, Chamanculo, Mafalala, Polana Canico, and Mikadjuine.
More than 340 cases of cholera that resulted in 4 deaths were reported in
Maputo during the first 2 months of this year, compared with over 800
diagnosed in a similar period of 2001.
Meanwhile, Maputo city council has announced that it will soon receive 2
new trucks to add to its mostly broken-down fleet of rubbish collection
vehicles. The director of the Maputo city sanitation services, Joao
Mucavele, said that the situation has been worsening lately because the 4
trucks that were being used to do the job have all broken down and the
municipal authorities do not have the money to buy the necessary spare
parts to repair them.
Mucavele said that until the 2 trucks arrive, the municipal authorities are
working with local business people to help in the job of cleaning up the
city. Mucavele said that for it to do the job properly, the municipality
needs at least 15 garbage trucks.
