Sri Lanka veterinary sources say that a cattle disease spreading in the Eastern Province, Batticaloa district, has affected the livelihood of the cattle farmers of the area.

Farmers say that around 1000 cattle have died due to the disease recently. They say the cattle die without taking food due to the disease. Milk production has also been affected.

Veterinary sources say that the cause of the cattle deaths are parasites spread by flies. They recommend protecting the affected cows from flies and using pesticides to destroy flies.

Meanwhile, figures released by the Central Bank showed that milk production in Sri Lanka has increased by 28 percent last year [2012].

The Central Bank report said the development programs launched by the government to boost milk production in the country and rearing cattle have helped increase milk production.

Sri Lanka recently imported 500 high breed dairy cows from Australia in a measure to boost the dairy industry in the country.

[In view of the scanty and non-specific information included in the above report on the cattle health problem (inappetence, reduced milk yield, death), we are compelled to request additional information. This should preferably include clinical signs, description of the affected population (e.g. age distribution, husbandry, feeding, number of farms affected, morbidity and mortality rates, and PM changes). Are the affected cattle local or imported animals? Have other farm animals been affected as well?

Since the information on the possible role of flies as vectors is attributed to "veterinary sources," could these sources kindly be more specific? If epidemiological investigations and laboratory tests have been carried out, information on their outcome will be much appreciated. - Mod.AS
