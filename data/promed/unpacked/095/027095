Virus infects lions
------------------
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus, the equivalent of HIV in human beings, has
infected lions in Kruger National Park, in South Africa, threatening the
viability of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park.
The mega-park, joining Gonarezhou (in Zimbabwe), Kruger (in South Africa),
and Gaza (in Mozambique), is the world's largest wildlife sanctuary, but,
veterinary workers in Kruger say that between 60 and 80 percent of the
lions in South Africa are now under threat.
The Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority was aware of the
disease, on the other side of the Limpopo, and said that it was closely
monitoring its development. The authority's chief warden, Mr. Lovemore
Mungwashu, said the disease was still in the southernmost part of Kruger
National Park, and, that Zimbabwe was still safe. "Yes, the AIDS-like
disease has been discovered in South Africa, and we are carefully watching
it. Although Kruger is part of the transfrontier park, the disease is still
confined to the southern-most part of the park, and Zimbabwe is still
safe," said Mr. Mungwashu.
The primary mode of FIV transmission is sexual contact and bite wounds. On
rare occasions, infection is transmitted from mother to cub, usually upon
passage through the birth canal, or, when newly-born cubs ingest
contaminated milk.
Infected animals usually appear normal for a few years, until infection
eventually leads to the gradual collapse of the immune system, leaving the
animal without protection from other subsequent infections.
Common among the symptoms are persistent fever; diarrhea, with a loss of
appetite; poor coat condition; chronic, or recurrent, infection of the skin
and urinary bladder; abortions; behavior changes; and seizures. All of this
is followed by slow, but progressive, weight loss and neurological disorders.
Zimbabwe shares a long stretch of the border with South Africa's Kruger
National Park, in Gonarezhou National Park, the verdant wildlife sanctuary
where lions roam wild and free. Given the long-range migratory habits of
lions, and the territorial dominance of huge males, there are fears that
the disease will spread to Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
Other felines, the leopard and cheetah, also have FIV, but, are said to be
less susceptible, because they are more solitary.
Lion prides are more affected by the disease, because they are highly
sociable and are in constant physical contact with each other.

[Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a worldwide-occurring lentivirus
that severely impairs the immune function of infected domestic cats, in
which the prevalence has been reported to range from 1 to 28 percent. FIV
has not been found, so far, to infect humans, and, due to structural and
biological similarities, it represents a promising model for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS.
Since the discovery of FIV, reported in 1987, FIV vaccine research has
pursued both molecular and conventional vaccine approaches toward the
development of a commercial product. A dual-subtype FIV commercial vaccine
-- the 1st animal lentivirus vaccine -- was approved by the USDA in 2002.
We are not aware of its efficacy in non-domestic feline species. - Mod.AS].
