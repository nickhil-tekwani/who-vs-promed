Epidemiological comments [abridged]
--------------------------------------------
1. 8th affected farm (Toyota city, Aichi, 5 Feb 2019). On 4 Feb 2019, several pigs were found to have low appetite and reported to the Aichi Central LHSC. Official veterinarians of the LHSC immediately visited the farm to conduct clinical inspection and blood sampling. Official veterinarians conducted RT-PCR for CSF virus, found positive on 5 Feb 2019. The National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) carried out the sequencing analysis of the amplified products, and the NIAH confirmed that this was a case of CSF on 6 Feb 2019. Result of the sequencing analysis suggests that the virus of the 8th case is classified into the same phylogenetic cluster with those of the previous 7 cases and some wild boars captured in Gifu and Aichi. Movement and shipment restriction are imposed on the farms within a radius of 3 km [1.86 miles] and 10 km [6.21 miles] on the affected farm, respectively. Stamping out is being carried out on the affected farm.

2. [Farms epidemiologically related to] the 8th affected farm (Tahara city in Aichi, Iida city in Nagano, Ena city in Gifu, Ohmihachiman city in Shiga, and Higashi Osaka city in Osaka, 5 Feb 2019). Immediately after the confirmation of the 8th case in Aichi, epidemiologically related farms were identified. These farms have introduced piglet from the 8th affected farm. The official veterinarian of the LHSC of each prefecture visited the epidemiologically related farms and collected samples. RT-PCR for CSF virus were conducted at the LHSC in each prefecture, and samples were found to be positive on 6 Feb 2019. Stamping out of all pigs is being carried out in these farms.

3. Summary of the wild boar surveillance: As of 4 Feb 2019, 710 wild boars (79 dead and 631 captured) in Gifu prefecture have been tested, and 112 (41 dead and 71 captured) were found to be positive for CSF by RT-PCR since 13 Sep 2019. A total of 59 wild boars (14 dead and 45 captured) in Aichi prefecture have been tested, and 10 were found to be positive (one dead and 9 captured) for CSF by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2019. Among the other prefectures, 161 dead wild boars in 36 prefectures were tested, and all were found to be negative by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2018. All prefectures are requested to conduct CSF testing on dead wild boars.

[The Japanese authorities have acted swiftly following the detection of spread of the virus with animal consignments from the Toyota City Farm in Aichi. This is reflected by the fact that only a few animals were found, upon inspection, clinically sick and no mortality took place before the stamping-out activities on the affected farms. They have a heavy task to prevent further spread and, in particular, leakage of the virus to wild boar populations in the prefectures hitherto not infected.

In December 2019, the Gifu prefectural assembly adopted a statement calling on the central government to study vaccinating hogs against the disease. The farm ministry remained reluctant because it would affect the country's pork exports.

As wild boars are suspected to be the source of infection, Masuo Sueyoshi, head of the University of Miyazaki's Division of Prevention and Control for Animal Diseases, said control of such animals should be tightened. "In addition to trapping, steps should be taken such as placing food containing vaccines along trails" frequented by wild boars, he said (see https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20181225/p2g/00m/0na/042000c). - Mod.AS
