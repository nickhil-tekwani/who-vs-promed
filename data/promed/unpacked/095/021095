Australia's biggest pork producer, SunPork, has confirmed its piggeries have been impacted by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). JEV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito to people and animals -- mostly pigs and horses.

SunPork Group CEO and managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld said several of their sites in the eastern states had been impacted and they were working through it. "One of the Goondiwindi farms has been infected...we have an infected premises in New South Wales.... There are infected premises all down the east coast," Dr van Barneveld said. "We've been working on this endlessly since Friday night [25 Feb 2022] when we first were made aware that it was an issue."

Dr van Barneveld said it was not a new occurrence and there was no cause for alarm in the pork industry. "The piggeries are innocent bystanders. Pigs are not going to infect other pigs. It's not going to have a negative effect at an abattoir. The pork is safe to eat. It's play on," he said. "If you're going to have an emergency animal disease, this is the one to have. We're not actually anticipating any significant disruption to our operations at all."

Pigs are the focus from a human health perspective, as they can infect mosquitoes that can then infect humans. This is not the case with horses.

Humans can become infected with JEV through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught through eating pork or pig products.

"If a mosquito bites people and if it bites horses, they're called dead-end hosts, so it doesn't pass on. If it bites a pig -- a pig's an amplifier -- so if another mosquito bites that pig while it's viremic, which is a very short period of time, it can transmit in the mosquito population," Dr van Barneveld said. "That's why there are controls around the movement of pigs."

Dr van Barneveld said authorities were working well together to protect humans and animals. "This is about protecting people and the bad guy in the process is a mosquito and the weather patterns," he said. "The state health departments and the state chief veterinary officers have worked extremely well together. They understand that eradicating it is going to be very unlikely and they're being very practical around the movement of pigs and making sure people are safe."

He said SunPork had done a lot of preparedness work around African swine fever and had good relationships with the state chief veterinary officers which puts it in a very good position to manage this. "When you get a disease like this, there are a whole stack of legislative instruments that are pushed into place that have to be executed, and they're following those processes. Everyone's fairly calm about it and [I] think we can manage through it with minimal disruption."

A vaccine for horses and pigs is available in countries where the disease is endemic, but no JE vaccines for animals are registered for use in Australia, and there is no effective treatment for JE in animals.

On Friday [4 Mar 2022], Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Mark Schipp said JEV had been confirmed at 14 piggeries across NSW, SA, Queensland and Victoria. This follows a confirmed human case of JEV in Queensland. Queensland Health said the confirmed case had recent travel in regional southern Queensland and is currently being treated in a Brisbane hospital.

Less than 1% of people infected may develop a serious illness such as encephalitis and experience symptoms including neck stiffness, severe headache and coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.

Goondiwindi and District Veterinary Services owner and vet Dr Trisha Pullos said the recent heavy rain in parts of Queensland and NSW had brought with it more mosquitoes and potentially more risk of JEV. "We've had quite a bit of rain like everybody else, and the mozzies out here are brutal," Dr Pullos said.

Dr Pullos said the main issues were observed in piglets -- pigs didn't seem to be affected physically. "If the piglets are born dead or weak or malformed or something really unusual or if the sow aborts the whole litter -- that's the 1st sign," she said. "Pigs can amplify the virus. It's not transferable between humans; it seems to be just the mosquitoes that are how we can catch it, so if you can keep the mozzies off you, then we'll be a little bit safer."

She said it was important to get information from reliable sources and anyone who was worried should contact their vet. "Anybody who's got 2 pigs in the backyard, or a pig for the kids, or a little kill herd at the back of the property -- they need to contact their local vet and just say, 'Hey, I've got 2 pigs here. What do I need to keep an eye out for?' Then what we'll do is we'll let our district vet know who will then let the Chief Veterinary Officer know so we can try and track it a lot faster, because if someone goes and tells their neighbour but doesn't tell the vet then we're already behind the 8 ball."

She said there was a risk people had "bad news fatigue" and wouldn't take things seriously. "I've found that everyone's a little bit worn out. There's been quite a few comments on our Facebook posts where people are just like, 'Not again', or 'What now?' 'Can it just end?' We might be at risk of going, 'Oh, whatever', and I want to make sure that they're not going to do that."

JEV was detected in 3 people in the Torres Strait Islands in 1995. In 1998, 2 further cases were detected in people in Queensland, including one acquired on the Australian mainland.

JEV is mostly transmitted by bites from infected mosquito vectors and is maintained in mosquito-waterbird or mosquito-waterbird-pig cycles. Waterbirds, particularly wading birds such as herons and egrets, are the main source from which transmission of JEV can occur. They are important amplifying hosts and hold enough virus in their blood to infect vectors for one to 7 days.

Pigs are also major amplifiers of the virus and develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect vectors for around 4 days. Horses and a wide range of other species may be infected but do not develop levels of virus in the blood sufficient to infect mosquitoes, so are not involved in maintaining disease in an area.

Key points
----------
- The virus has been detected at 21 piggeries, 3 human cases have been confirmed, and the federal government predicts more cases will be detected.
- The Chief Veterinary Officer says it's unusual to detect Japanese encephalitis (JE) so far south.
- Pork SA [South Australia] says piggeries will still be able to operate, but restrictions are in place.

The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) is now impacting 4 states as public health officials work to contain it. Since the potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus was first detected near the New South Wales-Victoria border last week, cases have been recorded in Queensland and South Australia.

A Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesperson said 3 cases of JE had been confirmed in humans, and a number of possible cases were under investigation. The spokesperson said it was anticipated that more cases would be confirmed shortly.

Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer Mark Schipp said animals at 21 piggeries had been infected. "We're mapping the presence of waterbirds, feral pigs or piggeries and people that have contracted the infection," he said. "We're undertaking mosquito surveillance and mosquito control on those farms."

There is a vaccine available as well. "That's the purpose of the mapping that we're undertaking at the moment -- to prioritise those vaccinations and then rolling the vaccinations out further from there," Mr Schipp said. The movement of pigs on farms with positive cases is being restricted.

Pork SA chairman Andrew Johnson is urging pork producers to report suspected cases. "Farmers that see any symptoms, they shouldn't be afraid to advise accordingly," he said.

JE cannot be transmitted to humans by eating pork products and producers will still be able to transport livestock to abattoirs. "If there's a suspect case, or if there is a positive case, those farms will be issued a movement permit that will allow them to continue business," Mr Johnson said.

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and cannot be passed from livestock to humans. "Japanese encephalitis is a virus carried by mosquitoes from water birds or pigs to humans or horses," Mr Schipp said. "Pigs are an amplifying host, so they produce a lot of virus and the mosquitoes pick that up and carry it forward into humans and horses."

JE is not normally found in Australia and health officials survey the Torres Strait and the Top End every year to check for outbreaks. This outbreak has been found along the Murray River corridor.

Mr Schipp said it was surprising to find JE so far south. "It will have a large impact on human health and industry," he said. "The impacts on tourism, for example, could be significant. We're doing everything we can to try and minimise its spread and ensure that people are vaccinated."

[Pigs have been effective sentinels for the presence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in the 4 affected Australian states. The above reports provide a comprehensive overview of the current JEV situation in the 4 states. There has been no indication in the above or previous reports that ProMED has received about the frequency of aborted litters or teratogenic effects in the affected piggeries. Restriction on movement of pigs out of infected piggeries could be a problem for producers. The Australian response is a good example of implementation of a One Health approach to an unexpected disease outbreak. Public health and animal health officials have been working closely together on the outbreak and informing the public in a way that promotes concern and reduces risk of exposure without panic. - Mod.TY

In adult swine reproductive failure may be the only clinical sign while piglets may suffer from CNS disease, unthriftiness, etc. For more information on JEV in swine see https://vetmed.iastate.edu/vdpam/FSVD/swine/index-diseases/japanese-B-encephalitis. - Mod.JH
