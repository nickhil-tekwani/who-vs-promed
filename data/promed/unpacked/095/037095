Residents in southern New South Wales [NSW] are advised to take extra steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites following a suspected outbreak of Ross River fever and the Barmah Forest virus locally.

The Southern NSW Local Health District says an increased number of suspected cases of both mosquito-borne diseases have been reported to the public health unit and are currently under investigation. So far, the investigation suggests the infections were acquired on the NSW South Coast.

The NSW Arbovirus Surveillance and Mosquito Monitoring program has seen a moderate number of mosquitoes in early February [2021] at a trapping site in Narooma.

Manager of infectious diseases April Roberts-Witteveen said symptoms of both diseases are similar and include a rash, fever, chills, headache, aches, and pains, which usually show about 3 weeks after a mosquito bite. "Tiredness and sore and swollen joints can also occur," she said. "Anyone experiencing these symptoms should see their doctor."

Symptoms can subside after a few weeks, but some people may experience them for weeks or even months.

NSW Health has recommended the following advice to avoid mosquito bites:
- When outside cover up as much as possible with light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing and covered footwear.
- Use an effective repellent on all exposed skin. Re-apply repellent within a few hours as protection wears off with perspiration. The best mosquito repellents contain Diethyl Toluamide (DEET) or Picaridin. Those containing oil of lemon eucalyptus can also provide adequate protection.
- Take special care during peak mosquito biting hours, especially around dawn and dusk.
- Remove potential mosquito breeding sites from around the home and screen windows and doors.
- When camping, use flyscreens on caravans and tents or sleep under mosquito nets.
- Use insecticide sprays, vapour dispensing units (indoors) and mosquito coils (outdoors) to clear rooms or repel mosquitoes from an area. Devices that use light to attract and electrocute insects are not effective.

[Although the above report does not indicate how many cases of Ross River and Barmah Forest virus infections are under investigation, there is concern because these viruses have caused outbreaks sporadically in the past, particularly in New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania states. 2017 was a very active Ross River and Barmah Forest virus transmission season.

As noted in previous comments, Ross River virus [RRV] infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases also occur at times in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. Common symptoms include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring. Barmah Forest virus is also an alphavirus.

Dr Steve Berger provided comments on the background of Barmah Forest disease [BFD] in Australia abstracted from Gideon (http://www.GideonOnline.com) and the Gideon e-book series. Barmah Forest disease virus was 1st isolated from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_) in the Barmah Forest, Northern Victoria in 1974. Human infection was subsequently reported along the south coast of New South Wales during the mid-1980's; in Queensland during 1988-1989; in the Northern Territory in 1992; and in southwestern Western Australia in 1993. A new focus was described in Gippsland (Victoria) during 1993-1994. The number of localities reporting Barmah Forest disease increased during 1996-1998, and again during 1999-2001. Disease incidence has increased somewhat since 2000, with most cases reported from Queensland and New South Wales. The most recent reported outbreak of Barmah Forest virus infections was in Tasmania in 2019. The previous ProMED-posted cases of BFV infections have been in Queensland state.
