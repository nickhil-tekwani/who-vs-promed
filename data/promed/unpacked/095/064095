Over 1000 tons of infected potatoes confiscated and destroyed
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Bulgarian Food Safety Agency [has recently] registered a lot of fraud with potatoes imported from Poland or regions where potatoes are infected. Because of the infection the import from these regions is forbidden. Some people, however, continue trying to import to trade. Over 1000 tons of infected potatoes have already [been] confiscated and destroyed.

The potatoes from Poland, which were infected with "potato cancer" [see comment below], were mislabelled as Swedish potatoes using fake certificates. [They are mostly being] confiscated at the borders, both at Oryahovo and Ruse [Danube ports on the northern border].

"Potato cancer" is dangerous only to potatoes. Infected potatoes could spread the disease to other areas. The trade of infected potatoes is forbidden, but they are sold much below the standard price. This is a serious problem.

Polish authorities have been informed and measures to prevent the import of infected potatoes have been taken.

[A large number of potato diseases due to a range of pathogens are know to occur in the region. In Poland, a high percentage of potatoes are said to be affected by diseases. The term "potato cancer" is not commonly used and it is not clear which disease is referred to in the item above.
