Horses found to have encephalitis
-------------------------------
A total of 2 horses in north central Wisconsin have tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a mosquito-borne illness caused by a virus that attacks the central nervous system, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection announced Tuesday [21 Aug 2012]. The 2 horses were located in Clark and Lincoln counties.

EEE can be transmitted by mosquito bite to horses, birds and humans. Although humans also can contract EEE, no human cases have been reported in Wisconsin, according to the DATCP.

Signs in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, aimless wandering and circling, blindness and sometimes paralysis. There is no cure; the disease must run its course and has a mortality rate of 90 percent or higher.

Horses that have never been vaccinated will need 2 doses, 2 to 4 weeks apart, and the vaccine will take at least 2 weeks to build up enough antibodies to protect them. A booster should be given at least annually and takes about 4 days to be effective, according to the DATCP news release. Vaccines will not protect horses that already have been infected when they receive the injections. Vaccines are available to protect against other strains of equine encephalitis along with EEE, and a separate West Nile virus vaccine also is available.

In addition to vaccination, owners should take steps to reduce their animals' exposure to mosquitoes, state veterinarian Robert Ehlenfeldt said. They should eliminate standing water by removing objects such as old tires or even the folds in tarps where water collects, and frequently changing water in water troughs, bird baths and similar containers. Owners also should keep their animals inside barns if possible from dusk through dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.

[When protective vaccines are available it is a tragedy for this kind of senseless loss to occur. Losing a pet is never easy on any of us, but vaccination is not that expensive and is live-saving.

If you have not already vaccinated your horse, please do so immediately.
