[1] China (Beijing) outbreak: update
Date: Wed 17 Jun 2020 08:42 am IST
Source: NDTV, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]

Beijing's airports cancelled more than 1200 flights and schools in the Chinese capital were closed again on Wednesday [17 Jun 2020] as authorities rushed to contain a new coronavirus outbreak linked to a wholesale food market. The city reported 31 new cases on Wednesday [17 Jun 2020], while officials urged residents not to leave Beijing, with fears growing about a 2nd wave of infections in China, which had largely brought its outbreak under control.

Tens of thousands of people linked to the new Beijing virus cluster -- believed to have started in the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food market -- are being tested, with almost 30 residential compounds in the city now under lockdown.

At least 1255 scheduled flights were cancelled on Wednesday morning [17 Jun 2020], state-run People's Daily reported, nearly 70 per cent of all trips to and from Beijing's main airports. The outbreak had already forced authorities to announce a travel ban for residents of "medium- or high-risk" areas of the city while requiring other residents to take nucleic acid tests in order to leave Beijing.

Meanwhile, several provinces were quarantining travellers from Beijing, where all schools -- which had mostly reopened -- have been ordered to close again and return to online classes. "The epidemic situation in the capital is extremely severe," Beijing city spokesman Xu Hejian warned Tuesday [16 Jun 2020].

Mass testing under way
----------------------
Officials have closed 11 markets and disinfected thousands of food and beverage businesses in Beijing since the outbreak was detected. The city has now reported 137 infections over the last 6 days, with 6 new asymptomatic cases and 3 suspected cases on Wednesday [17 Jun 2020], according to the municipal health commission. An additional 2 domestic cases, one in neighbouring Hebei province and another in Zhejiang, were reported by national authorities on Wednesday [17 Jun 2020], while there were 11 imported cases.

Authorities have so far banned group sports, ordered people to wear masks in crowded enclosed spaces, and suspended inter-provincial group tours in response to the outbreak.

Officials said that since [30 May 2020], more than 200 000 people had visited Xinfadi market, which supplies more than 70 per cent of Beijing's fruit and vegetables. More than 8000 workers there were tested and quarantined.

Until the new outbreak, most of China's recent cases were nationals returning from abroad as COVID-19 spread globally, and the government had all but declared victory against the disease. China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday [15 Jun 2020] that the virus type found in the Beijing outbreak was a "major epidemic strain" in Europe.

[The media report mentions the additional measures of shutting down air traffic and discouraging inter provincial travel. Effectively, a lockdown is being put into place, focused on the areas around the market. One suspects this lockdown may be expanded geographically as more contacts are identified.

We still await further information on additional genomic studies in the attempt to identify the location of origin of the virus. Other media reports have mentioned that salmon importations are being halted (see Asia One for more details on the salmon https://www.asiaone.com/china/coronavirus-china-halts-salmon-imports-over-possible-link-beijing-outbreak-consumers-leap). In this article, Marion Koopmans at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam raised concern of a "European strain" in the absence of data addressing the diversity of viruses in China.

[2] Dexamethasone shown to reduce mortality in severe cases
Date: Tue 16 Jun 2020
Source: University of Oxford, press release [edited]
http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-06-16-low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-one-third-hospitalised-patients-severe


In March 2020, the RECOVERY (randomised evaluation of COVID-19 therapy) trial was established as a randomised clinical trial to test a range of potential treatments for COVID-19, including low-dose dexamethasone (a steroid treatment). Over 11 500 patients have been enrolled from over 175 NHS hospitals in the UK.

On [8 Jun 2020], recruitment to the dexamethasone arm was halted since, in the view of the trial Steering Committee, sufficient patients had been enrolled to establish whether or not the drug had a meaningful benefit.

A total of 2104 patients were randomised to receive dexamethasone 6 mg once per day (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for 10 days and were compared with 4321 patients randomised to usual care alone. Among the patients who received usual care alone, 28-day mortality was highest in those who required ventilation (41%), intermediate in those patients who required oxygen only (25%), and lowest among those who did not require any respiratory intervention (13%).

Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in ventilated patients (rate ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88]; p=0.0003) and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only (0.80 [0.67 to 0.96]; p=0.0021). There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support (1.22 [0.86 to 1.75]; p=0.14).

Based on these results, 1 death would be prevented by treatment of around 8 ventilated patients or around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone. Given the public health importance of these results, we are now working to publish the full details as soon as possible.

Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, and one of the chief investigators for the trial, said: 'Dexamethasone is the 1st drug to be shown to improve survival in COVID-19. This is an extremely welcome result. The survival benefit is clear and large in those patients who are sick enough to require oxygen treatment, so dexamethasone should now become standard of care in these patients. Dexamethasone is inexpensive, on the shelf, and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide.'

Martin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, one of the chief investigators, said: 'Since the appearance of COVID-19 6 months ago, the search has been on for treatments that can improve survival, particularly in the sickest patients. These preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial are very clear -- dexamethasone reduces the risk of death among patients with severe respiratory complications. COVID-19 is a global disease -- it is fantastic that the 1st treatment demonstrated to reduce mortality is one that is instantly available and affordable worldwide.'

About the RECOVERY trial
------------------------
The RECOVERY trial is a large, randomised controlled trial of possible treatments for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 http://www.recoverytrial.net. Over 11 500 patients have been randomised to the following treatment arms, or no additional treatment:

- Lopinavir-ritonavir (commonly used to treat HIV)
- Low-dose dexamethasone (a type of steroid, which typically used to reduce inflammation)
- Hydroxychloroquine (which has now been stopped due to lack of efficacy)
- Azithromycin (a commonly used antibiotic)
- Tocilizumab (an anti-inflammatory treatment given by injection)
- Convalescent plasma (collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and contains antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus).

Overall dexamethasone reduced the 28-day mortality rate by 17% (0.83 [0.74 to 0.92]; P=0.0007) with a highly significant trend showing greatest benefit among those patients requiring ventilation (test for trend p less than 0.001). But it is important to recognise that we found no evidence of benefit for patients who did not require oxygen and we did not study patients outside the hospital setting. Follow-up is complete for over 94% of participants.

The RECOVERY trial involves many thousands of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and research administrators at over 175 hospitals across the whole of the UK, supported by staff at the NIHR Clinical Research Network, NHS DigiTrials, Public Health England, Public Health Scotland, Department of Health & Social Care, and the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

[Welcome news to finally identify a drug, readily available that has been demonstrated to reduce mortality in severe presentations of COVID-19. I look forward to seeing the published paper. While the reductions in mortality are not as high as one would like, they are still highly significant and may significantly lower the mortality rates currently observed.

Unfortunately, one concern in the USA will be the likely rush to stockpile this medication with resultant shortages of supplies for patients who will benefit from the treatment. This has happened with all prior medications speculated to have an impact on the disease, such as hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, and famotidine. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 16 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO director-general Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing yesterday [15 Jun 2020], stressed that "Despite the ongoing global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot lose sight of other significant public health issues, including influenza". WHO urges countries to address the sharp decline in influenza surveillance and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as the southern hemisphere enters the flu season.

- Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, and it is now facing another major threat to health security -- COVID-19. A health care worker asked Yemenis to be extremely vigilant and protect themselves and urged them to stay at home as health care workers put their lives at unprecedented risk to save lives.

- In today's 'subject in focus', we look at the WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN), which is tackling the spread of mis- and dis-information and rumours during the COVID-19 pandemic.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 50.7% of the global newly reported cases and 53.0% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 36.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Brazil reported 28.5%, Chile 8.6%, Peru 7.7%, and Mexico 6.9%. The same 5 countries at the top.

The European region reported 14.6% of the global newly reported cases and 13.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Russia reported 47.8% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Turkey 9.2%, the UK 5.6%, Sweden 4.5%, Belarus 4.1%, and Ukraine 3.9%. Again, same countries, minor juggling of orders and percentages on a daily basis.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 15.7% of the global newly reported cases and 14.8% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 24.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 23.9%, Iran 13.2%, Egypt 9.1%, Qatar 6.9%, Iraq 6.0%, and Oman 5.6%.

The African region reported 5.4% of the global newly reported cases and 3.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 54.6% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 9.0%, Gabon 8.9%, Ghana 8.5%, Cameroon 4.6%, and Ethiopia 2.8%. While South Africa and Nigeria are consistently number 1 and number 2 in terms of 24 hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.78% of the global newly reported cases and 0.40% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 52.9% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 23.1%, Japan 9.2%, and China 4.9%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets has brought China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases.

The South East Asia region reported 12.9% of the global newly reported cases and 14.8% of global fatalities. India reported 69.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 20.3%, Indonesia 6.7%, and Nepal 3.0%. Same countries, same order as in previous days.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 8000+ new cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean has surpassed the European region with Pakistan reporting 5-6000+ cases a day. South East Asia is approaching parity with the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean region has surpassed the European region for the past 2 days in terms of newly confirmed cases. The Americas region is reporting around 70 000 cases a day with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day (today16 Jun 2020, was only 17 110 cases), and the USA seems to have stabilized at 20 000+ a day. In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 2000-3000+ range daily, and in the Western Pacific region, they are maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 400+ cases per day (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 3. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 16 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has overtaken the European region; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

Countries with more than 5000 cases not on the list above (as the list has grown longer, we froze the list and maintain a list of countries passing the 5000-case mark):

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 8 256 725, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count increased by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.20 million confirmed cases, now represents 26.7% of the global cases of COVID-19, as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases. A global total of 445 958 deaths have been reported, an increase of 6907 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, there is major underreporting of numbers of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, possibly 1/10th to 1/20th in order of magnitude. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home and who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Italy, Peru, Iran, and Germany at number 10. China is number 19. In descending rank order, Brazil is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, India, Russia, Chile, Mexico, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Peru, and Bangladesh.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region, a new country from the South East Asia region was added in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most newly confirmed cases include 7 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the European region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, none from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
