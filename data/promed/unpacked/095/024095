Avian influenza strain identified: no human threat seen; PA poultry remains
safe
---------------------------------
HARRISBURG, PA, Feb 13: Agriculture secretary Dennis C Wolff today
announced that a Mount Joy, Lancaster County, poultry flock, previously
identified as having avian influenza, has a strain of influenza, H2N2, that
poses a low threat to the general population and to the poultry industry.
"Late this afternoon, we received notification of the strain from USDA's
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa," said Wolff.
[Although, ProMED-mail post 20040213.0486 stated the strain to be an H7
strain, it was prior to receiving the report from NVSL. Based on the virus
in previous years, it seemed reasonable the virus was likely an H7, but
specifically typing it has identified it as a different strain. - Mod.TG]
"This is not the strain currently in Asia or Delaware. We believe this
indicates no threat to human health and a low threat to the poultry
industry. Based on this information, USDA is notifying our international
trading partners to reassure them of the safety of US poultry products."
"We have been working closely with the state Department of Agriculture from
the very beginning of this situation," said Dr Calvin B Johnson, state
secretary of health. "Based upon our information from Ames, Iowa, we
believe no health risk to humans exists at this time."
The virus was discovered during routine surveillance testing for avian
influenza. The flock had no clinical signs to indicate illness with avian
influenza, mortality is being monitored, and no decrease in egg production
has occurred. The farm in Mount Joy remains under quarantine, and all 16
poultry flocks in the surveillance zone are being tested for avian
influenza. "I would like to stress that consumers can be confident that
meat and eggs are safe for human consumption," said state veterinarian Dr
John Enck. "We will continue surveillance activities in the poultry industry."
Pennsylvania remains a leader in the nation in surveillance for avian
influenza testing. Last year alone, more than 211 000 samples were tested
for avian influenza. "While any disease discovery is unfortunate, we can be
assured that our avian influenza surveillance program is working," said
Wolff. "Because of our strong program, we were able to find virus activity
early, quarantine the facility and, we hope, ensure the health of
Pennsylvania's poultry industry," said Wolff.

[Although direct strain typing has identified a strain that is not the same
as the strain present in previous years, it is still considered to be of
very low risk to humans. However, according to I Capua and DJ Alexander in
"Avian influenza and human health" there is some risk. The abstract of
Capua and Alexander's article follows:
National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza, Istituto Zooprofilattico
Sperimentale delle Venezie, Via Romea 14/A, 35020 Legnaro, Padua, Italy

Natural infections with influenza A viruses have been reported in a variety
of animal species including humans, pigs, horses, sea mammals, mustelids,
and birds. Occasionally devastating pandemics occur in humans. Although
viruses of relatively few HA and NA subtype combinations have been isolated
from mammalian species, all 15 HA subtypes and all 9 NA subtypes, in most
combinations, have been isolated from birds.In the 20th century the sudden
emergence of antigenically different strains transmissible in humans,
termed antigenic shift, has occurred on 4 occasions, 1918 (H1N1), 1957
(H2N2), 1968 (H3N2) and 1977 (H1N1), each time resulting in a pandemic.
Genetic analysis of the isolates demonstrated that "new" strains most
certainly emerged after reassortment of genes of viruses of avian and human
origin in a permissive host. The leading theory is that the pig represents
the "mixing vessel" where this genetic reassortment may occur.In 1996, an
H7N7 influenza virus of avian origin was isolated from a woman with a
self-limiting conjunctivitis. During 1997 in Hong Kong, an H5N1 avian
influenza virus was recognised as the cause of death of 6 of 18 infected
patients. Genetic analysis revealed these human isolates of H5N1 subtype to
be indistinguishable from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that
was endemic in the local poultry population.
More recently, in March 1999, two independent isolations of influenza virus
subtype H9N2 were made from girls aged 1 to 4 who recovered from flu-like
illnesses in Hong Kong. Subsequently, 5 isolations of H9N2 virus from
humans on mainland China in August 1998 were reported. H9N2 viruses were
known to be widespread in poultry in China and other Asian countries. In
all these cases there was no evidence of human to human spread except with
the H5N1 infections where there was evidence of very limited spread. This
is in keeping with the finding that all these viruses possessed all 8 genes
of avian origin. It may well be that infection of humans with avian
influenza viruses occurs much more frequently than originally assumed, but
due to their limited effect go unrecognized.
For the human population as a whole the main danger of direct infection
with avian influenza viruses appears to be if people infected with an
'avian' virus are infected simultaneously with a 'human' influenza virus.
In such circumstances reassortment could occur with the potential emergence
of a virus fully capable of spread in the human population, but with
antigenic characteristics for which the human population was
immunologically naive. Presumably this represents a very rare coincidence,
but one which could result in a true influenza pandemic. - Mod.TG]
