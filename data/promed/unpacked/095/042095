[The following information was obtained from the Manual on "Diagnosis by histo-cytopathology of _Bonamia spp._ in flat oysters _Ostrea spp._ Edition No 5, del IFREMER, European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for Molluscs Diseases.
http://www.eurl-mollusc.eu/content/download/69998/920034/file/Bonamia_5.pdf: "Bonamiosis is a lethal infection of the haemocytes of flat oysters (_Ostrea spp._) caused by the haplosporidians _Bonamia spp._ It is sometimes accompanied by yellow discoloration and extensive lesions on the gills and mantle. However most of the infected oysters appear normal.

"Lesions occur in the connective tissue of the gills, mantle, and digestive gland. These intrahaemocytic protistans quickly become systemic, often leading to the death of the oysters.

"Bonamiosis can be transmitted experimentally by cohabitation or inoculation. _B. ostreae_ and _B. exitiosa_ have been observed in the oyster _Ostrea edulis_ of Europe. Several Bonamia species have been observed in the world: _B. exitiosa_ in _Ostrea chilensis_, _O. angasi_, _O. edulis_ and _O. stentina_, _B. perspora_ in _Ostreola equestris_, _B. roughleyi_ in _Saccostrea glomerata_, and _Bonamia sp._ in _Ostrea puelchana_. Experimental assays have indicated a low infectivity of _B. ostreae_ to _Crasssotrea ariakensis_ (Audemard et al. 2005).

"_B. ostreae_ may occur throughout the year, but the highest prevalence is usually observed in late winter-early spring. It has been reported from France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, Norway, Morocco, Canada and the USA (California, Maine, Washington State). _B. exitiosa_ has been observed in flat oysters _Ostrea edulis_ from Spain (Galicia), Italy (Adriatic coast), France (Mediterranean coast) and England (South-West coast).

"Examination of stained tissue sections or tissue imprints and PCR and real-time PCR of susceptible organs are the OIE-recommended methods for screening and presumptive diagnosis. Transmission electron microscopy can be used as confirmatory diagnostic method.

"Differentiation between Bonamia species can be achieved 1) by using a PCR-RFLP technique on positive PCR products for _Bonamia spp._ detection and 2) by sequencing".

Other information is available on the EURL website: http://www.eurl-mollusc.eu

_B. ostreae_ is listed by the EU Directive 2006/88/EC as a non-exotic pathogen. http://www.eurl-mollusc.eu/Main-activities/Tutorials/Bonamia-sp.. - Mod.CRD
