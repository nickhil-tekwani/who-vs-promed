Despite widespread public awareness and vaccination, the Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) has been taking toll in the district. A total of 6 people suffering from fever in Sagar taluk were admitted to Manipal hospital on [Wed 16 Jan 2019]. Meanwhile, carcasses of 3 monkeys were found in Agumbe and surroundings creating panic among people. However, the health department has been incentivizing awareness against KFD. [RBB, SN, PM, ST, RN & RA] who were suffering from suspected KFD virus were admitted to Manipal hospital.

One carcass was found at Agumbe and 2 other at near Bilachikatte. As soon as the news spread, health and forest departments and local gram Panchayat authorities rushed to the places and burnt the carcasses after conducting postmortem evaluations. Entomologists who came from Uttara Kannada district to Aralagodu village and other places collected ticks to identify the KFD virus. Meanwhile, former minister Kagodu Thimmappa gave away Rs 1 lakh [approx. 1400 USD] compensation to each of the 6 families of a deceased, given by Health Minister Shivanand Patil.

[Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever endemic (constant presence of disease) in Karnataka State, India. It is also referred as monkey fever by local people. The virus causing the disease, KFD virus (KFDV), is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ and family _Flaviviridae_.

KFDV was first identified in 1957, when an illness occurred in monkeys (the black faced langur and the red faced bonnet monkey) in Kyasanur Forest area of Shimoga district, Karnataka State along with febrile illness and few deaths in humans in neighborhood area (Sagar taluk of Shimoga district). Initially the disease was limited to 3 taluks (Sagar, Shikaripur and Sorab) of the Shimoga district of Karnataka. In subsequent years the disease spread to Uttar Kannada, Udupi, Mangalore (Dakshina Kannada) and Chikmagalure districts of Karnataka. - Mod.UBA
