Banana wilt hits Bushenyi
-------------------------
Residents of Nyabubare sub-county in Bushenyi district [Western Region] are
worried about the rate at which the banana wilt disease is spreading.
Because of the disease, some families lack food.

Residents say they are waiting for the Government to provide pesticides to
eradicate the wilt. The LCI [village council] vice-chairperson, Daniel
Ruterahururu, said: "Our eyes are on Government. We have tried to cut down
affected banana plantations but the disease has persisted." He said the
chief administrative officer had met farmers but no solution was provided.

The district agricultural officer, Jeninah Tumushabe, said there was no
medicine for the disease, except uprooting the infected stems. "Some are
uprooting infected plants but others are refusing to and this has caused
the disease to spread," Tumushabe said.

Monday Rwanga, an agricultural officer, said they resolved to handle the
disease like an epidemic.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana
bacterial wilt (BBW) in Uganda and other East African countries. It affects
all banana types causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit. An
incidence of 70-80 per cent in many plantations and yield losses of up to
90 per cent have been reported. The pathogen survives in soil and plant
debris and is mainly spread via infected planting material, insects,
mechanical means, and contaminated tools. A range of alternate hosts may
serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Disease management and phytosanitation aimed at reducing inoculum as well
as preventing re-introduction and plant-to-plant spread of the pathogen
have been successful in reducing infections on individual farms, but have
not been able to stop the overall spread. There are no 'pesticides' to
simply 'eradicate' BBW as claimed by the farmers above, but an integrated
approach of control on a large scale is needed, and this would be extremely
difficult to implement under the local conditions.

In Uganda, the disease started in Mukono district (Central Region) in 2001
and has been spreading since at an average alarming rate of 75 km (47 mi)
per year. Spread has been somewhat slower in some other countries, but the
disease is a significant threat to food security in the region. For more
information on BBW see ProMED-mail post no. 20080612.1851 and links below.
