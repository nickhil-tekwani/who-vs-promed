News of the response

Port of entry monitoring

Security incident in Beni
- On the evening of Sat 20 Oct 2018, 12 people were killed and a dozen kidnapped in the Rwenzori commune by suspected ADF fighters. The FARDC supported by MONUSCO forces intervened to repel the rebels during clashes that lasted about 3 hours. This Sun 21 Oct 2018, residents took to the streets to express their anger at the violence, preventing any traffic in the streets of Beni. The demonstrators destroyed several administrative buildings including the office of the town hall, the post office, and the office of the Order of Doctors. However, the Beni General Reference Hospital, where the CTE is located, has not been targeted.

- The majority of the agents of the riposte had to spend their day in their respective hotels. The 1st teams that had gone out before 8 am have taken refuge at Beni's General Reference Hospital while waiting for the end of the demonstrations. They were able to return to the hotel from 13h. All immunization and awareness activities were suspended this Sun [21 Oct 2018]. Community monitoring activities have been slow and have been done by telephone with the focal points within the neighborhoods. The care teams worked at the ETC and 5 dignified and safe funerals were carried out during the afternoon.

Community involvement
- This Sat 20 Oct 2018, 25 customary chiefs of the Alliance of Traditional Leaders of the Democratic Republic of Congo were sensitized on the fight against Ebola and visited the CTE of Beni. At the end of their awareness day, traditional leaders made a commitment to get involved in the interventions of the response, in particular in the management of resistances, the raising of alerts, and the notification of deaths.

Vaccination
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 20 789 people have been vaccinated, including 9823 in Beni, 4391 in Mabalako, 1663 in Mandima, 1672 in Katwa, 1085 in Butembo, 690 in Masereka, 434 in Bunia, 355 in Tchomia, 240 in Komanda, 160 in Musienene, 121 in Oicha, 105 in Kalunguta and 50 in Mutwanga.

[The violence in the region and the demonstrations in protest create an impossible situation for control efforts to be effectively carried out. Every time responders must suspend their activities for any reason, the virus has an opportunity to spread; vaccinations must be halted, and people who are infected cannot be treated. It's amazing that safe burials were able to be conducted under these trying circumstances; the responders who assisted with these are to be praised. - Mod.LK]

[2] Violence in the region

Congo rebels kill 15, abduct kids in Ebola outbreak region
Date: Sun 21 Oct 2018

Congolese rebels killed 15 civilians and abducted a dozen children in an attack at the center of the latest deadly Ebola outbreak, Congo's military said Sun [21 Oct 2018], as the violence threatened to again force the suspension of crucial virus containment efforts.

"We condemn this attack," said the World Health Organization's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "Everyone should work on achieving peace and fight Ebola."

Allied Democratic Forces [ADF] rebels attacked Congolese army positions and several neighborhoods of Beni on Sat [20 Oct 2018] and into Sun [21 Oct 2018], Capt. Mak Hazukay Mongha told The Associated Press. The U.N. peacekeeping mission said its troops exchanged fire with rebels in the Mayangose area of Beni.

Angry over the killings, Beni residents on Sun 21 Oct 2018 carried 4 of the bodies to the town hall, where police dispersed them with tear gas. Vehicles of aid organizations and the peacekeeping mission were pelted with stones, the U.N.-backed Radio Okapi reported.

The ADF rebels have killed hundreds of civilians in recent years and are just one of several militias active in Congo's far northeast.

Late last month [September 2018], Ebola outbreak containment efforts were suspended for days in Beni after a deadly attack, complicating work to find and track suspected contacts of infected people. Since then, many of the new confirmed Ebola cases have been reported in Beni as the rate of new cases overall has more than doubled, alarming aid groups.

The latest attack comes after 2 medical agents with the Congolese army were shot dead, the 1st time health workers have been killed by rebels in this outbreak.

It is a "dark day" for everyone fighting Ebola, Congo's health minister said late Saturday [20 Oct 2018] while announcing the deaths.

Mai Mai rebels surged from the forest and opened fire on the unarmed agents with the army's rapid intervention medical unit at an entrance to Butembo city, the health ministry said.

The daytime attack appeared premeditated, with civilians present left unharmed, the statement said. The medical agents had been placed in "dangerous zones" to assist national border health officials.

Confirmed Ebola cases have now reached 200, including 117 deaths.

Health workers in this outbreak, declared on 1 Aug 2018, have described hearing gunshots daily, operating under the armed escort of U.N. peacekeepers or Congolese security forces, and ending work by sundown to lower the risk of attack.

Congo's health ministry has reported "numerous aggressions" against health workers. Early this month [October 2018], 2 Red Cross volunteers were severely injured in a confrontation with wary community members in a region traumatized by decades of fighting and facing an Ebola outbreak for the 1st time.

"Health agents are not a target for armed groups," Health Minister Oly Ilunga said on Sat 20 Oct 2018. "Our agents will continue to go into the field each day to fulfill the mission entrusted to them. They are true heroes, and we will continue to take all necessary measures so that they can do their job safely."

WHO said it was "deeply concerned" by the outbreak but announced it does not yet warrant being declared a global emergency. An outbreak must be "an extraordinary event" that might cross borders, requiring a coordinated response. Confirmed cases have been found near the heavily traveled border with Uganda.

In the latest example of the rumors that pose another serious challenge to containing the virus, the health ministry said 22 youth in Butembo dug up the body of an Ebola victim and opened the body bag, "wanting to verify that no organs had been taken from the body by health workers."

They ended up touching highly infectious bodily fluids, the ministry said. "The next day, they agreed to be vaccinated," joining the more than 20 000 people who have received vaccinations so far.

[This is a disastrous situation. To what end are children being abducted and health care workers attacked? This is all totally unacceptable. It is unclear what can be done to quell the violence against people in country who are putting their own lives at stake to help save people.
