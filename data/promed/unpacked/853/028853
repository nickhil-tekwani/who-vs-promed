China has recorded the 1st human infection with the H3N8 strain of bird flu, the country's health authority said on Tuesday [26 Apr 2022], but said the risk of it spreading among people was low.

A 4-year-old boy from central Henan province was found to have been infected with the variant after developing a fever and other symptoms on 5 Apr 2022. No close contacts were infected with the virus, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement. The child had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, it added.

The H3N8 variant has previously been detected elsewhere in the world in horses, dogs, birds and seals, but no human cases of H3N8 have been reported, said the NHC. The commission said an initial assessment determined the variant did not yet have the ability to effectively infect humans, and the risk of a large-scale epidemic was low.

Many different strains of bird flu are present in China and some sporadically infect people, usually those working with poultry. Last year [2021] China reported the 1st human case of H10N3.

China has huge populations of both farmed and wild birds of many species, creating an ideal environment for avian viruses to mix and mutate. Growing surveillance of avian influenza in people also means more infections are being picked up.

The National Health Commission announced on 26 Apr 2022 that a human case of H3N8 avian influenza was found in Henan Province.

The patient, male, 4 years old, now lives in Zhumadian City, Henan Province. Before the onset of the disease, the patient had raised chickens and black-bone chickens at home, and there were wild ducks around the home. He developed fever and other symptoms on 5 Apr 2022, and was admitted to a local medical institution for treatment on 10 Apr 2022 due to aggravation of his condition. On 24 Apr 2022, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a test on the patient specimen sent from Henan Province, and the result was positive for the H3N8 avian influenza virus. Henan Province carried out medical observation and sampling tests on the close contacts of the child, and no abnormality was found.

The National Health Commission has instructed Henan Province to carry out prevention and control in accordance with relevant plans, and organized experts to carry out risk assessments. Experts' preliminary assessment believes that the H3N8 avian influenza virus is of avian origin and does not yet have the ability to effectively infect humans. H3N8 virus has been detected in horses, dogs, birds and seals worldwide, but no human cases of H3N8 have been reported.

This outbreak is an occasional bird-to-human cross-species transmission, and the risk of a large-scale epidemic is low. Experts suggest that the public should avoid contact with sick and dead poultry in their daily lives, and try to avoid direct contact with live poultry; pay attention to dietary hygiene, and separate raw and cooked food during food processing; raise awareness of self-protection, and those with fever and respiratory symptoms should wear a mask and seek medical attention as soon as possible.

[H3N8 is a strain of avian influenza, or bird flu, which as the name suggests is a virus that spreads naturally through bird populations, especially wild aquatic birds around the world.

Domestic poultry can also get infected, as well as other bird and animal species. H3N8 has been known to infect horses, dogs, and seals, and is also known as equine flu or canine flu. The above report mentions the 1st human case infected with avian influenza H3N8 reported to date.

It garnered attention when a US study published in 2012 found it caused fatal pneumonia in more than 160 seals along the US coast.

The H3N8 influenza virus has been reported to be the possible cause of the "Russian flu" during the 1889-1890 season, as the last pandemic of the 19th century (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17488968/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2889325/).

It must be highlighted that in order to cause a pandemic, an avian virus would have to at least adapt to human HA receptors and acquire human transmissibility. Historically this may be a difficult challenge for influenza viruses as, despite human and mammalian exposures to countless avian viruses over many decades, the last 3 (1957, 1968 and 2009) pandemics have resulted from reassortment of preexisting human-adapted viruses containing imported genes that were derived from avian influenza viruses, not from de novo adaptation of avian viruses to humans.

An interesting aside reported on ProMED: "Laboratory tests have pinpointed the equine virus suspected of triggering an outbreak of a respiratory illness having killed at least 95 captive wild horses in less than a week at a federal corral in Colorado, US government officials said on Thursday [28 Apr 2022].

"Results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests from 2 leading US veterinary diagnostic labs detected the equine influenza virus in nasal and lung tissue samples taken from several horses, the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said in a statement.

"The virus strain, an equine influenza designated 'subtype H3N8,' is not uncommon in both wild and domestic horses, but is unrelated to an outbreak of a highly contagious bird flu striking wild birds and poultry across the United States in recent days, the BLM said." (<Undiagnosed deaths - USA (02): (CO) wild horses, H3N8 equine influenza susp. 20220430.8702943).

The bottom line is this is yet another avian influenza virus trying to cross the species barrier in a manner similar to H5N1, H9N2, H7N9 avian influenza subtypes that have resulted in sporadic cases and limited transmission events over the last few years. Continued surveillance on this critical animal-human front is vital to early detection of similar events for early response and control. - Mod.UBA
