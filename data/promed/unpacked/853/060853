Thiruvananthapuram: The district reported 3788 cases of viral fever
on Monday [23 Jul 2007], including 23 cases of suspected chikungunya
[virus infection].
From Parassala 212 viral fever cases were reported. Other reports
came in from Kesavappuram, Manamboor, Vizhinjam, Perumkadavila,
Vellarada, Neyyattinkara and Nedumangad. Suspected chikungunya cases
are being reported frequently from Peroorkada area.
The outpatient clinic at Peroorkada Government hospital has been very
crowded in the past few weeks [8-21 Jul 2007] with fever patients.
However, the hospital authorities had not been sending the stipulated
number of blood samples daily for analysis. The Central team members
who had visited the hospital sought an explanation for this from the
district health administration. Blood samples are now being sent from
the hospital and a few suspected and confirmed cases of chikungunya
have been reported from Peroorkada.
A section of the doctors are worried about the sustained pattern of
viral fever incidence and the fact that chicken pox cases are also
being reported now, during the rainy season.

ProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[Previous reports of febrile cases of chikungunya, as well as fevers
caused by other etiological agents, continues with this report.
Chikungunya virus transmission can be reduced by vigorous _Aedes_
mosquito control. Confirmed laboratory diagnosis is critical to know
to what extent chikungunya virus infection is responsible for these
cases, in order to mount an effective control campaign.
