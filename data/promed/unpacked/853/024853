Representatives of the Department of Public Health (DSP) issued an alert yesterday [16 Jun 2013] afternoon after a 56-year-old man of Stauceni [Botosani County, Romania] arrived at the emergency unit with symptoms of anthrax. Admitted to the Infectious Diseases Section of the County Hospital, he is under medical supervision. To avoid spread of disease, epidemiologists have prepared a room where they isolated and subjected him to treatment and further tests.

"So far, the patient has fever and an [lesion] on the arm. He is showing clinical signs of cutaneous anthrax, but we are waiting upon laboratory results," said the county's chief epidemiologist, Ecaterina Chihaia.

The man has told doctors that a few days after he treated some insect bites on his forearm with Vaseline, some nodular effusions appeared, popularly referred to as "black sore" [a.k.a. "Siberian ulcer" - Mod.MHJ].

The alert was communicated to the Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority, but they are awaiting the results of laboratory tests before initiating [farm] quarantine.

[Cutaneous cases in humans are seen as a result of biting fly activity with contaminated mouthparts; such an event is presently uncommon but not unexpected. That the veterinary authorities are involved suggests that they know of an affected animal or animals. That the veterinary authorities are holding back until there is a laboratory confirmation suggests that they are lacking information on any unexpected livestock deaths in the area. In my experience a telephone call to the owner of the pub in the village where this 56-year-old man lives would quickly reveal which farm or farms needed visiting.

Bovine outbreaks of anthrax were reported in Botosani in 2005 and 2009; the latter involved 2 human cases.

A suspected case of anthrax has been recorded in Dubasari in Transnistria, in a private household.

According to Tiraspol press, the results of laboratory tests are currently expected to determine if it really is about the disease "mad cow". [Why is "mad cow" not explained? - Mod.MHJ]

The Regional Veterinarians normally take preventive measures to avoid the possible spread of the disease. Local media did not specify what it is, and the Dubasari President, Gregory Policinschi, did not know any details.

The last case of anthrax disease of animals in Moldova was registered in March last year [2012, in Riscani], and in 2011, 2 [porcine] cases were reported. Anthrax is a potentially fatal disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. It occurs in cattle, horses, sheep, and goats.

[As at least one of the 2 cases in Dubasari has died I think we can presume that this report refers to livestock cases, and as they quote "mad cow" probably bovine.
