CDC Update as of 17 Feb 2005: recent avian influenza outbreaks in Asia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) occurred
among poultry in 8 countries in Asia (Cambodia, China, Indonesia,
Japan, Lao, South Korea, Thailand and Viet Nam) during late 2003 and
early 2004. At that time, more than 100 million birds either died
from the disease or were culled. From 30 Dec 2003 to 17 Mar 2004, 12
confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) were reported in
Thailand, and 23 in Viet Nam, resulting in a total of 23 deaths. By
late February [2004], however, the number of new human H5 cases being
reported in Thailand and Viet Nam slowed and then stopped. Within a
month, countries in Asia were reporting that the avian influenza
outbreak among poultry had been contained. No conclusive evidence of
sustained human-to-human transmission was found.
Recent developments
-------------------
Beginning in late June 2004, new lethal outbreaks of H5N1 among
poultry were reported by several countries in Asia: Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Malaysia (1st-time reports), Thailand and Viet Nam. There
has not been a resurgence of avian influenza in South Korea and
Japan, and the outbreaks are reported to be controlled in those
countries. It is unknown to what extent H5N1 outbreaks in the other
countries may be ongoing. For more information about outbreaks in
poultry, visit the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] website:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/en_index.htm>.
The new outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia were followed by renewed
sporadic reporting of human cases of H5N1 infection in Viet Nam and
Thailand beginning in August 2004 and continuing into 2005. Of
particular note is one isolated instance of probable limited
human-to-human transmission occurring in Thailand in September 2004.
On 2 Feb 2005, the 1st human case of avian influenza A H5 infection
from Cambodia was reported.
As of 17 Feb 2005, there have been 55 human cases of avian influenza
A (H5N1) in Viet Nam (37), Thailand (17) and Cambodia (1) resulting
in 42 deaths. For more information about H5N1 infections in humans,
visit the World Health Organization (WHO) website:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/>.
Assessment of current situation
-------------------------------
The avian influenza A (H5N1) epizootic outbreak in Asia is not
expected to diminish significantly in the short term. It is likely
that H5N1 infection among birds has become endemic to the region and
that human infections will continue to occur. So far, no sustained
human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus has been identified,
and no evidence for genetic reassortment between human and avian
influenza virus genes has been found; however, the epizootic outbreak
in Asia poses an important public health threat.
If these H5N1 viruses gain the ability for efficient and sustained
transmission between humans, there is little preexisting natural
immunity to H5N1 in the human population, and an influenza pandemic
could result, with high rates of illness and death. In addition,
genetic sequencing of influenza A (H5N1) virus samples from human
cases in Viet Nam and Thailand show resistance to the antiviral
medications amantadine and rimantadine, 2 of the medications commonly
used for treatment of influenza. This would leave 2 remaining
antiviral medications (oseltamavir and zanamavir) that should still
be effective against currently circulating strains of H5N1. Efforts
to produce a vaccine that would be effective against this strain of
influenza A H5N1 are under way. Vaccine reference virus strains
already have been made and been provided to manufacturers to produce
pilot lots for human clinical trials as well as to produce a larger
quantity of H5N1 vaccine, but mass production and availability of
such a vaccine is some time off.
Recent research findings give further cause for concern. New research
suggests that H5 viruses are becoming more capable of causing disease
(pathogenic) for mammals than earlier H5 viruses and are becoming
more widespread in birds in the region. One study found that ducks
infected with H5N1 are now shedding more virus for longer periods of
time without showing any symptoms of illness. This has implications
for the role of ducks in transmitting disease to other birds and,
possibly, to humans as well. Additionally, other findings have
documented H5 infection among pigs in China and H5 infection in
felines (experimental infection in house cats in the Netherlands and
isolation of H5N1 viruses from infected tigers and leopards in
Thailand), suggesting that cats could host or transmit the infection.
These finding are particularly worrisome in light of the fact that
reassortment of avian influenza genomes is most likely to occur when
these viruses demonstrate a capacity to infect multiple species, as
is now the case in Asia.
Bird import ban
---------------
On 4 Feb 2004, the CDC and the USDA issued an order for a ban on the
import of all birds (Class: Aves) from affected areas in Southeast
Asia. On 10 Mar 2004, the CDC, in coordination with USDA, lifted the
embargo of birds and bird products from Hong Kong. On 28 Sep 2004,
the list of countries affected by the embargo of birds and bird
products was expanded to include Malaysia.
Information on influenza A (H5N1)
---------------------------------
Influenza A (H5N1) is a subtype of type A influenza virus. Wild birds
are the natural hosts of the virus, hence the name avian influenza or
bird flu. The virus was 1st isolated from birds (terns) in South
Africa in 1961. The virus circulates among birds worldwide. It is
very contagious among birds and can be deadly to them, particularly
domesticated birds like chickens.
The virus does not typically infect humans. In 1997, however, the 1st
instance of direct bird-to-human transmission of influenza A (H5N1)
virus was documented during an outbreak of avian influenza among
poultry in Hong Kong; the virus caused severe respiratory illness in
18 people, of whom 6 died. Since that time, there have been other
instances of H5N1 infection among humans. However, H5N1 viruses thus
far have not been capable of efficient human-to-human transmission;
health officials continue to monitor the situation closely for
evidence of H5N1 transmission between people.
Infected birds shed virus in saliva, nasal secretions, and feces.
Avian influenza viruses spread among susceptible birds when they have
contact with contaminated excretions. It is believed that most cases
of H5N1 infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected
poultry or contaminated surfaces.

Avian influenza has "pandemic potential"
----------------------------------------
One of the world's top researchers [Dr. Nancy Cox from CDC Atlanta]
investigating outbreaks of avian influenza in South-East Asia says
she is extremely concerned by the scientific evidence emerging about
the virus. Dr. Nancy Cox is the Head of the Influenza Division of the
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
She says research now shows that bird flu is capable of mutating into
a form that can spread from humans to humans. "We have found that,
for the 2003 virus, the virus had actually changed its receptive
[receptor] binding [site] or its ability to bind to the receptors
that are in human cells," she said. "This shows that the virus can
actually change in such a way, or has actually changed in the past in
such a way, that might make it more easily transmitted from person to
person."
She also says the recent spurt of human infections increases the
likelihood that a mutant strain would arise that could spread between
humans. "It's impossible to predict what the consequences would be.
We might have a relatively mild pandemic like we did in 1968," Dr.
Cox said. "Alternatively, we could have a relatively severe pandemic
as occurred in 1918 or perhaps even worse."

[The text of the 2nd report is ambiguous. But, if it is correct that
the receptor binding site of the hemagglutinin of some avian
influenza A (H5N1) viruses has undergone change, then this is a very
significant development, because it is this region of the
hemagglutinin molecule that can determine tissue-specific binding
properties and ultimately the host range of the virus. - Mod.CP]
