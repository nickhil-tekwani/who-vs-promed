City veterinarians warn of killer virus from goats
--------------------------------------------------
Officials in Santos City expressed apprehension over the spread of a
virus in locally bred goats that could possibly infect local
residents. The City Veterinary Office has directed port authorities
to quarantine all imported goats for blood testing following
information that the virus came from imported goats from the United States.

In a regular city council meeting Thursday [26 Mar 2009], Councilor
Minardo Avila said animals that were exposed to goats that died due
to encephalitis should undergo blood testing and those that are found
infected must immediately be burned, he said.

Experts said caprine encephalitis is a viral infection among goats,
which can cause encephalitis in their kids and chronic joint disease
among adult goats.

City Veterinarian Dr. Antonio Marin said an extensive information
campaign has been conducted in villages adjacent to goat farms that
were found infected. "We found that one huge goat farm in the
locality was already infected and this should alarm our local goat
raisers," Marin told reporters.

The most direct infection route is from mother goat to its kid through
infected colostrum, body fluids, and milk.

Marin also sternly advised the public not to eat any animal suspected
of having the disease, as he directed veterinarian personnel posted
at the Makar Port to check all incoming imported goats. Martin
clarified that only big goat farms have been reported with infected
goats and not small backyard breeders.

[Caprine arthritis and encephalitis results from infection by caprine
arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), a member of the genus Lentivirus
in the family Retroviridae (subfamily Orthoretrovirinae). Several
genetically distinct isolates circulate in goats. Caprine arthritis
encephalitis virus infects goats and, to a lesser extent, sheep. The
frequency of cross-species transmission is unknown.

CAEV is mainly transmitted from infected dams to their kids; by the
ingestion of virus-containing colostrum or milk, transmission usually
occurs early in life. Horizontal transmission can also occur by
direct contact, exposure to fomites when feeding, or exposure to
contaminated milk in milking parlors. Iatrogenic transmission can
occur on contaminated needles and other blood-contaminated fomites.
The existence of in utero transmission is controversial; most sources
suggest it is of minor importance. CAEV has been found in semen, but
this route has not been investigated further. Humans can spread CAEV
between herds on fomites [such as boots. - Mod.JW].

CAEV infects goats for life, but viral burdens vary between animals.
Both asymptomatic and symptomatic animals can transmit CAEV. The
incubation period is highly variable. Most goats become infected when
they are very young, and develop disease months or years later.
Encephalitis usually occurs in kids 2-6 months of age, but it has
been reported in a one-month-old kid, and in older goats.
Polyarthritis is generally seen only in adults.

The differential diagnosis for arthritis caused by CAEV includes
traumatic arthritis and infectious arthritis caused by _Mycoplasma_
species. In young kids with progressive paresis, enzootic ataxia,
cerebrospinal nematodiasis, spinal cord trauma or abscess, and
congenital anomalies of the spinal cord and vertebral column should
be considered. In goats with symptoms of brain involvement, the
differential diagnosis also includes polioencephalomalacia,
listeriosis and rabies. The pulmonary form in adult goats can
resemble the pulmonary form of caseous lymphadenitis.

There is no specific treatment for caprine arthritis and encephalitis,
but supportive therapy can make affected goats more comfortable.
Measures may include regular foot trimming, the provision of
additional bedding material, and the administration of NSAIDs
[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] to goats with arthritis.
High-quality, readily digestible feed should be provided.
