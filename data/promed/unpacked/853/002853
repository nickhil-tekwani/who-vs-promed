Whirling disease, an incurable disease that can wipe out trout populations,
has been detected by researchers in Yellowstone National Park. It was found
in native cutthroat trout taken from Yellowstone Lake, in the heart of the
nation's oldest park. With such a foothold, the disease could spread down
the Yellowstone River, experts said Tuesday. "With Yellowstone Lake being
such an important headwaters, this isn't very good news," said Bill
Granath, a University of Montana professor who studies whirling disease.
"It certainly could become a major source of infection."
The disease attacks the cartilage of certain fish, including cutthroat and
rainbow trout. While it may not kill the fish, the resulting whirling
behavior makes the fish unable to feed normally and more prone to
predators. The disease is most commonly found in rivers and streams.
Officials said 11 of 41 cutthroat trout tested in Yellowstone during the
fall tested positive for the disease.
Park biologists had previously found no evidence of whirling disease in
rivers or streams that link Yellowstone Lake to known locations of the
disease in waters outside the park in Wyoming's northwestern corner. Native
fish in the lake already are threatened by a growing population of
voracious lake trout, which apparently are not affected by whirling disease.
To prevent the spread of the disease, Yellowstone Superintendent Michael
Finley encouraged people to wash mud off fishing equipment before moving to
another fishing spot. Water, fish and aquatic plants also should not be
moved from one drainage to another.
