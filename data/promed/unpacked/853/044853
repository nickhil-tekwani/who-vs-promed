The Mamuja community, 22 km away from Magdalena, in Beni Province,
was quarantined because of an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever, Dr. Juan
Alberto Nogales, local Health Vice-minister, reported today [10 Mar 2007].
There is ongoing high risk for epidemic outbreaks because of natural
disasters caused by the "El Nino" phenomenon, and this presents a
potential risk for other regions affected by heavy rainfall and
floods. For this reason, health authorities intensified actions in
order to control dengue fever, yellow fever, malaria, hantaviruses,
hemorrhagic fever, and other diseases.
Dr. Nogales indicated that 2 weeks ago, 3 people, a veterinary
student and 2 other persons, found a mouse nest, and for unknown
reasons they killed them with a knife without taking any
precautions. Soon afterwards, these 3 people used the same knife
(without properly cleaning it) to cut lemons from a tree, and they
drank the juice from those lemons. The health officer stated that 2
of these people died because of this febrile illness, and the
surviving 3rd one lived to tell the story to his peers.
As a consequence, the community has been quarantined, the entry of
persons is tightly controlled, the area has been surrounded with 3000
mouse traps, and a rodenticide poison is being used to kill mice,
which are known to be transmitting agents for this fatal
disease. This is the 3rd quarantine period declared in Bolivia as a
consequence of the occurrence of this condition, which is lethal in
most of the cases.
San Joaquin community, next to Magdalena, had a quarantine declared
in 1958, while in 1971, Viedma Hospital in Cochabamba was closed
because of the occurrence of this disease.

[Machupo virus, the etiological agent for Bolivian hemorrhagic fever,
belongs to the Tacaribe complex of the Arenavirus group. Machupo
virus reservoirs are _Calomys callosus_ mice, which are found in the
plains in Beni and Santa Cruz departments. _Calomys_ mice acquire the
virus when they are newly born, and during the lactation period they
start shedding it through their urine and saliva; they have permanent
asymptomatic viremia. When _Calomys_ mice acquire the virus in the
adult stage, they may develop immunity; and, after a short period
when they shed the virus, viral shedding stops. The incubation period
for Bolivian hemorrhagic fever in humans is 14 days on average, and
the case mortality rates reported are between 5 to 30 per cent.
Apparently, these are 3 new hemorrhagic fever cases in addition to
the 2 fatal cases in ranch workers reported in archive no.
20070308.0829. The health vice-minister's comments attribute the
current cases to Bolivian hemorrhagic fever caused by Machupo virus
rather than to dengue hemorrhagic fever. It would be interesting to
know if the etiological agent involved has been laboratory confirmed.
Exposure of these 3 individuals could just as well have been due to
handling the mice that they killed as it was from preparing the
lemonade that they drank. The news source El Nuevo Dia
<http://www.el-nuevodia.com/versiones/20070306_007026/nota_249_398700.htm>
reports on the severity of this year's [2007] floods in the Beni and
mentions the occurrence of diseases, including dengue and hemorrhagic fever.
