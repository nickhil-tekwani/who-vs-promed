Usually, when we write about an outbreak associated with milk, the subject is raw milk. But in the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases issue for [March 2019], a _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak associated with pasteurized chocolate milk in Ontario, Canada is the subject (1). That outbreak took place from [November 2015] through [June 2016].

The article states that listeriosis outbreak[s] associated with pasteurized milk are rare in North America, but, like all foods, dairy products can be contaminated with pathogens after pasteurization.

A study conducted in the U.S. reviewed 83 fluid milk-associated outbreaks from 1990 to 2006; only one was attributed to _Listeria monocytogenes_ (2).

[In the referenced journal article (1)], 34 people were sickened during this outbreak, but only people who lived in Ontario were studied. Illness onset dates ranged from [14 Nov 2015] through [14 Feb 2019] [sic, 14 Feb 2016]. A 2nd wave of illnesses occurred during the time frame of [11 Apr to 20 Jun 2016].

Public health officials considered several other foods during the initial investigation. The 1st [thought] was leafy greens were the problem, since a _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak associated with that food was ongoing in the U.S. and Canada at that time. Cheddar cheese was suspected, but the investigation ruled out that food. Finally, investigators suspected coleslaw, but that was ruled out too.

Finally, investigators isolated _Listeria monocytogenes_ from expired bagged chocolate milk collected from the home of one patient. The outer packaging was discarded, so officials weren't sure of the brand name. The investigation revealed that exposure to pasteurized milk was reported by 60% of case patients in the 1st wave, and 75% in the 2nd wave.

On [3 Jun 2016], a retail sample of brand B chocolate milk produced at facility C was confirmed positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_. The brand was recalled. Isolates from the original sample and 3 positive samples of chocolate milk matched the outbreak strain by PFGE and whole genome sequencing. Investigators found the outbreak strain within a post pasteurization pump dedicated to chocolate milk.

The conclusions of this study [were] that more attention should be given to the design of equipment and maintenance programs. _Listeria monocytogenes_ can be persistent in an environment, and "harborage sites" that contain the pathogen can be undetected by routine monitoring. Officials stressed the importance of obtaining thoroughly food histories and collecting food that patients ate or drank during the incubation period. Finally, officials also stated that any food product sold in bags, especially food with an inner and outer bag, should be labeled on both bags to facilitate traceback.

[_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that are difficult to access. In past listeriosis outbreaks, _Listeria_ contamination of food products occurred in parts of the machinery "well beyond the [manufacturer's] recommended sanitation process" and was "found only after the devices were completely disassembled" (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/maple-leaf-eyes-meat-slicers-in-outbreak/article1060898/).

The machinery involved in the listeriosis outbreak described in the news report above was attributed to a post-pasteurization pump dedicated to chocolate milk. This outbreak illustrates that listeriosis can be caused by ready-to-eat food despite being previously cooked or pasteurized. Even if machinery used in food processing only adds a few organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated ready-to-eat food, like chocolate milk, because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures.

This study also shows the power of genotyping clinical and environmental isolates to confirm the source of an outbreak. - Mod.ML
