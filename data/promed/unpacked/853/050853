The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and the Washtenaw County Health Department are investigating the 1st confirmed human case of Sin Nombre hantavirus detected in Michigan. An adult female in Washtenaw County was recently hospitalized with a serious pulmonary illness from Sin Nombre hantavirus. The individual was likely exposed when cleaning an unoccupied dwelling that contained signs of an active rodent infestation.

Hantavirus was 1st discovered to be responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in ill patients in the southwest United States in 1993. HPS has since infected people throughout the US and the Americas. Hantavirus infections are associated with domestic, occupational, or recreational activities that bring humans into contact with infected rodents. Most cases have been identified in adults and tend to occur in the spring and summer.

"HPS is caused by some strains of hantavirus and is a rare but severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease that can occur 1-5 weeks after a person has exposure to fresh urine, droppings, or saliva from infected rodents," said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health at MDHHS. "Anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry hantavirus is at risk for HPS, and healthcare providers with a suspect case of hantavirus should contact their local health department to report the case and discuss options for confirmatory testing."

Humans become infected when freshly dried materials contaminated by rodent excreta are disturbed and inhaled, get into breaks in the skin or on mucous membranes, or when ingesting contaminated food or water. Bites from rodents can also transmit hantavirus. The highest risk of exposure takes place when entering or cleaning rodent-infested structures. There are not any documented person-to-person cases of hantavirus transmission in the US.

Symptoms of HPS can be non-specific at first and include fever, chills, body aches, headache, and gastrointestinal signs such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The illness can progress to include coughing and shortness of breath. HPS has a 40% fatality rate.

"We can prevent and reduce the risk of hantavirus infection by taking precautions and being alert to the possibility of it," says Dr. Juan Luis Marquez, medical director with Washtenaw County Health Department. "Use rubber, latex, vinyl, or nitrile gloves when cleaning areas with rodent infestations, ventilate areas for at least 30 minutes before working, and make sure to wet areas thoroughly with a disinfectant or chlorine solution [10%] before cleaning."

Hantaviruses are a family of viruses spread mainly by wild rodents and occur worldwide. Several hantaviruses that can infect people have been identified in the US, and each hantavirus has a primary rodent host. The most important hantavirus in the US that causes HPS is the Sin Nombre virus, which is spread by the deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] and white footed mouse [_P. leucopus_].

The greatest risk for hantavirus infection is associated with opening or cleaning closed-up buildings with rodent infestations without proper protection. Healthcare providers with a suspect case of hantavirus should contact their local health department to report the case and discuss options for confirmatory testing.

Hantaviruses are viruses and are susceptible to most disinfectants (diluted chlorine solutions, detergents, and general-purpose household disinfectants including those based on phenols, quaternary ammonium compounds, and hypochlorite). Depending on environmental conditions, these viruses probably survive less than one week in indoor environments and much shorter periods (hours) when exposed to sunlight outdoors. Special precautions should be taken when cleaning up after rodents. In cases of heavy rodent infestation, it is recommended to consult with a pest-control professional.

A rare case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] was reported Tuesday [8 Jun 2021] in Douglas County. Carson City Health and Human Services reported the case, the 1st of its kind in Douglas County and only the 14th case reported in Nevada outside of Clark County since 2005.

HPS is a severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease in humans caused by an infection with hantaviruses.

Hantaviruses are spread by certain species of rats and mice that shed the virus in their urine, droppings, and saliva.

Early symptoms of hantavirus infection include fatigue, fever, and muscle aches. These symptoms may be accompanied by headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath.

The virus can be transmitted to people when contaminated nesting materials or dust are stirred up and breathed in by humans. The virus is not spread from person to person.

The virus is frequently associated with spring cleaning. The exposed individual is a Douglas County resident who was exposed while cleaning. Carson City Health and Human Services did not release any further information about the patient.

According to CCHS, precautions to reduce exposure to Hantavirus include the following:

- Seal openings that may allow rats and mice to enter homes and workplaces.
- Remove brush, woodpiles, trash, and other items that may attract rats and mice.
- Tightly close garbage cans, pet food containers, and other food sources.
- Before cleaning up nests or droppings found inside, open windows and doors to ventilate the area for at least 30 minutes.
- If any dust will be stirred up, goggles and a HEPA or N-95 mask are recommended.
- Wear protective gloves to handle dead mice and rats or to clean up nesting areas, urine, or droppings.
- Do not stir up dust by sweeping or vacuuming. Dampen areas before cleanup with either a 1-to-10 bleach-water mixture or another effective disinfectant to eliminate dust and begin inactivating the virus. After 30 minutes, apply the viricide again and immediately begin the cleaning process.
- Use the same viricide and apply to dead rodents, nests, urine, and droppings before cleaning, with the same 30-minute interval and reapplication process.

[The hantavirus involved in the Michigan case above was reported as Sin Nombre virus. The case in Nevada could be due to Sin Nombre virus as well, but Seoul virus cannot be ruled out without relevant laboratory tests. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), which is present worldwide including in Nevada. Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in many states, and a few cases have occurred in the USA annually. Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides, with more detail than in the above report, in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Hantavirus cardiopulmonary disease (HPS) is a serious disease that can become life threatening very quickly. Individuals who develop febrile disease with pulmonary symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, and white footed mouse, _P. leucopus_, are the reservoir hosts of Sin Nombre virus. An image of _P. maniculatus_ can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg, and an image of _P. leucopus_ can be seen at https://kxci.org/podcast/peromyscus-leucopus/.
