A 22-year-old young man suspected of being infected with [a] hantavirus died while being transported to a health assistance center in Temuco [Araucania region].

The deceased man was an agricultural worker who resided in the city of Victoria [Araucania region]. He initially had a medical consultation in the hospital of that city, where a hantavirus rapid test was positive.

The young man was taken to a more complex medical assistance center, specifically in the Temuco Clinica Mayor. Communications with that facility confirmed that there was an order to move him and that all was ready to receive him, but indicated that the patient died before being admitted to the clinic.

This morning [24 Feb 2016] the Ministry of Health sent the samples to the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia, to confirm or discard [a] hantavirus infection.

If confirmed, this would be the 1st death in 2016 in the Araucania [region]. In January of this year [2016] a person died in the Temuco Regional Hospital but was infected in Los Rios, and so was counted in that region.

[Much of central and southern Chile, including the Araucania region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The above report provides little information about the circumstances under which the woman acquired her hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
