A new virus aimed at wiping out the wild rabbit population will be trialled across Victoria next year [2017].

A naturally occurring Korean variant of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus -- known as RHDV1 K5 -- will be released at 418 sites across Australia where rabbit populations have demonstrated resistance to the existing strains.

The strain is expected to affect up to 40 per cent of wild rabbits in colder and wetter climates.

Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce said Australia had a good track record when it came to the biological control. "When we first released rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus in 1995, populations had multiplied to around 600 million, and we managed to reduce this by 98 per cent in arid areas," Mr Joyce said.

"This built on the massive reductions achieved in the 1950s from the release of the myxoma virus, which killed more than 85 per cent of Australia's rabbit population."

He said again aiming at rabbits would help the environment regenerate and give farmers a fighting chance to keep rabbits at bay.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

For these characteristics of RHDV, it was deliberately released in Australia and New Zealand. There, RHD has reduced rabbit abundance, particularly in dry regions, but rabbits in cooler, high-rainfall areas have been able to maintain their populations. In Australia and New Zealand, RHD has raised the prospects for managing rabbits in low rainfall areas and brought substantial economic and environmental benefits. It is expected that after many generations the defence strategies of rabbits evolve to resist and/or tolerate RHDV, so introduction of a novel strain might enable boosting the efficiency of RHD as a biological control. - Mod.PMB
