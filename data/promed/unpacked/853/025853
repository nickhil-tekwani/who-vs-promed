Austrian authorities are investigating an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)] infections that has affected a handful of people. Between September and December 2020, 6 people fell ill with infections from _E. coli_ O146:H28. Those sick live in 5 federal states. Two people needed hospital treatment. As yet, there is no indication as to the source of the outbreak, according to the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES). It is understood other countries in Europe have not reported related infections.

The Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) has instructed AGES to investigate the outbreak with the relevant state authorities. Austrian food testing in 2018 found _E. coli_ O146 in 3 samples of fresh game meat and one sample of fermented sausage. In 2017, 4 isolates were typed as _E. coli_ O146 from 2 samples of raw meat from wild ruminants, fresh bovine meat and a fermented sausage.

The latest Zoonoses Report from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows _E. coli_ O146 was the 5th most frequent serogroup reported in confirmed human infections in 2018.

Anyone who has developed symptoms of EHEC infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of _E. coli_ infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Most patients recover within 5 to 7 days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

About 5% to 10% of those diagnosed with EHEC infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor.

Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than 5 years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients. People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

[This Shiga toxin-producing O146 is one of the non-O157 serotypes causing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ disease. The source of this zoonotic infection in Austria is not clear at this point. Potential vehicles for transmission include salads, unpasteurized dairy products and undercooked ground beef. - Mod.LL
