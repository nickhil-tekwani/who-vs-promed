Outbreak of respiratory illness, Sierra Leone (Update)
A WHO-sponsored team from the Ministry of Health and the District Medical
Officer [have] identified 125 active cases during [a] visit to several
affected towns and villages in the Chiefdoms of Sulima, Sinkunia Dembelia
and Folosaba Dembelia in Koinadugu District during the period 21-25
November. According to community leaders and village elders large parts of
the population had been affected during the outbreak and around 2000-3,000
cases were estimated to have occurred, most of which were adults.
Thirty-six deaths were reported to have occurred. One village had
reportedly been abandoned after the disease had struck all 20 inhabitants of
which 5 had died. The outbreak started in late September and spread during
October through November and continued in early December. A follow-up
mission is planned for collection of blood samples for laboratory
investigation. Koinadugu district, located in the northern part of the
country has poor access to medical services, insufficient health staff and
drugs and no disease surveillance activities. WHO's emergency programme
will expand the epidemiological surveillance network to cover the affected
area.
