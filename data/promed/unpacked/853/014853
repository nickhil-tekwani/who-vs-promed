As of Mon 11 Dec 2017, there have been a total of:
1750 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
708 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.5 per cent],
1028 recoveries, and
14 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases. - Mod.MPP]

[The endemic pattern of sporadic cases continues in Saudi Arabia; with 3 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 12 days, from 3 different regions (Riyadh, Al Jawf and Al Qasim). The reporting pattern in the absence of nosocomial transmission has ranged from 11 cases reported each month in September and October 2017 to 15 cases reported during the months of November 2017 in contrast with the month of August 2017 when there was nosocomial transmission ongoing there were 33 cases reported during that month.

Looking at the classification of the cases during this period (September 2017 through today, 11 Dec 2017), 2 cases were classified as secondary cases in household contacts, 18 were classified as primary cases having contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset and, 20 cases were classified as primary cases with high risk exposure histories still under investigation.
