Wet and warm growing conditions could mean trouble for the potatoes
across Northern Europe. Potato blight is reported as being
widespread, and the situation without some dry weather could be
disastrous for this season's [2007] potato crop.
Potatoes in the UK, Holland, Germany, Belgium and France are said to
be the worst affected, with some main crop potato fields already
desiccated. Some Eastern European crops have also been hit according
to industry experts, although lack of information from this area
means that it is difficult to establish to what extent blight has
taken hold.
There are also industry reports that blight spray is running scarce,
with only limited quantities available, meaning that spraying regimes
cannot be followed by all growers. This shortage of blight spray is
said to be Europe-wide.
In parts of the UK, floods over the past 3 weeks have also immersed
some fields for over 48 hours, rendering the potato crop useless.
This has affected several hundred acres, and the full extent of UK
flood damage is yet to be known.
The weather across Northern Europe will surely have an affect on
medium to long term potato availability and prices; short term
storage problems could well be the biggest issue, as they were with
last year's [2006] potato crop in Europe. Last season's storage
problems were due to late rains throughout August and September.
The rain over the past 5 weeks in Europe has been continuous and,
combined with warm temperatures, has started a potential blight
catastrophe, which may not have been seen for decades.

Potato blight is spreading, following the recent wet weather, the
National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned. Farmers have been unable to
spray their crops to protect them from the fungal disease, which
causes plants to rot.
NFU horticulture board chairman Richard Hirst said that if there is a
crop in the country that does have the potato blight "it is a
miracle. The problem is that conditions are so wet that crops are
full of these diseases," he said. Mr. Hirst said the land on his farm
in Norfolk was the wettest it had been for 25 years. He said fewer
customers were going to pick-your-own farms, and salad growers were
experiencing less demand.
The NFU said cabbages, cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetables
were also suffering in the conditions. The Processed Vegetable
Growers Association has previously said frozen pea prices may rise,
because a quarter of the crop could have been destroyed.
The Food and Drink Federation's (FDF) Frozen Vegetable Committee
warned of a "disastrous" pea harvest, with a crop output of 70
percent, a figure that is falling every day with the rains
continuing. Sarah Pettitt, chairman of the committee, said: "Other
crops such as broad beans, green beans and brassicas are also being
seriously affected, particularly broad beans and the potential green
bean crop, where in certain parts of the country we have only 25
percent drilled."
The British Retail Consortium has also said sales of salad produce,
some soft fruit, and barbecue food, such as burgers and sausages, had
all been hit.

There is an increasing amount of blight occurring in potato crops
across the UK following the recent wet and warm conditions. "As a
result of all the Smith Period pressure [see Mod. comment below] we
have had for the last few weeks, we are now certainly seeing the
highest level of blight incidence reporting since we started the
Fight Against Blight campaign 5 years ago," said British Potato
Council (BPC) knowledge transfer manager, Rob Clayton.
"There is no doubt that blight is at higher levels than we would
normally see at this time of year, and this is the earliest and
fastest we have seen blight spread for a long time, which paints a
worrying picture."
On Wednesday [27 Jun 2007], the BPC were already aware of over 80
blight incidences around the country, with hotspots reported in East
Anglia and the Midlands in addition to Cornwall and the South West.
"More recently, the disease has been creeping up into the North West
and Cheshire; however, it appears to be not as bad north of the
Humber at the moment."
The increased blight incidence was, he said, due to a combination of
the recent wet and mild conditions together with growers' inability
to travel on wet fields.

[Potato late blight is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_,
which can also infect other solanaceous crops such as tomato or
eggplant. It affects leaves as well as tubers and is spread by plant
material (including seed tubers), wind and water. Other fungi and
bacteria often invade blight-infected tubers resulting in total tuber
breakdown. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different
isolates of _P. infestans_ has been observed. There are 2 mating
types, A1 and A2. Where both are present, reproduction occurs
sexually as well as asexually, leading to greater variation and
fitter strains with higher fungicide resistance and increased yield
losses. A1 occurs worldwide; A2 is recorded in Mexico, northern
Europe, Japan, Korea, Indonesia and northern America.
_P. infestans_ was responsible for the Irish potato famine in the
late 1840s, which resulted in large-scale population loss from that
country due to deaths and emigration. For more information on potato
late blight, see also the recent post with archive no. 20070509.1491.
Species in the genus _Phytophora_ often have a narrow host range, and
many cause serious diseases in a range of crops. Different species of
_Phytophthora_ (possibly _P. phaseoli_ or _P. brassicae_) or species
in other fungal genera may be responsible for the diseases reported
in item [2] affecting the legumes (peas, beans) and brassicas
(cabbage varieties).
Smith Periods are whether patterns used to predict the risk of potato
late blight. They were developed empirically by identifying the
relationship between specific weather criteria and disease
development. A full Smith Period has occurred when at least 2
consecutive days have had a minimum temperature of 10 C or above and
when on each day for at least 11 hours, the relative humidity was
more than 90 percent. These conditions are conducive for sporulation
and ideal for the pathogen. If they occur in 7-10 day intervals,
there is a greater chance of blight development, because this is the
generation time from original infection to lesion development and,
finally, sporulation.
