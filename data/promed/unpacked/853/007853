Tennessee's state veterinarian confirms 4 horses in Tennessee have tested positive for Potomac horse fever [PHF], the Department of Agriculture announced Monday [26 Jul 2021].

Cases in Hawkins, Robertson, and Sullivan counties are in addition to the Wilson County case announced earlier this month [July 2021] where a horse was diagnosed with PHF and had to be euthanized.

"Transmission of this disease can be prevented," State Veterinarian Dr Samantha Beaty said in a news release. "Potomac horse fever is preventable with regular vaccinations and environmental management. In addition to having your horses on a routine medical schedule, make sure they have clean drinking water. One way to do this is to change from natural drinking water sources to frequently-cleaned water buckets."

PHF is caused by _Neorickettsia risticii_, bacteria thought to be carried by aquatic snail larvae and other intermediate hosts including flies. Horses living near bodies of water or low-lying areas which could collect stagnant water are at risk. In addition to clean drinking water, horse owners can reduce the risk of exposure by turning off insect-attracting stable lights at night.

PHF is not a threat to human health and it is not contagious between horses. Horse owners should watch for signs including anorexia, diarrhea, colic, fever, and laminitis. Signs of the disease can appear in 2 to 18 days after ingestion and can be fatal if left untreated.

Vaccination for PHF should be administered before mid-to-late summer when the risk of illness is increased. The vaccine provides protection and minimizes the severity of disease if a horse is infected but does not always prevent a horse from getting PHF. Horse owners should work with their veterinarian to determine an appropriate vaccination schedule.

The State Veterinarian's office seeks to prevent the spread of disease through import and movement requirements, livestock traceability, disaster mitigation, and the services of the CE Kord Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory.

[The most common name for the disease is Potomac horse fever but other names include equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, equine ehrlichial colitis, and acute equine diarrhea syndrome.

"Potomac horse fever (PHF) is a non-contagious, infectious equine disease caused by the rickettsial organism _Neorickettsia risticii_ (previously known as _Ehrlichia risticii_). The disease can affect any age, breed, or sex of horse. PHF cases usually occur in summer and fall, but may occur in any season depending on weather conditions.

"Clinical signs
They are highly variable and include:
- High fever up to 107 deg F (41.6 deg C) reported. Fevers may occur 7-14 days before signs of colitis develop
- Diarrhea: variable, ranging from absent to severe
- Depression
- Anorexia
- Lethargy
- Laminitis (with or without diarrhea) may progress from mild to severe
- Mild to moderate colic
- Decreased gastrointestinal sounds
- Edema of limbs and ventral body, and the prepuce of males
- Abortion (by transplacental transmission)
Note: concurrent infections with _Salmonella_ have been documented.

"Incubation period
Approximately 1-3 weeks.

"Risk factors
- Housing near (within approximately 5 miles [8 km]) a freshwater stream, or river, or on irrigated pasture in endemic areas
- Nighttime use of barn lights which attract parasitized insects

"Transmission
- Oral ingestion of trematodes present in aquatic insects (caddisflies, mayflies, damselflies, and dragonflies)
- Whole blood transfusion from an infected donor
- Transplacental (across the placenta to the foal)
- Exposure to freshwater or operculate snails (Note: Affected horses are not considered to be contagious by natural contact with other horses.)"

"Confirmed PHF cases are not considered to be contagious. The organism is not known to be free in the environment but is instead harbored by certain aquatic insects and snails."

Diagnosis
May be made by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] or IFA [immunofluorescent assay], depending on what type of sample is submitted to the testing laboratory.

"Post-mortem
Gross necropsy findings in the acute stage of PHF disease include:
- Distended large colon and cecum filled with watery contents
- Mucosal hyperemia and ulceration (may be widespread)
- Hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles and lymph nodes
Aborted fetus lesions include:
- Increased content within the small and large intestine
- Hepatic discoloration

"Submission of tissues for microscopic examination is indicated to facilitate a definitive diagnosis."

"Specific control measures
Routine isolation and disinfection guidelines should be followed, including appropriate disposal of manure.

"In situations where insect attraction has occurred fouling horse feed and water, keep barn lights off where practical to discourage insect travel from water habitats.

"Release of animals from isolation
- Any diarrheic horse should be isolated until the cause can be established
- Co-infection with additional contagious agents is possible in _N. risticii_-infected horses, therefore a comprehensive fecal diagnostic investigation should be undertaken.
- If PHF is proven to be the only cause of the observed illness, isolation protocols can be relaxed as it is not considered a contagious disease.

"Biosecurity issues for receiving animals:
Diarrheic horses should be isolated as a matter of routine until contagious causes can be ruled out and normal feces are produced"
