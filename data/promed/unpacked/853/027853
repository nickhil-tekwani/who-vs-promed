China reports additional SARS cases - update
-------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported an additional 3 cases of
SARS, including one death. This brings the current number of persons with a
clinical illness compatible with SARS in China to 4.
Chinese authorities have reported a diagnosis of clinically confirmed SARS
coronavirus infection in 2 of these persons. These are the 20-year-old
nurse in Beijing, reported yesterday, who remains in intensive care, and a
26-year-old female laboratory researcher, from Anhui Province. During 2
weeks in March 2004, the researcher worked at the Chinese National
Institute of Virology in Beijing, which is part of China's Center for
Disease Control. This institute is known to be engaged in research
involving the SARS coronavirus. She developed symptoms on 25 Mar and was
attended, while in a Beijing hospital, by the nurse. Her mother also
provided bedside care.
The mother became ill in Anhui on 8 Apr and died on 19 Apr. Her clinical
symptoms were compatible with SARS, and health authorities have
retrospectively diagnosed her as a suspected SARS case.
The 4th person is a 31-year-old male laboratory researcher who also worked
at the Beijing virology institute. He developed symptoms on 17 Apr and was
hospitalized in isolation on 22 Apr. Health authorities have diagnosed him
as a suspected SARS case.
In line with WHO definitions of SARS coronavirus infections, WHO has
classified 2 of these persons, the 20-year-old nurse and the 26-year-old
laboratory researcher, as probable cases of SARS. The 2 additional persons
remain under investigation; further laboratory tests are being conducted by
Chinese authorities.
According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,
classification as a confirmed case requires independent verification of
results by an external international reference laboratory. Such procedures
are considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS
cases can have for international public health.
WHO is working closely with Chinese health authorities to confirm the
status and full extent of this cluster, and to prevent further spread. The
situation is considered potentially serious because of the multiple
opportunities for exposures. To date, more than 300 contacts have been
identified and placed under medical observation.

[2] China measures taken
Date: 24 Apr 2004

The Chinese government began screening travelers at airports and train
stations on Friday and closed its main SARS laboratory after what appeared
to be a safety breach at the lab led to 4 confirmed [cases are still
pending confirmation from an independent international laboratory] and
suspected cases, including a death, in a new outbreak.
Officials are hurriedly trying to determine how widely the disease has
spread. At least 260 people who came into close contact with the patients
are being observed, and at least 5 others with fevers have been isolated.
There is also concern about the recent travels of one of the patients [the
index case], a 26-year-old medical graduate student, who studied at the
SARS lab. She traveled on at least 3 trains; 2 of the trips came after she
had developed a fever and other symptoms. [Her] mother, who cared for her
and traveled with her, fell ill with pneumonia symptoms this month and died
Monday.
This is the 3rd outbreak from a laboratory accident in the past year; the
others were in Singapore and Taiwan. Dr. Alfred Sommer, an epidemiologist
and dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in
Baltimore, said Friday, "The good news is this is not a new emergence of
yet another strain of virus that we do not know anything about, or how to
contain," like SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, was when first
detected in 2003. "The bad news is that this is the 3rd laboratory release
of this virus, which keeps taking people by surprise," he added.
Chinese officials, who were harshly criticized for their mismanagement of
the original SARS outbreak, appeared to be responding swiftly. Efforts were
under way to find people who had come into contact with the SARS patients.
Officials also closed the Institute of Virology at China's Centers for
Disease Control in Beijing, where the infections originated, according to a
statement on the Ministry of Health Web site.
The director of Beijing's health bureau, Jin Dapeng, said Friday that the
chain of transmission had been identified and that authorities had the
situation under "effective control." The pattern of the outbreak, however,
has raised questions about how a safety breach could have occurred at the
laboratory and whether medical officials moved quickly enough to isolate
[the index case] after she exhibited symptoms. The 4 patients were cared
for in different hospitals but not initially isolated. Another student
working in the lab, developed symptoms more than 3 weeks later and is now
listed as suspected of having SARS.
Dr. Julie Hall, the SARS team leader for the Beijing office of the World
Health Organization, said health officials held a meeting on Friday with
the Chinese Ministry of Health. She said the ministry had asked for their
help in trying to determine what went wrong and to limit exposures.
At World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, a spokesman for the
United Nations agency said that under its rules it could not call the cases
confirmed until scientists in a laboratory in its network outside of China
had tested specimens from the patients. Until then, the agency is
considering as "probable" the 2 cases that China has called "confirmed."
The agency said it is classifying the other 2 cases as "under investigation."
Early Friday evening, the Chinese Ministry of Health issued a detailed
chronology that appeared to trace the outbreak to some sort of mishap in
the lab. [The index case], a medical graduate student in Anhui Province,
began study at the lab on 7 Mar 2004. She and the other [post doctoral
student case] both studied in a laboratory that handled samples of the SARS
virus, according to Dr. Hall.
The Health Ministry said that [the index case's] stint at the lab ended 22
Mar 2004 and that the next day she returned by train to Anhui Province. On
25 Mar 2004, she developed a fever. At some point, she returned by train to
Beijing for treatment. On 29 Mar 2004, she was admitted to Jiangong
Hospital as a pneumonia patient.
At the hospital, one of [the nurses who cared for her], the woman
identified Thursday by Chinese officials as suspected of having SARS. On
Friday, officials reclassified [this case] as a confirmed SARS patient.
For reasons that are not clear, [the index case] was discharged from
Jiangong on 2 Apr 2004 and returned by train with her mother to a hospital
in Anhui. There, she was transferred to a second hospital. The person
apparently most often by [her] side during her illness was her mother. She
had started caring for her daughter on 31 Mar 2004 and developed a fever on
8 Apr 2004. She was hospitalized as a pneumonia patient at the same
hospital as her daughter. On Monday, [the index case's mother] died.
The official New China News Agency reported that [the index case] tested
positive for SARS antibodies on Wednesday. Health officials from Beijing
went to Anhui and tested her again. She again tested positive on Friday and
was deemed a confirmed SARS patient. Dr. Hall, said she "died of pneumonia
of an unknown cause that is likely to be SARS."
Meanwhile, [the other graduate student] developed a fever on 17 Apr 2004
and was hospitalized Thursday. He is now classified as suspected of having
SARS.
Dr. Hall said the timetable raised questions about why [the index case] was
not promptly isolated when she first developed a fever, particularly
because physicians should have known she had studied in a SARS laboratory.
"Those alarm bells appear not to have gone off," she said.

<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/han/han_China042304.htm>

CDC is recommending that U.S. physicians maintain a greater index of
suspicion for SARS in patients who 1) require hospitalization for
radiographically confirmed pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and 2) who have a history of travel to mainland China (or close
contact with an ill person with a history of recent travel to mainland
China) in the 10 days before onset of symptoms . When such patients are
identified, they should be considered at high risk for SARS-CoV infection,
and the following actions should be taken:
Patients should immediately be placed in appropriate isolation precautions
for SARS (i.e., contact and airborne precautions along with eye protection).
Patients should promptly be reported to the state or local health
department. Health departments should immediately report any SARS-CoV
positive test result to CDC. Health departments should also inform CDC of
other cases or clusters of pneumonia that are of particular concern by
calling 770-488-7100.
Patients should promptly be tested for evidence of SARS-CoV infection as
part of the diagnostic evaluation (see Appendix 2, "Guidelines for
Collecting Specimens from Potential SARS Patients," in the CDC document,
"In the Absence of SARS-CoV Transmission Worldwide: Guidance for
Surveillance, Clinical and Laboratory Evaluation, and Reporting" at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/absenceofsars.htm>
The health department should identify, evaluate, and monitor relevant
contacts of the patient, as indicated. In particular, the health status of
household contacts or persons who provided care to symptomatic patients
should be assessed.
Health care providers are reminded to obtain a travel history for patients
presenting with acute respiratory illness. In addition, this new case of
possible SARS provides a reminder to all healthcare settings, especially
physician offices, outpatient clinics, and emergency departments, of the
importance of implementing infection control precautions at the point of
1st contact with patients who have symptoms of a respiratory infection.
These include respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, hand hygiene, and
droplet precautions (i.e., masks for close patient contact). For additional
information, see " Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette in Healthcare Settings."
The reported possible cases of SARS in China represent an evolving
situation, and CDC will distribute updates as additional information is
learned. For more about SARS and the current U.S. SARS control guidelines,
please visit the CDC SARS website.

<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/cases_china.html>

Health Canada has alerted health care officials to the importance of
collecting a travel history from people with severe respiratory illness. As
per the Department's guidelines, Health Canada recommends that health
professionals be alert for severe respiratory illness (fever, cough,
difficulty breathing and evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory
distress syndrome) in patients who have a history of travel to China or in
patients having close contact with a symptomatic person with a history of
travel to China in the 10 days before symptoms appeared.
We continue to provide ongoing, up-to-date information from Health Canada
to our provincial and territorial partners on SARS, influenza, avian
influenza, and other emerging severe respiratory illnesses.
Health Canada continues to maintain Quarantine Services at the Toronto,
Vancouver, Montreal (Mirabel, Pierre Elliot Trudeau), Calgary, Edmonton,
Halifax and Ottawa international airports. Quarantine Officers on site at
these airports provide health assessments for international travellers who
are identified to be ill. Health Canada has advised Quarantine Officers of
the SARS situation in China and has asked them to increase vigilance of any
reported passengers with respiratory illness. They have been advised to be
especially alert to reports of travellers on flights from Beijing who
appear to be ill from a respiratory illness. We also continue to provide
infectious disease brochures with information on SARS at the airports.

The European Commission Directorate General for Public Health and Consumer
Protection (DG SANCO, <http://europa.eu.int/comm/health/index_en.htm>) has
previously issued several technical guidance documents outlining the
communication procedures if a probable case of SARS is detected within
European Union countries. This document also includes case definitions (see
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/health/ph_threats/com/sars/com_procedure.pdf>).
An early warning, regarding the current Beijing suspect case of SARS, has
been sent to national public health bodies through the European Union's
Early Warning and Response System.
The United Kingdom (UK) Health Protection Agency (HPA) recently issued
interim guidance (algorithm) for identification of possible cases of SARS
and avian influenza
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/avianinfluenza/pdfs/Algorithm140
404.pdf>). The HPA has urged clinicians and health professionals in the UK
to remain vigilant and report any unusual clusters of severe respiratory
illness in people returning from China.

South Korea heightens health checks against travelers from China amid new
SARS scare
Health inspections of travelers from Beijing and Shanghai were intensified
Saturday at South Korean airports and seaports after China reported new
SARS cases.
The National Institute of Health ordered quarantine offices to check
temperatures of all travelers from the 2 Chinese cities, and asked them to
fill out health questionnaires upon arrival.
The institute also ordered anyone showing symptoms of severe acute
respiratory syndrome, such as a high fever, be reported immediately.

more detailed information from WHO and newswires on the chronology of
events surrounding the cases with implications for potential spread due to
delay in recognition of the disease in the index and other cases. We've
included information from several countries on heightened surveillance
activities that are now being taken in order to more quickly identify
possible spread of disease outside of China. One hopes that with
heightened surveillance, transmission of the SARS CoV will be interrupted
rapidly. - Mod.MPP]
