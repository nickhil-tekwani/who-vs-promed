A large increase in norovirus outbreaks in Hungary and Germany was reported
to European national health authorities via the Foodborne Viruses in Europe
network (FBVE,
<http://www.eufoodborneviruses.co.uk/DIVINEVENT/DIVIndex.asp>) on 24 Nov
and 4 Dec respectively. Subsequently, an email was sent to all FBVE members
requesting a current overview on norovirus outbreaks in their country, and
asking for preliminary reports on genotyping.
Thirteen country authorities participate in the FBVE network. Nine of the
11 country authorities which replied to the survey indicated an increase in
norovirus activity (outbreaks and/or case reports) in October and/or
November 2006 compared with the same period in 2004 and 2005 [Data
tabulated in the original report]. In 2 countries (France and Spain), no
increase in norovirus activity was found. Unusually high norovirus activity
already in summer 2006 was reported by the Hungarian authorities (thought
to be due to a drinking-water related outbreak) as well as the Netherlands,
Denmark, Ireland, Finland, and Norway. [The reports of norovirus cases and
outbreaks across Europe, as provided by an email survey and as reported to
the FBVE database, are tabulated in detail in the original report which
should be consulted for further detail. Numbers of reports in the email
survey were partly estimates; the numbers of reports in the FBVE database
are counts.]
The norovirus isolates causing 108 outbreaks which started in October and
November 2006 have been characterised, and 87 (81 per cent) belonged to
genotype G.II 4, which has been the predominant genotype in recent years.
Twenty-one (19 per cent) belonged to other genotypes. Of the 87 G II.4
isolates characterised, 51 (47 per cent) were G II.4 new variant 2006a and
24 (22 per cent) were variant 2006b. Twelve G II.4 isolates (11 per cent)
could not be assigned to a variant.
All norovirus outbreak isolates which were reported to FBVE sequence
database in the seasons 2004/2005, 2005/2006 and the present season so far
are shown graphically ion the form of a histogram in the original report.
The first new variants of genotype GII.4 2006 appeared during the 2005/2006
season, and became the predominant strain in summer 2006. For variant
2006a, the 1st entry in the database is from an outbreak or case in England
in 2005. The first 2006b variant was reported from Spain in December 2005
after an outbreak in a residential institution. In the spring of 2006, this
variant was found to be circulating widely, causing at least 45 outbreaks
of norovirus illness on cruise ships sailing across Europe. It is believed
that the emergence of the variants 2006a and 2006b and the increase in
outbreaks on cruise ships might well be the forewarning of a very active
norovirus season. This prediction is based on observations in 1996, 2002
and 2004, when the appearance of new variants within genotype GII.4
coincided with high levels of outbreak reporting worldwide [1,2,4].
The different country reports indicate that the norovirus season has
already started in most areas. As predicted, 2006/2007 is likely to be a
highly active norovirus season, with the new variants of genotype G II.4
2006 being predominant [3]. It is therefore recommended that hospitals and
nursing homes inform their staff about the possibility of norovirus
outbreaks and provide information on the clinical presentation. They should
also consult their outbreak protocols, adopt them if necessary and
strengthen preventive measures, in order to be prepared for the present
outbreak season.
The data provided in response to this email survey come from local
datasets, and are not (yet) visible in the FBVE database. The FBVE network
maintains a web-based database to which 13 national authorities report
norovirus outbreaks, along with epidemiological and laboratory data. The
average delay between the onset of an outbreak and the reporting of this
outbreak to the FBVE database is quite long.
For the outbreaks reported in the quarterly period of July to September
2006, the average delay was 111 days, ranging from 23 days (Sweden) to 436
days (Italy). As a result, in its present form, the FBVE database cannot be
used to compare reports from Germany and Hungary with the rest of the
European situation. Since typing norovirus strains takes some time, there
is limited information on the circulating noroviruses at the moment. A
complete comparison will be possible towards the end of this winter.

Comparisons of genome sequences to determine if norovirus outbreak strains
elsewhere belong to the same new variant lineage can be done via an open
access strain matching system (<http://www.rivm.nl/bnwww>). This was
established by the FBVE network to allow harmonized sequence comparisons
worldwide for commonly used genome regions (follow the links to Food-borne
viruses in Europe' and quick typing database'. Requests for strain
comparison can also be sent to <fbve@rivm.nl>).

From January to November 2006, 223 norovirus outbreaks were reported in
Hungary. For 128 out of 223 outbreaks (57 per cent) the norovirus agent was
laboratory confirmed (72 by ELISA, 56 by PCR). Norovirus was thought to be
the probable cause for the remaining 95 outbreaks on the basis of clinical
and epidemiological data.
Since summer 2006, the majority of outbreaks in Hungary have been caused by
the new variant of the virus GGII.4 2006b, which was identified early in
2006 in several European countries [see report above], including Hungary
(in April). A rise in norovirus circulation had been expected in subsequent
seasons following the appearance of this new variant.
In the 2nd quarter of 2006, an especially high virus circulation was noted
in north east Hungary. This was thought to be due to the outbreak of
drinking water-related diseases which occurred in June 2006 in Miskolc (the
capital of Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen county in the north east), affecting 3600
people. Although the outbreak had multiple causes, the predominant agent
was found to be norovirus. Following this outbreak, the number of norovirus
outbreaks in the area increased. In the 3rd quarter of 2006, increased
norovirus activity spread to the neighbouring county of Heves and to
central part of Hungary, and in October and November 2000 it reached the
northern lowlands and the northern and western Trans-danubian region.
So far, in 2006, norovirus outbreaks have been reported as occurring in
similar settings to outbreaks in recent years: 42 per cent (54 outbreaks)
took place in hospitals, 31 per cent (39 outbreaks) in residential homes
for old people, 13 per cent (16 outbreaks) in settings with children (such
as nurseries and schools) and the remaining 15 per cent (19 outbreaks) in
other places. In most outbreaks, including the recent ones in November
2006, the transmission was person to person; other modes of transmission
played a negligible role.
Compared with previous years, the overall number of norovirus outbreaks
reported in Hungary between January and November 2006 is almost 2.5 times
higher than during the same period in 2005, and exceeds the median value
for the years 2002-2004.
In the 1st quarter of both 2005 and 2006, a similar number of outbreaks was
reported (62 and 68 respectively). However, in the 2nd quarter of 2006, the
number of outbreaks almost doubled when compared with the same period of
2005, and in the 3rd quarter and October and November of 2006, it was 4
times higher than in the same period of 2005. [Data illustrated by a
histogram in the original report].
The total number of probable and laboratory confirmed norovirus outbreaks
in Hungary in 2005 did not exceed the median value for 2000-2004
(consequently, 2005 was considered to be a year with low norovirus
activity), whereas from January to November 2006 the number of outbreaks in
all periods was above the median of these previous years, and in October
and November 2006 it was 3 times higher than the median.
Norovirus surveillance in Hungary began in 1998, and since 2002, Hungarian
national authorities have participated in the Food-borne Viruses in Europe'
network (<http://www.eufoodborneviruses.co.uk/>). After the routine
bacteriological investigation of an outbreak has been completed,
representative samples undergo ELISA analysis and both positive and
negative samples are sent to the national reference laboratory for
gastroenteric viruses for further investigation, where a PCR test and
comparative genetic analysis of the viruses identified are performed [1].
Thanks to this procedure, norovirus has been established as the cause of
569 gastroenteritis outbreaks in Hungary since 1998. In a further 583
outbreaks, noroviruses were thought to be the probable cause on the basis
of clinical and epidemiological data alone, because laboratory
investigation either was not performed or yielded negative results [data
presented as a histogram in the original text].
According to the surveillance data gathered so far, 2002/2003 has been the
most active norovirus season since surveillance began. The sharp rise in
number of norovirus outbreaks in that period was due to the increased
circulation of the then newly-identified variant (G II.4 2002) which was
detected in Europe in 2002, including in Hungary [2].
The increase in the number of outbreaks seen in 2006 seems to follow a
similar pattern and be due to the newly identified genotype GII.4 2006
variants, but as the 2006/2007 season is not yet over, it will be possible
to draw the final conclusions only after the surveillance data has been
completed and put in a larger international context.
