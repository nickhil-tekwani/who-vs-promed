In a follow-up on the salmonellosis outbreak reported across Norway, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has, in collaboration with the Norwegian Veterinary Institute, detected _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis with the outbreak profile in a batch of beef imported from Germany.

The imported batch of beef is used for, among other things, chop dough [Our investigations have failed to reveal what this is. - Mod.SH]. This product has been withdrawn from the market. Some of the imported batch of beef has also been sold to other companies, and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority is still working to trace this.

"This agrees well with the information we have from the cases that have so far been interviewed, where several state that they have tasted raw chop dough," says Dr Hilde Marie Lund. "I would also like to remind you of the importance of frying chop dough and minced meat as an important preventive piece of advice."

Outbreak investigation is ongoing in close collaboration with the industry, relevant municipal chief physicians, the Veterinary Institute, and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. Of the total of 22 cases, 19 have so far been detected in the _S._ Enteritidis outbreak strain. For 3 of the cases, we are awaiting a final confirmation, but preliminary analyses indicate that these belong to the outbreak. In addition, we are awaiting analysis of one case.

The people who belong to the outbreak are sampled at the end of January [2021] and until the last week of February [2021] (week 4-8). They are aged 11-91 years, the median age is 60.5 years, and 64% are women. The infected live in Viken (11), Oslo (3), Innlandet (2), Vestfold and Telemark (1), Agder (1), Rogaland (1), Vestland (1), More og Romsdal (1), and Nordland (1). Ten of the cases have been hospitalized.
