There IS standard serology for bovine brucellosis. I am not familiar
with a skin test, but there could be. Are you confusing this with
bovine TB in the post about Idaho brucellosis?

[Brucellosis testing is a blood test. The blood is drawn and
submitted to the laboratory, where a number of tests can be run on
the blood. Our thanks to Drs. Britt, Nydham, and King who wrote
promptly to point out the error.
This moderator apologizes for giving the protocol for TB testing. - Mod.TG]
