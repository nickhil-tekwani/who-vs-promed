Kenya: Rift Valley fever case number now 152 with 54 deaths
-----------------------------------------------
The death toll from the dreaded Rift Valley Fever in North Eastern province
has risen to 54 after 2 more people succumbed to the disease. The area
Provincial Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Ahmed Omar, on Tuesday [2 Jan
2007] told the press that one person died at Garissa Provincial General
Hospital this morning [Tue 2 Jan 2007] while the other one died at Hagarbul
in Garissa District.
Dr. Omar said 47 new cases of the disease have also been recorded in the 3
districts of Garissa, Wajir and Ijara, bringing the total number of cases
to 152 up from 105.
He said in an effort to contain the disease, the government on Tue [2 Jan
2007] dispatched 2 doctors to Ijara and Wajir Districts to assist other
doctors at the district hospital, where many patients are admitted.
Dr. Omar, however, pointed out that the lack of enough nurses at Wajir,
Mandera and Ijara district hospitals and the poor state of the roads in the
province were hampering efforts to contain the disease. He appealed to
residents of the province to comply with measures that have been put in
place by the government to control the disease.
