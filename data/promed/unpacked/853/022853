On 8 Jan 2016, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N6) virus.

Details of the cases:
The 1st case is a 25-year-old male from Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, who developed symptoms on 1 Jan [2016]. The patient was admitted to hospital on 4 Jan [2016] and is now in severe condition. He has a history of visiting a live poultry market.

The 2nd case is a 42-year-old male from Jieyang City, Guangdong Province, who developed symptoms on 12 Dec [2015]. The patient was admitted to hospital on 19 Dec [2015] and died on 21 Dec [2015]. He had a history of visiting a live poultry market.

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:
- making every effort to treat the patient; collecting and testing the specimens of the patient, carrying out viral isolation and whole genome sequencing and comparison;
- conducting epidemiological investigation; tracing, managing and observing the close contacts of the patient;
- strengthening surveillance of unexplained pneumonia and routine sentinel surveillance of influenza; strengthening the etiological surveillance of influenza/avian influenza virus.

WHO continues to closely monitor the influenza A(H5N6) situation and conduct risk assessments. So far, the overall risk associated with avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses has not changed.

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms or contact with animals in live bird markets or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005) and continue national health preparedness actions.
