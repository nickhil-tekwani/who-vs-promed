Withdrawing antimicrobial growth promoters in animals in Denmark has
reduced threat of antimicrobial resistance
-----------------------------------------------------
An international review panel has concluded that Denmark's termination of
the use of antimicrobial growth promoters seems to have achieved its
desired public health goal, and that countries with similar animal
production conditions could see similar benefits if they follow suit (1).
The World Health Organization (WHO) convened the independent and
international panel in November 2002. The panel evaluated the impact that
withdrawal of antimicrobial growth promoters in Denmark has made on the
efficiency of food animal production, animal health, food safety, and
consumer prices.
Denmark's termination programme is consistent with WHO global principles,
which call on governments to adopt a proactive approach to reduce the need
for antimicrobials in animals and ensure their prudent use (2).
Antimicrobial growth promoters were withdrawn both as a public health
measure and to ensure consumer confidence. Their use ceased in Denmark in
1999. The concern was that resistance to these antimicrobials in the food
animal reservoir would lead to clinical problems in humans, although these
were rare in Denmark both before and after termination. The quantity of
antimicrobials used in food animals in Denmark has declined 54 per cent
from peak use between 1994 and 2001.
Before the programme began, most pigs and broiler chickens in Denmark were
given antimicrobials, such as avilamycin, avoparcin, tylosin, and
virginiamycin, for most of their lives. After withdrawal, average use
declined to 0.4 days in broiler chickens (with life span of around 42 days)
and 7.9 days in pigs (with life span of around 170 days). Pork production
in Denmark has continued to increase, and effects on poultry production
were small.
Data from the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and
Research Programme (DANMAP <http://www.vetinst.dk>) showed that ending the
use of the above antimicrobials has greatly reduced the reservoir of
resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ in the food animal reservoir, thus
reducing the reservoir of resistance genes. For example, resistance to
avilamycin, avoparcin, and streptogramins in _Enterococcus faecium_
isolates from broiler chickens declined from 60 to 80 per cent before
withdrawal of antimicrobials to only 5 to 35 per cent after. The panel
considered that the threat of antimicrobial resistance to human health has
been reduced.
The panel concluded that use of antimicrobials for the sole purpose of
growth promotion can be ended in countries that have similar conditions to
Denmark, that is, where animal farming methods are intensive, and animals
have a relatively high health status, and where a high level of
infrastructure and capacity to monitor antimicrobial use and resistance
exist. In July 2003, the European Parliament adopted a regulation on feed
additives that completes a ban on antibiotic growth promoters in feed, and
the European Union's Scientific Steering Committee has recommended that the
use of these antimicrobials be progressively phased out (3 and
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/afs/afs_index_en.html>).
