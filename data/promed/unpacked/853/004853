HERPES B VIRUS, RISK FOR MACAQUE OWNERS

Between 80% to 90% of adult macaques carry [Herpes] B virus, which poses a
significant threat to human health, says an article in the January 1998
issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases. Macaques are found in laboratories,
wild animal parks, zoos, private homes, and even wandering free in
undeveloped areas of Texas and Florida. Their bites or scratches can infect
humans with B virus, a herpesvirus that lies dormant in monkeys, as
herpesvirus simplex does in humans. "B-virus infection in monkeys is
characterized by lifelong infection with intermittent reactivation and
shedding of the virus in saliva or genital secretions, particularly during
periods of stress or immunosuppression," says Dr. Stephanie Ostrowski, a
veterinary epidemiologist at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. A layperson has no way of knowing when a
monkey is or is not contagious.
Pet owners are at particularly high risk for two reasons: 1) It is the
natural behavior of these animals to become more aggressive as they mature;
they bite to defend themselves and to establish dominance within a social
group. 2) People tend to form an emotional bond with pet macaques, treating
them like human babies. Some people have even put their pet macaque in
diapers, hired baby-sitters, and shared chewed bubble gum. This close,
intimate contact exposes macaque owners to B virus. Children are three
times more likely than adults to be bitten by a macaque, but the reasons
and risk factors are unclear.
Although federal regulations control importation and distribution of
macaques, people can be exposed to B virus through contact with
macaques, either as pets or those in wildlife parks, both in the United
States and abroad. For more information, contact the CDC Media Relations
Division, Office of Communication, at 404-639-3286, or access the full
