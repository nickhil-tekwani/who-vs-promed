The deadly outbreak of jaundice [previously reported as hepatitis E - Mod.LL] in Biratnagar [Morang District], which has already claimed 10 lives, has now spread in the Morang District Prison located in the town. "16 prisoners have tested positive for the disease and are receiving treatment at various hospitals in the district," said jailor Durgadatta Poudel, adding that 4 of them, who are undergoing treatment at the Koshi Zonal Hospital and Nobel Hospital, are in serious condition.

Poudel said they had feared the worst as 400 inmates underwent medical check-ups after being suspected of suffering from jaundice. The prison located at Biratnagar Sub-Metropolitan City-11 houses 700 prisoners. Ward no 2, 10, 11 and 13 of Biratnagar sub-metropolis have been badly affected by the jaundice outbreak affecting scores of people, health workers said, adding that the hospitals in the town have been flooded by patients and the disease has spread in other areas in the city too.

Nawaraj Subba, chief of the District Public Health Office, said that 55 new patients received treatment in Biratnagar-based health facilities on Tuesday, 13 May 2014, alone. "The number of patients is increasing every day," he said, adding that 1414 patients received treatment in various health facilities across the city as of Tuesday evening, 13 May 2014. He, however, said that the number of affected people could be much higher as the district authorities do not have any record of patients receiving treatment in health facilities outside the city.

The majority of patients are aged between 15 and 40, Subba said.

[The initial posting suggested the total number of those affected was higher (about 6000) with 9 deaths. As noted in the past, a hallmark of epidemic hepatitis E is a high case fatality rate in pregnant women (especially in the last trimester). Fulminant hepatic failure occurs in this cohort and may be caused by immunological and endocrinological changes occurring in pregnancy. In maternal survivors, infection of the baby occurs often. Deaths can also occur in those with preexisting liver disease of any type.

Treatment of some cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, acute or chronic, has been effective using ribivirin monotherapy (1). Additionally, a recombinant vaccine is being studied and appears to be safe and effective (2).
