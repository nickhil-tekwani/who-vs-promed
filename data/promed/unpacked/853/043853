The Mauritian Agro-Industry ministry late on Wednesday [10 Oct 2007]
unveiled various measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the swine fever
in the Island, an official source told PANA [Pan African News Agency].

An official of the ministry said a high number of pigs had recently died in
several farms in the Island, sparking fears about a swine fever epidemic.

"Postmortem examinations have been carried out on the dead animals. We will
be sending today [11 Oct 2007] samples to South Africa for further
analysis," he said. Also, 12 000 vaccines against the disease have been
ordered from the Pasteur Institute in France.

Meanwhile, all pork businesses have been banned throughout the island and
the pork unit at the main butchery in the capital, Port Louis, has been
temporarily closed. Products to disinfect farms have also been distributed
to breeders.

[The ordering of vaccine may indicate that the suspected disease is classical
swine fever (CSF); there is no vaccine against African swine fever (ASF).
Laboratory results are anticipated; confirmation (or exclusion) of CSF and ASF,
as well as further details, are requested. - Mod.AS
