Infection with Mayaro virus in a French traveller returning from the Amazon
region, Brazil, January, 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: C Receveur, M Grandadam, T Pistone, D Malvy]

Summary
-------
Mayaro virus (MAYV) disease is a mosquitoborne zoonosis endemic in humid
forests of tropical South America. MAYV is closely related to other
alphaviruses that produce a dengue-like illness accompanied by long-lasting
arthralgia. A French tourist developed high-grade fever and severe joint
manifestations following a 15 day trip in the Amazon basin, Brazil, and was
diagnosed with MAYV infection in January 2010. This case is the 1st
reported in a traveller returning from an endemic South American country to
Europe.

Introduction
------------
Mayaro virus (MAYV) (family _Togaviridae_, genus _Alphavirus_) is an
arthropodborne zoonotic pathogen circulating only in tropical South
America. The transmission cycle of MAYV in the wild is nearly similar to
the continuous sylvatic cycle of yellow fever and is believed to involve
wild primates (monkeys) as the reservoir and the tree-canopy-dwelling
_Haemagogus_ mosquito as the vector. Thus, human infections are strongly
associated with recent exposure to humid tropical forest environments. MAYV
disease is an acute, self-limited dengue-like illness of 3-5 days'
duration. Moreover, MAYV is closely related to chikungunya virus and
produces a nearly indistinguishable, highly debilitating arthralgic disease.

Here we report the case of MAYV disease that recently occurred in a French
citizen who presented with severe rheumatologic disorders after visiting
the Brazilian Amazon. This report illustrates that with increasing travel
to remote areas, travellers are at risk of acquiring and importing rare
diseases that are not indigenous to Europe.

Discussion
----------
The case illustrates the challenge of clinically differentiating MAYV
disease from classical dengue fever and other febrile exanthematous
diseases that also circulate in South America, as well as the role of
laboratory confirmation in establishing a correct diagnosis. Indeed, dengue
fever was initially suspected considering its occurrence in most cities and
places in tropical America, including the Amazon basin.

[Normally, ProMED-mail does not post imported cases such as this one that
originate in an endemic area and arrive in a country where ongoing
transmission is unlikely or not possible. Mayaro virus is endemic in Brazil
and the possibility of transmission in France is not likely. This case was
posted because it is unique as the 1st reported Mayaro virus infection
imported into Europe and because Mayaro virus infection can be clinically
similar enough to dengue virus infections, indicating that a thorough
travel history supported by comprehensive laboratory testing is important
for making a differential diagnosis. The full report can be accessed at the
