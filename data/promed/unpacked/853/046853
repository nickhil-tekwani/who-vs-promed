The [Colorado] State Veterinarian's Office says there are 60 locations under quarantine after horses and cows tested positive for a debilitating virus. Officials said on Friday (24 Oct 2014) that 274 of the 334 quarantines announced over the summer have been released, but warm fall temperatures are still a concern.

The virus called vesicular stomatitis is spread by insects and from animal to animal through open sores and saliva. The virus causes oral blisters and sores that can be painful and cause difficulty eating and drinking for the animals.

The quarantines are located in Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Jefferson, Larimer Logan, Morgan, Otero, Pueblo and Weld counties. The state veterinarian's office says it is not recommending that livestock shows be canceled.

[Hopefully all these premises will soon be released from quarantine. Texas was the other state that was hard hit with vesicular stomatitis this year (2014). As of 16 Oct 2014, Texas has no premises under quarantine.

Readers are encouraged to read my comments on ProMED-mail post 20140927.2811014 for more information on the vesicular stomatitis virus.
