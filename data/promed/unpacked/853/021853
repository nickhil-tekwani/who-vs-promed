A respiratory illness that caused nasal discharge and coughing in nearly 40 000 Icelandic horses in 2010 has been linked to a strain of _Strepotococcus zooepidemicus_.

The organism, which is closely related to the microbe that causes strangles infections, is commonly found on the skin and in the respiratory tract of horses and occasionally causes significant disease.

Researchers originally looked for a viral cause of the epidemic, but no virus was found in affected horses. However, most of the tested equines were carrying _S. zooepidemicus_, leading investigators to pinpoint the bacterial strain as the cause.

[Although this has taken 2 years, it is good to know the cause of the problem in these horses.
