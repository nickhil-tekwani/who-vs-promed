Following the death of a 22-year-old woman from South West Garo Hills district [Meghalaya state, India] due to Japanese encephalitis [virus infection], the medical authorities have taken precautionary measures to confine the disease from spreading.

There are 37 confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis in the state to date, official sources said today [29 Aug 2014].

The death of the woman was the 1st such instance in the state.

Joint Director of Health Services, in-charge integrated disease surveillance project, Dr RO Budnah today said that the woman died after she went home following treatment at Tura Civil Hospital.

The woman was diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis on 21 Aug [2014] and later admitted to the Tura Civil Hospital.

"There are as many as 37 confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis and we are taking all precautionary measures so that the disease does not spread further to unaffected parts of the state," Dr Budnah said.

Ri-Bhoi district is the most affected with 16 confirmed cases, Dr Budnath added.

[Meghalaya state is in northeastern India, where Japanese encephalitis virus transmission occurs seasonally. The above report quotes health authorities as indicating that precautionary measures have been taken to halt spread of this virus disease, but does not indicate what those measures are. Possible measures include mounting a vaccination campaign, intensive public education to avoid mosquito bites, or vector control, which is much more difficult for these _Culex_ mosquitoes, which can occur over extensive areas. India is still in mid-virus transmission season, so additional cases can be expected in this region of India.
