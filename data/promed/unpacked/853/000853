Brazil.
- Vector control. 25 Apr 2018. (reported) Millions of sterile mosquitoes will be released from drones over parts of Brazil to combat the Zika virus, after successful field tests were hailed as a "breakthrough" by the United Nations. Once freed, the sterilized, laboratory-bred male _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes mate with wild females, but do not produce viable eggs. The use of drones allows mosquitoes to be released by air on a large scale that reduces the cost of distribution.

- Congenital consequences. 15 May 2018. (reported) In the year since Brazil officially declared an end to the Zika outbreak, the aftermath has only just begun. An estimated 3000 children have Congenital Zika Syndrome, the collection of neurological disorders that afflict the babies of mothers infected with Zika during pregnancy. Civil Society in Brazil, with help from local and state governments, has done its best to explore new treatments for children as a response to the emergence of this new condition. But the number of children born with Congenital Zika Syndrome is straining Brazil's already limited public health system.

(reported) Peru has declared a national epidemiological alert to contain what appears to be an outbreak of the Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with the Zika virus, according to the country's health ministry. Health authorities suspect of more than 19 cases of the syndrome in Peru and have warned hospitals to watch for symptoms in other people.

Bangladesh. 6 Apr 2018. (published) ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies were detected in a study from 2013 onwards. The prevalence of ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies was not significantly higher in patients with GBS compared to healthy. Serological evidence for prior ZIKV infection in patients with GBS was associated with more frequent cranial, sensory, and autonomic nerve involvement compared to GBS patients with _Campylobacter jejuni_, the predominant preceding infection in GBS worldwide. Nerve-conduction studies revealed that ZIKV antibodies were associated with a demyelinating subtype of GBS, while _C. jejuni_ infections were related to an axonal subtype. Interpretation: No significant association was found between ZIKV infection and GBS in Bangladesh, but GBS following ZIKV infection was characterized by a distinct clinical and electrophysiological subtype compared to _C. jejuni_ infection. These findings indicate that ZIKV may precede a specific GBS subtype but the risk is low.

- Risk assessment. 11 Apr 2018. (published) The authors present a framework for the projection of ZIKV autochthonous transmission in the continental US during the 2015-2016 epidemic, using a data-driven stochastic and spatial epidemic model accounting for seasonal, environmental and detailed population data. The model generates an ensemble of travel-related case counts and simulate their potential to trigger local transmission at individual level. Locations in Texas and Florida that have actually experienced local ZIKV transmission are among the places at highest risk according to the results.

Abstract
Background
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has been linked to adverse birth outcomes. Previous reports have shown that person-to-person transmission can occur by means of sexual contact.

Methods
We conducted a prospective study involving men with symptomatic ZIKV infection to determine the frequency and duration of ZIKV shedding in semen and urine and to identify risk factors for prolonged shedding in these fluids. Specimens were obtained twice per month for 6 months after illness onset and were tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for ZIKV RNA and by Vero cell culture and plaque assay for infectious ZIKV.

Results
A total of 1327 semen samples from 184 men and 1038 urine samples from 183 men were obtained 14 - 304 days after illness onset. ZIKV RNA was detected in the urine of 7 men (4 percent) and in the semen of 60 (33 percent), including in semen samples from 22 of 36 men (61 percent) who were tested within 30 days after illness onset. ZIKV RNA shedding in semen decreased substantially during the 3 months after illness onset but continued for 281 days in 1 man (1 percent). Factors that were independently associated with prolonged RNA shedding included older age, less frequent ejaculation, and the presence of certain symptoms at the time of initial illness. Infectious ZIKV was isolated from 3 of 78 semen samples with detectable ZIKV RNA, all obtained within 30 days after illness onset and all with at least 7.0 log ^10 ZIKV RNA copies per mL of semen.

Conclusions
ZIKV RNA was commonly present in the semen of men with symptomatic ZIKV infection and persisted in some men for more than 6 months. In contrast, shedding of infectious ZIKV appeared to be much less common and was limited to the 1st few weeks after illness onset.

[Although Zika virus RNA has been detected in semen as long as 6 months after the acute infection and 281 days in the above report, the question has remained about persistence of infectious virus with a risk of sexual transmission. The results of the above study indicate that presence of virus RNA for long period of time does not necessarily mean presence of infectious virus. It will be interesting to see if CDC recommendations are modified, given the results of the above study. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
A prospective cohort of women with RT-PCR confirmed Zika virus infection aged 18-39 years in Puerto Rico found that pregnant women have about a 3-fold longer estimated median detection of Zika virus RNA in serum, which can increase definitive diagnosis of infection and facilitate timely and appropriate clinical management.

Zika virus transmission in Brazil was linked to a large outbreak of microcephaly but less is known about longer term anthropometric and neurological outcomes. We studied a cohort of infants born between [31 Oct 2015], and [9 Jan 2016], in a state maternity hospital, followed up for 101 plus/minus 28 days by home visits. Microcephaly (less than 2 standard deviations, Intergrowth standard) occurred in 62 of 412 (15 percent) births. Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) was diagnosed in 29 patients. Among CZS patients, we observed a significant gain in anthropometric measures (P less 0.001) but no significant gain in percentile for these measures. The main neurological outcome was epilepsy, occurring in 48 percent of infants at a rate of 15.6 cases per 100 patient-months, frequently requiring multiple anti-seizure medications. The cumulative fatality rate was 7.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval: 2.1-23.4 percent). Health-care professionals should be alerted on the high risk of epilepsy and death associated with CZS in early infancy and the need to actively screen for seizures and initiate timely treatment.

[Interestingly, a recently published study stated that babies exposed to Zika virus in utero but who are born with normal neuroimaging appear to develop in much the same way as do unexposed infants. At 6 months of age, the infants had neuromotor skills similar to those of unexposed controls. However, the authors stated that investigators need to determine how their work compares with studies from other parts of the world, where there have been observations that are more concerning in babies who have appeared normal at birth.

[5] Transmission by _Culex quinquefasciatus_

Abstract
We report a laboratory colony of _Culex quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes were experimentally able to salivate Zika virus (ZIKV, _Flaviviridae_; Flavivirus) at 16 days post infection (dpi). ZIKV RNA was detected in bodies and in saliva deposited on filter paper cards with subsequent studies demonstrating the presence of live ZIKV in saliva.

Discussion
Detection of ZIKV RNA in laboratory infected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ is not novel, however this report is the 1st laboratory study to show positive plaque assay results of live ZIKV collected from saliva from colonized _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. The results are proof of ZIKV transmission by this _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ population under the conditions of the study.

Although using a long established laboratory population may have contributed to their ability to transmit ZIKV, previous studies of ZIKV competence have also used established laboratory _Culex_ populations with mixed results (Amraoui et al., 2016; Weger-Lucarelli et al., 2016; Guedes et al., 2017; Kenney et al., 2017). Laboratory reared _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ from China infected with a contemporary isolate of ZIKV revealed ZIKV RNA in midgut tissues as early as 2 dpi and infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed on infant mice from which ZIKV RNA was later detected (Guo et al., 2016). During a ZIKV outbreak in Recife, Brazil, field collected _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ were positive by qRT-PCR for ZIKV and mosquitoes from a colony of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ salivated ZIKV RNA, further validating its potential as a vector of ZIKV (Guedes et al., 2017). Field collections of mosquitoes from Mexico included _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species containing live ZIKV. The authors also revealed the presence of live virus in dissected salivary glands of wild mosquitoes from both species further supporting the need to study additional mosquito species for ZIKV vector competence (Elizondo-Quiroga et al., 2018).

These findings support that there exists population-specific variability in the vector competence of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ for ZIKV like other mosquito-arboviral systems (Tabachnick, 2013). It affirms that there are biological and environmental conditions where _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes are likely competent for ZIKV and these mosquitoes may play a role in ZIKV transmission to humans. Varying yet unknown environmental conditions likely influence variation in vector competence that has been reported in different studies that have resulted in different conclusions about the role of _Culex_ in ZIKV transmission. We urge caution in making sweeping generalizations of ZIKV transmission capability. For example, further studies are warranted to ascertain those conditions that influence _Culex_ vector competence for ZIKV in different localities where _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ could be important in ZIKV epidemiology.

[Conflicting results of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ susceptibility and ability to transmit Zika virus, or lack of it, make it difficult to assess the importance of this mosquito as a vector of the virus in nature. Huang Yan-Jang et al. reported that Vero Beach, Florida _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ were refractory to Zika virus infection (<Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases. October 2016, 16(10): 673-676. doi:10.1089/vbz.2016.2058>) as was this mosquito tested by Amraoui et al. (<Euro Surveill. 2016;21(35):pii=30333>). The authors of the above report are correct: studies to determine the conditions under which this mosquito is able to become infected and transmit the virus and those conditions under which it is refractory are essential to determine the importance of this mosquito as a vector. - Mod.TY]

[6] Drone mosquito release

https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/27996-iaea-uses-drones-release-sterile-mosquitoes-high-risk-zika-areas/


Marking a milestone in the fight against vector-borne diseases, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) successfully released radiation-sterilized mosquitoes from drones in Brazil last as part of ongoing efforts to control mosquito populations there.

IAEA, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and Swiss-American nonprofit WeRobotics began pioneering the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) to control mosquito populations last year [2017]. Healthy, radiation-sterilized male mosquitoes are released into the wild to mate with females. Because the breeding doesn't produce offspring, populations decline over time.

"The release mechanism for mosquitos has until now been a bottleneck in the application of SIT to control human diseases," Jeremy Bouyer, a medical entomologist at the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, said. "The use of drones is a breakthrough, and paves the way for large-scale and cost-efficient releases, also over densely populated areas."

Previously, the sterile mosquitoes were released from the ground using a labor and time intensive method. The new drone application method, however, can be used to treat up to 20 hectares in 5 minutes, Bouyer said.

"The biggest challenge in designing this mechanism was keeping the mosquitos healthy and competitive while transporting and releasing them at cool temperatures" Adam Klaptocz, co-founder of WeRobotics, said. "We're pleased with initial tests that show less than 10 percent mortality through the entire chilling, transport, and aerial release process."

Each drone can carry 50 000 sterile mosquitoes per flight, which can cut the costs of releasing the mosquitoes in half, Bouyer said. As a result, Brazilian officials plan to use the drone application method in January 2019, which marks the peak of the summer mosquito season.
"We are hopeful about the application of SIT for the control of _Aedes aegypti_ in Brazil with the results from the drone tests," said Jair Virginio, director of Brazil-based Moscamed, an IAEA partner.

While SIT has been used to control populations of the Mediterranean fruit fly and other pests for a half century. The Zika epidemic in Brazil and Latin America from 2015-2016 led to ongoing efforts to use SIT to control mosquito populations.

[Long-term reduction of populations of _Aedes aegypti_ has been difficult and largely unsuccessful. The drone dispersal apparently overcomes the difficulty of ground-based releases. This approach should make possible repeated release of sterile male mosquitoes to significantly reduce population of this vector mosquito. The results of these efforts will be very interesting to watch over time. - Mod.TY]

Taking CRISPR technology further
CRISPR techniques are allowing the development of technologies for nucleic acid detection (see the Perspective by Chertow). Taking advantages of the distinctive enzymatic properties of CRISPR enzymes, Gootenberg et al. developed an improved nucleic acid detection technology for multiplexed quantitative and highly sensitive detection, combined with lateral flow for visual readout. Myhrvold et al. added a sample preparation protocol to create a field-deployable viral diagnostic platform for rapid detection of specific strains of pathogens in clinical samples. Cas12a (also known as Cpf1), a type V CRISPR protein, cleaves double-stranded DNA and has been adapted for genome editing. Chen et al. discovered that Cas12a also processes single-stranded DNA threading activity. A technology platform based on this activity detected human papillomavirus in patient samples with high sensitivity.

Abstract
Mitigating global infectious disease requires diagnostic tools that are sensitive, specific, and rapidly field deployable. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cas13-based SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) platform can detect Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) in patient samples at concentrations as low as 1 copy per microliter. We developed HUDSON (heating unextracted diagnostic samples to obliterate nucleases), a protocol that pairs with SHERLOCK for viral detection directly from bodily fluids, enabling instrument-free DENV detection directly from patient samples in less than 2 hours. We further demonstrate that SHERLOCK can distinguish the 4 DENV serotypes, as well as region-specific strains of ZIKV from the 2015-2016 pandemic. Finally, we report the rapid (less than1 week) design and testing of instrument-free assays to detect clinically relevant viral single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

[Development and deployment of a rapid, field-deployable test that is sensitive enough to differentiate between the 4 dengue serotype viruses and those viruses from Zika virus will be a major contribution to diagnosis and surveillance of virus infections. It will be particularly useful for diagnosis of Zika virus infection in pregnant women and in men who are at risk of sexually transmitting the virus to their partners. Current technology makes national Zika virus surveillance difficult and expensive. The result is that there has been a tendency to focus on pregnant women because of the risk of fetal damage. An example of this difficulty in a recent publication is Mexico that has only reported symptomatic cases that have been confirmed, using a polymerase chain reaction diagnostic test, within 5 days of symptom onset. The authors state that to estimate the magnitude of an epidemic, one needs to know not just the number of confirmed cases but also the number of suspected cases, the proportion of the suspected cases that are tested and the mean sensitivity of the test being used. The authors conclude by stating that a surveillance system based solely on confirmed cases is unlikely to capture the magnitude of an epidemic of Zika virus infection and needs to be supported by the routine collection and analysis of other data (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/96/5/17-201004.pdf).

Until a rapid, inexpensive, sensitive and specific laboratory test is available, perhaps the one reported above, achieving the goal of a laboratory-supported surveillance system that reliably captures and reports all instances of symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika infections will not be attained. - Mod.TY]

Highlights
- A highly sensitive and specific biosensor for the detection of ZIKV antibodies in blood and saliva.
- Monitoring ZIKV infections in endemic areas.
- Valuable tool both for monitoring the epidemiology of ZIKV at the level of the population as well as early diagnosis of ZIKV infection at individual levels.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) recently emerged as a global threat subsequent to its global spread because it induces microencephaly and other brain damages in infants born to infected mothers. Epidemiological monitoring of infection has been hampered by the absence of reliable serological tests capable to distinguish between ZIKV and other _Flavivirus_ infections, in particular dengue virus (DENV). As both viruses are transmitted by the same mosquito species, their distributions largely overlap and reliable serological distinction between the viruses is essential. Here we develop a novel biosensor which is based on recombinant forms of ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and the domain III of the envelope protein (EDIII). Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square wave voltammetry (SWV), we demonstrate that in addition to extremely sensitive detection of ZIKV-specific antibodies in serum and saliva, the biosensor promptly distinguished ZIKV and DENV-specific antibodies. Hence, this novel biosensor allows assessing ZIKV antibodies in blood and saliva and results are unaffected by presence of DENV virus-specific antibodies.

[A test that can differentiate Zika virus antibodies from antibodies to other flaviviruses would be a valuable tool for serological surveys and for diagnosis. It is not clear if this method is of low enough cost and technically uncomplicated enough to be established in the countries where Zika and the dengue viruses are circulating and can be operated by laboratory technicians without additional advanced training. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
During its most recent outbreak across the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) was surprisingly shown to cause fetal loss and congenital malformations in acutely and chronically infected pregnant women. However, understanding the underlying pathogenesis of ZIKV congenital disease has been hampered by a lack of relevant in vivo experimental models. Here we present a candidate New World monkey model of ZIKV infection in pregnant marmosets [_Callithrix jacchus_] that faithfully recapitulates human disease. ZIKV inoculation at the human-equivalent of early gestation caused an asymptomatic seroconversion, induction of type I/II interferon-associated genes and proinflammatory cytokines, and persistent viremia and viruria. Spontaneous pregnancy loss was observed 16-18 days post-infection, with extensive active placental viral replication and fetal neurocellular disorganization similar to that seen in humans. These findings underscore the key role of the placenta as a conduit for fetal infection, and demonstrate the utility of marmosets as a highly relevant model for studying congenital ZIKV disease and pregnancy loss.

Abstract
Background
Countries with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus have observed a notable rise in reported cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), with mounting evidence of a causal link between Zika virus infection and the neurological syndrome. However, the risk of GBS following a Zika virus infection is not well characterized. In this work, we used data from 11 locations with publicly available data to estimate the risk of GBS following an infection with Zika virus, as well as the location-specific incidence of infection and the number of suspect GBS cases reported per infection.

Methods
We built a mathematical inference framework utilizing data from 11 locations that had reported suspect Zika and GBS cases, 2 with completed outbreaks prior to 2015 (French Polynesia and Yap) and 9 others in the Americas covering partial outbreaks and where transmission was ongoing as of early 2017.

Results
We estimated that 2.0 (95 percent credible interval 0.5-4.5) reported GBS cases may occur per 10 000 Zika virus infections. The frequency of reported suspect Zika cases varied substantially and was highly uncertain, with a mean of 0.11 (95 percent credible interval 0.01-0.24) suspect cases reported per infection.

Conclusions
These estimates can help efforts to prepare for the GBS cases that may occur during Zika epidemics and highlight the need to better understand the relationship between infection and the reported incidence of clinical disease.
