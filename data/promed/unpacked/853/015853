3 more outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been confirmed in Taiwan. The outbreaks were of the H5N2 serotype and occurred in the western county of Yunlin.

There were 8894 cases in a susceptible population of 23 528 birds, including 2 goose farms and one chicken farm. All the affected birds died, and the remaining susceptible birds were destroyed as a precaution.

These farms have been put under movement restriction, and thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted after the stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within 3 km radius of the infected farms are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.
