Hepatitis A outbreak in the capital
-----------------------------------
Health authorities decreed the temporary closure of Dolores Bustillo School in Santa Isabel de Comayaguela community, because of an outbreak of hepatitis that has affected both students and teachers during the last few weeks.

15 children and one teacher are said to be affected, and they had to stay away from the school in order to receive full-time therapy and not transmit the disease to the remaining personnel in the school. [The decision to close the school] was taken after teachers in the aforementioned school reported both to Public Education and Public Health authorities that the disease was increasing its case toll, as every day 2 to 3 sick children are being sent back home.

Ms Ruth Pagoaga, Head of the Dolores Bustillo School, declared that they have reported 15 sick children and they will come back to school as soon as authorities permit its reopening. "We have 13 children and one teacher who got sick since last June [2012] and we definitively took the decision to close the school," declared Ms Pagoaga, because they were concerned about the health of the community. She pointed out that the children started developing fever and vomiting, and went to the toilet frequently and their urine changed colour, from dark yellow to brownish.

At the beginning, school authorities requested support from medical personnel from the Ramon Villeda-Morales health center, so that they could assess the problem. Subsequently when they became aware of the situation fumigation and other preventive measures were initiated. Health personnel also started visiting households of all the affected children in order to assess their condition. It was established that this was an outbreak of hepatitis A virus infection, but the primary focus of the outbreak has not yet been identified.

[Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis, which can be associated with high mortality. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route. This is when an uninfected person ingests food or water that has been contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. The virus can also be transmitted through close physical contact with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Hepatitis A is now a vaccine-preventable disease. The vaccine can be given as part of regular childhood immunizations programmes and can also be given with other vaccines. (Discussed in detail in the WHO Hepatitis A Fact Sheet at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html).

The preceding press report does not provide information concerning the suspected source of the hepatitis A virus outbreak at the Dolores Bustillo School, or the policy with regard to hepatitis A vaccination.
