Cases of _Plasmodium. vivax_ malaria in Virginia, US
----------------------------------------------------
In recent weeks, 2 Loudoun County teenagers contracted malaria locally, an
extremely rare occurrence that has prompted officials to launch a search
for infected mosquitoes and stricken residents, local and state health
officials said yesterday. Officials said a 15 year old boy and a 19 year
old woman, who had not travelled abroad and who live about a mile from each
other in suburban eastern Loudoun, were probably bitten and infected by
mosquitoes that had sipped blood from someone who contracted malaria overseas.
"The fact that you have a cluster of 2 cases among people who have not
travelled overseas is impressive, and it suggests there is a small malaria
outbreak in Loudoun County," said Peter Hotez, chairman of the Department
of Microbiology and Tropical Medicine at George Washington University.
Officials said they were heartened by the fact that the type of malaria
found in Loudoun, the vivax strain, is not deadly. The boy, a high school
student, was admitted to hospital, while the woman, a college student, was
treated and released. Both suffered high fevers, chills, fatigue, and
headaches. They were given antimalarial medication and are doing well,
officials said.
Infected mosquitoes spread malaria, which is caused by a parasite. Both
teenagers reported being bitten multiple times. The appearance of malaria
has concerned many residents, especially at the end of a summer during
which the Washington area has been worried about another mosquitoborne
illness, the West Nile virus. "This is sort of fuel on a fire," said
Richard Steketee, the chief of the malaria epidemiology branch at the
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But Steketee said
the 2 phenomena are distinct. "It's linked in the context that it's a
mosquito-borne illness. But for the most part, the mosquitoes that are
transmitting West Nile are a different group of mosquitoes" from those
transmitting malaria, he said.
Denise Coffey Sockwell, the Northern Virginia epidemiologist for the
Virginia Department of Health, said she contacted health authorities in
Maryland, the District, and other Northern Virginia jurisdictions, and none
but Loudoun reported any cases of locally contracted malaria. State and
county health authorities do not consider either Loudoun case to be one of
"airport malaria," in which the disease is spread by mosquitoes carried on
aircraft from places where malaria is endemic. The malaria-carrying
anopheline mosquito normally has a range of less than a mile, and both
victims live in areas that are about 7 miles from Dulles International Airport.
David Goodfriend, the Loudoun County health director, said officials put up
extra mosquito traps in and around the Cascades and Sugarland Run
neighborhoods where the 2 students live to supplement those put up as part
of the fight against the West Nile virus. Additional measures to kill
mosquito larvae are also being implemented, Goodfriend said, and the county
is considering spraying pesticide to kill adult mosquitoes. "There may be a
risk in that area," he said. But he noted that the common precautions that
have been the county's mantra all year should keep people safe, including
calls to wear long sleeves and insect repellent when outside.
From 1957 to 2001, there were 85 recorded cases of locally transmitted
malaria in the United States, Steketee said, 9 of which occurred since
1995. Among those infected were a 63 year old Virginia woman and a 19 year
old New Jersey man in 1998, Steketee noted. More than 1500 cases of malaria
are reported in the United States every year in people who have travelled
overseas, he said. In most cases, the source of a local malaria
transmission is never found. Researchers say that's because the carriers
either return overseas or do not know they have malaria. Carriers who have
developed a resistance to infection can still pass the disease on when
mosquitoes bite. Virginia state epidemiologist John Marr said area
residents should remember that it is rare, but not unprecedented, to have
local malaria transmissions. The fact that the malaria in Loudoun is not
the life-threatening falciparum strain is also a blessing. "Fortunately,
this is a very benign malaria," he said. "It's a curiosity more than a
public health concern."

[ProMED-mail has recorded 2 similar US cases, one in Georgia in 1997 and
one also in Virginia in 1998. The report suggests that airport malaria
should be ruled out, but mosquitoes can also ride in cars and the cases are
only 7 miles from Dulles International Airport. Travellers from _Plasmodium
vivax_-endemic countries may carry gametocytes in their blood for weeks and
if immune may be completely asymptomatic. The local mosquitoes have the
capacity for transmission and it is almost impossible to avoid such cases
during a warm summer. The cases act as a reminder that a malaria blood film
should be taken from patients with unexplained fever, even without a travel
history. Â­ Mod.EP]
