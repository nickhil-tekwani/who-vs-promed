A fresh case of Legionnaire's disease has been identified. The latest case in Renfrew [Scotland] brings the total number of people infected with the potentially fatal disease to 6.

Health officials continue to search for a source of the outbreak, which began last month [June 2013]. They have treated all cooling towers within 4 miles of patients' homes with chemicals to kill any _Legionella_ bacteria as a precaution.

Legionnaires' disease is contracted from inhaling infected water droplets, usually from water-cooling towers, air conditioning systems and showers.

The latest person to have contracted the disease is said to have a mild form of the illness and has been responding well to treatment at home. The previously reported 5 cases have now all recovered and been discharged from hospital.

Dr Gillian Penrice, NHS [National Health Service] Greater Glasgow and Clyde Consultant in Public Health, said: "Given the 2-week incubation period of the disease, it was always a possibility [that] some further cases might be identified. I am pleased, however, that this individual has a mild form of the disease and is responding well to treatment at home. All the cases have had some connection to the Renfrew area and investigations into a possible source are ongoing in partnership with the Health and Safety Executive, Health Protection Scotland, Renfrewshire Council and other local authorities."
