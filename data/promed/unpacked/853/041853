The outbreak of leishmaniasis that has affected the southern municipalities (of Madrid) has not decreased in 2012, with 150 cases reported.

According to the "Report on the Health Status of the Population of Madrid, 2012," the outbreak of leishmaniasis is not over, as evidenced by the 150 cases detected last year [2012], including nearly 500 cases which have emerged in the last 3 years. These cases have occurred in southern municipalities of the region, such as Fuenlabrada, Leganes, Getafe or Humanes, near the green zones of Bosquesur.

Leishmaniasis is spread by the bite of an insect (a _Phlebotominae_ female sand fly that has previously bitten an infected animal) and can lead to death if the visceral disease occurs and if it is left untreated.

The strong increase occurred from 2009, with 471 cases, compared to 15 or 25 that had been reported in previous years. The cases have been found in municipalities in southern Madrid, such as Fuenlabrada with 322 cases, Leganes with 37, Getafe with 20 affected, and Humanes, which had 5 patients. All of them were near the green area of Bosquesur, which officials believe may be the focus of leishmaniasis.

This disease is transmitted by a sandfly that has previously bitten an infected animal. It is believed that hares and rabbits, which proliferate in Bosquesur, can act as reservoirs or carriers of the parasite.

Leishmaniasis causes 2 types of disease: cutaneous, and visceral, which can affect organs such as the spleen and liver and is fatal if not treated properly.

Last year [2012], the community declared Fuenlabrada an "Emergency Area," allowing the free hunting of rabbits to try to control the extent of the problem. The Ministry of Health said that by the end of 2012, there were 3 cases of visceral leishmaniasis, while in 2011, there had been 47, which was good progress. Still, the outbreak is not considered to be over. So far this year [2013], there have been 3 new cases.

[Dogs are considered the main reservoir of Leishmania in Spain (M.G. et al. Current situation of _Leishmania infantum_ infection in shelter dogs in northern Spain. Parasit. Vectors. 2012;5:60). It has been hypothesized that rabbits, hares, and squirrels may also be hosts, but this remains to be demonstrated. - Mod.EP
