The food safety investigation into a case of bovine tuberculosis that was found in an Alberta cow now extends into Saskatchewan. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says 2 farms in Saskatchewan - but just 1 infected herd [in Alberta. - Mod.MHJ] - are under quarantine along with 30 farms in south eastern Alberta.

Chad MacPherson, spokesman for the Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association, says it's not a new instance of the contagious bacterial disease. He says a ranch in Saskatchewan's south west was placed under quarantine based on a trace-out from the farm in Alberta where the infected cow was from.

Last week, the CFIA warned that more ranches could be placed under quarantine and suggested the process of testing cattle and tracing where the animals have lived is expected to take months.
