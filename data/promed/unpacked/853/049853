The risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during air travel is lower than from an office building, classroom, supermarket, or commuter train.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is emitted when someone talks, coughs, sneezes, or sings, mainly in droplets that can be propelled a short distance, and sometimes in smaller aerosol particles that can remain suspended and travel further. Another person can be infected if these particles reach their mouth or nose, directly or via hands. Transmission via surface contact is also important in some cases.

How Clean Is the Air in Passenger Aircraft?
Air enters the cabin from overhead inlets and flows downwards toward floor-level outlets. Air enters and leaves the cabin at the same seat row or nearby rows. There is relatively little airflow forward and backward between rows, making it less likely to spread respiratory particles between rows.

The airflow in current jet airliners is much faster than normal indoor buildings. Half of it is fresh air from outside, the other half is recycled through HEPA filters of the same type used in operating rooms. Any remaining risk to be managed is from contact with other passengers who might be infectious. Seat backs provide a partial physical barrier, and most people remain relatively still, with little face-to-face contact.

Despite substantial numbers of travelers, the number of suspected and confirmed cases of in-flight COVID-19 transmission between passengers around the world appears small (approximately 42 in total). In comparison, a study of COVID-19 transmission aboard high-speed trains in China among contacts of more than 2300 known cases showed an overall rate of 0.3% among all passengers. Onboard risk can be further reduced with face coverings, as in other settings where physical distancing cannot be maintained.

Risk Reduction Steps by Airports and Airlines
Steps being taken at airports and on board can include temperature testing and/or asking about symptoms (fever, loss of sense of smell, chills, cough, shortness of breath); enhanced cleaning and disinfection; contactless boarding/baggage processing; use of physical barriers and sanitization in airports; physical distancing in airports and during boarding; use of face coverings or masks; separation between passengers on board when feasible; adjustment of food and beverage service to reduce contact; control of access to aisles and bathrooms to minimize contact; limiting exposure of crew members to infection; and facilitation of contact tracing in the event that a passenger develops infection. Additional steps being studied are preflight testing for COVID-19 and adjustments to quarantine requirements.

Steps Passengers Can Take
Wear a mask, don't travel if you feel unwell, and limit carry-on baggage. Keep distance from others wherever possible; report to staff if someone is clearly unwell. If there is an overhead air nozzle, adjust it to point straight at your head and keep it on full. Stay seated if possible and follow crew instructions. Wash or sanitize hands frequently and avoid touching your face.

A study of more than a half-million people in India who were exposed to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the virus' continued spread is driven by only a small percentage of those who become infected.

Furthermore, children and young adults were found to be potentially much more important to transmitting the virus -- especially within households -- than previous studies have identified, according to a paper by researchers from the USA and India published 30 Sep 2020 in the journal Science.

Researchers from the Princeton Environmental Institute (PEI), Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, Berkeley worked with public health officials in the southeast Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to track the infection pathways and mortality rate of 575 071 individuals who were exposed to 84 965 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is the largest contact tracing study -- which is the process of identifying people who came into contact with an infected person -- conducted in the world for any disease.

Lead researcher Ramanan Laxminarayan, a senior research scholar in PEI, said that the paper is the 1st large study to capture the extraordinary extent to which SARS-CoV-2 hinges on "superspreading," in which a small percentage of the infected population passes the virus on to more people. The researchers found that 71% of infected individuals did not infect any of their contacts, while a mere 8% of infected individuals accounted for 60% of new infections.

"Our study presents the largest empirical demonstration of superspreading that we are aware of in any infectious disease," Laxminarayan said. "Superspreading events are the rule rather than the exception when one is looking at the spread of COVID-19, both in India and likely in all affected places."

The findings provide extensive insight into the spread and deadliness of COVID-19 in countries such as India -- which has experienced more than 96 000 deaths from the disease -- that have a high incidence of resource-limited populations, the researchers reported. They found that coronavirus-related deaths in India occurred, on average, 6 days after hospitalization compared with an average of 13 days in the USA. Also, deaths from coronavirus in India have been concentrated among people aged 50-64, which is slightly younger than the 60-plus at-risk population in the USA.

The researchers also reported, however, the 1st large-scale evidence that the implementation of a countrywide shutdown in India led to substantial reductions in coronavirus transmission.

The researchers found that the chances of a person with coronavirus, regardless of their age, passing it on to a close contact ranged from 2.6% in the community to 9% in the household. The researchers found that children and young adults -- who made up 1/3rd of COVID cases -- were especially key to transmitting the virus in the studied populations.

"Kids are very efficient transmitters in this setting, which is something that hasn't been firmly established in previous studies," Laxminarayan said. "We found that reported cases and deaths have been more concentrated in younger cohorts than we expected based on observations in higher-income countries."

Children and young adults were much more likely to contract coronavirus from people their own age, the study found. Across all age-groups, people had a greater chance of catching the coronavirus from someone their own age. The overall probability of catching coronavirus ranged from 4.7% for low-risk contacts up to 10.7% for high-risk contacts.

The study, "Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian states," was published 30 Sep 2020 by the journal Science. The work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Abstract
--------
Although most COVID-19 cases have occurred in low-resource countries, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease in such contexts. Data from the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh provide a detailed view into SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways and mortality in a high-incidence setting. Reported cases and deaths have been concentrated in younger cohorts than expected from observations in higher-income countries, even after accounting for demographic differences across settings. Among 575 071 individuals exposed to 84 965 confirmed cases, infection probabilities ranged from 4.7%-10.7% for low-risk and high-risk contact types. Same-age contacts were associated with the greatest infection risk. Case-fatality ratios spanned 0.05% at ages 5-17 years to 16.6% at ages 85+ years. Primary data are urgently needed from low-resource countries to guide control measures.

[3] Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak after Nasal Swab Testing for Coronavirus Disease 2019
Date: Thu 1 Oct 2020

In March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a global pandemic. Testing for presence of active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is one pillar of the global response. In particular, nasopharyngeal, anterior nasal, and midturbinate swabs are 3 of the 5 methods for initial diagnostic specimen collection recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, complications associated with nasal swab testing are not well characterized. We describe the 1st case of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak after nasal testing for COVID-19, to our knowledge.

Report of a Case
A woman in her 40s presented with unilateral rhinorrhea, metallic taste, headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia. The patient had recently completed nasal COVID-19 testing for an elective hernia repair. Shortly after, she developed unilateral rhinorrhea, headache, and vomiting. The patient's medical history was notable for idiopathic intracranial hypertension and removal of nasal polyps over 20 years before presentation. Physical examination revealed clear rhinorrhea from the right side. Flexible nasopharyngoscopy revealed a mass in the right anterior middle meatus but did not identify the source of the fluid. The nasal drainage tested positive for B2-transferrin. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a 1.8-cm encephalocele extending through the right ethmoid fovea into the middle meatus and a right sphenoid wing pseudomeningocele. Comparing these images to findings on CT performed in 2017 revealed that the encephalocele dated at least to that time (Figure 1). The 2017 CT diagnosis was paranasal sinus disease but not an encephalocele. The patient was admitted to the hospital for endoscopic surgical repair. At the beginning of the procedure, intrathecal fluorescein was infused through a lumbar drain. An encephalocele was identified in the right anterior ethmoid cavity (Figure 2). After reduction of the encephalocele, a skull base defect in the fovea ethmoidalis was repaired with a combination of acellular human dermal matrix and a poly(D,L-lactic) acid. The patient was admitted postoperatively for neurological monitoring and lumbar drain management.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an iatrogenic CSF leak after a nasal swab for COVID-19. Of prior reported iatrogenic CSF leaks from intranasal procedures, surgical trauma at the cribriform plate is the culprit in CSF leaks 8% to 58% of the time. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a risk factor for meningocele formation, and this patient had an undiagnosed skull base defect at the fovea ethmoidalis that was present on imaging dating back to 2017. We, therefore, theorize that the swab itself did not result in a violation of the bony skull base, but rather the invasive test caused trauma to the patient's preexisting encephalocele.

Capacity for COVID-19 testing is increasing in the US, with plans to ramp up to as many as 6 million tests per day by the end of 2020. Although it is now routine in the US to rule out COVID-19 prior to elective surgeries, for many hospital admissions, and for symptomatic individuals, additional testing may help contain the spread of COVID-19. As the number of daily COVID-19 nasal and nasopharyngeal swab specimen collection procedures increases, a greater burden is placed on the health care system to properly train clinicians and even the general public to safely perform nasal and nasopharyngeal swab testing. High-quality instruction on how to properly obtain an adequate nasopharyngeal specimen for testing is available. However, adverse events may still occur owing to complex and delicate anatomy. Such complications have not been well described in the existing literature.

This case of iatrogenic CSF leak from nasal swab testing for COVID-19 illustrates that prior surgical intervention, or pathology that distorts normal nasal anatomy, may increase the risk of adverse events associated with nasal testing for respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19. One should consider alternative methods to nasal screening in patients with known prior skull base defects, history of sinus or skull base surgery, or predisposing conditions to skull base erosion.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (74 479), followed by the USA (48 925) and Brazil (24 602) -- account for over half (54.3%) of all confirmed cases globally and 48.7% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, having gone down from 50.4% yesterday (2 Oct 2020). As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 4795 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (2-3 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include India, USA, Brazil, France (16 972), Argentina (11 129), Russia (9859), UK (7070), Colombia (6616) and Israel (5523). A total of 37 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 13 of the 37 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, and 9 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease in case counts by 0.17%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 1.05%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India, and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and elsewhere in the Americas, with global daily new cases around or over 300 000. - Mod.UBA]
