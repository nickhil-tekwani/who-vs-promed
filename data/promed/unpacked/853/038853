Bangladesh: unknown disease across national borders
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of an unknown severe disease was reported in a remote
village less than 20 km. (12.5 miles) from the border with India. At
the same time a similar disease was causing deaths on the Indian side
of the border. At the request of the Bangladesh Ministry of Health,
WHO (World Health Organization) mobilized the Global Outbreak Alert
and Response Network and an international team was dispatched.

[On 12 Apr 2007, ProMED-mail posted a report on undiagnosed
encephalitis-related deaths in Kushtia, Bangladesh (see Undiagnosed
deaths, encephalitis - Bangladesh (Kushtia): RFI 20070412.1221). At
that time, this moderator reflected on the similarities of
description of the outbreak and response of the population (panic) in
the affected areas as those seen with the earlier outbreaks of
henipavirus reported from this area. Kushtia district borders with India.
The report above is a bit of an enigma as it is not dated, there is
no mention of which districts in Bangladesh or in neighboring India
are involved, nor does it mention any symptomatology. But, given the
earlier reports of the undiagnosed deaths in Bangladesh, one can't
help but wonder if this report is related to that event. More
information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
