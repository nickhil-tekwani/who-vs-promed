Mekong Delta crops hit by rice diseases
---------------------------------------
Nearly 10 percent of winter-spring crops in the Cuu Long (Mekong)
Delta suffered from rice diseases, said Nguyen Quang Minh, director
of the Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry's Plant Protection
Department. He told Viet Nam News yesterday [30 Jan 2008] that more
than 91 000 ha (hectares) (224 866 acres) of crops were attacked by
brown planthoppers, small insects causing yellow and stunt rice
diseases, an increase of almost 21 000 ha (51 892 acres) over last
January [2007].

The worst hit provinces were Hau Giang, Vinh Long, Bac Lieu, Soc
Trang, and Long An with an insect density of 750-3000 insects per sq
m. The density was as bad as 6000-8000 insects per sq m in some areas,
said Minh. The department forecast that brown planthoppers would
quickly spread out during Tet [festival], from 5-11 Feb 2008, when the
crops would be at the most important period of development.

Incidents of rice blast disease also increased this year [2008],
affecting around 50 000 ha (123 553 acres) of crops, said Minh. Rice
blast disease is a disease caused by fungus, which results in yellow
spots on leaves, reduces the process of photosynthesis, and affects
yields.

The department has asked provincial-level agriculture and rural
development departments and plant protection centres in southern
provinces to tighten supervision over rice diseases and instruct
farmers how to protect their crops. The Cuu Long Delta has a total of
1.6 million ha (3.954 million acres) of crops.

[The Asian brown planthopper (_Nilaparvata lugens_) is one of the
worst pests of rice in the Australasian and Pacific Island region and
is also the vector of _Rice grassy stunt virus_ and _Rice ragged
stunt virus_. A number of other rice viruses are spread by different
species of plant- or leafhoppers, including _Rice yellow stunt
virus_. These and other rice viruses are present in the area and it
is not clear which particular virus species are involved in the
present epidemic. In tropical regions, levels of virus infection and
vector density may be very high. Crop losses of up to 100 percent due
to some virus diseases have been reported. Generally for these
viruses, disease management includes vector control, cultural
practices to minimise inoculum, and the use of rice varieties
resistant to the vector, the virus, or both. Cultivars resistant to
the vectors have usually low virus disease incidence.

Planthoppers also cause wounds on the leaf surfaces (by feeding or
oviposition) exposing the plant to fungal and bacterial infections.
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia oryzae_, _P. grisea_). It is one of the most destructive
diseases of rice worldwide with reported losses of more than 50
percent in infected fields. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of
the shoot, stem rot, and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all
plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When
infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are
often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges
can be affected by different strains of the fungus, but most strains
isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.
Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is spread by infected plant debris,
mechanical means, water, and wind. Disease management may include
fungicides and cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant
varieties. However the fungus is highly variable and new strains are
emerging breaking down host resistance.

Serious problems due to diseases and insect pests of rice have been
reported from this area recently. Collaborative projects with
international scientific organisations have been established to
combat these problems and increase food security (see ProMED-mail
20080118.0221).
