[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 346 566 with 81 740 (6.1%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 264 826 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 213 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 72 825 cases when compared with the data on 5 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 30 174 (41.4%), Italy for 4316 (6.0), France for 5171 (7.1%), Spain for 5029 (6.9%), the UK 3802 (7.1%), Germany for 3252 (4.5%) and Turkey 3148 (4.3%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 93.9% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 29.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 74 697deaths have been reported, 71 366 (95.5%) outside mainland China.

Italy, Spain, and Germany are showing trends for decreasing daily newly confirmed cases, as are Belgium, Switzerland... it is early and bears watching further. Musing out loud, one can't help but wonder if in addition to the impact of social distancing and lockdowns, perhaps there is a seasonality beginning to show. Time will tell.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2 and Italy is number 3. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Turkey has been accelerating. Turkey illustrates how rapidly things can increase: the 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 24 days the country has confirmed 30 217 cases; it now ranks number 9 out of 213 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[3] COVID-19 and economic and health security
Date: Fri 3 Apr 2020
Source: The Telegraph [edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/protecting-healthandlivelihoods-go-hand-in-hand-cannot-save/


As the world responds to COVID-19, country after country is faced with the need to contain the spread of the virus at the cost of bringing its society and economy to a standstill. At face value there is a trade-off to make: either save lives or save livelihoods. This is a false dilemma -- getting the virus under control is, if anything, a prerequisite to saving livelihoods.

This is what brings the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) so closely together -- the WHO is there to protect the health of people and well-placed to advise on health priorities; the IMF exists to protect the health of the world economy -- it advises on economic priorities, and also helps provide financing.

Our joint appeal to policymakers, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, is to recognise that protecting public health and putting people back to work go hand-in-hand.

The WHO is on the front line of this crisis by the virtue of its mandate, but so is the IMF. In the short time since COVID-19 started spreading across the world, the demand for IMF financing has skyrocketed. Never in the 75-year history of the institution have so many countries -- 85 so far -- found themselves in need of IMF emergency financing. And this financing is being made available in record short time, with the 1st projects already being approved and money disbursed to provide much needed assistance to shield countries against dramatic increase in financial needs at a time of sudden drop in economic activities and in revenues.

As financing to support severely constrained public budgets reaches the countries in need, our joint plea is to place health expenditures at the top of the priority list. Paying salaries to doctors and nurses, supporting hospitals and emergency rooms, establishing make-shift field clinics, buying protective gear and essential medical equipment, carrying out public awareness campaigns about simple measures like hand washing -- these are critical investments to protect people against the pandemic.

In far too many places health systems are unprepared for an onslaught of COVID-19 patients and it is paramount to give them a boost. And this can and must go together with support for economy-wide priorities required to reduce unemployment, minimise bankruptcies and, over time, ensure recovery. They come in addition to -- not as a substitute for -- health spending, and aim to provide targeted support to most-affected households and firms, including cash transfers, wage subsidies, and short-time work, strengthening unemployment benefits and social safety nets, and limiting the rise in borrowing costs.

We recognise how difficult it is to strike the right balance. Economic activity is plummeting as infections and measures to combat the pandemic affect workers, firms, and supply chains, job losses, and uncertainty drag down spending, financial conditions sharply tighten, and the oil price collapse hits commodity exporters -- all with cross-border spillovers. In countries with large informal economies families depend on daily wages to survive. Highly congested urban slums make social distancing impossible.

We are convinced, however, that emergency financing can only help if countries strike this balance. The WHO can help in vital areas for coordination such as ensuring the production and delivery of medical supplies to those in need, in an effective, efficient, and equitable manner -- by facilitating advance purchase agreements, for example. The WHO is also working with suppliers of personal protective equipment for health workers to ensure that supply chains are functioning. And this is an area where collaboration with other international organisations can be so effective -- for example, the World Bank's capacity to aggregate demand to purchase medical supplies in bulk.

The IMF for its part aims to help by doubling its emergency response capacity from USD 50 billion up to USD 100 billion -- making it possible for countries to get twice as much money from the Fund as had been made available during emergencies. Its total lending capacity of USD 1 trillion is now secured thanks to decisive actions of its membership. The Fund is also increasing its capacity to ease debt service obligations of its poorest members through the Catastrophe Containment Relief Trust for which generous donors are providing grant resources. And together with the World Bank it is advocating for a standstill of debt service from the poorest countries to official bilateral creditors for as long as the world economy is paralysed by the pandemic.

The course of the global health crisis and the fate of the global economy are inseparably intertwined. Fighting the pandemic is a necessity for the economy to rebound. That is why the WHO and IMF are cooperating closely with one another, and with other international organisations, to help address countries' priority needs.

As we all work together, with little time and finite resources, it is essential that we focus on the right priorities to save lives and livelihoods. Our joint appeal is that in one of humanity's darkest hours, leaders must step up right now for people living in emerging markets.

[As countries (low income, middle income, and high income) are starting to make plans for lifting the lockdown/stay at home mandates, many perhaps prematurely, the OpEd piece above should be required reading for the policy makers. Premature relaxation of containment strategies for economic reasons may actually be more costly than continuing the containment measures longer until the risk of increasing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has significantly passed. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- One new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours: South Sudan.

- At a joint press conference and in a co-authored opinion piece [see [3] above], the WHO Director-General and IMF Managing Director reiterated the importance of saving lives and saving livelihoods and made it clear that the trade-off between saving lives or jobs is a false dilemma. The press conference remarks are available at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19--3-april-2020.

- Almost 90 per cent of the world's students are now affected by nationwide school closures -- that's more than 1.5 billion children and young people. Together with UNICEF and the International Publishers Association, the World Health Organization has launched the 'Read the World' children's reading initiative. More information on this initiative can be found at https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/02-04-2020-ipa-who-and-unicef-launch-read-the-world-on-international-children-s-book-day-to-support-children-and-young-people-in-isolation. WHO has also published advice for parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic, available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/healthy-parenting.

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [10:00 AM 6 Apr 2020], available at the source URL above.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 20. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 53 countries (including 18 territories) from the Americas region, and 46 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 36 878 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 90.9% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil (3.3%) and Canada (2.6%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 36.3% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 28.7%, and Chile at 9.2%

The European region seems to be slowing down, having confirmed 33 932 (44.0% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 3063 (63.7%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, down from 38 266 new cases and 4082 new deaths from yesterday's update. Spain accounted for 17.8% of newly confirmed cases, the UK for 17.4% of newly confirmed cases, Italy for 12.7% of newly confirmed cases, Germany for 10.8% of newly confirmed cases, and Turkey for 9.2% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 5 countries accounting for 67.9 % of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 2483 new cases representing 61.2% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar, represent 9.8%, 7.3%, and 6.6% respectively. Removing Iran from the denominator, Pakistan represents 25.3% of newly reported cases, followed by UAE at 18.7%, and Qatar at 17.8%.

In the African region, South Africa reported 35.4% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Mauritius with 15.7% and Kenya at 10.1%. Note that 27 (58.7% of reporting countries in the African region) countries/territories reported 0 new cases in today's update suggesting incomplete data due to the lower weekend reporting.

In the Western Pacific region, Japan reported 36.4% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Malaysia reported 17.0% of the newly confirmed cases, followed by the Philippines at 14.5%.

In South East Asia, India reported 68.5% of newly confirmed cases, followed by Indonesia at 17.9% and Thailand at 10.1% of newly reported cases.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [6 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve seems to show Europe plateauing and even possibly decreasing, but the Americas are adding to the overall height of the curve on a daily basis. The 24-hour newly reported case total for the European region was 33 932 today (6 Apr 2020), compared with 36 878 for the Americas region, the 1st time the Americas have reported more cases than Europe.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 3 weeks I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
