The capital of Madagascar, Antananarivo, has been hit by an outbreak
of the new pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus. The 1st case was
confirmed by the National Influenza Center (NIC) at the Institut
Pasteur from Madagascar on 12 Aug 2009. From that date only sporadic
cases (16) were confirmed until 9 Oct 2009. All these cases had a
history of travel from a country where community transmission has been
demonstrated.

During this period, in order to contain the spread of the virus within
the community, the Department of Emergencies of the Ministry of Health
[instituted] a national containment plan. The guidelines are isolation
of confirmed cases, disinfection, and treatment with Tamiflu
[oseltamivir] of all confirmed cases as well as their contacts.

The situation changed on 9 Oct 2009 when a large outbreak occurred in
one of the biggest schools in Antananarivo (Lycee Francais de
Tananarive). This school accommodates more than 1500 students
including 200 boarders. Since that 1st outbreak, the pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus has spread within the capital despite the efforts of the
health authorities to contain the outbreak. As of 12 Nov 2009, the NIC
has tested more than 1500 specimens and confirmed 581 cases. The
majority of confirmed cases are located in the capital and suburbs,
but recent cases (13) have been confirmed in large cities like
Antsiranana (North), Toamasina (East Coast), Mahajanga (West Coast)
and Taolagnaro (South), and in a small village (Ambohimandroso).

Due to limited resources, the strategy at present is to test as a
priority specimens from sentinel sites that cover 19 (out of 111)
health districts in all Madagascar in order to measure the spread of
the virus through the country. Hospitalized cases or patients at risk
are also tested as a priority.
