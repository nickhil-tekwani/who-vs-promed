[African swine fever (ASF) continues its spread in Russia; the
Stavropolskiy Kray (Stavropol) is the 5th main Russian administrative
division affected, following Chechnya, North Ossetia-Alania, Orenburg
(wildlife) and Ingushetia. The total number of outbreaks reported by
Russia since the start of this epizootic on 5 Nov 2007 has reached 21.
A summary, including a map with all outbreaks as of 24 Oct 2008, is
available on-line at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6546>
(zoom-in).

The report includes the following epidemiological comments: "Wild boar
move freely across the subalpine grassland along the Argoun and the
Shatoy-Argoun rivers, which run 30 to 40 km on Georgian territory.
Stepped-up biosecurity measures are applied in the pig farms."

This Follow-up report No 6 states, under Measures to be applied,
"Stamping out". This is a justifiable measure in view of the fact that
ASF cannot be controlled by vaccination (no vaccine available).
However, the figures pertaining to the 2 outbreaks described include
900 susceptible animals, of which 161 were clinically affected (127 of
them died), while none were destroyed nor slaughtered. Have the
authorities changed their policy into stamping out in the future? -
