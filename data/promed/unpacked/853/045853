I have been surprised with the numerous suggestions of Reye's syndrome as
the explanation for the 2 cases of encephalopathy in DR Congo. The
suggestion is based on the combination of encephalopathy with aspirin
intake reported for the cases and their association reported in the
literature.
Aspirin intake is, however, not a rare event; I guess that 90% of cases of
encephalopathy of any cause in DR Congo would have had aspirin in their
past few days history. Therefore, Reye's syndrome is not more likely than
any other cause of encephalopathy. In addition, should aspirin not have
been taken, Reye's syndrome would still remain one of the options.
It is interesting to see that physicians only suggest one not very likely
diagnosis, while a computer aid (like GIDEON in previous mail) reminds us
that the presentation of the patients is non-specific and suggests many
more alternative diagnoses: hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg,
Crimean-Congo), yellow fever, bacterial septicemia, malaria, anthrax and
shigellosis.
