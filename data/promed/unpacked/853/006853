Patients [among the refugees from Central Africa who were diagnosed in
Quebec Province included [persons exhibiting infection with _P.
falciparum_, _P. vivax_ and one mixed _P. falciparum/ovale_ infection. Risk
of transmission in Canada is very low, although not zero. _A.
quadrimaculatis_ can be found in southern Ontario, up the Ottawa Valley
(where malaria was seasonal in the 19th century), up the St. Lawrence River
past Montreal and into the Canadian Prairies.
