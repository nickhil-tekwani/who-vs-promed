Scrub typhus spreads in southern Georgia
Akhaltsikhe (southern Georgia), 26 November: A serious outbreak of scrub
typhus, an acute infectious skin disease, has been recorded in the
Samtskhe-Javakheti province, a Prime-News correspondent reported from
Akhaltsikhe. The disease is mainly spread among schoolchildren and
students. An official of the public health care authority, Inga
Diakonishvili, told Prime-News that a shortage of vaccines and
disinfectants [is] making it difficult to take effective measures against
the spread of the disease.

[Scrub typhus, aka mite-borne typhus & tsutsugamushi disease, is caused by
a rickettsia, _R. tsutsugamushi_ (_R. orientalis_) transmitted by larval
trombiculid mites which normally feed on wildlife. It often has a high
fatality rate, & since no deaths are mentioned this outbreak seems more
likely to be flea-borne typhus, caused by a different strain of rickettsia
transmitted by rat fleas, but showing similar symptoms, and with a rather
low fatality rate. There is also a third type, louse-borne typhus,
transmitted by the human body louse, with an intermediate fatality rate.
Since vaccines are mentioned, the outbreak is likely to be due to one of
the latter types, for which vaccines exist, since there is no vaccine
against scrub typhus. - Mod.JW]
