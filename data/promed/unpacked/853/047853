Vietnam: childhood death toll doubles to reach 38
-------------------------------------------------
A still unidentified sickness has killed 38 children and left more than 60
others ill in 17 Vietnamese provinces in the past 3 months,
state-controlled media reported yesterday. The disease is suspected to be
[caused by an] enterovirus, the Lao Dong (Labour) trade union newspaper
quoted the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City as saying. It is believed
to attack the intestines and the brain. Officials said it did not appear to
be _Human enterovirus 71_, which killed 30 children in Malaysia in 1997 and
more than 50 children in Taiwan in 1998 [and is currently responsible for
an extensive outbreak in Sarawak. - Mod.CP].
Doctors and medical experts, along with the World Health Organization
(WHO), completed an epidemiology survey in Ho Chi Minh City on 15 Apr 2003.
They did not classify the illness as an outbreak because the cases did not
appear to be linked and were scattered throughout many provinces, the
newspaper said. All the children who succumbed to the disease experienced
high fever and convulsion. Nearly 70 per cent of them died within a day of
becoming sick.
Mr Nguyen Van Thuong, vice-minister of health, told health institutes to
work closely to carry out a more thorough study of the disease and to work
out a uniform diagnosis and treatment method for all hospitals.

[Although, according to this report, the disease has been present in
Vietnam since the beginning of 2003, the childhood death toll has doubled
since the one given in a previous report from a different source dated 23
Apr 2003. If human enterovirus 71 infection has indeed been excluded, a
statement of the evidence for involvement of a different enterovirus would
be welcomed. The rapidity of death following the onset of illness is a
matter of concern. - Mod.CP]
