Citation: Siva N: Hunt begins for the cause of acute hepatitis cases. Lancet Vol 399 May 7, 2022 DOI: doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00818-2

As of [21 Apr 2022], 169 children have been reported to have severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology worldwide, most of whom are in the UK as well as in the EU, the USA, Israel, Japan, Canada, Indonesia, and Singapore. As of [25 Apr 2022], the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has recorded 145 cases in the UK; 10 children have received a liver transplant and none have died. There are reports that 3 children have died in Indonesia and there is 1 suspected death, still being investigated, in Wisconsin, USA. [All these numbers are now larger as can be seen in recent ProMED updates. - Mod.LL]

The UKHSA is leading several studies into the cause. Testing has excluded viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E, as well as other known causes of acute hepatitis. "We do see children with severe hepatitis [non A-E hepatitis], for which we find no cause every year", Deirdre Kelly, Professor of Paediatric Hepatology, University of Birmingham (UK), told The Lancet. "And there's often a peak in the spring, which we are in now...But obviously, there's a far greater number [now] than we normally see... It's a real phenomenon."

Detailed epidemiological and laboratory investigations are underway, but recent reports found that the most commonly found pathogen was adenovirus. In one report, UKHSA found that 40 of 53 cases were positive for adenovirus. Preliminary typing has been consistent with one subtype: 41F.

Adenoviruses are very common and not usually dangerous, explains David Matthews, Professor of Virology, University of Bristol. There have been a few cases of severe viral hepatitis in immunocompromised children; however, in all recently reported cases, children were otherwise healthy and not immunocompromised. "If you'd have asked me 2 weeks ago to write a list of viruses causing hepatitis, I wouldn't have put adenoviruses on the list", said Will Irving, Professor of Virology, University of Nottingham. "So, if the adenovirus finding is important, there has to be some explanation. Something else has changed. Either the virus has changed, or something has happened to the individual patients that meant their response to the virus has all of a sudden become focused on the liver", said Irving.

One possibility is that young children did not have the usual exposure to these viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic and so could now be showing severe immune responses. "Lockdown was a very dramatic and huge change in societal behaviour", said Irving. "And we know from laboratory reports that this winter we have seen increases in a whole range of viruses, including adenoviruses."

Another hypothesis is that COVID­19 itself could be a factor. The UKHSA study reported that 10 children tested positive for SARS­CoV­2 either in recent weeks or on hospital admission (of 61 children with available data). But the general prevalence of SARS­CoV­2 is very high and, at present, there is no evidence of a new variant.

"So perhaps, prior infection with SARS­CoV-2 is doing something to the immune system, such that when it meets what would otherwise be a perfectly normal, trivial virus infection, it is triggering a damaging response to the liver", said Irving. Kelly points out that this has happened before; after the first wave of COVID­19, there were reports of a severe and new pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome in some children 6-8 weeks after having COVID-19. In addition, because none of the children in the UK had been vaccinated, the UKHSA has ruled out any association with the COVID­19 vaccine. There have been suggestions that the hepatitis cases could be associated with the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of COVID­19, first detected in South Africa in November [2021]. However, after reviewing hospital records at a hospital in Alabama, USA, a recent CDC report found that 9 patients with severe acute hepatitis of unknown cause were admitted to the hospital as early as October [2021]. Concomitant adenovirus infection was detected in all children.

The idea of a toxin from the environment or food is not being ruled out. The UKHSA is conducting epidemiological studies that involve retrospectively assessing the children's environment, demographics, and food intake. "It is possible that some food has been contaminated, but as yet there is no evidence for that", said Irving. With some adenoviruses frequently detected in water bodies, the UKHSA is also conducting a study to retrospectively analyse wastewater where cases are reported. In addition, the UKHSA is undertaking whole­genome sequencing of several samples to allow for further categorisation of any adenoviruses that are involved.

So, why does the UK have such high case numbers? Experts believe the UK has a good surveillance system. "If you've got a joined­up system for surveillance of infectious disease that is effective and works well, you will probably always be the first to find lots of cases", says Matthews. And Kelly points out that milder cases may be being missed. "If children have a tummy ache, vomiting, and diarrhoea, which lots of children have for lots of reasons, they may not be noticed until they get jaundiced and then suddenly the penny drops, this could be the liver."

A week ago, the first suspected case of hepatitis of unknown cause was reported in a child in Brazil. According to an investigation by the newspaper O GLOBO, the Ministry of Health stated that the registration took place in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro. In all, the country is investigating 7 suspected cases of the disease; 1 of the children needed a liver transplant. On [Thu 5 May 2022], Argentina confirmed the 1st case in Latin America, in an 8-year-old child.

The World Health Organization (WHO) regards the situation as a "very urgent" issue and said it is giving "absolute priority" to it.

At least 8 children with suspected severe hepatitis are under observation in different parts of Argentina, the National Health Ministry confirmed on [Fri 6 May 2022]. Officials also said that all the cases are under epidemiological investigation and have not yet been officially classified as severe hepatitis of unknown origin.

According to the government, these are isolated cases with no connection between them. In a statement, the Health Ministry said that "this is not an outbreak but a situation that is not beyond what is usually reported," underlining that every year there are cases of severe acute hepatitis that go without a diagnosis.

The first case in Argentina of a child diagnosed with the mysterious form of hepatitis, whose origin is under study by WHO after being registered in at least 20 countries, was detected on [Wed 4 May 2022].

Argentina's Health Ministry, in light of the epidemiological alert, has recommended that the population ensures youngsters have completed the schemes of the National Vaccination Calendar for each age group, frequently wash their hands, avoid contact with sick people, cover their mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing and avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth. In the presence of symptoms compatible with those of hepatitis (fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, white stools, joint pain, and jaundice) in children under 16 years of age, it is advisable to consult a physician.

https://wtvbam.com/2022/05/09/indonesia-detects-15-cases-of-severe-hepatitis-after-3-child-deaths/


Indonesia has identified 15 cases of severe hepatitis of unknown origin after reporting 3 deaths among children, the country's health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin told a news briefing on [Mon 9 May 2022]. The WHO said last week that it had received reports of at least 228 probable cases from 20 countries of child hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver.

Minister Budi said Indonesia had detected 15 cases since it launched an investigation into the illness recently, adding that authorities had not determined a definitive cause. He did not say whether the 15 cases were all children or what treatment they were receiving. A health ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some health experts have linked the illness to an infection by a type of adenovirus, a family of common viruses that can cause flu-like or gastrointestinal symptoms. There is also a theory that COVID-19 lockdowns may have weakened children's immunity because they were less exposed to common pathogens while in isolation. Scientists are in addition looking at whether the adenovirus involved has mutated, or is acting in tandem with another infection, possibly COVID-19.

Earlier this month [May 2022], Indonesia reported 3 children suspected to have contracted the illness had died in the capital Jakarta in April 2022.

[More cases are being reported. Likely updates will occur in the next few days from CDC and UKHSA. It remains to be seen whether all of the cases are due to one etiology or not.

- Adenovirus type 41, one of the enteric adenoviruses, has been found in the blood of many of the cases but has not been known to cause hepatitis in immunocompetent people and was not found using metagenomics in the liver. It is not yet known whether type 41 is similar to older isolates of this adenovirus serotype.

- SARS-CoV-2 can cause hepatitis which may be much more prominent in children with MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory disease in children). Only some of the children were actively infected with this virus at the time of the hepatitis but no substantial data has yet been published regarding past infection with SARS-CoV-2 as some cases of MIS-C are thought to be late sequelae or whether the cases actually fit the multi-system disease.

- Adeno-associated virus 2 was found in some cases in the liver as reported by UKHSA but it has been known to cause hepatitis in humans and may be just reactivating the latent genome which can integrate into the human genome.

- A possible link to dog ownership has also been suggested by UKHSA.

ProMED awaits more information about this entity. - Mod.LL
