--------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background data on human brucellosis in Mexico were
abstracted from GIDEON:
Highest rates are found in Queretaro, Coahuila, Guanajuato, Nuevo Leon,
Chihuahua, Jalisco, Tamaulipas, and Michoacan.
Most infections are acquired from unpasteurized milk, fresh cheese, and
other dairy products -- primarily from goats.
Mean seroprevalence rates are approximately 3.42 percent, ranging from 0.24
percent in Morelos to 13.5 percent in Mexico State.
5552 cases were reported in 1986; over 6300 in 1988; 5958 in 1992; 2699 in
1995; 3362 in 1996; 3387 in 1997; 3502 in 1998; 2669 in 1999; 2129 in 2000;
2826 in 2001; 2802 in 2002.
163 fatal cases were reported during 1978 to 1982. Mortality rates were
0.04/100 000 in 1992; 0.01/100 000 in 1996 .
The caprine seropositivity rate was 20.7 percent in 1947.
