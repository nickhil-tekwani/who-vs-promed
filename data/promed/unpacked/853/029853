The death of a 67-year-old man in Larissa, central Greece, raised the death toll from the West Nile virus to 41 on Thursday [18 Oct 2018]. Another 17 people have been infected since the start of October [2018] by the virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, with 14 of the cases showing symptoms that the virus has affected their central nervous system.

A total of 306 people have been infected since the start of the year [2018], with 234 of them requiring hospital treatment. According to the weekly report published by the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO) on Friday [19 Oct 2018], there are currently 13 people in hospitals around the country who have been diagnosed with West Nile virus.

Between 12 and 18 Oct 2018, European Union (EU) Member States reported 34 human West Nile virus (WNV) infections in Italy (14), Hungary (9), Greece (8), France (2) and Austria (1). EU-neighbouring countries reported 16 cases, all by Serbia.

In 2 areas (NUTS 3 level [see https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/background for a description of NUTS levels - Mod.JH]) in France, human cases were reported for the 1st time. All other human cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week, 8 deaths were reported by Greece (6), Italy (1) and Serbia (1).

In the same week, as of 17 Oct 2018, 8 outbreaks among equids were reported by Italy (6), Spain (1) and Portugal (1).

In 2018, as of 18 Oct 2018, EU Member States have reported 1436 human cases in Italy (550), Greece (302), Romania (268), Hungary (212), Croatia (45), France (24), Austria (19), Bulgaria (11), Slovenia (3) and the Czech Republic (2). EU-neighbouring countries reported 498 human cases in Serbia (385), Israel (110) and Kosovo (3) [see note]. To date, 172 deaths due to WNV infection have been reported by Italy (44), Greece (41), Romania (38), Serbia (35), Bulgaria (11), the Czech Republic (1), Hungary (1) and Kosovo (1) [see note].

In September 2018 in Germany, a veterinarian was diagnosed with suspected WNV infection after performing an autopsy on a deceased owl found in a wildlife park near Poing, Ebersberg, Bavaria, Germany. WNV was detected in the owl by PCR in tissue samples recovered during the autopsy.

During the current transmission season, 243 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (128), Hungary (84), Greece (14), France (8), Romania (2), Germany (2), Spain (2), Austria (1), Slovenia (1) and Portugal (1).

In accordance with European Commission Directive 2014/110/EU, prospective blood donors should defer for 28 days after leaving an area with evidence of WNV circulation among humans unless the results of an individual nucleic acid test are negative.

[Note] This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the International Court of Justice Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.
