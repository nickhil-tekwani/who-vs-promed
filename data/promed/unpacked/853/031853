Egyptian official denies 2 bird flu cases in Cairo
--------------------------------------------------
Egyptian Chief of Health Affairs department in Cairo Dr. Naibal
Abdul-Qader denied on Friday [6 Mar 2009] reports of emergence of 2
cases of bird flu in the Egyptian capital, excluding one case of a
child who tested positive in Faiyum province. Abdul-Qadir said in a
press release that all suspected cases of the disease were in 2
hospitals, adding that laboratory results proved that the 2 cases
were tested negative, contradicting rumors that the samples of those 2
cases were positive.

The only exception was of a 2-year old child from Faiyum province, who
was under treatment in hospital, the statement added.

[The case of this child was described in ProMED-mail archive (44)
below. - Mod.CP]
