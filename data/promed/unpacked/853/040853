Naturally occurring anthrax on Ted Turner's Flying D Ranch has killed
dozens of his bison and led workers to disinfect the ground, burn
some of the carcasses in a boxcar-size incinerator, and bury others.
Deaths rose to 175 bison on Thursday [7 Aug 2008], according to the
Montana Department of Livestock, which said the mortality likely
would taper off in a couple of days. The agency announced the
outbreak last week [30 Jul 2008]. "It's just a day-by-day situation,"
Turner Enterprises spokesman Phillip Evans said Thursday [7 Aug 2008]
from Atlanta, where Turner's media empire is based. Evans said there
are just over 4000 bison on the ranch south of Bozeman.

Turner raises bison on 14 of his 15 ranches in 7 states. With 45 000
of the animals, he has the nation's largest private bison herd,
according to the website for Turner Enterprises. [See

Bison meat from Turner's ranches is served at his Ted's Montana Grill
restaurants. Any Flying D bison meat from slaughters just before the
anthrax problem surfaced was not allowed to enter the food chain,
said state epidemiologist Kammy Johnson. She added that meat from a
sick animal would have to be insufficiently cooked to pose any
potential food risk. [The worse the cook, the safer you are. - Mod.MHJ]

The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said anthrax also
was suspected in the death of a black bear on the ranch. Agency
spokesman Ron Aasheim said wild animals there would be monitored to
help determine whether there are other deaths possibly linked to anthrax.

The anthrax in the ground is different from that in the 2001 anthrax
crimes that killed 5 people and grabbed headlines again with
investigators' conclusion that the perpetrator was a Fort Detrick,
Maryland, scientist who killed himself last week [29 Jul 2008].

Anthrax spores can lie dormant in soil for decades and then become
active [when swallowed. - Mod.MHJ]. Animals are exposed by consuming
forage or water contaminated by the spores. Anthrax can spread from
animals to humans, but the chance of that happening is extremely
rare, said Steve Helgerson, Montana's state medical officer. Anthrax
outbreaks in livestock are not uncommon. [In general yes but latterly
it has been infrequent and sporadic in Montana. - Mod.MHJ] "It was in
Saskatchewan [Canada] just a couple of weeks ago," said Steve Merritt
of the Department of Livestock. "It happens in livestock on a regular
basis." He said the risk of one anthrax-stricken animal sickening
another animal is low. [The disease is essentially non-contagious. - Mod.MHJ]

Turner's 175 deaths are more than in Montana's last anthrax case but
the number is not "super huge," Merritt said. He said "hot spots,"
where bison were found dead on the ground, were being disinfected with bleach.

Part of the Turner ranch is quarantined, and a county-and-federal
road through the property is closed. The road provides the main
access to the Lee Metcalf Wilderness, a popular destination for
hikers and others. "On an August weekend you can have 40 or 50 horse
trailers up there (at the trail access) and a couple of hundred
cars," said Gallatin County Commissioner Bill Murdock. "I'm surprised
the public has not been calling us and complaining about the road closure."

[With each report, the number of deaths increases significantly.
While compared to the epidemic in the western part of the Edwards
Plateau in Texas in 2001 when thousands of deer died, it is not
"super huge" but compared to the index outbreak in South Dakota in
2005 when some 200 bison died on a rodeo ranch it is getting up
there. In due course some 38 herds were diagnosed with anthrax in
South Dakota in 2005. Initially we were told the ranch had 3000
bison, now it is 4000; possibly the latter number includes calves.
With a ranch size of 13 343 acres [5400 ha] that is 3.3 to 4.4
animals per acre, which density may well go to explain the increasing
numbers affected, especially when one considers that it is the
rutting season. In all honesty this is a very difficult situation for
the ranch and its management. - Mod.MHJ]
