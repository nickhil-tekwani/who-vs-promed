A multistate outbreak of salmonellosis among people handling turtles,
that includes California and Los Angeles County, was announced
Tuesday [23 Sep 2008] by officials at the County of Los Angeles
Department of Public Health Veterinary Public Health.

Over 100 people, mostly children were infected by the same strain and
24 of them had to be hospitalized officials at the CDC [US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention] reported. 11 cases of the
infection were reported in Southern California that included 8 cases
in Los Angeles County, officials at County Public Health reported.

Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, and
vomiting. The CDC and local health officials interviewed potential
cases to determine the cause of the outbreak. Of those interviewed,
59 percent reported turtle exposure during the 7 days before the
illness onset. Further study confirmed that turtle exposure was
strongly association with the outbreak.

Many human exposures were indirect. A baby became ill after being
bathed in a sink where turtle feces had been discarded. 2 girls fell
ill after swimming in a non-chlorinated pool where turtles had been swimming.

additional information of interest from the updated article at the
above URL includes the following discussions:

"Turtles are natural carriers of salmonella bacteria," said DPH
spokeswoman Sarah Kissell. "So we strongly urge parents not to buy
those small turtles you might find in a dime store as pets for their children."

Kissell said if people do have pet turtles, they should take extra
precautions to practice good hygiene.

"We found that children were getting sick because they were kissing
their pet turtles. So we want parents to guard against such facial
contact," she said. "Also, it's very important to wash your hands
after handling turtles and other reptiles. So parents need to educate
their children on how to safely handle these animals." - Mod.MPP]

[It is not stated in the information available as to which serotype
of _Salmonella enterica_ is involved. Earlier this year (2008), CDC
reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC:
_Salmonella_ Infections Associated with Exposure to Turtles - USA,
2007-2008. Morbid Mortal Weekly Rep 2008; 57(03): 69-72;
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm>). The
discussion of the report is reproduced below:

"This ongoing, multistate outbreak of salmonellosis is associated
with small turtles purchased at pet stores, flea markets, and other
outlets, despite a federal prohibition on the sale of turtles with
carapace lengths of less than 4 inches (10.2 cm). These turtles are a
risk to the public and especially to young children. Other outbreaks
of turtle-associated salmonellosis have been reported (2,3).

"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was
enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that
small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections,
particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated
that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23 percent of
_Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975
prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_
infections in American children each year since going into effect
(5). However, this prohibition has an exception: small turtles may be
sold legally for scientific, educational or exhibition purposes.
During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA
increased 86 percent to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that
this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles
become household pets.

"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal
carriage rates can be as high as 90 percent (1). Small turtles sold
as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed
in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes
_Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle
eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate
_Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high
prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7,8). Other treatments reduce
but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that
continue to shed might recontaminate other turtles during rearing or
shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related,
determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).

"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an
estimated 6 percent of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons
coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces
contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from
salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry
_Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than
other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting
_Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite
or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is
likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to
small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in
charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the
turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high
numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated
with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater
risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2,10), several illnesses
occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that
turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children.
Additionally, only 20 percent of case-patients interviewed reported
awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with
reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this
link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to
prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However,
because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles,
prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains
the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated
salmonellosis.

A ProMED-mail posting (Salmonellosis, human, pet turtles - USA
20080125.0317) regarding the CDC report above also mentioned the
Domestic Pet Turtle Equality Act which was to be part of HR 2419, the
Farm, Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007 which was, on 21 May 2008,
vetoed by President Bush over concerns about increased spending
levels and budget offsets, payment limits, and the proposed target
price and loan rate increases for some crops. Congress overrode the
veto by a vote of 316-108 in the House on 21 May 2008 and 82-13 in
the Senate on 22 May 2008. It is not clear to this Moderator whether
the Domestic Pet Turtle Equality Act remained part of HR 2419 in its
final version.

More recently, S. 540/H.R. 924, Domestic Pet Turtle Market Access Act
of 2007 was proposed. According to the American Veterinary Medicine
Association/AVMA
(<http://www.avma.org/advocacy/federal/legislative/agenda.asp>), this
bill requires the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) to permit the
sale of baby turtles (less than 10.2 centimeters) as long as the
seller uses proven methods to effectively treat salmonella.

At present it appears to be in committee with S. 540 referred to
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and HR 924 referred
to the Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. AVMA
does not support this act, which seems to seek to rectify the
discrimination against baby turtles.

The Senate version of the bill can be found at
<http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s110-540> and
states that "The Food and Drug Administration does not ban the sale
of iguanas or other lizards, snakes, frogs, or other amphibians or
reptiles that are sold as pets in the United States that also carry
salmonella bacteria. The Food and Drug Administration also does not
require that these animals be treated for salmonella bacteria before
being sold as pets."

The issue in Public Health remains that these small turtles are much
more likely to be directly handled by small children. There is no ban
against the sale of larger turtles, which are much less likely to be
handled by these small children.
