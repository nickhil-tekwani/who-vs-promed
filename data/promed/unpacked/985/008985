As a result of rainstorms in the Lugansk region, the growth of mushrooms has
increased and mushroom poisoning has become more frequent. 14 people are
suffering from mushroom poisoning; one person has died, according to officials
in the regional sanitary epidemiological station. Another person was poisoned
in Lisichansk, 2 in Pervomaisk, 3 in Stakhanov, and 8 in Popasyansky district.
The poisoning in Stakhanov resulted in the death of a 4-year-old child.
According to Sergey Birjukov, a physician in the food hygiene branch of the
regional epidemiological station in the Lugansk region, the principal cause of
mushroom poisoning is the lack of knowledge by most people regarding which
mushrooms are safe to collect and consume.
Only lamellar mushrooms grow in the Lugansk region, especially _Amanita
phalloides_. According to Birjukov, because the Lugansk region is not an
ecologically pure zone, the consumption of local mushrooms is undesirable in
general. Gathering of mushrooms outside the woods and near roads and in
plantings is especially dangerous.
Improper preparation of mushrooms is also a health factor. According to
Birjukov, mushrooms are not recommended for use in food for older persons,
children, and persons with diseases of the gastroenteric tract.
According to the Lugansk press service, the number of poisonings in 2004 and
2005 has not been finalized.ï¿½
As of this date, sale of mushrooms at markets is strictly forbidden.

12 persons, including 4 children 8-12 years old, have been hospitalized with
food poisoning due to the consumption of wild mushrooms.
8 persons were hospitalized on 8 Jul 2005 with food poisoning, all inhabitants
of Pushkariovka in Sumy district.
On 9 Jul 2005, the children's condition deteriorated and they were transferred
to the toxicology branch of Okhmatdet Hospital in Kiev. Their condition was
described as grave.
On 7 Jul 2005, 2 persons died from mushroom poisoning in the Kharkov region.
More than twice the number of people died from mushroom poisoning in 2004 than
in 2003.
Despite measures to prevent mushroom poisoning, the situation remains
difficult. Analyses show that the majority of poisonings are caused by
lamellar poisonous mushrooms (primarily _Amanita phalloides_), which by mistake
are identified as champignons or russulas.
According to the Ministry of Health, poisoning can also follow the consumption
of edible mushrooms, possibly due to contamination or the age of the mushrooms.
One of the principal contributors to fatalities after poisoning is waiting too
long to seek medical help.

[Mushroom poisoning refers to the severe and often deadly effects of various
toxins found in certain types of mushrooms. One type, known as _Amanita
phalloides_ [Ap], also known as "death cap," accounts for the majority of
cases. The toxins initially cause severe abdominal cramping, vomiting, and
watery diarrhea which proceeds to liver and kidney failure.
The highest reported incidences of mushroom poisoning occur in western Europe,
where a popular pastime is amateur mushroom hunting. Since the 1970s, the
United States has seen a marked increase in mushroom poisoning due to an
increase in the popularity of "natural" foods, the use of mushrooms as
recreational hallucinogens, and the "gourmet" value of wild mushrooms. About 90
percent of the deaths due to mushroom poisoning in the United States and
western Europe result from eating Ap. Ap is recognized by its metallic green
cap (the color may vary from light yellow to greenish brown), white gills
(located under the cap), white stem, and bulb-shaped structure at the base of
the stem. A pure white variety of this species also exists.
Poisoning results from ingestion of as few as 1 to 3 mushrooms.
Poisonous mushrooms contain at least 2 different types of toxins, each of which
can cause death if taken in large enough quantities. Some of the toxins found
in poisonous mushrooms are among the most potent ever discovered. One group,
known as amatoxins, blocks DNA production. This leads to the death of many
cells, especially those that reproduce frequently such as those in the liver,
intestines, and kidney. Other mushroom poisons affect proteins needed for
muscle contraction, and therefore reduce the ability of certain muscle groups
to perform.
There is no specific antidote for mushroom poisoning. However, several
therapeutic advances have decreased the death rate over the last several years.
Early replacement of lost body fluids has been a major factor in improving
survival rates. Therapy is aimed at decreasing the amount of toxin in the body.
Initially, attempts are made to remove toxins from the upper gastrointestinal
tract by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage (stomach pumping). After that,
continuous aspiration of the upper portion of the small intestine through a
nasogastric tube is performed, and oral charcoal (every 4 hours for 48 hours)
is given to prevent absorption of toxin by the body. These measures work best
if started within 6 hours of ingestion.
In the United States, early removal of mushroom poison by way of an artificial
kidney machine (dialysis) has become part of the treatment program. This is
combined with the correction of any imbalances of salts (electrolytes)
dissolved in the blood, such as sodium or potassium. An enzyme called thioctic
acid and corticosteroids also appear to be beneficial, as do high doses of
penicillin. In Europe, a chemical taken from the milk thistle plant, _Silybum
marianum_, is also part of treatment. When liver failure develops, liver
transplantation may be the only treatment option.
The mortality rate has decreased with improved and rapid treatment. However,
according to some medical reports, death still occurs in 20-30 percent of
cases, with a higher mortality rate of 50 percent in children less than 10
years old.
The most important factor in preventing mushroom poisoning is to avoid eating
wild or non-cultivated mushrooms. For anyone not expert in mushroom
identification, there are generally no easily recognizable differences between
nonpoisonous and poisonous mushrooms. It is also important to remember that
most mushroom poisons are not destroyed or deactivated by cooking, canning,
freezing, drying, or other means of food preparation.
