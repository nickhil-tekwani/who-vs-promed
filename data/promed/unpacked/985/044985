The immediate threat is over, but a Middleton vet is urging horse owners to
remain cautiously alert for a rare and deadly virus next spring [2010].

13 horses have now died in Nova Scotia as a result of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE). EEE, or sleeping sickness, is a virus that affects the
brains of horses and humans. So far this year [2009], no horses in
Annapolis county have been infected.

The Department of Natural Resources [DNR] is now partnering with deer
hunters in Lunenburg County to obtain blood samples from deer. Because the
same mosquitoes that attack white-tailed deer also attack horses, it is
hoped that blood samples can help determine the scope of the affected area.

Hunters are being provided a special package to collect the blood samples
that are returned to drop-off stations where the samples are screened for
EEE by special field teams. This monitoring program may help identify the
extent of the infection in Lunenburg but not the extent of where the virus
could extend outside of the area.

Dr Dave MacHattie, a large animal veterinarian at Middleton Veterinary
Services, said that while the number of confirmed EEE cases did sharply
rise this year [2009], he doesn't see any reason to begin immunizing any
new horses this season. "As the weather gets colder and mosquitoes die down
for the winter, there's no point in vaccinating any new horses," he said.
"But in the spring, we'll proceed cautiously with a vaccination program."

The EEE outbreak remained contained on the South Shore, and no horses were
affected in other areas. Horses here that have received the initial dose
will be given the 2nd dose.

These cases are the 1st confirmed EEE in Nova Scotia, but MacHattie says
he's treated horses with similar illnesses over the past 10 years. These
cases are rare and were never confirmed as EEE. This is the 1st time
veterinarians have been [able] to confirm the diagnosis through tests.

MacHattie estimates that about 2 horses each year are typically affected
with similar signs. However, given such a high incidence rate this year
[2009], something has changed and should be monitored closely next season.

The outbreaks of EEE are typically sporadic and unpredictable in the normal
course of nature. The disease is believed to be spread between nonmigratory
birds by a species of mosquito that generally doesn't bite horses or
humans, he said. No one knows what causes these mosquitoes to begin biting
horses, but every now and then, it happens and causes an EEE outbreak.

While EEE is carried by birds and transmitted by mosquitoes, affected birds
don't show signs of infection. Unlike infections of West Nile virus, EEE
won't give horse owners a warning by killing birds 1st.

Infected horses will begin showing signs of being ill about 5 to 7 days
after being bitten by an affected mosquito. Clinical signs of EEE include
sleepiness or depression; affected horses can have difficulty walking and
seem unsteady or wobbly on their feet; seizures, muscle twitches, and
pressing their heads against solid objects are also possible signs of
infection.

This virus is not contagious between horses. Some stables have required
that horses undertake a quarantine period after traveling to an affected
area, but this is not a necessary measure, Dr MacHattie added.

[EEE was found in Nova Scotia, Canada this year 2009, a very rare
occurrence. The occurrence of the disease this far north has alarmed a lot
of equine owners and some veterinarians.

All horses should be vaccinated against the many equine encephalitis
diseases. A vaccine containing eastern, western, and Venezuelan equine
encephalitis and West Nile virus is available. The vaccine is administered
in the early spring with a repeat dose about 3 weeks later. The immunity to
eastern equine encephalitis will wane the fastest, and vaccination should
be repeated in about 3 months for best protection. Most often, the EEE
season ramps up from mid summer into late autumn. Consequently, a vaccine
in early spring may not be entirely protective by late autumn. I am at a
little bit of a loss as to understand why this veterinarian is so cautious
about a vaccine program in the spring. It seems appropriate to get a
vaccination program in place and boost the immunity of these animals to
prevent loss.

It is interesting that DNR is willing to help look for the virus. Deer have
been reported to have the disease, as reported by the Journal of Wildlife
Diseases 2005; 41(1): 241-5, and which may be viewed at
