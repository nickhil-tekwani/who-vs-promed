A 36-year-old Pretoria man died in Kalafong Hospital on Saturday [8 Apr
2000 after contracting Congo Fever, the Gauteng health department said on
Wednesday. Spokeswoman Jo-Anne Collinge said the man from Saulsville died
hours after admission to the hospital. "He was already experiencing
bleeding which is typical of an advanced haemorrhagic fever and died the
same night."
She said Congo fever, caused by the bite of a pied-legged tick or
contamination from the blood of an infected animal, was not necessarily
fatal. "During slaughtering or skinning, the blood of the animal could
enter through a cut or scratch on the person's hands," she said.
On Tuesday night an outbreak control team was set up to monitor and trace
all the people the victim may have come into contact with. Collinge said
authorities would also investigate whether informal slaughtering had played
a part in the man's illness.
