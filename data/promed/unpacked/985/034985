Blood Donor Screening for Chagas Disease, United States, 2006-2007
------------------------------------------------------
Chagas disease, a zoonotic disease caused by the bloodborne parasite
_Trypanosoma cruzi_, affects an estimated 11 million persons
throughout much of Latin America. In endemic areas, _T. cruzi_ is
transmitted primarily by triatomine insects (i.e., kissing bugs);
infection also can occur via blood transfusion, congenital
transmission, organ transplantation, laboratory incident, and
ingestion of triatomine-contaminated food or drink (1). To evaluate
an investigational assay for detecting _T. cruzi_ infection in blood
donations, the American Red Cross conducted a clinical trial during
August 2006-January 2007, screening 148 969 blood samples at 3
blood-collection centers in the United States. In January 2007, after
the new assay was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
other centers began screening donors for _T. cruzi_. This report
describes the results of the American Red Cross study, which
identified 32 donations (approximately one in 4655) as confirmed
positive for _T. cruzi_ antibodies. As blood-donation screening for
Chagas disease becomes more widespread, public health officials and
health-care providers should anticipate increased numbers of
questions regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of
Chagas disease.
Chagas disease has an acute stage, typically asymptomatic or with
mild symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise, swelling at the site of
inoculation, and lymphadenopathy) during the 1st 6-8 weeks after
infection. If not treated, infection is lifelong with low-level,
intermittent parasitemia. The majority of infected persons remain
asymptomatic in the chronic indeterminate phase (i.e., a prolonged
period of clinically silent infection that follows acute primary
infection). However, an estimated 30 percent will have onset of
chronic symptomatic disease, usually decades after the initial
infection, with cardiac manifestations (e.g., cardiomyopathy,
arrhythmias, and sudden death) or gastrointestinal involvement (e.g.,
megaesophagus or megacolon). In the United States, vector-borne
transmission of Chagas disease is rare (2). However, one study
revealed an increasing Chagas seroprevalence among blood donors in
Los Angeles County, California, from 1996 (one in 9850 donors) to
1998 (one in 5400 donors) (7). In 1991, a questionnaire was
introduced to screen blood donors; those reporting a history of
Chagas disease are deferred, but most persons with Chagas disease
likely are unaware of their infections. Seven cases of
transfusion-associated transmission have been documented in the
United States and Canada during the past 20 years; all occurred in
immunosuppressed recipients (3-6). Because acute infections often are
asymptomatic and the level of awareness of Chagas disease among
clinicians is low, cases of transfusion-associated transmission can
go undetected.
In 2005, a new commercial test for blood-donation screening for
Chagas disease was developed. The test, manufactured by
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (Raritan, New Jersey), is an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that uses epimastigote lysate antigens
for detection of antibodies to _T. cruzi_ in serum and plasma (8). In
clinical trials evaluating the test, including the American Red Cross
study, blood donor specimens with initially reactive results were
retested twice and considered repeat reactive if one or both of the
repeat tests were reactive. Repeat reactive specimens from the
clinical trials underwent further testing using a
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA); those with positive RIPA
results were considered confirmed positive. However, FDA has not
licensed a supplemental test as a confirmatory assay in blood
donation screening for _T. cruzi_ antibodies.
After a clinical trial in 2005 with approximately 40 000 blood donors
resulted in only one repeat reactive specimen (which tested negative
with RIPA) (8), the American Red Cross conducted a larger study of
the new screening assay in areas where Chagas was expected to be more
prevalent. The study was conducted in 3 collection facilities of the
American Red Cross, including the Southern California Region (Los
Angeles, California), the Northern California Region (Oakland,
California), and the Arizona Region (Tucson, Arizona). Blood
donations collected during 28 Aug 2006-28 Jan 2007, were tested with
the screening assay for those blood donors willing to participate in
the study. All donors were asked to participate; 78.5 percent agreed,
and their specimens were tested. A total of 148 969 blood-donation
specimens were tested; 63 specimens from 61 donors were repeat
reactive for _T. cruzi_ antibodies (approximately one in 2365
donations). Among the 61 donors with repeat reactive specimens, 40
(66 percent) were male; the age range was 17-84 years, with a mean
age of 47 years and a median of 50 years. Of the 63 repeat reactive
specimens, 50 (79 percent; one in 1993 donations) were collected from
the Los Angeles center, 9 (14 percent; one in 3258 donations) were
collected from the Oakland center, and 4 (6 percent; one in 5995
donations) were collected from the Tucson center. Of the 61 donors,
55 (90 percent) were allogeneic donors; the remaining 6 included 5
autologous donors (2 with 2 reactive donations each) and one directed
donor. Of the 55 allogeneic donors, 18 (33 percent) were 1st-time
donors, and 37 (67 percent) had donated blood previously. All of the
63 repeat reactive donations were tested with RIPA, of which 32 (51
percent) were positive and 31 (49 percent) were negative.
On 13 Dec 2006, based in part on preliminary results from the
American Red Cross study, FDA licensed the Ortho _T. cruzi_ ELISA
Test System to screen blood donors in the United States. The new
assay also is labeled for testing plasma and serum samples from
living cell and tissue donors and from heart- beating organ donors,
but is not labeled for general clinical diagnostic use.

MMWR Editorial Note
--------------------
Findings from the American Red Cross study described in this report
provided evidence to support FDA approval of the 1st blood
donor-screening test for Chagas disease in the United States. Use of
this test by blood centers to screen for _T. cruzi_ antibodies is not
required. However, both the American Red Cross and Blood Systems,
Inc., blood-collection organizations that are responsible for
approximately 65 percent of the U.S. blood supply, began screening
all donations for _T. cruzi_ on 29 Jan 2007, and providing testing
services for smaller blood-collection centers and hospitals that
requested testing. FDA is expected to recommend implementation of the
test by all blood- collection establishments. The AABB (formerly
known as the American Association of Blood Banks) has issued
recommendations to its member facilities regarding how to use the new
test.* AABB recommends that all components from blood donations that
are repeat reactive by the ELISA test should be quarantined and
removed from distribution, and the donor should be deferred from
making donations indefinitely. Recipient tracing should be conducted
to identify and test recipients of blood components collected
previously from donors who are confirmed positive (i.e., repeat
reactive by ELISA and positive by RIPA). AABB also suggests testing
at-risk family members of donors who are confirmed positive or family
members with a similar history of exposure to vectors in an endemic
area (e.g., the children of seropositive women). Deferred donors,
at-risk family members, and potentially infected recipients should be
referred to health-care providers for evaluation and management.
Screening blood donations for _T. cruzi_ antibodies can identify
persons with previously undiagnosed Chagas disease and further
enhance the safety of the U.S. blood supply. However, as with any
screening test, limitations exist. Although available data regarding
the performance of the new assay have suggested high sensitivity and
specificity (8,9), some false-negative results have occurred with
this assay (8) and with other assays used to screen for _T. cruzi_
antibodies (10). In addition, when a screening assay is used in a
population with low disease prevalence, a greater proportion of
false-positive results can be expected. Donors with reactive
screening assay results require further clinical diagnostic testing
to verify _T. cruzi_ infection and to guide clinical management.
For clinical purposes, no single laboratory test is adequately
sensitive and specific to diagnose Chagas disease. Diagnosis
generally is made by using at least 2 different serologic tests
(e.g., diagnostic ELISA tests, immunofluorescence assay, or indirect
hemagglutination) (1) and by considering clinical findings and
exposure risk. Clinical diagnostic testing for Chagas disease is
available through commercial laboratories and the Division of
Parasitic Diseases (DPD) at CDC. After diagnosis, health-care
providers should conduct a thorough clinical evaluation to determine
the stage of disease, develop an appropriate treatment plan, and
provide information regarding prognosis. CDC is preparing guidance
for the clinical evaluation, staging, management, and treatment of
patients with Chagas disease. Cases of Chagas disease likely will be
increasingly identified as a result of screening blood donors for
infection with T. cruzi. In addition, requests for diagnostic testing
might become more frequent as awareness of Chagas disease increases
among clinicians and the general public. Most identified cases likely
will represent chronic infections that were acquired years earlier.
Chagas treatment options are limited and are most effective during
the acute stage of infection. However, increasing evidence suggests
that treatment of persons with chronic infections can result in
seroreversion and prevent progression of cardiac morbidity (1).
Treatment of women of childbearing age with Chagas disease can
decrease the risk for congenital transmission. Antitrypanosomal
medication in the United States is currently available only through
CDC under an investigational new drug protocol.

of Chagas disease can be posed to DPD by telephone, (+1-770) 488-7775.

[This report in MMWR announces the implementation of universal
screening of blood donors in the United States for possible infection
with _Trypanosoma cruzi_. The key points in the report are that the
"FDA is expected to recommend implementation of the test by all
blood-collection establishments," and that "The AABB recommends that
all components from blood donations that are repeat reactive by the
ELISA test should be quarantined and removed from distribution, and
the donor should be deferred from making donations indefinitely".
The reported finding that between 1 per 2442 to 4655 blood donors are
repeatedly positive is surprisingly high, and it is expected that a
proportion of these are false positive. In screening programmes it is
important to avoid false negatives, which means that the cut-off is
adjusted to accept a false positive fraction, which is substantially
higher than the false negative fraction. These numbers are not
provided in the MMWR report.
The report does not give any recommendations as how to deal with
persons found positive in the test. As the implication of a positive
is that the person may transmit _T. cruzi_ through blood transfusion,
it is expected that persons tested positive are referred to
infectious disease specialists for diagnosis and possible treatment
of _T. cruzi_ infection. The main purpose of the screening is to
accept donors from _T. cruzi_ endemic countries, and it will be
interesting to see if the numbers of blood recipients infected with
_T. cruzi_ will decline. - Mod.EP]
