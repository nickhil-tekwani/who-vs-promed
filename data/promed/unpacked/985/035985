A Virginia horse has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1, but state officials say there is no cause for alarm for the general horse population in the Commonwealth.

On Thu 24 Oct 2019, the State Veterinarian's Office of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services confirmed that a horse has tested positive for the virus causing equine herpes myeloencephalopathy.

According to a release, the infected animal was at a boarding stable in Loudoun County, which has now been placed under quarantine.

Two other horses that were exposed to the virus have been traced to a boarding stable in Maryland, and VDACS says the Maryland State Veterinarian has been notified.

Both of those horses are being monitored for fever and other clinical signs. VDACS says no other horses have been exposed to the virus.

Officials say there is no cause for alarm regarding the general horse population in Virginia because EHV-1 is a virus present in the environment and found in most horses around the world.

Animals are usually exposed to it at a young age and suffer no serious side effects. Most will carry the virus with no clinical signs for the entirety of their lives.

However, a horse will sometimes develop the neurologic form of the disease.

Horse owners who have concerns are urged to contact their veterinarian, or they can call the VDACS Office of Veterinary Services at (804) 786-2483.

Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture officials confirmed on 28 Oct 2019 that one horse tested positive for the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and 33 horses were exposed in Chester County.

The positive horse, a 14-year-old Quarter Horse mare, began showing clinical signs of limb edema (fluid swelling), recumbency (down and unable to get up), urine dribbling, and poor tail tone on 27 Oct 2019. She was subsequently euthanized.

Only the affected premises has been quarantined; statewide restrictions have not been enacted.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[This virus continues to plague our equine friends, yet there is no effective vaccine for the neurological form of this disease.

None of the available vaccines has a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 [equine herpesvirus - 1] infection. It has been suggested vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM; equine herpes myeloencephalopathy/EHM is an alternative name for a neurologic disease associated with EHV) by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neurovirulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy) and the modified live vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza).
