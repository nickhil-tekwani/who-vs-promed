Re: PRO/AH/EDR, Rabies (17): Asia (Qatar ex Nepal) human, sylvatic exposure suspected, comment

I thank Prof Zanoni for his important comments. It is indeed our experience that healthcare professionals are not always up-to-date with procedures for rabies prophylaxis and may in fact receive limited training on this subject. Issues arising as a result certainly include the matter at hand and variations thereof (patient was deemed too late to receive PEP, or present on different days than prescribed, or the PEP schedule is interrupted for whatever reason, etc.). In addition, changes to recommended PEP routes and schedules do occur, and all these factors are addressed in the most recent WHO Expert Consultation on Rabies: WHO Technical Report Series no. 1012 (https://www.who.int/rabies/resources/who_trs_1012/en/).

How could we collectively contribute to update healthcare personnel around the world and work against what [Prof Zanoni] rightly terms "fatal misconceptions"? As one example, the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC) developed a series of free online certificate courses, the latest of which is the "Rabies Healthcare Certificate (RHC)." The RHC coursework has been reviewed by the WHO and found to be in-line with the latest WHO position paper (2018) on all aspects related to rabies vaccination protocols, as endorsed by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization.

The RHC certificate course is freely available from the GARC Educational Platform (https://education.rabiesalliance.org/), and we hope that this may be useful as an additional instrument to effectively update healthcare professionals around the world when it comes to the prevention of rabies in the communities that they serve.

[We are grateful to Prof Nel for his comments and the above GARC information.

Subscribers are reminded that the event, addressed in this thread, involved a patient from Nepal's Nuwakot district who went to a "nearby medical shop" 3 days after being bitten by a wild animal for antirabies vaccine and counseling. He returned home, untreated, since being regarded as "late for vaccination" and eventually died.

It remains to hope that those running "medical shops" and alike, in Nepal and elsewhere, are kept aware of the availability of the free online courses, and that they are encouraged, or preferably required, by the local health authorities to obtain the said -- or similar, in their own respective language -- a Rabies Healthcare Certificate (RHC).

According to the GARC website, a prerequisite for the RHC course is the completion of the Rabies Educator Certificate (REC), which provides basic information about rabies prevention and community engagement (see https://rabiesalliance.org/resource/rabies-healthcare-certificate-flyer). - Mod.AS
