[1] Indonesia - 89th death reported

An Indonesian toddler from Tangerang, west of the capital Jakarta,
has died of bird flu, bringing the country's death toll from the
disease to 89, a Health Ministry official said on Tuesday [23 Oct
2007]. The 4-year-old girl died on Monday [22 Oct 2007] after being
admitted to hospital 2 days earlier, health Ministry spokeswoman Lili
Sulistyowati said by telephone.

The girl, who had been suffering from fever, died after being
transferred to Persahabatan hospital in Jakarta. Officials were still
investigating the case, but 4 chickens had previously died in the
girl's neighborhood, another official at the Ministry's bird flu centre said.

Contact with sick fowl is the most common way for humans to contract
the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus. Bird flu is endemic in bird
populations in most parts of Indonesia, where millions of backyard
chickens live in close proximity to humans.

Indonesia, which has now had 110 confirmed cases of the disease in
humans [if the information in this report is included], has suffered
more fatalities than any other country. Including the latest case
[described above], there have been 204 deaths and 332 cases globally
since 2003, according to World Health Organisation data [see the WHO
table of confirmed cases of human H5N1 avian influenza, last updated
on 17 Oct 2007, at
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2007_10_17/en/index.html>].

[2] Indonesia - 7 new suspected cases in Riau province

Seven children aged between one and 10 years old are suspected of
having bird flu in Indonesia's Riau province [on the island of
Sumatra], where 4 people have died of the virus in recent months, an
official said Tuesday [23 Oct 2007]. "It is only suspicion, but we
are [keen] to handle the case[s]," local head office head Hasanul
Irbai was quoted by leading news website Detikcom as saying.

The 7 children live in Merampi Hulu village, Siak regency, in the
province on Sumatra island. "The Siak government will immediately
send the children to the Arifin Achmad Hospital in Pekaanbaru (the
provincial capital)," he said.

Earlier this week, the government confirmed that bird flu was the
cause of the death of a 10-year-old girl in Riau, bringing the total
number of national casualties to 89, the highest among other bird-flu
affected countries in the world. [This statement may be erroneous;

[ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human (141): Indonesia
20071022.3443" carries a statement from an official at the Health
Ministry's bird flu information centre contradicting an earlier
Xinhua-relayed report that a 10-year-old child in Riau province had
died as a result of avian influenza virus infection. Therefore,
pending further clarification, the Xinhua report should be
discounted, and the 4-year-old child resident in Tangerang (in Java)
described in part [1] of this post should be considered the 89th
fatality in Indonesia and the 110th case.

The cause of death of the 10-year-old girl in Riau province and the 7
new suspected cases remains to be established and confirmed by
laboratory testing.
