New outbreaks:

have abridged), all in sheep on the Greek island of Lesvos. Their
respective start dates were between 6 and 23 Nov 2008. According to
this report, no cattle or goats in the affected farms have been
clinically affected. Locations of the outbreaks are given by place
numbers (e.g. Lesvos 14, Lesvos 15, etc.) and not by village names;
all are reportedly in the administrative region "Voreio Aigaio"
(several north Aegean Islands, of which Lesvos is the largest). For
the start date and the number of susceptible animals, cases, deaths
etc. in each outbreak, interested subscribers are referred to the
above URL, which includes also a map with all outbreaks marked. -

[This follow-up report No 2 adds 30 new outbreaks to the 13 already
reported from Lesvos [more commonly known as Lesbos. - Mod.JW] in the
immediate notification and follow-up report No 1; the updated number
of outbreaks so far is thus 43. It may be assumed that their reporting
pace is determined by the dates of accomplished (labor and
time-consuming) laboratory confirmations.

Interesting data pertaining to the said epizootic can be found in the
web page titled "Isolates of Bluetongue virus type 16 (BTV-16) in the
dsRNA virus collection at IAH Pirbright;" see
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//ReoID/btv-16.htm>.

According to the table, BTV-16 has been recently isolated and
identified from blood samples derived from 9 cattle in 2 herds (herd
EL83303013, 7 cattle; herd EL83303024, 2 cattle) in Madamado
(northeast Lesvos). The dates of virus isolation were given as 27
Nov-1 Dec 2008. It will be of particular interest to note whether the
sampled bovines were clinically affected and, if so, to obtain
information on the course of their disease. No previous information on
clinical disease in cattle infected by BTV-16 is available. The
location of the village Madamado, northeastern Lesvos, can be seen at
<http://www.greekislands.com/lesvos/map.htm>.

In case these bovines were clinically sick, it would also be
interesting to include epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in their
differential diagnosis. EHD has been seriously suspected on the
Turkish mainland, opposite Lesvos, in autumn 2007 (see
20080606.1809). EHD, similarly an orbiviral disease, is clinically
indistinguishable from BT in cattle.

Outbreaks of bluetongue have also been reported from Israel during
October-November 2008, including (unusual) clinical cases in cattle
and goats; the serotyping of these cases is anticipated with great
interest. - Mod.AS]
