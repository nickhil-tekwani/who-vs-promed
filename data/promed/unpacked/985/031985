I also have had Orf on the finger. It seemed to last an eternity --
and started spreading when I put Camphophenique [antiseptic] on it
with a band-aid. Just once. We had other instances of Orf that I did
not get, and that did not spread past the face on the affected
animals. This variety (Texas A&M said it originated in New Zealand or
Australian sheep) was very severe in the goats, spreading to the
rectum and udder, and was more significant in general.
It was ugly on my finger, but did not hurt at all. Location may be an
issue -- and I wonder about differences in virus strains with regard
to pain. I have heard other people say it was painful when they had
it.

[It appears that an Orf Veterans/Victims Club of considerable
membership could have been established among PRO/AH subscribers.
The following abstract from a recent German article seems to be worth citing:
"Orf of the hand is considered as an uncommon viral infection which
is usually acquired through contact with infected sheep and goats.
Indirect infections through contaminated knives or meat have been
reported. Many authors feel that the disorder is more common than
reported because the disease is often misdiagnosed and the course is
usually self-limiting with spontaneous healing within several weeks.
Diagnosis is mainly made by patient's history and clinical course. It
is important to know the benign nature of human orf, since
complications seem to be caused by overtreatment. See: Rieger et al,
Ecthyma contagiosum (Orf) as an uncommon differential diagnosis of
infections of the hand [in German]. Unfallchirurg. 2003 Mar;
106(3):204-6."
