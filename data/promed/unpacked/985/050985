A 7th person with anthrax has died as infection among heroin users
continues to spread around the country, health officials have
confirmed. The latest person to die was from the NHS Tayside area,
where one other person with anthrax has died.

Another case has been confirmed in the NHS Fife area, bringing the
total number of infected people to 14, Health Protection Scotland said.

The outbreak, thought to be due to contaminated heroin, began in Glasgow.

[The last release from Health Protection Scotland was dated 7 Jan
2010, which reported 6 deaths among 12 cases:
<http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/news/spdetail.aspx?id=322>, so it would
seem that the 13th & 14th cases are since that date, and one of them
promptly died. The CFR remains at 50 percent. A case presenting with a
systemic anthrax infection is still extraordinarily difficult to save.

It is clear that we are going to see a steady incidence of new cases
over the coming weeks of the New Year. - Mod.MHJ]
