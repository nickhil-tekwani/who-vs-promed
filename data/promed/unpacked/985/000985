1st* Outbreak of Bacterial Leaf Spot Caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ on
Canola in Argentina.
--------------------
S. Gaetan, Facultad de Agronomia, Universidad de Buenos Aires, A. San Martin
4453, 1417, Argentina; and N. Lopez, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales,
Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Plant Dis. 89:683, 2005; published on-
line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0683B. Accepted for publication 31 Mar 2005.
Canola (_Brassica napus_) is an alternative crop to wheat in Argentina, and
approximately16 000 ha are grown commercially in southern Buenos Aires
Province. During 2003, experimental field plots of canola plants located at
Agronomy Faculty, University of Buenos Aires, in Buenos Aires were severely
damaged by bacterial leaf spot. Average disease incidence across 25 2- to 5-
month-old canola cultivars was 58 percent (range = 27-89 percent).
During 2004, identical infection associated with blackened veins (8-12 percent
of plants) was found in 2 commercial fields and experimental crops (rosette
and flowering stages) in Tres Arroyos in southern Buenos Aires Province.
Symptoms observed on adaxial surfaces consisted of v-shaped necrotic lesions
on leaf margin surrounded by yellow halos. Yellow bacterial ooze was found on
young lesions. The advanced phases of the disease included lesion enlargement,
foliar chlorosis, and death of leaves. The disease developed from the lower
leaves to the apex, resulting in complete leaf necrosis and defoliation.
10 samples (5 plants per sample) with lesions were arbitrarily collected from
2003 to 2004 from commercial and experimental canola crops. Diseased leaf
tissue was surface sterilized in 0.50 percent sodium hypochlorite for 30 s and
rinsed in sterile distilled water (SDW). Leaf sections were macerated in SDW,
and the extract was streaked onto nutrient agar. Plates were incubated at 28 C
for 3 days. Resultant colonies were yellow, mucoid, and convex. Gram-negative,
aerobic, and rod-shaped bacteria were obtained. 8 strains were biochemically
characterized using API 20NE (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and
identified as _Xanthomonas campestris_ (1).
Strains hydrolyzed starch, gelatine, and aesculin and were positive for
catalase and negative for oxidase, nitrate reduction, ureasa, and
triptophanase. Strains were capable of utilizing D-glucose, D-mannose, D-
maltose, malic acid, and N-acetyl-glucosamine. _X. campestris_ pv.
_campestris_ 8004 was used as a reference strain (2).
Pathogenicity and host range for 3 isolates were completed by injecting a
bacterial suspension (10 million CFU/ml) into leaves of 2-week-old canola
plants (cvs. Eclipse, Impulse, Master, and Mistral), cabbage (B. oleracea_
var. _capitata_), and cauliflower (_B. oleracea_ var. _botrytis_) seedlings (2-
leaf stage). The experiment (4 inoculated and 2 control plants for each
cultivar and each strain) was conducted in a greenhouse at 24 C and 75 percent
relative humidity. Inoculated and control plants were enclosed in a plastic
bag for 48 h after inoculation.
Chlorotic patches on the leaves followed by a dry, brown necrosis spread
beyond the initial injected area were observed in inoculated plants 8 days
after inoculation. Enlarged spots caused death of leaves. The pathogen was
successfully reisolated. Control plants, inoculated only with SDW, remained
symptomless. The results suggest that the bacterium represents a potential
threat to canola production in Argentina and indicate the need for further
study to identify the pathovar involved in canola leaf spots.
*To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of an outbreak of _X. campestris_
causing leaf spot of canola and in which the bacteria affecting canola
commercial crops was biochemically characterized and host range was carried
out in Argentina.

[Canola is the major oilseed crop grown in the Prairie Provinces in Canada and
its coverage area is expanding. It is also an economically important and
serious disease of canola (_Brassica napus_) in Australia, France, Germany,
USA and the United Kingdom. It is the most serious disease of canola/rapeseed
in the prairies, and may cause major crop losses in some years. The
infections of blackleg may occur on cotyledons, leaves, stems and pods. Stem
canker is the most serious symptom, as it can girdle the stem, causing plant
lodging leading to yield loss. 3 disease prevention methods -- crop rotation,
genetic resistance and seed treatment with fungicide have proven to be
effective.
Isolates of canola can be categorized into 4 pathogenicity groups (PGs) on the
basis of the interaction phenotypes (IP) on the differential canola cultivars
Westar, Glacier, and Quinta by using a standard screening protocol in the
greenhouse. Isolates in PG1 are weakly virulent as they generally cause
superficial lesions on the leaves. However, isolates in PG2, PG3, and PG4 are
highly virulent because they can produce stem canker at the base of the canola
plant, causing significant yield loss. In Manitoba, _L. maculans_ population
consists mainly of PG2 (virulent on cv. Westar; avirulent on cvs. Glacier and
Quinta) and a few PG1 isolates (avirulent on all 3 differential hosts). PG3
isolates (virulent on cv. Westar and Glacier; avirulent on Quinta) are found
in Europe, Australia, USA and eastern Canada. The existence of PG3 in western
Canada had not been established until its isolation in 2002).
