NHK, the main Japanese TV station, reported on 23 Dec 2012 that the death of 6 elderly subjects aged between 70 and 90 years old, apparently related to a gastrointestinal infection caused by a viral gene mutation [sic].

According to the available information, the deaths occurred in a hospital in Miyazaki Prefecture, southwest Japan, where other patients and workers have developed similar symptoms.

Medical authorities declared that at least 5 additional fatal cases have been detected in other unspecified regions. These deaths are thought to have the same cause, and it was pointed out that the mutant virus is rapidly spreading.

Both Miyazaki local government as well as Tokyo authorities indicated that extreme preventive measures have been taken, in order to stop the proliferation of this condition.

Norovirus Outbreak Kills 6 In Japan
-----------------------------------
A hospital in rural Japan is experiencing an outbreak of norovirus [infection] that has claimed the lives of 6 patients. Hospital officials made the announcement today [23 Dec 2012], although the deaths began occurring on Wed 12 Dec 2012.

Channel News Asia reports that the illness has infected staff and dozens of patients at the Shunko-kai Higashi Hospital in southern Miyazaki prefecture. The 6 victims were elderly male patients over the age of 70 and all died from gastroenteritis after contracting norovirus.

According to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovirus): "Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, coughs, and low-grade fever may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. A small number of people die, mostly the very young, elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems."

The Japan Daily Press reports that 14 members of the hospital staff and 24 additional patients have contracted the illness. 5 patients, with ages ranging from 76 to 90 years old, are considered to be in serious condition. The 6 men who succumbed to norovirus had been hospitalized for previous ailments such as stroke.

The deaths spurred a public apology from Shunko-kai Higashi Hospital officials who believe the spread of the illness was caused by an employee. They allege the caregiver wore one disposable apron throughout her shift rather than replacing it with each patient.

The norovirus is highly contagious and commonly passed along through person-to-person contact. It is unclear why hospital officials in Japan did not publicly acknowledge the current norovirus outbreak until after the 6th death.

[Norovirus is a highly contagious virus. Anyone can experience norovirus infection. There are many genotypes of norovirus in circulation and reinfection can occur throughout life. Hence infected with one norovirus genotype does not provide life-long immunity. Thus, as in the current situation, the elderly are equally vulnerable to infection. Norovirus can be present in an infected person's faeces both before and after appearance of clinical disease.

Norovirus can spread quickly in closed places like daycare centers, nursing homes, schools, and cruise ships. Generally norovirus outbreaks happen from November to April in the northern hemisphere, hence the alternate designation of this infection as "Winter vomiting disease." Norovirus infection is also a leading cause of illness from contaminated food. Fatalities are rare, except among the elderly and infirm.

So far there has been no confirmation by laboratory analysis (a straight-forward procedure in the case of norovirus infection) that the illnesses and deaths that have occurred at the Shunko-kai Higashi Hospital in southern Miyazaki prefecture are a consequence of norovirus infection, but it is the likely diagnosis. In the absence of identification of the etiological agent it is illogical to attribute the deaths to a 'mutant' virus (or even a virus). Further information is waited.
