I was surprised to read that optical equipment is used on multiple persons
in the UK. I wonder if this is the case in the US and whether there is a
disinfecting process in between patients? My Benenson [reference indicates
autoclaving of surgical instruments between uses to avoid CJD transmission,
so I guess there is a disinfection process in place but is it deemed
inadequate to stop CJD transmission?
