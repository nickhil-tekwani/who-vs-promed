The Ugandan Ministry of Health has warned the public that the ongoing
cholera epidemic has affected 11 districts and caused a total of 220
cases and 56 deaths since the beginning of 2005. A statement was
quoted by Radio Uganda on Wed 3 Aug 2005 as saying that local
district and national epidemic response interventions have been
instituted in collaboration with development partners such as the
WHO, the Uganda Red Cross and many others.
At present, only the districts of Arua, Nebbi, Gulu and Kotido have
reported cases during the month of July 2005. The ministry would like
to inform the public that the present epidemic is caused by an
unusual strain that has not been commonly observed in Uganda.
"Therefore, the population is likely to be highly susceptible and, if
treatment is not sought promptly, the outcome could be severe," the
statement said.
It said: "the risk factors for the epidemic have been identified as
poor sanitation and hygiene, failure to wash hands with soap after
going to the latrine or after cleaning fecal matter from babies or
children, low latrine coverage and eating uncooked food and un-boiled
water."
The public is urged to conduct preventive measures, such as washing
hands with soap after going to the toilet or after handling fecal
matter, promptly burying the dead, reporting any suspected cases
promptly to health authorities and assisting suspected cholera
patients to get medical care as soon as possible.
"Delay to seek medical care has been the major under[lying] cause for
the deaths reported during the present epidemic," it said.

20 people confirmed dead, as cholera epidemic hits 3 Adamawa LGs
-----------------------------------------------
A cholera epidemic has broken out in 3 local government (LG) areas of
Adamawa State, with no fewer than 20 persons confirmed dead, while
scores of others are hospitalized, many of them on a danger list.
These are Numan, Lamurde and Guyuk local government areas. Unofficial
figures said the death toll might be higher, as the ravaging epidemic
continues to spread to the remotest areas of the affected local
governments.
Adamawa State House of Assembly confirmed the outbreak of the
epidemic and the death on the floor of the house on Tue 3 Aug 2005
and directed the Ministry of Health to immediately dispatch medical
personnel to the areas to contain the scourge. The lawmakers blamed
the outbreak on lack of portable water in the affected areas and
elsewhere in the state.
Contributing to deliberation on the outbreak as reported by members
representing the areas, the House directed its committee on health to
investigate the cause of the epidemic and recommend quickest measures
before the situation gets out of hand.
According to reports from the areas, 6 persons have died of the
epidemic in Lamurde, 10 in Guyuk and 5 in Numan, while many more are
receiving medical attention. Outbreak of epidemic and other water
borne related diseases have become a yearly scourge in Adamawa State,
more so among riverside communities. This yearly scourge, people
said, is caused by their dependence on water from the River Benue for
consumption and other domestic use at a time the river overflows its
banks following torrential rainfall.
Investigation by Vanguard revealed that the epidemic is fast
spreading to other Local Governments of Demsa, Shelleng, as well as
others in the neighboring states of Gombe, Taraba and Borno. A member
of the State House of Assembly representing Lamurde Constituency, Mr.
Vedeino Bamayi called on the Federal Government and private
organizations to intervene in the water crisis rocking Adamawa before
the state is completely ravaged by cholera.
