Increased detection of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infection in children, Lyon, France, 2010 to 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent reports from several northern European countries indicate an increase in detection of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infection in the past two years, notably in children aged 5–15 years. Analysis of our laboratory database showed a similar pattern, with a higher proportion of respiratory samples positive for _M. pneumoniae_ by real-time PCR in paediatric patients aged 5–15 years. Our data indicate that in 2010 and 2011, France experienced the first epidemic peak of _M. pneumoniae_ infection since 2005.

An increased number of cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infections have recently been reported in northern Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and England [1-6]. Till now, there were no available surveillance data on the current situation in France or any other country in southern Europe. The Lyon Laboratory of Virology serves the university hospitals in the metropolitan area of Lyon, with an estimated catchment area of 2.1 million people. We investigated our laboratory database in order to determine if a similar increase in the number of _M. pneumoniae_ infections could be observed during the past nine years. Our study shows a striking similar pattern as that seen in Norway [3] and also confirms a current outbreak of _M. pneumoniae_ infection in children.

_M. pneumoniae_ is known to cause respiratory tract infections. It is contracted through droplets and affects primarily children aged between 5 and 15 years, with an estimated 20% of asymptomatic infections occurring in this age group [7,8]. It is the most common pathogen detected in paediatric community-acquired pneumonia [7].

Analysis of laboratory data
-----------------------
Laboratory diagnosis for _M. pneumoniae_ has been historically based on a fourfold rise of antibody titres in a serological assay, with more sensitive methods, such as PCR, the gold standard, being used in _Mycoplasma_ diagnostics in some laboratories during recent years [9].

As infections with _M. pneumoniae_ are not notifiable in France, we analysed all _M. pneumoniae_-positive reports in the Lyon Laboratory of Virology during the study period of January 2003 to December 2011. Until September 2011, we used an in-house real-time PCR based on Hardegger et al. [10], which was then replaced by the _Chlamydia pneumoniae_/_M. pneumoniae_ Respiratory Multi Well System r-gene, a real-time PCR kit (bioMérieux-Argène, France).

During the study period, the _M. pneumoniae_ PCR was performed on a total of 11,302 respiratory samples, with a mean of 1,280 respiratory samples per year. The samples had been mainly taken from paediatric patients, with 53.4% of the patients aged under 16 years. These paediatric samples came from the following hospital departments: paediatric emergency department (29.3%), intensive care units (14.5%) and various inpatient departments, mainly pneumology and haematology departments (56.2%). The samples from adults (aged over 15 years) were received from various inpatient departments (65.8%) and intensive care units (34.2%).

We detected a 15.1% increase in the number of respiratory samples sent to the laboratory for _M. pneumoniae_ PCR from 2009 (n=819) to 2010 (n=943) and another 30.3% increase to the year 2011 (n=1,229). The main reason for this was the increased number of samples sent for testing from the paediatric emergency department, where the number of respiratory samples rose by 53.9% from the number in 2009 (n=191) to 2010 (n=294); comparison with 2009 alone showed an increase of 185.3% in 2011 (n=545). During the same time period (2009–2011), the number of samples sent for the detection of _M. pneumoniae_ from paediatric intensive care units and the adult hospital departments remained at the same level.

Coincident with the increase in the number of respiratory samples received in 2010 and 2011, we observed an increase in the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection when compared with the number in 2009 (Figure). Considering the overall pattern in the past nine years, two main epidemic periods for the detection of _M. pneumoniae_ can be identified. The first occurred in 2005, followed by a slow decrease in numbers until 2009. In 2010, the number of _M. pneumoniae_ started to rise again – resulting in a second epidemic period – and continued to rise until the end of the study period, December 2011 (Figure). To date, the epidemic seems to be ongoing.

When looking at the ages of patients with _M. pneumoniae_ infection, we observed a general rise in the number of infections in all age groups in 2010 and 2011. The largest rise and the highest percentage of positive samples were found in patients aged 5–15 years, with 14.8% of all samples being positive for _M. pneumoniae_ in both years; in 2009, the percentage of positive samples was only 7.1%. Among patients aged 0–4 years, the percentage increased from 0.6% in 2009 to 4.0% in 2010 and 5.5% in 2011. In patients aged over 15 years, the percentage of _M. pneumoniae_-positive samples was lower, but still rose from 0.9% in 2009 to 2.8% in 2011. In the nine years, no shift in the age distribution of patients with _M. pneumoniae_ infection was observed (Table).

Discussion
---------
The proportion of _M. pneumoniae_-positive tests in our study correlates well with findings of the PCR-based study in Denmark, where approximately 3% of PCRs for _M. pneumonia_ in 2007 were positive, increasing to 15% during 2010 [11]. Surveillance data from Finland, based mainly on serology results, gave similar proportions, with 8–17% of tests positive for _M. pneumoniae_ in 2010 and 2011 [2]. The detection rate of _M. pneumoniae_ by PCR was highest in Sweden, at 23% in both 2006 and 2011 [6], which is as high as the percentage we observed during the peak in 2005 in the age group 5–15 years. In our study, the substantial increase in the number of samples originating from the paediatric emergency department clearly underlines the importance of _M. pneumoniae_ as a community-acquired pathogen, primarily spreading in childcare facilities or schools. There was no increase in the number of samples sent for _M. pneumoniae_ detection from inpatient departments. A nosocomial spread of the infection is therefore not expected.

The proportion of _M. pneumoniae_-positive PCRs among children aged 5-15 years has risen from 7.1% in 2009 to 14.8% in both 2010 and 2011. Such a high percentage has not been seen since the 2005–2007 period. A similar increase was seen, but to a lesser extent, in children aged 0–4 years (0.6% in 2009 to 4.0% and 5.5% in 2010 and 2011, respectively) and in the adult population (0.9 in 2009 to 3.3% and 2.8% in 2010 and 2011, respectively). Nevertheless, children of school age are the group mainly affected by _M. pneumoniae_ infection.

The two epidemic periods, 2005–2007 and since 2010, correspond to the distribution of cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection in other European countries, such as Sweden, Finland and Norway [2,3,6]. Epidemic periods, occurring after a four-year interval and lasting for approximately 18 months, have also been reported from England [12].

A general surveillance system for _M. pneumoniae_ as in other European countries, including typing of a single or different strains in outbreak situations [13,5], would simplify the detection of the strains responsible for the reoccurring epidemics in France.

Data on macrolide resistance of the circulating _M. pneumoniae_ isolates in France are currently not available, but this issue needs to be assessed in the near future.

Ongoing epidemic of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infection in Jerusalem, Israel, 2010 to 2012
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nir-Paz R, Abutbul A, Moses AE, Block C, Hidalgo-Grass C.

A substantial epidemic of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infection was reported in late 2011 in some European countries. We report here an epidemic of _M. pneumoniae_ infection that began in Jerusalem during 2010 and is still ongoing. This report complements current information on what might be a worldwide epidemic of _M. pneumoniae_ infection that might require substantial coordinated international public health intervention.

We describe here on an ongoing epidemic of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infection in Jerusalem, Israel, which started in February 2010. As of 31 January 2012, a total of 156 cases were identified among patients referred to the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centers in Jerusalem.

Background
----------
_M. pneumoniae_ is one of the major leading respiratory bacterial pathogens, causing respiratory tract infections. It is known to cause epidemics that emerge at three-to-seven-year intervals and can last two years or more [1-3]. Until now, it was not clear whether this phenomenon was endemic to certain regions or was global in nature. Some reports have suggested that similar trends can be observed in adjacent countries [2,4-6]. Additionally, it has been suggested that most epidemics occur either in summer or autumn, without an evident explanation for this seasonal occurrence of _M. pneumoniae_ outbreaks [2,7,8].

During 2006 and 2007, an increase in the number of cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection was reported in several countries including England and Norway [3,9]. A new surge was noted in a few countries in 2010, including England and Wales, Denmark and Israel [3,10,11]. In both Denmark and the United Kingdom, a decrease in the number of cases was reported in early 2011. However, a new surge of cases was noted in a few northern European countries by the end of 2011 and early 2012 [2,4-6,9,12,13] and there were also reports of an increase in the number of cases in 2011 in Japan (M. Narita, personal communication, September 2011), which included the Emperor of Japan and his granddaughter [14].

One of the major obstacles to timely diagnosis of _M. pneumoniae_ since its discovery 70 years ago has been the lack of a fast and reliable diagnostic method [15]. The past 20 years were notable for a revolution in the diagnosis of _M. pneumoniae_ by direct DNA amplification methods, but only in the last few years, with the introduction of real-time PCR, has rapid diagnosis become more widely accessible.

Setting
------
The Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centers in Jerusalem provides most of the acute-care hospitalisation facilities in Jerusalem, with approximately 1,000 beds in two hospitals. It has secondary and tertiary facilities and provides, to a lesser extent, primary care consultation for some of the health maintenance organisations in Jerusalem. It currently serves a population over a million in Jerusalem and its surroundings.

Notification of _M. pneumoniae_ infection is not mandatory in Israel and currently there is no laboratory in the Central Ministry of Health Laboratories to support its diagnosis. _M. pneumoniae_ diagnostics based on DNA amplification were implemented almost 10 years ago at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centers [16], but real-time PCR was introduced only in late 2006 [11], at which point serological tests were discontinued. Physicians in all admission wards, mainly paediatrics and general medicine, can submit samples, with same-day results possible five days a week.

Description of the epidemic
-----------------------
The past few years saw the tail of a previous epidemic in 2007 and the abrupt onset of a new epidemic in February 2010 (Figure 1). A feature of this new epidemic was a relatively high percentage (30%) of macrolide-resistant _M. pneumoniae_ isolates [11], but resistance rates may be diminishing as the epidemic progresses. It is still difficult to estimate the real extent of resistance at this stage since surveillance of resistance is only done periodically, every few months. Interestingly, no consistent seasonal or monthly influences were noted (Figure 2). The number of _M. pneumoniae_-positive samples fell from 2007, with almost no cases detected towards the end of the year, very few in 2008 and none in 2009. However, after the start of the 2010 epidemic – and unlike the phenomenon observed in Denmark [4] – there has been no notable decrease in the number of cases of _M. pneumoniae_ infection, except for a temporary fall during early 2011. Since April 2011, a more or less constant number of new cases has been observed each month.

The demographic and clinical characteristics of 166 patients hospitalised at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centers during 2007 to January 2012, from whom clinical information was collected, are presented in the Table.

Since the introduction of real time-PCR, the proportion of _M. pneumoniae_-positive tests submitted to our laboratory during the epidemic years has been relatively stable: in 2007 it was 11.1%, 16.0% in 2010, 16.7% in 2011 and 11.7% in January 2012. In the non-epidemic years, it was low: 2% in 2008 and 0% in 2009.

Discussion
---------
Of the major bacterial respiratory pathogens including _Haemophilus influenzae_ and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _M. pneumoniae_ is the only one for which no vaccine is available. _M. pneumoniae_ is considered to cause a milder disease compared with _S. pneumoniae_, though substantial morbidity can be observed [17]. Indeed the median duration of admission in our cohort was four days.

In many laboratories, serology is still being used [2,6]. The resulting delay in diagnosis poses a problem for clinicians [2], who need to ensure prompt treatment of patients with _M. pneumoniae_ infection. Problems in diagnosis have led to under-investigation in the past and have also impeded our ability to understand the epidemiology of the local outbreak setting as well as the nationwide or worldwide spread of this pathogen.

A study from Germany suggested that no single clone was responsible for nationwide _M. pneumoniae_ infections [18]. Indeed, Chalker at al. suggested from multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing of a small sample in the United Kingdom that epidemics are multiclonal in nature [13]. In contrast, Pereyre et al. have evidence that a small outbreak in Bordeaux, France, might be related to a single clone [19]. In influenza, the epidemics generally involve a single or very few clones of influenza virus that spread worldwide at the same time. Interestingly, it seems that _M. pneumoniae_ epidemics do occur worldwide and are a global phenomenon affecting countries both adjacent and distant. This is demonstrated by the fact that in 2007, epidemics were noted in several countries, some of which are not adjacent to each other [3,9], including Israel. Similar observations were made in 2010 and 2011 [2,4-6,9,12-14]. It seems that for unknown reasons some countries are spared from such epidemics [2]. For example countries in the south of Western Europe are not affected by the current epidemic [2,6]. Additionally, the specific epidemiological pattern within each country seems to differ: in some countries the epidemic is abrupt and subsides relatively quickly [4], while, as in our case, the epidemic has so far being maintained for more than two years.

Our study has a few limitations. Being a single-institution study, selection bias in the population referred to our hospitals may have resulted in the inclusion of more severe cases, possibly with more underlying conditions or co-morbidities. In addition, since currently there is no nationwide surveillance programme for _M. pneumoniae_ in Israel and no published data are available from other Israeli medical institutions, we do not know the extent of the infection in the rest of the country.

Our report is in line with recent observations published in Eurosurveillance [4-6,9,12,13] and emphasises the need to understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of epidemics of _M. pneumoniae_ infection better. To this end, it would be appropriate for countries to establish sentinel institutions equipped with up-to-date dedicated diagnostics for _M. pneumoniae_. A network of such facilities, working in a coordinated fashion, would provide invaluable information for epidemic and inter-epidemic periods.

[_Mycoplasma_ are bacteria that lack a cell wall and are bounded only by the cytoplasmic membrane. There are over 100 recognized species of the genus _Mycoplasma_. _Mycoplasma_, too small (about 0.1 micron in diameter) to be detected by conventional microscopy, can be detected by DNA probe, enzyme immunoassay, real-time PCR assay (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=19403761&dopt=Abstract), and growth in vitro. However, isolation of these organisms in vitro can be difficult and may require up to 6 weeks. In vitro media must supply long-chain fatty acids and cholesterol that are required for cyotplasmic membrane synthesis. Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. Several species are pathogenic in humans, including _M. pneumoniae_.

_M. pneumoniae_ commonly cause a mild acute upper respiratory infection with fever, nonproductive cough, pharyngitis, malaise, muscle pains, earache, and headache in children and young adults (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/mycoplasmapneum_t.htm). Radiologically confirmed pneumonia develops in 5-10% of cases. _M. pneumoniae_ accounts for 15%-20% of community-acquired lower respiratory infection in adults that require hospitalization and probably an even greater proportion of those that do not require hospitalization. Approximately 20% of infections are asymptomatic. Extrapulmonary syndromes, including cardiologic (e.g., pericarditis, myocarditis, arrhythmias), neurologic (e.g., encephalitis), hematologic (hemolyisis), and dermatologic findings (erythema multiforme) may occur. Cold agglutinins may be present in the acute serum of 30%-60% of patients.

Transmission of _M. pneumoniae_ infections probably occurs through close contact with contaminated respiratory droplets. Infections with _M. pneumoniae_ occur sporadically throughout the year, and outbreaks are most common during the late summer and early fall, typically in 4-7-year cycles (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00022322.htm). Spread of infection is common in households, college dormitories and military bases where people are living together in close proximity. The prolonged incubation period for this pathogen of 2-4 weeks may contribute to protracted duration of outbreaks. Macrolides, tetracycline, fluoroquinolones are the antimicrobials of choice for _M. pneumoniae_ infections. However, macrolide resistance has been reported and appears to be increasing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2223908/ and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/6/10-1558_article.htm). A real-time PCR assay has been developed to detect in clinical specimens the mutations that confer macrolide resistance in _M. pneumoniae_ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2565909/). Use of alternative antimicrobial agents should be considered if initial treatment with a macrolide is unsuccessful (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/6/10-1558_article.htm). - Mod.ML
