NEWCASTLE DISEASE - UK
======================
I have received a report that MAFF/UK has cponfirmed an outbreak of
Newcastle disease on a farm in East Sussex. All the usual official
veterinary responses have been put in motion (slaughter, surveillance,
restricted movements, etc). If anyone in MAFF can provide more details
on the outbreak and on the virus(es) involved, it would be appreciated.
The last case of Newcastle in the UK was in 1984 with 22 confirmed
outbreaks, the slaughter of 800,000 birds, and some $3 million (2 million
stirling) paid in compensation. The last outbreak in The Netherlands
was in mid-November 1995 and the country was declared free as of May
15th 1996.
