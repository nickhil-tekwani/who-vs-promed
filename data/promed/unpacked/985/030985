The 2 men listed at the isolation ward of the hospital in the Danube
city of Ruse have been infected with anthrax, the Regional Health
Inspectorate reports. The Head of the Inspectorate further said that
this is the 1st anthrax case in the Ruse region in the last 30 years.

The men, 70 and 32, were admitted in the beginning of the week with
symptoms of anthrax. They became ill after butchering a goat in the
village of Chilnovo.

The Health Ministry has been notified, and the men have begun
penicillin treatment. Samples have tested positive for anthrax.

However, the lab results from the samples from Chilnovo are still
expected in order to confirm there is anthrax in the area. If the
tests results [presumably from the butchered goat. - Mod.MHJ] come
out positive, the regional vet services will begin vaccinations of
all animals in the village to stop the spread of the infection.

[The previous Bulgarian report had 4-5 affected sheep and 2 suspect
human cases, a 68-year-old man and his 8-year-old grandson, in an
unnamed village. Here, we have 2 men -- 70 and 32 -- and a goat
(presumably a milk goat from the picture in the article) in the
village of Chilnovo. It would seem that the veterinary authorities do
not trust the medical confirmation, as they are delaying livestock
vaccination until they have a positive confirmation; interesting.

Ruse is on the northeast border of Bulgaria on the south bank of the
Danube and adjoining Romania; see:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruse,_Bulgaria>.

Anthrax is sporadic in Bulgaria and has been absent from sheep and
goat reports for a few years. So, either this represents a dip of the
observation radar to catch what would otherwise have been missed, or
a quiet, ongoing problem. In that the recent outbreaks have involved
humans or more than a couple of animal deaths, I am of the opinion
that the sporadic sheep and goat-only outbreaks are being missed.
This is, unfortunately, not at all unusual. In the Caribbean, where
sheep and goats are traditionally looked after by women and children,
as they are in many parts of the world, response times to sick and
dead animals can be very slow and, therefore, needlessly expensive.
Sick cows and men are looked at immediately. - Mod.MHJ]
