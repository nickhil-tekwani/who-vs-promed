Magunje herd under serious threat
---------------------------------
Lumpy skin disease [LSD] has plagued Magunje [Hurungwe district,
Mashonaland West province] livestock and left a number of villagers
fearing for their beasts.

Although the disease is not the biggest killer of cattle in the
country, some people in Magunje are already counting their losses.
Villagers in areas such as Zvipani, Chanetsa, Chabumha, Kandororo,
and Matamba live in perpetual fear of losing whole herds following an
outbreak of LSD. Most of the affected cattle exhibit a craggy skin
that slowly develops into swollen wounds.

For the past 2 years, the Magunje villagers have been battling with
the disease, which has been wiping out their wealth.

Veterinary scientists say the disease has no cure, but can be
prevented. The meat from affected cattle can be consumed without any
fear of health hazards.

Some villagers blamed the scourge on the long period the cattle have
gone without dipping. Others feel that lack of vaccines has led to
their failure to prevent the disease. "Most of the cattle are not
dipping and we fear that this could have caused our livestock to be
vulnerable to diseases," said Mr Ngaudi.

Very few villagers with financial means have been buying vaccines to
treat their beasts. The treated beasts are apparently separated from
the rest for fear that they may contact the disease. Others feel that
it is time they graduated from cattle rearing to other farming
activities that have less risk.

Magunje villagers depend on cattle for draught power in an area that
usually produces enough food for its people. There are now fears that
the villagers might find it difficult to realise good harvests next
season due to lack of draught power.

Principal director in the Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and
Irrigation Development Dr Stuart Hargreaves said the Government was
distributing lumpy skin vaccines in partnership with the European
Union. "The vaccines are in stock and we are distributing them," he
said. "The vaccines were bought through a partnership with the
European Union and there is an outreach programme around the country."

The vaccines were being distributed through the farmers' unions. But
marginalised villagers and communal farmers who are rarely affiliated
to any farmers' organisation are being left out in the disbursement.

Dr Hargreaves said such farmers should quickly be affiliated to a
farmers' union in order to benefit. "It is important that everyone
joins a farmers' union," he said. "There is no cure for the disease,
but prevention can work."

Magunje is not the only area that is affected by lumpy skin disease.
Areas such as Sanyati and Chegutu [also in Mashonaland West province]
have reported some cases of late.

[Lumpy skin disease, a vector borne capripox transboundary disease of
bovines, previously an OIE list-A disease, is known to be endemic in
Zimbabwe and countries in southern as well as other parts of Africa.
The disease is transmitted primarily by biting insects. It does not
infect humans.

Since the 1980s, LSD has spread northwards and even beyond the
African realm. It seems to have become endemic in Egypt, where annual
mass vaccinations are being carried out, and recorded in other Middle
Eastern and Near Eastern countries. For OIE's map of LSD OIE-reported
distribution since 2005, see map at (select 'lumpy skin disease' from
the terrestrial diseases list)

Vaccination, with live attenuated vaccines, is an effective means in
preventing the losses caused by this debilitating cattle disease. For
