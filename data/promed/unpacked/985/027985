A 59-year-old Thai man who bred and raised fighting cocks in
northeastern Thailand contracted the H5N1 bird flu virus and has
died, bringing the country's human death toll from the disease to 17,
health officials said on Tue 26 Sep 2006.
The man, from Nong Bua Lamphu province, had been treating his sick
fighting cocks with herbal medicines when he was exposed to the
disease, said Thawat Suntrajarn, Director-general of the Department
of Communicable Disease Control. He became ill on 14 July 2006 with
fever and aches, and died on 10 Aug, said a statement from the Health Ministry.
"He didn't give his full history to the doctor -- that he raised
chickens, that they were sick, and that they had died," Thawat told
The Associated Press. "He was scared that the agriculture officials
would kills his birds."
Thawat said the man had about 50 fighting cocks on his farm and
assumed that since there weren't any bird flu outbreaks in the area
near his home, his birds couldn't possibly have died of bird flu.
"His wife finally confessed 14 days after he became sick," Thawat
said, adding that officials have gone to the man's farm to cull
poultry according to standard protocol.
Cock fighting is hugely popular in Thailand, and owners have resisted
previous culls by hiding their expensive birds. The Health Ministry
said Thailand has logged 17 human deaths from the disease.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu has killed at least 146 people worldwide
since it started ravaging poultry stocks in Asia 3 years ago,
according to the World Health Organization. The figure has not yet
been updated to include the most recent death in Thailand. Most human
deaths have been traced to direct contact with sick birds, but
experts fear the virus could mutate into a more easily transmissible
form, potentially causing a deadly global pandemic.
The man came from the None Sang district of Nong Bua Lamphu, about
420 kilometres northeast of Bangkok.

A 59-year-old farmer has died of bird flu in northeastern Thailand,
bringing the death toll in the country from the H5N1 virus infection
this year to 3, public health officials said.
Kumnuan Ungchusak, Director of the Public Health Ministry's
Epidemiology Bureau, said the victim fell sick in mid-July 2006 and
died on 10 Aug in Nong Bua Lam Phu, some 580 kilometres northeast of Bangkok.
"There were sick chickens at his house," the director said. Another
health ministry official also said a laboratory test had confirmed
the man died of the H5N1 virus, adding: "He was believed to have been
in contact with sick chickens."'
Thailand is among the countries hardest hit by the H5N1 virus
recording 25 human cases. 17 of them have been fatal since the
outbreak began here in 2004.
The latest bird flu fatality followed the death in July of a
27-year-old farmer in the central province of Uthai Thani. He died
after burying a dead chicken with his bare hands. To help control the
spread of the virus, 900 000 volunteers have been recruited across
the country to spray disinfectant around poultry farms every 3 months
and check for signs of illness among residents.
Thailand, the world's 4th-largest exporter of poultry, now only
exports cooked chicken. The country has stockpiled 1.5 million
capsules of the anti-viral drug oseltamivir, a generic version of the
drug Tamiflu, which the kingdom began producing this year.

A 59-year-old man from Nong Bua Lamphu was yesterday declared the
latest victim of avian influenza, bringing Thailand's death toll to
17 since the disease was first detected in 2004. The man is the 3rd
confirmed death from the infection this year. Officials said he was
the 1st to die of complications rather than H5N1 itself.
"This case study has taught us that having the antiviral drug
oseltamivir at hand doesn't necessarily mean we can cure it," said Dr
Kumnuan Ungchusak, head of the Bureau of Epidemiology. The case was
the first that took almost a month from the day the patient fell ill
to his eventual death, compared to past cases in which victims died
within a few days of falling sick, Kumnuan said.
The Nong Bua Lumphu man, who lived in Nong Sang district, fell ill on
15 Jul 2006 with high fever and muscular pains. He was treated at the
nearby primary care unit, but his condition did not improve, said Dr
Prat Boonyawongwiroj, the permanent secretary for Public Health.
Before his death, the man had been transferred to the Nong Sang
district hospital and then to the Nong Bua Lumphu provincial
hospital, where he died on 10 Aug 2006, the doctor said.
At first, doctors treating the man were not aware he had been in
contact with sick chickens before falling ill, Dr Thawat Suntrajarn,
the director-general of the Disease Control Department, said. About 2
weeks after becoming ill, his wife finally told doctors he had
touched some sick chickens earlier, Thawat said, explaining that was
why doctors suspected he had leptospirosis instead of bird flu. The
patient had nursed about 40 sick chickens and treated some of them
with an herbal drug, but most eventually died, Thawat said.
An autopsy revealed the man had succumbed to drug-resistant bacteria
called Acinetobacter, he said, adding the patient was given the
antiviral oseltamivir right after his wife told doctors he had been
in contact with sick chickens. When the man was initially taken in
for treatment, he was tested for H5N1 [virus] even though it was not
known at that stage whether he had been in contact with sick poultry,
Department of Medical Sciences chief Dr Paijit Warachit said. The
first advanced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test detected no signs
of the H5N1 virus, nor did several repeat PCRs conducted later after
the man's wife finally said that her husband had been in contact with
sick chickens, Paijit said.
He was the 1st person to undergo 9 PCR tests, yet the virus was still
not detected until an autopsy was conducted on tissue taken from his
lungs and faeces, he said. That PCRs failed to detect the virus could
be because of the effects of oseltamivir, which might have prevented
the virus from being present in the respiratory-tract areas where
swabs were taken for testing, according to Dr Tawee
Chotpitayasundond, of the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health.
The Department of Livestock Development, meanwhile, insisted Nong Bua
Lumphu was not on the list of bird-flu districts and past testing on
poultry had found no signs of H5N1 there. There would be no culling
of poultry in the province for now, Veterinarian Nirand Auengtrakul,
director of the Bureau of Disease Control and Veterinary Services,
said. Governor Phairat Sakolphan has ordered an "X-ray check" across
the province for the bird-flu epidemic.

Indonesian health officials said on Tue 26 Sep 2006 that they were
examining possible person-to-person transmission of avian influenza
after 3 brothers developed symptoms of the virus, one of whom has
died. So-called cluster cases, where the H5N1 virus is spread from
human to human rather than from poultry, increase the chance of the
virus mutating to become easily transmissible between people. Such a
development, scientists fear, could lead to a global pandemic with a
potential death toll of millions.
Fatimah Resmiati, from the West Java health office, said that a
25-year-old man died in Bandung on Sun 24 Sep 2006 suffering bird flu
symptoms, but he was buried without samples being taken for testing.
His 20-year-old brother, displaying similar symptoms, was admitted to
the same hospital with him, she said. He was transferred to Hasan
Sadikin hospital, a government-appointed centre for bird flu
treatment, where he was joined by the 3rd brother, aged 15, on
Monday. "As the 3 are blood-related and suffer from the same
symptoms, we are suspecting a new cluster case here, but we still
have to make the necessary tests to ascertain what they are suffering
from," Resmiati told AFP.
The family had regularly fed dead chickens from various sources,
including local markets, to their dogs, she said -- meaning the trio
may have picked up the virus from poultry instead of from each other.
Samples have been taken from the rest of the family and their close
neighbours, Resmiati added. Hadi Yusuf, who heads the bird flu
control team at the hospital, told AFP that the 20-year-old was in a
critical condition but declined to comment on the youngest brother.
Indonesia is grappling with ongoing outbreaks of the H5N1 virus in
its poultry and has reported 51 human fatalities from avian
influenza, the highest number anywhere in the world. It reported the
world's 1st laboratory confirmed case of human-to-human transmission
in May, when 7 people died in a cluster case.
The World Health Organisation estimates that there have been about
half a dozen instances of human-to-human transmission, mainly
involving relatives or close carers who were infected by someone who
caught the virus from poultry.

Indonesia is investigating a possible cluster of bird flu cases after
a man died and his brother and sister were hospitalised, one of them
testing positive for bird flu, a doctor said on Tue 26 Sep 2006.
The man, 25, died on Sunday with bird flu symptoms after being
treated at a Christian hospital in Bandung, the capital of West Java
province, said Hadi Yusuf, head of the bird flu ward at the city's
Hasan Sadikin hospital. The dead man's brother, 20, and sister, 15,
were being treated in Hasan Sadikin hospital and tests carried out by
a government laboratory showed the surviving brother had bird flu, Yusuf said.
It was not clear if samples from the dead brother had been taken for
tests when he was treated, the doctor said. "The condition of the
(other) brother is not good. He's on a ventilator," Yusuf told
Reuters by telephone. Test results for the girl were expected on
Wednesday, he said.
The brothers often bought dead chickens to feed their dog, but the
girl had no known history of contact with chickens, the doctor said.
"If it is true that the youngest did not touch chickens at all and
[if] she had bird flu, we need to suspect she got it from the
brothers," he said.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 146 of the 249
people confirmed as infected with H5N1 bird flu have died since 2003.
Those infected have come from countries ranging from China to Iraq to
Djibouti. Indonesia, with 51 deaths, has the highest toll of any nation.
In Thailand, a 59-year-old man died of bird flu in August 2006, the
country's 17th victim of the virus since it swept through much of
Asia in late 2003, a senior Health Ministry official said on Tuesday.
The man died on 10 Aug in a northeastern province near the Lao border
after chickens at his house fell sick and died, the official said.
The virus mainly affects birds but experts fear it could mutate into
a strain capable of killing millions of people in a global pandemic.
This fear heightened in May when 7 people in an extended family died
of bird flu in Indonesia's North Sumatra province. The WHO has said
limited human-to-human transmission is highly likely to have occurred
in the Sumatra cases but that the transmission was not sustainable
and occurred only during close, prolonged contact, such as a parent
looking after an infected child.
Health experts and scientists say it is crucial to control the virus
from spreading in poultry to limit the chances of more people
contracting the disease. The more it spreads, the greater the risks
of the virus mutating into a form that can easily pass between humans.

[The retrospective confirmation of the death of a fighting cock
breeder as a result of H5N1 virus infection brings the Thai case
total to 25 which includes 17 fatalities. A significant feature of
this result is the failure of PCR tests to detect H5N1 virus
infection in patient samples during the course of treatment with oseltamivir.
The precise status of the 3-member cluster of blood relatives under
investigation in West Java should become clearer when test results
from the sister of the 2 brothers (one only known to be H5N1-positive
so far) become available in the next 24 hours. - Mod.CP]
