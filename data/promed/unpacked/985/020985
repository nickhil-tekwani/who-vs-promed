Phoma set to threaten yields in 2011
------------------------------------
With phoma leaf spot levels increasing considerably in oilseed rape
crops since mid-January [2011] and up to 100 percent of plants
affected in some crops in southern, eastern, and central England, it
seems likely the 2010/11 season will be a high phoma year and yield
losses could be heavy in crops in which the disease is not
controlled.

That is according to ADAS' [Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service] Dr Peter Gladders, who says the foundations for a phoma
epidemic were laid last autumn [2010], with wet weather in August and
September. There was a rapid onset of disease in October, leaving
little time to react. December's very cold weather would simply have
allowed phoma spores to accumulate in crops.

At present there are plants with multiple leaf spots where fungicides
are no longer protecting the crop, said Dr Gladders. Where 2
fungicides have been applied almost complete disease control has been
achieved. Some of the lesions appear to be larger than usual and may
still produce damaging stem cankers on small plants. Dr Gladders said
the early onset of phoma was bad news for growers.

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) caused by the
fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ is the most serious disease of oilseed
rape with a possible yield loss of 50 percent or more. It can also
affect other species in the _Brassicaceae_ family (such as cabbages,
turnip, some weeds) which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms
on oilseed rape may include lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, with
stem cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse of the crop.
However, symptomless infections may also occur.

The fungus is seed borne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal,
mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment), and infected
crop litter. It may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often
sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk
from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease
management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise
inoculum and fungicides.

Rape cultivars with different levels of disease resistance are
available. However, the pathogen can be expected to adapt to new
resistant crop varieties quickly since it is extremely diverse. New
strains evolve frequently and have overcome major resistance genes in
the past. The need to use 2 different fungicides for control, as
described above, may point to the possibility that fungicide
resistances are also emerging in the national pathogen population.
