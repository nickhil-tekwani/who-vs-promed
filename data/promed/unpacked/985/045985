[Craig Carter has put out the following warning and RFI on the Texas
veterinary net <texvetmed@tvma.org>. If we have canine PAM in Texas, logic
would suggest that it will occur elsewhere in the southern USA, including
Florida. Has anyone seen cases? Any replies will be copied to Craig. -

Meningoencephalitis in dogs in TX: _Naegleria fowleri_?

TVMDL [TX state diagnostic lab at College Station has had reports of
unexplained apparent meningoencephalitis in dogs over the last month. I've
been following the outbreaks of Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM)
in people in Texas due to the parasite _Naegleria fowleri_ which is
acquired by the respiratory route when swimming in stagnating water and am
wondering if we are seeing cases in dogs. The organism gains access to the
brain via the cribiform plate and is almost always fatal.
Have any other practitioners in TX seen any unusual cases like this in
dogs? In live animals, Dr. Tom Craig would recommend submitting CSF fluid
for analysis -- the organism can be visualized, there will be leukocytosis
and elevated protein in the CSF. In dead animals, collect CSF and also
submit the whole animal or at least the brain for histopathology.
If you see animals with these signs, be sure to ask the owner if the dog
has been swimming in the last few days.
