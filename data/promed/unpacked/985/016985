1st report of _Erwinia amylovora_ in Tunisia
--------------------------------------------
In Tunisia, fireblight caused by _Erwinia amylovora_ (EPPO A2 List) was found for the 1st time on pear (_Pyrus communis_) trees in May 2012. Symptoms were observed on flowers and young shoots of _P. communis_ cv. 'Alexandrine' in one locality.

Surveys carried out in 2013 during winter and spring showed that fireblight has spread to several governorates. Infection levels varied according to cultivars and regions. The 1st detection and confirmation of _E. amylovora_ was performed by the Quarantine Laboratory of DGPCQPA (Ministry of Agriculture) in collaboration with the Olive Institute laboratory, and in accordance with the EPPO Diagnostic Protocol for _E. amylovora_ [see link below].

An official control program is being established by the Tunisian NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] which includes the destruction of highly infected trees and pruning of infected twigs followed by treatment with copper fungicide of trees with limited infections.

1st reports of _Erwinia amylovora_ in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
---------------------------------------------------------------
In Kazakhstan, symptoms resembling those caused by fireblight (_Erwinia amylovora_ - EPPO A2 List) have been observed by apple and pear growers in the Almaty area since 2008. In 2011, surveys were conducted in Almaty and Zhambyl province. Laboratory analysis confirmed the identify of _E. amylovora_ in several samples of pear (_Pyrus communis_) and apple (_Malus domestica_).

A national survey programme has been initiated. In 2012, surveys showed that the fireblight outbreak was restricted to Almaty province. Eradication and containment measures were taken and included the destruction of infected trees, as well as treatments with copper compounds. Research projects are being initiated in diagnosis and epidemiology of fireblight. It is finally noted that this 1st finding of _E. amylovora_ in Kazakhstan might be of particular interest to the scientific community as this territory is one of the centres of _Malus_ spp. origin and genetic diversity.

The source of introduction of fireblight into Kazakhstan is unknown. The disease may have been introduced by trade, as since 2003 import permits have been issued for pome fruit and ornamental plants from countries where _E. amylovora_ occurs. However, the disease may also have spread naturally from the bordering regions of Kyrgyzstan.

In Kyrgyzstan, fireblight 1st appeared in 2008/2009 in the Chuy province. In 2011, it was also found in Issyk Kul province with outbreaks in several localities.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers), and with plant material (including budwood). Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk. The pathogen has been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season, and consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations. A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern (for example, ProMED-mail post 20120111.1006401).

In North Africa, fireblight appears to be spreading. It was reported from Morocco in 2006 and more recently also from Tunisia's immediate neighbour Algeria (ProMED-mail posts 20070321.0990 and 20110928.2939). For Kazakhstan, the decision to allow import of planting material of susceptible hosts from fireblight areas would have dramatically increased the risk of acquiring the disease.
