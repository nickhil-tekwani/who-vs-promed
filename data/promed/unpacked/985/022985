Negeri Sembilan has been gazetted as a _Brucella abortus_ disease area which can lead to cattle being infected by the disease to suffer miscarriage, sterility and could lead to death [see comment] after 3 cases were detected in the state.

The disease can also infect humans if meat that is infected by the disease is consumed [comment].

Negeri Sembilan Menteri Besar [Chief Minister] Datuk Seri [Malaysian honorary title] Mohamad Hasan said the gazette enabled the Veterinary Services Department to carry out checks on all animal farms to prevent the spread of the disease and facilitating the process of paying compensation to the affected farm operators.

"So far, we have detected 2 or 3 cases in the state where the disease was spread by the imported animals (cattle) which later attacked local cattle. So, in the next 2 or 3 days, we will pass the gazette and the Veterinary Services Department will carry out checks on the animal farms to take blood samples.

"Animals detected to have the disease will be disposed of immediately, and the farmers affected will be given compensation based on the number of animals that had to be disposed of according to the current market price," he said after chairing the EXCO meeting, here today [15 Feb 2017].

Mohamad said the gazette was made according to the Animals Act 1953 and if the gazette was not made, it would pose difficulties to the Veterinary Services Department to carry out its task, while compensation could not be paid out to the farmers affected.

He said members of the public need not panic over the development, as efforts were being taken to prevent the disease from spreading.

[Negeri Sembilan is one of Malaysia's 13 states, situated on the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia, bordering Selangor on the north, Pahang in the east, and Malacca and Johor to the south (map at http://tinyurl.com/zh83teu).

There are some statements in the above media report which deserve clarification/correction:

1. _B. abortus_ infection in cattle is not regarded to be fatal. The disease is usually asymptomatic in young animals and non-pregnant females. Following infection, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis, usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th month of pregnancy. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk. In acute infections, the organism is present in most major body lymph nodes. Adult male cattle may develop orchitis/epididymitis, and brucellosis may be a cause of infertility in both sexes.

2. Most human _B. abortus_ infections are direct, resulting from exposure to infected foeti, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges of attended cattle. Most indirect infections result from the consumption of unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized dairy products. While udders and testicles of infected cattle are of high risk, the consumption of meat (muscular tissue) from such animals is significantly less hazardous, and even allowed by some countries.

The Malaysian _B. abortus_ situation has recently been reviewed (Ref. 1). From the said reference, we hereby present the following extracted data.

The prevalence of bovine brucellosis _Brucella abortus_ in 2014 ranged between 1-2 percent in Thailand and Indonesia, and 4-5 percent in Malaysia and Myanmar. "Test-and slaughter" is the general policy against brucellosis adopted by most ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries to eradicate the disease. Under this program, the Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) is used as the screening test to identify infected farm/herd, while the complement fixation test (CFT) is the confirmatory test.

The "test-and-slaughter" method is expensive and internationally recommended as feasible only in countries where the prevalence rate does not exceed 2 percent and where surveillance and laboratory facilities are excellent. However, the small number of cattle in Malaysia of approximately 800 000 head made the program less expensive and feasible, and it was started in 1979.

The national bovine brucellosis eradication program had successfully reduced the prevalence of bovine brucellosis in Malaysia from 3.3 percent in 1979 to 0.23 in 1988 to approximately one percent in 1998, but was unable to eradicate the disease, which recurred to reach a prevalence of 5 percent in 2015. The failure of eradication was due to several factors, including inability to locate and identify the remaining affected animals and to control their movement, importation of breeder animals from non-brucellosis-free countries and lack of participation by the farmers who claimed that the program eliminated uninfected breeder animals following unreliable test results. To support the eradication policy, research activities since the 1980s have suggested combinations of serological tests to improve diagnosis, while surveillance should be focused on hot spot areas. The prevalence can be further reduced by strictly sourcing breeder animals from brucella-free areas or countries.
