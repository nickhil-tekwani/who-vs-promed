[It is very good news that no new cases or deaths are being reported, or as we see in the next report from 10 Sep 2018, very few cases/deaths, suggesting the interventions are working well. But WHO remains concerned that it is difficult to operate where there are armed groups in the region, suggesting that cases in these areas may be missed. - Mod.LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 9 Sep 2018.
A total of 132 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 101 confirmed and 31 probable.
Of the 101 confirmed, 60 died and 36 are cured.
- 9 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 1 new confirmed case in Butembo [North Kivu]. This is a man whose wife was one of the confirmed cases of Mandima [Ituri]. The tests on his blood samples were negative, but the Ebola virus was identified in his sperm. He became ill during August [2018] and was admitted to the Makeke health center in the Mandima health zone (Ituri). He refused to be transferred to Mangina's [North Kivu] Ebola treatment center (ETC) but fled to Butembo and his illness had progressed favourably. During his recovery period, his wife visited him. Later, she became ill and was confirmed as suffering from Ebola.
- 1 confirmed case death in Beni.
- 1 new person cured in Beni.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
The Ministry of Health has received a haemorrhagic fever alert in Kisangani, the provincial capital of Tshopo. These are 3 girls from the same family returning from a vacation in Mambasa, a neighboring town in Mandima health zone [Ituri] where 9 confirmed cases of Ebola were recorded. All 3 samples were collected and sent to the Beni laboratory for analysis. The results are negative.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 7780 people were vaccinated , including 3503 in Mabalako, 2284 in Beni, in 1257 Mandima 287 in Butembo, 220 Masereka, 121 Oicha, 70 and 38 to Katwa Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

[This update reports a false alarm that was quickly determined not to be Ebola in 3 girls in Kisangani, but it is unknown what other etiologic agent(s) were found or tested for. The update also raises the problem of sick people fleeing from the location of infection to a new location where the virus could potentially be transmitted further, and the issue of sexual transmission.

It appears Ebola virus was transmitted from a man to his wife after he had apparently recovered and virus was no longer detected in his serum. Sexual transmission, especially after a patient appears to have recovered, hinders control efforts.

The following letter to the editor of Journal of Infection and Public Health discusses the issue of Ebola virus RNA persistence in the semen. Although the authors state there is "...no evidence of any other verified sexually transmitted Ebola cases occurring..." there now is additional evidence. It would be informative to know whether infectious virus was detected in the semen or RNA only in this latest case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently we have been alarmed on the possibility of Ebola as a sexually transmitted infection. The primary mode of Ebola virus transmission is through direct contact with broken skin and bodily fluids of those acutely infected or deceased EVD patients. In early 2015, apart from one case in Liberia with a confirmed molecular evidence [1] and a few other inconclusive case reports, little is known on how significant is the sexual transmission risk of Ebola virus. At the same year, a Sierra Leone study reported Ebola virus in the semen of survivors is found to persist longer than the previously known duration of 3 months, some continued to have EV RNA detected by PCR analysis of their semen 7-9 months after the onset of EVD [2]. The WHO had not taken this new possible route of transmission lightly, as revision of its guidelines on the sexual practices of Ebola survivors were done promptly [3]. The prior recommendation of 3-months abstinence or protected sexual intercourse with condom has been prolonged to at least 6 months, in addition to conduct PCR testing on semen of survivors after 3 months, and regularly until is negative twice. Since then, more evidence has emerged, showing that there is a risk of viral persistence in semen. Although this suggests the plausibility of Ebola transmitting sexually from the survivors [4], most of the authors conclude that the presence of Ebola RNA in the semen is not an indication of the infectiousness of the virus. So far, there has been no evidence of any other verified sexually transmitted Ebola cases occurring. Further research on viral infectivity is needed to confirm if sexual activity has a direct role in disease transmission. In the meantime, all survivors should abstain from all sexual intercourse or at least practice safe sex for 6 months after the onset of symptoms or until their semen PCR testing is negative twice for Ebola.

[2] Assessment of outbreak status
- Sun 9 Sep 2018. The Ebola outbreak under control in its "epicenter" in the East
[Media Congo; in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-42103_l_epidemie_d_ebola_maitrisee_dans_son_epicentre_dans_l_est.html


Health authorities estimated Sat 8 Sep 2018 in Kinshasa that the evolution of the Ebola virus disease was under control in the "epicenter", 5 weeks after the declaration of the epidemic that has already caused 89 deaths in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

On 1 Aug 2018, the Minister of Health announced the occurrence of an Ebola outbreak in North Kivu province.

In the health zone of Mabalako where the majority of cases were reported at the beginning of the epidemic, "since 13 Aug 2018, there have been practically no more cases; we can say that the situation is controlled at the level of the epicenter," said Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, Minister of Health, during a press conference.

"To date, we have 129 cases (including 31 probable and 98 confirmed), 89 deaths, and 33 patients who have been cured," he said. [See updated numbers from 10 Sep 2018, above. - Mod.LK]

The concern mounted a notch on Thu 6 Sep 2018, after the announcement of the 1st 2 deaths in Butembo, hub of DRC trade with neighboring countries, such as Uganda. They were a woman and a caregiver who had been in contact with her.

"Even in Butembo, the situation is not critical" at this stage, Minister Oly Ilunga assured during this joint conference with Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, a Congolese researcher and pioneer in the fight against Ebola.

Professor Muyembe nevertheless called on all Congolese to be "vigilant" to alert the health authorities about suspected cases.

"The Ebola virus circulates here in Africa in general, and in the DRC in all provinces; we must be vigilant," he insisted.

The 10th Ebola epidemic on Congolese soil since the outbreak of the virus in 1976 occurred in an area of great insecurity, due to the presence of dozens of armed groups.

"The security dimension did not stop the teams from doing their job, going to the patients, we had the support of the army, the police, and Monusco (UN Mission in the DRC)," said Minister Oly Ilunga.

The end of the previous epidemic was declared on 24 Jul 2018 in Equateur province (north west), with a death toll of 33.

- Mon 10 Sep 2018. Ebola fight has new science but faces old hurdles in restive Congo
[Reuters, edited]

[Byline: Fiston Mahamba]

[...]

The fight against Ebola has advanced more in recent years than in any since it was discovered near the Congo River in 1976. [...]

Now there's an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck which already this year [2018] helped quash an earlier outbreak of this strain of the virus on the other side of the country in under 3 months. And there are the cube treatment centers, pioneered by the Senegal-based medical charity, ALIMA [Alliance for International Medical Action].

"With this system ... where there are not people donning masks, the patients feel reassured and perceive that there is life here," said Claude Mahoudeau, ALIMA's coordinator for the Ebola outbreak in Beni.

In addition, 3 experimental treatments have been rolled out for the 1st time, offering patients additional reason to hope that their diagnosis is not a death sentence.

Yet even the smartest science can do little about the marauding rebel groups and widespread fear and mistrust that could yet scupper efforts to contain Congo's tenth outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever.

The latest outbreak is so far believed to have killed 90 people since July [2018] and infected another 40.

The stakes are high, not just for health reasons. Ebola could complicate Congo's 1st democratic change of power, the holding of a [23 Dec 2018] election to replace President Joseph Kabila that is already 2 years late.

Rebellion, fear, mistrust
-------------------------
The affected North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been a tinderbox of armed rebellion and ethnic killing since 2 civil wars in the late 1990s. Some areas near the epicenter require armed escorts to reach because of insecurity. 2 South African peacekeepers there were wounded in a rebel ambush last week.

And last week [week of 3 Sep 2018], authorities confirmed the 1st death from Ebola in the major trading hub of Butembo, a city of almost a million people near the border with Uganda, dampening hopes that the virus was being brought under control.

On Mon [10 Sep? 2018], the World Health Organization (WHO) said more than 60 of its experts had arrived in the city and that a mobile laboratory had started testing samples.

Insecurity aside, the biggest challenges the government faces could be panic and downright denial, as they were during the catastrophic West Africa outbreak.

"Ebola does not exist in Beni," resident Tresor Malala said, shaking his head. "For a long time, people got sick with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and they healed. Now someone gets a fever, they get sent to the Ebola treatment center and then they die."

Taxi driver MK was equally skeptical: "The only people dying are the ones going to the ... treatment center."

Tackling these perceptions will be crucial if authorities are to halt the epidemic.

At a news conference on [Sat 8 Sep 2018], Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga acknowledged that "community resistance is the 1st challenge to the response to the epidemic."

In the district of Ndindi, in Beni, Ebola is spreading due to the community's reluctance to cooperate with health workers, the ministry says. Some locals have hidden sick relatives or refused to be vaccinated.

The problem, says schoolteacher AM, many of whose pupils were being kept at home by anxious parents, is that locals have little understanding of Ebola. "If the population of Beni continues to show this distrust," he said, "this disease will consume the whole town."
