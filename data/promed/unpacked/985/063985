Records show there have been 5 deaths due to dengue so far this year
[1999, including 2 from Colombo. The total number of dengue cases in the
country is 95, of which 18 are in Colombo.
Medical Research Institute (MRI) Director Dr. Gaya Colombage says that it
is a viral disease [caused by 4 different types of viruses. There is no
specific vaccine or drug to combat the disease.
Anyone of any age group could be susceptible to the dengue virus. But it
could take a dangerous form [dengue hemorrhagic fever in the age group 5
to 9 years.
Dengue has been endemic in Sri Lanka from the beginning of this century.
The disease became significantly evident in 1965. Thereafter, only a few
cases were recorded up to about 1989.
1996 had been the worst year of all, when 54 dengue deaths were recorded.
The suspected number of cases was 1294, out of which Colombo had 525. The
rest were from Kurunegala, Kandy, Galle and Batticaloa.
Investigations have revealed that the spread of dengue virus is closely
linked to monsoonal showers. The South-West monsoon begins towards the
latter part of May and extends up to September. Then the North-East
monsoon starts in late November and continues till about the end of
February. The months of June and July are found to be the worst times for
the spread of this disease.
Transmission of disease is by a vector mosquito known as _Aedes aegypti_,
which breeds in clear water. It attacks humans during the daytime. It takes
about 10-14 days to develop from egg to adult, and is capable of flying
about a mile. People are advised to keep a close watch on places where
water collects; some of the most frequent would be discarded tires, coconut
shells, damaged drains, ant traps, roof-gutters and septic tanks. The heaps
of discarded items [collecting rainwater at various street corners provide
ideal places for breeding of the vector mosquito.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) sources said residents urged spraying
of insecticides in their areas. Such spraying was carried out round the
clock in many places. Yet, practically it may not be easy to carry out this
task effectively. "Is it possible for our men to go inside houses and spray
their ant traps or roof gutters?" a CMC source asked.
CMC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tissa Seneviratne said they had taken
measures to educate school children on dengue prevention methods. This was
started last year by training 2 teachers from each school about the
disease. Over 300 teachers were educated in 150 schools in the city. This
year children in 18 schools, so far, have been given knowledge about the
disease. It was provided by the Public Health Inspectors (PHIs), health
educators and medical officers of the CMC.
