The UN has warned that an outbreak of polio in Sudan could lead to a spread
of the disease to other countries in the region unless it is quickly contained.
UN and government officials held an emergency meeting on Thursday in the
Sudanese capital, Khartoum, to discuss how to contain the disease amidst
reports that 79 new cases had been recorded across the country.
"This is quite dramatic, considering there were no reported cases of polio
[in 2003]," Ben Parker, communication officer for the UN Chidren's Fund
(UNICEF) in Sudan told IRIN on Friday.
"Sudan was well underway to being officially declared polio-free, but the
country has now become the number 2 or 3 in the world in terms of the
number of polio cases reported [in 2004]," he added. 32 of the reported
cases were found in the state of Khartoum, while Unity state and Western
Upper Nile in the south each reported 5 cases.
The disease spread across at least 10 nations in Africa this year after
vaccination in some states of northern Nigeria was suspended in mid-2003
amid concerns from local religious leaders about the safety of the oral
vaccine. Those concerns were later proved baseless and vaccination has resumed.
Initial testing indicated that both the genetic P-1 strain, related to
reported cases in Nigeria, and the unrelated P-3 strain were present in
Sudan, suggesting that the outbreak might have resulted from both imported
and locally transmitted cases.
"Given the insecurity in certain regions of Sudan, there has not been full
access to all areas during previous polio campaigns," Parker added. "It
seems that there have been a few pockets where the P-3 strain managed to
survive. You cannot drop your guard," he added, "it is a very persistent
organism."
The UN World Health Organization and UNICEF will conduct a polio
vaccination campaign across the whole of the country next month. Parker
said the campaign, in both government and rebel-held areas, would start on
10 Jan 2004.
Polio -- poliomyelitis -- is a highly infectious and incurable disease
caused by a virus that affects mainly children under 3 years of age. It
invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
The virus enters the body through the mouth and multiplies in the
intestines. Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting,
stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs. One in 200 infections leads to
irreversible paralysis, which is usually in the legs.

[Information on the total reported cases by country of report can be found
at the polio eradication website:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/fixed/casecount.shtml>.
Of note in the above news article is mention of the identification of polio
type 3 virus in some cases, indicating that there was circulation within
the country not attributable to the ongoing outbreak in Nigeria, which
involved a polio type 1 virus. (There are 3 major wild poliovirus types,
type 1, type 2, and type 3.) In the most recent Polio Lab Network Quarterly
report available (Sep 2004) at the WHO vaccines website there is mention
that the type 1 poliovirus identified earlier in the year in the Sudan was
genetically linked to viruses in Chad (which in turn were linked to the
ongoing outbreak in Nigeria).
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/poliolab/2004/VolumeXIssue3Sept04.pdf>
Sudan belongs to the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of WHO, where as of
the Sep 2004 lab report there had been 6 identifications of wild poliovirus
type 3 in 2004.
An interpretation of the identification of wild poliovirus type 3 in some
of the cases is that there has most likely been continued circulation of
type 3 poliovirus in the country, in the absence of detection of clinical
cases, prior to this current outbreak. This raises a concern that the
level of surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) may have
been suboptimal during the interval (3 years) during which there was
apparent interruption of transmission of the wild poliovirus circulation in
the country -- perhaps not unrelated to the civil unrest in the country
impeding health initiatives. - Mod.MPP]
