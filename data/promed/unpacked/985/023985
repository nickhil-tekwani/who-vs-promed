Vector status of _Aedes albopictus_
-----------------------------------
I have been following the outbreak of chikungunya in the Reunion Islands,
and numerous unofficial reports are describing _Aedes albopictus_ as the
vector responsible for the outbreak. _Aedes albopictus_ appears to be an
efficient laboratory vector of chikungunya virus -- for example, Turell MJ,
Beaman JR. J Med Entomol 1992; 29: 802-5 -- but as far as I know there has
never been an actual isolation of the virus from wild-caught specimens.
Indeed, there seems to be no evidence that _Ae. albopictus_ has actually
been the vector of CHIK in any outbreaks -- for example, Gratz NG. Med Vet
Entomol 2004; 18: 215-27.
Has there actually been any isolation of CHIK virus from _Ae. albopictus_
in the Reunion Islands? Or is there any reliable evidence that _Ae.
albopictus_ is indeed the vector? Any information on this regard would be
most appreciated.

[In response to the above query from Dr Derraik about whether there is any
evidence that the mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ is a proven vector of
chikungunya virus -- the answer appears to be no. But it has long been
suspected as a possible vector based on the culture of the virus in cell
lines and laboratory infections of female adult mosquitoes.
Several recent publications in the news media and scientific press,
however, say it is strongly suspected as a vector in Reunion. Other reports
say it is the vector. For example the paper by Martin Enserink in the
journal Science (2006; 311: 1085, 24 Feb) and <http://www.sante.gouv.fr/>
both declare it is the vector, but present no evidence. All I can add at
this stage is that a well-respected medical entomologist presently on an
international mission in Reunion believes the vector on the island is
likely to be _Ae. albopictus_, as does another renowned medical
entomologist based in a research laboratory in France who has worked on
dengue. I might add that the usual suspect vector, _Aedes aegypti_, is
uncommon on Reunion, and moreover the adults rarely bite people (Salvan M,
Mouchet J. Ann Soc Belge Trop 1994; 74: 323-6).
Evidence for the role of _Ae. albopictus_ in the transmission of
chikungunya virus remains rather unsatisfactory, but hopefully the vector
on Reunion will soon be identified, and if it proves to be _Ae.
albopictus_, this will show that this mosquito can -- at least in certain
situations -- transmit chikungunya virus. - Mod.MS]
