Preliminary tests have found that avian influenza has killed 2 more
siblings in Indonesia, officials said on Fri 26 May 2006, as the country
grapples with a separate outbreak involving the largest family cluster ever
reported.
Local tests found that a brother and sister from West Java who died earlier
this week were infected by the H5N1 virus, said Nyoman Kandun, head of the
Health Ministry's office of communicable disease control. The tests will be
sent to a World Health Organization laboratory for further confirmation.
WHO officials so far have confirmed 33 human deaths from bird flu in
Indonesia, out of 124 worldwide. The latest victims, an 18-year-old boy and
his 10-year-old sister, died on Tue 23 May 2005 in the state-run Hasan
Sidikin hospital in Bandung, the capital city of West Java, said Achmad, an
official at the Ministry's special task force post for bird flu, who uses
only one name. They died within hours of each other less than a day after
arriving at the hospital, he said.
The newest cases come as Indonesia is struggling with a different family
cluster in northern Sumatra where 6 of seven family members died of bird
flu, the most recent on Mon 22 May 2006. An 8th family member who died was
buried before tests could be done, but she was also considered to be among
those infected with bird flu. WHO officials have not been able to link the
family members to contact with infected birds, and have said it's possible
limited human-to-human transmission may have occurred. Similar isolated
cases of transmission among humans is believed to have occurred in 4 or 5
other family clusters, said WHO spokesman Dick Thompson. But the Indonesia
case is the largest ever reported. However, the WHO has stressed the virus
has not mutated in any way and has shown no signs of spreading outside the
family -- all blood relatives who had very close contact with each other.
A team of international health experts and villagers is closely monitoring
the area where the family lived in northern Sumatra to ensure no one else
experiences flu-like symptoms. About 30 people in the village of Kubu
Sembelang have been asked to stay inside their homes and avoid close
contact as a precautionary measure, Thompson said. Experts also are
exploring whether the first woman sickened in the family may have had
contact with sick or dead chickens. She also worked at a market where
chickens were sold and may have used chicken feces as a garden fertilizer,
WHO officials have said.

[2] North Sumatra

Chickens are dying in unusually large numbers in a remote area in Indonesia
where avian influenza killed several members of a family, and experts say
the first victim in the cluster was probably infected by a diseased
chicken. For weeks now, health experts have been trying to hunt down the
source that introduced the H5N1 avian influenza virus to the family in Kubu
Sembilang village in north Sumatra, killing as many as 7 of them.
The case has drawn immense interest because it is the largest known family
cluster involving H5N1 and the World Health Organisation (WHO) said this
week that limited human-to-human transmission between members of the family
might have occurred.
Tests done on samples from pigs, chickens and ducks in the area have been
inconclusive and experts have long maintained that nothing can be ruled
out. This is the first time that they have narrowed down the likely source
to poultry. "What we're finding out the longer our team stays up in that
area is that there are many, many outbreaks in chickens that always go
unreported," stated Steven Bjorge, an epidemiologist with the WHO. "Just in
the past couple of weeks they have found a couple of outbreaks of chickens
dying in various villages in that area ... that raises the very real
possibility that people can come into contact with this virus."
Referring to the first victim in the cluster, a 37-year-old woman who died
on May 4, Bjorge said: "The first case has to get it from somewhere. It has
to be something environmental." Asked if sick chickens were responsible for
this index case, he said: "We think that it has to be that way."
The WHO has stressed that even if human-to-human transmission did occur, it
was in a very limited way and the infection had not spread beyond the
initial cluster. In addition, scientific evidence had shown the virus had
not mutated into one that can be easily passed among people -- a necessary
precursor for a pandemic to start.
Although Bjorge said it was up to Indonesia's Agriculture Ministry to find
out if the chickens were indeed dying of H5N1, he said Indonesia was awash
with the virus. "Basically, the virus is totally endemic in Indonesia,
thoroughly entrenched in backyard chickens. That doesn't mean they are
dying every day in the same house. It jumps from place to place," he added.

[Taken together these reports are consistent with limited person-to-person
transmission of H5N1 avian influenza virus among blood relatives (as
indicated by absence of transmission between husbands and wives) and some
form of contact with diseased poultry or poultry products. H5N1 avian
influenza virus is considered to be endemic throughout Indonesia on account
of poor containment of outbreaks, and perhaps protective immune responses
in flocks (e.g. following attempted vaccination) may mask the presence of
HPAI virus. However, until the source of the infection in the cluster of
human cases in North Sumatra is definitively identified, all such
interpretations remain speculative.
According to the FAO
(<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/special_avian.html>),
all laboratory examinations of samples -- mainly from chickens, ducks,
swine and manure -- have failed to detect the virus. Antibodies in a low
proportion of chickens and ducks could be consistent with known earlier
circulation of the avian flu virus in northern Sumatra in late 2005 and
early 2006. On the other hand, they could have resulted from vaccination.
An announcement that some swine from a nearby village had tested positive
for avian flu antibodies raised concern because this would have represented
a new development in the spread of the disease, opening up the possibility
of mammal to mammal transmission. However, all available evidence suggests
that swine play no role in the transmission of the current strain of H5N1
avian flu virus. Swine sera are difficult to examine and results need to be
confirmed by additional tests in a reference laboratory that can carry out
validated tests for influenza antibodies in swine. - Mod.CP]
