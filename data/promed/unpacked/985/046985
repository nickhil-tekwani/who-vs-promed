It's been a busy bird flu news day with H5N1 in Egypt, H7N9 in Hong Kong and mainland China, and for the past 10 hours, there have been cryptic Arabic twitter messages regarding supposed H5N1 cases in Libya, a country that has reported bird flu in poultry in the past but never any human infections.

Earlier this month [December 2014], FluTrackers also picked up a report of a suspected H5N1 case in Egypt, who had just returned from Libya, but the report was never confirmed. In the past hour, however, multiple news reports have emerged in the Arabic and English press, indicating that there have been 4 recent (time frame not specified) H5N1 deaths: 3 in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, and one in Tobruk. According to these reports, a 5th case is suspected, and the WHO has been notified. I've found nothing yet on the Libyan MOH website, but we have several media reports.

Four people have died of bird flu in Libya in recent days, the health minister of the country's internationally recognised government said. Rida al-Awkali said a 5th person suspected of having contracted the virus is currently in hospital in the far eastern city of Tobruk.

Three of the victims died in the capital Tripoli, while the 4th died in Tobruk, he added, without saying which strain of the disease they caught. Tobruk is across the border from Egypt where at least 8 people have died of bird flu this year [2014], according to health authorities in Cairo.

Awkali said that he will visit Tobruk on Sunday [28 Dec 2014] and then travel on to Egypt to meet experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), which closely monitors the various strains of avian influenza.

The H5N1 strain of bird flu has killed more than 400 people, mainly in South East Asia, since 1st appearing in 2003. Another strain, H7N9, has claimed more than 170 lives since emerging in 2013.

Libya's 1st case of bird flu was recorded at a Tobruk poultry farm in March [2014], but no people were infected. Again, officials did not reveal the strain of the virus. Awkali said that the WHO would be sending a delegation to Libya within 48 hours.

[If independently confirmed, Libya will become the 17th country to record confirmed human infections by avian H5N1 influenza virus, and the most westerly occurrence of human cases of avian H5N1 influenza virus. More detailed information is awaited. Elsewhere in recent months, human cases of avian A(H5N2) virus infection have been declining, with the exception of Egypt and Indonesia. - Mod.CP
