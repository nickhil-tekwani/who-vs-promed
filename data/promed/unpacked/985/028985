RABIES, WILD & DOMESTIC CANIDS - USA (ALASKA) 2007 (02): CORRECTION

[An alert ProMED reader, Vladimir Papic of
Belgrade, Serbia, pointed out that the Alaska
rabies story published in the Anchorage Daily
News
(<http://www.adn.com/life/story/488403.html>) as
reported in ProMED archive no. 20080810.2462,
giving the numbers of rabies cases diagnosed in
arctic foxes and wolves, was incorrect. ProMED
thanks him for bringing this to our attention.
The correct numbers of rabies cases in wild and
domestic canids in 2007 is given below. - Mod. TY]

From 1998-Â­2007, there were 232 cases of animal
rabies in Alaska. In 2007, the Alaska State
Virology Laboratory (ASVL) confirmed rabies in 45
of 104 animals submitted. Positive animals
included 24 red foxes, 17 arctic foxes, 3 dogs
and one wolf. Cases of animal rabies are
documented every year in Alaska, with epizootic
(epidemic in animals) peaks occurring every few
years. These peaks reflect the ecology and
population cycles of the wildlife reservoirs
(i.e., foxes and their food sources, small
rodents). The northern and western coastal areas
of Alaska are considered enzootic (i.e., the
disease is always present) for animal rabies;
most of the rest of Alaska has never had a confirmed case.
