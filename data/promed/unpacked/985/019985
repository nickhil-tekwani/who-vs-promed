In April 2016, Iraq reported 6 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the following regions: Dahuk, As Sulaymaniyah, Al Qadisiyah, Baghdad, Diyala, and Al Qadisiyah. According to the final report, the event was resolved on 7 May 2016. However, unfortunately, the disease continues spread in the country. The event summary and map are available at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=20093.

There is a high probability that the current subtype is similar to that reported on April 2016, which was identified as H5N1.
