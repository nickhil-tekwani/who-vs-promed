12 cases of Legionnaires' disease, a potentially fatal bacterial disease
with pneumonia-like symptoms, have been reported in Delaware since 29 May
2003, health officials said. 2 people died from the disease.
Dr. Maureen Dempsey, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health,
said the cases do not appear to be related and there is no public health
risk. But health officials will continue to investigate whether there is
any connection because of the number of cases reported in a short time
period, she said.
"There are no common denominators between any of the infections that leads
us to believe there is an outbreak," Dempsey said. "There is no cluster of
cases, no common source, or related factors." 7 of the 12 cases were
reported in New Castle County, and 2 were in Sussex. 3 cases involved non-
residents who received care in Delaware.
The range for Legionnaires' cases in the state is 16 to 22 in any given
year, Dempsey said. There was an average 13.8 cases per year in Delaware
between 1995 and 2002, she said.
The disease is not spread through person-to-person contact. It is [usually
- Mod.LL] contracted by inhaling mists from an infected water source, such
as cooling towers and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning
systems, whirlpool spas and showers, according to the state Department of
Health and Social Services. People may be exposed to these mists in homes,
workplaces, hospitals, or public places. The disease can be treated with
antibiotics.
The southern Atlantic region has shown an increase in Legionnaires' cases
so far this year, with 161 reported cases, up from 89 in 2002, Dempsey
said. The region includes Delaware, Washington, D.C., Virginia, West
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. She could
not explain the increase in cases and said the cases were isolated.
There were 549 reported cases in the United States for the week ending 28
Jun 2003. That number is up from 416 at the same time last year, state
health officials said.
About 8000 to 18 000 people get Legionnaires' disease in the United States
each year, and 5 percent to 15 percent die from it, Dempsey said. The
disease is most common among middle-age and older people, especially those
who smoke or have chronic lung disease.

[The warmer months of the year provide more opportunities for _L.
pneumophila_ to spread to humans. Although the posting implies that no
epidemiological association exists among these cases, such a link may be
difficult to find. Analysis of the strains (if available) by molecular
typing could determine whether they were identical. - Mod.LL]
