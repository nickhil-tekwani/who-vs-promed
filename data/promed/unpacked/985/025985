The transmission of the vesicular stomatitis viruses is via arthropods but although vertebrates do develop antibodies to the virus the demonstration of viraemias has proven difficult; see: Mead DG, Ramberg FB, Besselsen DG, Mare CJ. Transmission of vesicular stomatitis virus from infected to noninfected black flies co-feeding on nonviremic deer mice.
