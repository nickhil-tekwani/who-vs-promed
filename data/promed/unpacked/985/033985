Second Cheung Chau bird flu scare in days
------------------------------------
A dead oriental magpie robin, which was found in Cheung Chau, has tested positive for the H5 bird flu virus in preliminary checks, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said yesterday [29 Feb 2012]. This is the second bird of the species found with the H5 virus on the island within two days this month. In the latest incident, the robin, which is common to Hong Kong, was found and collected at Hok Loo Lane. The department is now conducting further confirmatory tests to check if the virus is the deadly H5N1.

A dead oriental magpie robin was found on the rooftop of a building on Hing Lung Back Street in Cheung Chau on Saturday [25 Feb 2012]. Testing also revealed H5 and confirmatory test results are pending. "It is not a huge surprise that the two birds of the same species were found dead in Cheung Chau within two days, especially in winter," said Billy Hau Chi-hang, University of Hong Kong assistant professor in biodiversity and conservation. "One bird may come in contact with another, which has already contracted the H5 avian influenza virus."

The department also announced on Tuesday [28 Feb 2012] that a crested goshawk, which is not common to Hong Kong, also tested positive for H5. [This goshawk] was found at Diocesan Boys' School in Argyle Street, Mong Kok, on Friday [24 Feb 2012].
Seven dead birds were confirmed with bird flu H5N1 in January and February this year.

The department has stepped up disinfection and cleansing work.

[H5N1 outbreaks involving poultry and wild birds in Hong Kong have been occurring since December 2011 (http://web.oie.int/wahis/reports/en_fup_0000011553_20120127_123726.pdf).

Oriental magpie robins (_Copsychus saularis_) are small passerine birds distributed in most of the Indian Subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia; they are common birds in urban gardens as well as forests. They are not migratory birds. For a picture of an oriental magpie robin see http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Copsychus_saularis_-_Ang_Khang.jpg.
