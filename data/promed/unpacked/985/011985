***[Note: this is a delayed report which has not yet been officially
confirmed - Mod.JW]***
PANA has learned from medical sources that 22 cases of YF have been
registered in Yomou, Guine Forestiere, more than 1000 km south west of the
capital, Conakry. A vaccination campaign for all ages will be carried out
from 16--26 Aug 2003. Mobile 10 man teams will cover the whole Yomou area.
They have 20 000 doses of vaccine for a population of 150 000. A similar
campaign was launched in 2002 in Macenta (Guine Forestiere), where the
disease caused some 10 deaths [in fact 24 deaths were reported -- see
references below. - Mod.JW].

[This outbreak is 100 km from the site of the one in late 2002 in Macenta,
but both towns are on the border with Liberia, which should be on the
lookout for cases. Liberia has not reported any YF since August 2001.
Sierra Leone, which also borders Guinea, has just reported an outbreak of
YF -- see reference below. - Mod.JW]
