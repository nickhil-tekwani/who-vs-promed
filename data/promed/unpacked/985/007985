The New Mexico Department of Health is telling the state's residents that it's more important to be concerned about the flu than the virus receiving attention globally.

The department said the COVID-19 virus should be subject to "heightened awareness" but that the flu "remains a more significant illness" in New Mexico.

Health Secretary Kathy Kunke says there haven't been any cases of the virus in New Mexico but that the flu season is continuing with hospitals and clinics still reporting many cases.

Eleven flu-related deaths, including one child, were reported in North Carolina last week, health officials announced Thursday [20 Feb 2020].

The 11 deaths were reported during the week of 9-15 Feb 2020, bringing the state total to 90 flu-related deaths since the season began in late September 2019, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

Three children have died of flu-related illnesses in the state this season [2019-2020], officials say. The death of a child between the ages of 5 and 17 was reported last week.

Two weeks ago, a child under the age of 5 died, The News & Observer reported.

The majority of deaths in the state have been among those ages 65 and older, the health department says.

By this time last year [2019], 58 flu-related deaths had been reported in the state, according to health officials. A total of 203 deaths were reported last season [2018-2019].

There were 1146 positive cases of the virus reported in the state last week, bringing the total to more than 8300 cases since the season started, the health department says.

Last flu season [2018-2019], the state had more than 9200 positive cases of the virus.

Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported 92 pediatric flu-related deaths this season [2019-2020].

The Indian arm of German software group SAP said on Thu 20 Feb 2020 it had shut down all offices in the country for sanitisation after 2 of its employees in the city of Bengaluru tested positive for the H1N1 virus.

SAP India offices in Bengaluru -- considered the tech hub of India -- Gurgaon and Mumbai have been temporarily closed, and all employees have been asked to work from home till further notice, SAP said in an emailed statement.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), H1N1 symptoms include fever, chills and sore throat similar to seasonal influenza but has been characterised by higher fatality rates among healthy young adults and higher incidence of viral pneumonia.

Swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] has claimed its 1st victim this year [2020] while the number of cases has reached 11.

The Health Department has sounded an alert in the state [Himachal Pradesh], asking the chief medical officers to issue an advisory to the public to take preventive measures. According to the surveillance officer, [influenza A/H1N1] claimed the life of a patient at the PGI a few days ago. The patient belonged to Shimla [capital city of Himachal Pradesh].

As many as 11 patients -- 9 in Shimla, one each in Kangra and Mandi [districts in Himachal Pradesh state] -- have tested positive this year [2020], said Dr Sonam Negi, state disease surveillance officer.

The 2 [influenza A/H1N1] patients were admitted to the isolation ward of the IGMC [Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla] said a senior consultant of the hospital. Most of the [influenza A/H1N1] cases have been reported in Shimla for the last 5 days. Professor of Medicine, IGMC, Dr Jatinder Kumar Mokta said the [influenza A/H1N1] was a seasonal viral infection prevailing in the environment and that there was no cause for panic.

"This virus can be checked by maintaining personal hygiene and taking precautionary measures by patients. People should wash hands, avoid handshakes, and drink warm water, and the patients suffering from cold should take rest at home," Dr Mokta said.

"Patients and their attendants and staff are advised to wear masks," Dr Mokta said. "People should avoid visiting crowded places and wash their hands frequently and take a lot of liquids. They should use cover while sneezing and coughing," he added. Though the intensity of [influenza A/H1N1] as compared to last year [2019] is much less, the sudden spurt in the cases has sounded an alert, as weather has been changing fast.

In 2019-20, the [influenza A/H1N1] toll was 30, while the number of cases was 330 till [19 Feb 2020], said Dr Negi. But this year [2020], there was one death, while the numbers of cases were 11, he added. Dr Negi said that of 109 patients tested for [influenza A/H1N1], 69 were at the IGMC and 40 at the government medical college, Tanda. The CMOs [Chief Medical Officers] have been alerted. The January-March period is the flu season, Negi said.

[Seasonal influenza (or "flu") is most often caused by type A or B influenza viruses. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and a runny nose. The cough can be severe and can last 2 or more weeks. Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention. However, influenza can cause severe illness or death in high-risk groups (see Who is most at risk? below).

Seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, from October to March in the northern hemisphere and April to September in the southern hemisphere. In tropical and subtropical countries, seasonal influenza can happen all year round.
People most at risk for severe seasonal influenza are:
- pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy
- children younger than 5 years
- people older than 65 years
- people with chronic medical conditions such as HIV/AIDS, asthma, heart and lung diseases and diabetes
- people with increased risk of exposure to influenza, which includes health care workers.

Influenza can spread quickly between people when an infected person coughs or sneezes, dispersing droplets of the virus into the air. It can also be spread by hands contaminated by the virus.

Precautionary measures should be taken to limit transmission. People should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing, then throw it out and wash their hands thoroughly and regularly.

The best way to avoid getting the flu is to get the flu vaccine every year. Influenza viruses evolve constantly, and twice a year, WHO makes recommendations to update the vaccine compositions. For the 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza season, the vaccine formulation was updated in February 2016 to contain 2 type A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), and a type B virus.

WHO recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups including healthcare workers. People should ideally get vaccinated just before the influenza season begins for the most effective coverage, although getting vaccinated at any time during the influenza season can still help prevent flu infections. - Mod.UBA
