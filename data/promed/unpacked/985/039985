Confirmation of European bat lyssavirus type 2 in Lancashire bat
----------------------------------------------------------------
On Sat 28 Sep 2002 a Daubenton's bat submitted to the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA), Weybridge, in the United Kingdom, as part of the
routine passive surveillance of bats, tested positive for rabies antigen
using the fluorescent antibody test (FAT). Further tests on the bat sample
were performed, including a rabies tissue culture inoculation test (RTCIT)
and pan-lyssavirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These confirmed the
presence of a lyssavirus infection. A 350 base-pair fragment was sequenced
from the PCR product which when aligned with a panel of lyssavirus
sequences showed that the virus was related to the European lyssavirus 2
EBL2) group. This case represents only the second confirmed case of an EBL
type 2 virus in an insectivorous bat submitted to the VLA. The first, also
in a Daubenton's bat, was in 1996.

[The above update corrects a misstatement by Mod.CP in the first post in
this thread, quoted from a published source, that the previous bat
lyssavirus isolated in the UK in 1996 was identified as EBL type 1.
It is relevant to point out that the type 1 and type 2 European
lyssaviruses, isolated from bats in Northern Europe, belong to genotypes 5
and 6 of the rabies group of viruses, whereas the insectivorous bat rabies
viruses associated with human rabies in North America all belong to
genotype 1, as do the classical terrestrial mammal and vaccine strains of
rabies virus.
The article reproduced below gives a fuller account of the background. -

Sporadic case of bat rabies in the United Kingdom
-------------------------------------------------
On 28 Sep 2002 a sporadic case of a lyssavirus in a Daubenton's bat
(_Myotis daubentonii_) was detected in the United Kingdom using the
fluorescent antibody test, as reported in this week's Communicable Disease
Report (1). Further tests on the bat sample were performed, including a
rabies tissue culture inoculation test and pan lyssavirus polymerase chain
reaction. These confirmed the presence of a lyssavirus. A 350 base-pair
fragment was sequenced from the PCR product which, when aligned with a
panel of lyssavirus sequences, demonstrated that the virus was related to
the European lyssavirus 2 (EBL2) group. These findings are similar to those
made in the first case of EBL in the UK, when, in 1996, a Daubenton's bat
infected with an EBL type 2 virus was discovered in Newhaven, Sussex (2).
The virus from the bat found in Newhaven had genomic sequence homology with
viruses from the Franco-Swiss border suggesting that this might have been a
migrant bat.
Bats are distributed extremely widely throughout the world and are the only
mammals that can fly. They are still persecuted by man and in many areas of
the world are becoming an endangered species. Throughout Europe bats are
afforded legal protection and are listed as "European protected species"
(3). In the UK, bats must not be killed and their roosts must not be
damaged (Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981,
<http://www.jncc.gov.uk/species/protect/default.htm>).
During the 1920s in Brazil, rabies virus (RV) was identified in
insectivorous bats and in the 1930s in frugivorous and insectivorous bats
in Trinidad. However, it was not until a young boy in Florida in the United
States was bitten on the chest by an RV infected insectivorous bat in 1953
that the interest in rabies in bats intensified.
Classical rabies virus is one of 7 lyssaviruses; all 7 are capable of
causing clinically indistinguishable fatal disease in man. In Europe 2 of
these lyssaviruses referred to as European bat lyssaviruses types 1 and 2
(EBLs) pose a risk to any individual that may come into contact with an
infected bat and are thus are considered emerging zoonoses. In Europe, only
3 human deaths from EBLs have been reported. In all 3 cases, there was no
record of prophylactic rabies immunisation. No properly RV vaccinated
person, nor person given proper post-exposure treatment, has died of rabies
following a bite from a European bat.
A total of 630 EBL cases in bats have been confirmed in Europe between 1977
and 2000, mainly in Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany (4). In addition,
low levels of EBL cross-species transmission events have been reported in
Europe. In 1998, an EBL type 1 virus infection was identified in 3 Danish
sheep (5). More recently an EBL type 1 was detected in a stone marten in
Germany (6).
