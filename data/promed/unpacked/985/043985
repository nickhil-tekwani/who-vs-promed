We report the 1st RT-PCR positive results for West Nile virus (WNV) RNA in Eurasian magpies (_Pica pica_), which were found dead during the latest re-emergence of the disease in Argolida, Peloponnese region, Southern Greece. Until 9 Aug 2017, a total of 20 human WNV cases with 2 deaths were reported in the same region of Argolida. IgM-capture ELISA seropositive results from horses in the area have been recently reported.

From late June 2017, dead wild birds (_Pica pica_, _Corvus corone cornix_) were reported to be found in different areas of Argolida, Peloponnese region; Aria, Inachos, Ireo and Nafplio. Until mid-July 2017, a noticeable reduction of the native wild bird population, especially Eurasian magpies, was mentioned by locals. Moreover, the presence of wild birds with neurological signs was verified near Inachos; affected birds were lethargic, unable to fly, stayed low to the ground and had no reaction to external stimuli (i.e. human presence). During the 4th week of July 2017, 20 dead Eurasian magpies were collected in a radius of 300 meters from that point near Inachos for WNV molecular detection.

Tissue samples were obtained only from fresh bird corpses, and total RNA was extracted from brain and pools of liver, spleen and kidney tissue. RT-PCR was performed using different primer pairs targeting various regions of WNV genome, and viral RNA was detected in brain and tissue pools. Sequence analysis in positive samples from 2 wild birds confirmed the detection of WNV that was subsequently clustered with lineage 2 strains. These are the 1st results of an ongoing study for the surveillance of WNV in wild birds in the Peloponnese Region, while collection of more samples and efforts for recording clinical signs are continuing.

[West Nile virus (WNV, Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is an emerging zoonotic arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) widely distributed throughout the world and with considerable impact both on public health and on animal health [1]. It was 1st isolated in 1937 from the blood of a febrile woman in the West Nile district of Uganda, hence the name of the virus [2]. WNV is maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosquitoes as transmission vectors and certain birds as reservoir hosts. Spillover from this cycle occasionally results in severe outbreaks.

West Nile virus has been detected in a variety of bird species. Some infected birds, especially crows and jays, are known to get sick and die from the infection. Reporting and testing of dead birds is one way to check for the presence of West Nile virus in the environment. Some surveillance programs rely on citizens to report dead bird sightings to local authorities.

West Nile virus is transmitted to birds through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected by biting infected birds. Some birds that are predators (such as hawks and owls) or scavengers (such as crows) may become infected after eating sick or dead birds that were already infected with West Nile virus.

Since West Nile virus was discovered in the United States in 1999, the virus has been detected in over 300 species of dead birds. Although some infected birds, especially crows and jays, frequently die of infection, most birds survive.

Wildlife agencies routinely investigate sick or dead bird events if large numbers are impacted. This type of reporting could help with the early detection of illnesses like West Nile virus or avian influenza (bird flu), known to cause deaths in birds.

There is no evidence that a person can get infected from handling live or dead infected birds. However, you should avoid bare-handed contact when handling any dead animal. If you must pick up a dead bird, use gloves or an inverted plastic bag to place the bird's carcass (body) in a garbage bag [3].
