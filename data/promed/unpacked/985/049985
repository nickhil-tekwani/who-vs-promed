Panic as cholera spreads in North West
--------------------------------------
The cholera outbreak, which has been causing panic in Kanana township near
Orkney in the North West Province, seems to be spreading to nearby towns.
A 56 year old man from Leeuwdoringstad has been admitted in a critical
condition in hospital after contracting the disease. He is the first
cholera patient from outside Kanana township and has been admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit.
About 151 people tested positive for cholera at the Klerksdorp hospital
within a month. Another 7 children, including a 4 month old baby, have been
placed under observation at the hospital after being tested for cholera.
Health authorities are yet to establish the source of the disease after the
department of water affairs exonerated water suppliers to the area from any
possibility of contamination.
2 people have died since the outbreak of the disease in the area a month ago.

Cholera hits 8 districts
------------------------
Cholera has broken out in 8 districts, the health ministry said yesterday,
27 Apr 2004. Kampala, Kasese, Hoima, Arua, Nebbi, Kabarole, Masindi, and
Bundibugyo have continued to report substantial numbers of cholera cases
since the beginning of 2003, the ministry said.
"As the rains increase, there is a likelihood of an upsurge of diarrheal
diseases such as cholera in several parts of the country. Already some
districts such as Kampala in Namuwongo parish are experiencing an increase
of these diseases. So far 7 people are sick while 2 have been reported
dead," said a statement signed by P Kaggwa on behalf of the permanent
secretary. The last cholera outbreak that struck about 10 districts at the
same time was in 2002.
The ministry has called for strict personal and community hygiene. It
recommended the washing of hands with soap and water before preparing,
serving, and eating food or using the latrine. It also called for boiling
all drinking water, cooking food thoroughly, keeping it covered and eating
it while hot. It said all fecal materials must be dumped in latrines.
The ministry has warned the public against drinking locally prepared packed
cold water and juices in buveera [polythene bags - Mod.LL]. "Persons with
diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids or oral rehydration salts and seek
medical care immediately."

Diarrhea cases on steady rise
-----------------------------
The diarrhea situation in the city is taking an alarming turn, with the
hospitals and clinics struggling to cope with the increasing number of
patients. Around 400 patients a day were admitted in the last 2 weeks to
the International Centre for Diarrhoea Disease Research, Bangladesh
(ICDDR,B), the sole hospital for treatment of waterborne diseases at
Mohakhali. About 70 to 80 per cent of the patients coming from different
areas of the city were children, hospital sources said.
More than 250 patients were admitted to the hospital by 3 pm on 26 Apr 2004
. The day before, the number was around 400. The figure is almost double
than that on the same day of March 2004. According to ICDDR,B sources, 390
patients were admitted on 25 Apr, 397 on 24 Apr, and 341 on 23 Apr.
ICDDR,B treated around 8000 diarrhea patients in Mar 2004. In Feb 2004, the
number was 4881 and in Jan 2004 it was 5857. The monthly number had already
crossed 10 000 mark before 25 Apr, a hospital source said.
Like the ICDDR,B, Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Dhaka Medical College Hospital
(DMCH), Suhrawardy Hospital, National Hospital, and Mitford Hospital are
also facing rising number of [diarrhea] patients, who occupy more than 20
to 25 per cent of beds in these hospitals.
"Though the number of patients is alarmingly increasing, the ICDDR,B has
all necessary preparation to face the situation," a doctor told the Star City.
Outbreaks of diarrhea are common at this time of the year, he said, adding
the situation worsens generally in May and June. He stated that diarrhea
increases both during hot spells and severe cold. For that reason it breaks
out between Sep and Nov also, he added. Besides the hot spell, the doctor
attributed the severity to the scarcity of safe drinking water and intake
of stale or rotten food.
ICDDR,B sources said most of the patients being treated there belong to the
city's slum areas and low-income group. The children suffer because of lack
of awareness of the parents and poor physical resistance. The contaminated
water supplied by the Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) is also adding
greatly to the situation, a diarrhea patient from Shantinagar alleged.
Reports of foul odor in WASA water were received from the city's Rajabazar,
Shukrabad, Tallabagh, Razabazar, Badda, Bashaboo, Hazaribagh, Mirpur, and
various parts of the old Dhaka including Lalbagh, Rahmatganj, Urdu Road,
and Nazimuddin Road. Rotavirus and enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ are the 2
germs mainly responsible for diarrhea, which leads to the patient having
frequent loose motions followed by dehydration, the severity of which may
result in death in some cases, experts say.

Diarrhea epidemic in Rautahat
-----------------------------
The diarrhea epidemic in Bagahi village of Rautahat which broke out on Fri,
23 Apr 2004 has affected over 100 people. News reports blamed contaminated
food and water as well as rising temperatures.
The VDC health post had repeatedly informed the District Public Health
Office about shortage of necessary medicines to counter the epidemic, but
no action was taken.
The Himalayan Times newspaper quoted Dr Shobhendra Karna, chief of the
District Public Health Office, as denying any knowledge of the epidemic.
