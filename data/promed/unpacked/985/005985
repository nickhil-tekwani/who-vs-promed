Hundreds of cases of a potentially fatal dog infection have been reported across Surrey.

Lungworm, known as _Angiostrongylus vasorum_, is a parasite which can cause serious health problems in dogs and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated.

According to Blue Cross, a registered animal welfare charity in the UK, the parasite has been a common problem in southern areas of England for some time.

An interactive map, created by My Pet and I, provides a breakdown of the number of lungworm cases reported in each local area, including across Surrey [https://uk.mypetandi.com/lungworm-map/].

In Guildford, there have been approximately 50 cases, and in the Redhill area, there have been 36. Other affected areas include Woking, Farnham, and Godalming.

Dogs and foxes can contract the lungworm parasite by eating larvae found in infected slugs, snails, and frogs.

The larvae then burrow their way into the body, finding their way to the heart and blood vessels of the lungs, where they develop into adult lungworms.

Lungworm, unlike many other diseases, is not passed directly from dog to dog but is rather spread to the environment in the faeces of an infected animal.

The larvae can also be found in molluscs' slime trails, meaning dogs are at risk if they cross their path.

[Signs] of lungworm in dogs:
Diagnosing lungworm can be difficult because signs vary, but they can include:
- coughing;
- breathing problems;
- changes in behaviour or a reluctance to exercise;
- abnormal blood clotting;
- poor appetite and weight loss.

Lungworm is a chronic disease, which can last for months and even years, and it can occasionally cause sudden death. If you spot any of the signs above, take your dog to the vet immediately.

Preventing lungworm in dogs:
Blue Cross suggests talking to your vet about regular lungworm treatment and how to prevent the infection, particularly if you travel with your dog around southern England.

It says: "If you spot slugs and snails in your garden or local parks, then be extra vigilant when out with your dog, and always consult your vet as soon as possible if your dog becomes unwell."

[_Angiostrongylus vasorum_, also known as French heartworm, is a metastrongylid nematode parasite that resides in the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle of dogs and other canids. The presence of the parasite has been reported in Europe, Africa, South America, and Canada. Infections in red foxes appear to be chronic; they are a natural reservoir for the parasite.

Although clinical signs in association with _A. vasorum_ infection in dogs can be variable, they typically represent 3 main syndromes: cardiorespiratory signs, coagulopathies, and neurological dysfunction. The disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs, as the geographic range of the parasite increases along with awareness among clinicians. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are not always straightforward, although recent developments offer hope for improved options in the future. Understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis remains poor.

Clinician awareness is an important defense against this disease, which can be severe and difficult to diagnose definitively. Signs associated with infection are well described and should alert clinicians to the possibility of infection. Climatic models suggest that there is substantial scope for further geographical spread, so practitioners in areas not currently considered endemic should be vigilant.

There are effective drugs for the treatment of _A. vasorum_ and early anthelmintic [anti-parasite] therapy of uncomplicated respiratory cases of mild or moderate severity has an excellent prognosis for a full recovery. More severe or unusual presentations, including bleeding disorders, can present a greater challenge. Regular anthelmintic treatment is likely to reduce, but might not eliminate, the risk of disease.
