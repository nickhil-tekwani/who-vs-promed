Canada: 1st West Nile Virus Bird Death of 2004 Confirmed in Ontario
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Ontario have reported what appears to be Canada's 1st
dead bird from West Nile virus in 2004.
"This is about the time [of year] when a number of public health units do
start finding or confirming West Nile virus infection," Tanya Cholakov,
spokeswoman with Ontario's Health Ministry, said on Thu 27 May 2004. The
Grey-Bruce Health Unit, covering an area northwest of Toronto, said a blue
jay found earlier this month near Hanover, Ont., had tested positive for
West Nile virus.
Health Canada's website on Thursday listed one presumed positive bird in
the country -- the one found in Grey-Bruce. However, it also stated that a
2-business-day embargo is placed on dead bird surveillance results to allow
provinces and territories time to notify affected areas.
Chris Munn, manager of health protection for the Grey-Bruce unit, confirmed
the result. But said he didn't believe the blue jay was infected in
Ontario. He pointed to the fact that so far no mosquitoes have tested
positive for West Nile virus in the region.
"It was likely infected somewhere where it's been warm for some period of
time and the mosquitoes have been out," said Munn. Munn added that the bird
most likely migrated into Ontario from the United States.

Canada: 1st Bird Death of 2004 Confirmed in Ontario
----------------------------------------------------
The potentially deadly West Nile virus is expected to show up in provinces
as far-reaching as British Columbia and Prince Edward Island this summer,
Health Canada stated on Thu 27 May 2004 as Ontario reported the 1st bird to
die from the virus this year.
A blue jay found earlier this month near Hanover, Ont., northwest of
Toronto, has tested positive for West Nile, said a spokeswoman for the
Ontario Health Ministry.
"This is about the time [of year] when a number of public health units do
start finding or confirming West Nile virus," Tanya Cholakov said.
Dr. Harvey Artsob with Health Canada's National Microbiology Lab in
Winnipeg wasn't surprised. "We expect to see repeat activity in pretty well
all of the provinces we've seen activity before. We also realize there's an
increased chance we'll see West Nile for the 1st time in British Columbia
this year," he said. The virus might make its way up to B.C. from
California, he said, adding "there's been a lot of early-season activity"
in the state.
Artsob said "it will be no surprise" if infected birds are also found on
Prince Edward Island this year for the 1st time. There was evidence in 2003
of infected birds in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. West Nile first
appeared in Canada in Ontario birds in 2001, and human cases appeared the
next year in the province. There were 14 West Nile-related deaths in Canada
in 2003.
An official with the Ontario health unit where the dead blue jay was found
said he didn't believe the bird was infected in Ontario. "It was likely
infected somewhere where it's been warm for some period of time and the
mosquitoes have been out," said Chris Munn, manager of health protection
for the Grey-Bruce Health Unit. Munn added that the bird most likely
migrated into Ontario from the United States. Artsob said he couldn't be
sure of that, but pointed out that states neighbouring Ontario -- including
Michigan, Ohio and New York -- have already reported West Nile in birds
this year.
Meanwhile, Cholakov said bird surveillance in Ontario "is really to
establish whether or not West Nile virus is present" in a community and to
help local health units establish an action plan to deal with it. For
example, some jurisdictions deploy a larvicide targeting mosquito breeding
grounds in an effort to prevent and control the illness.

[It is clear from these reports that West Nile virus surveillance is now in
progress in some Canadian Provinces at least. Future ProMED-mail updates
will be posted at intervals summarizing data appearing on the Health Canada
website, except where exceptional circumstances require immediate posting
-- such as changes of host range, extensions of geographic spread, etc. -
