61 cases of scrub typhus have been reported this year [2008], one of
which has proved fatal, a Department of Health (DOH) official said
yesterday [25 Mar 2008]. Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's
Centers for Disease Control, called for the public to be on guard,
especially during Tombsweeping Day, which falls on 4 Apr this year
[2008], when people sweep the tombs of their ancestors, often in rural areas.

Lin said that with warmer weather conditions, cases of many
communicable diseases such as dengue fever, typhus and shigellosis
will increase and that each year, there are between 300 and 400
confirmed cases [of presumably scrub typhus]. "But isolated
fatalities of scrub typhus are often ignored by the public," Lin
added. He advised the public to wear long-sleeved clothing and spray
themselves with mosquito repellent while outdoors. If they develop
symptoms of crusty skin, swollen lymph glands and fever, they should
seek treatment immediately.

He noted that the fatal case involved a 36-year-old man living in
southern Taiwan. He displayed none of the classic symptoms of scrub
typhus and reported that he was not active outdoors and that his
workplace was not rat-infested. Rats are the host of scrub typhus. He
became sick on 24 Feb 2008 and sought medical treatment 1 Mar 2008,
but died on 11 Mar 2008 of multiple organ failure.

There has also been a cluster infection of scrub typhus this year
[2008], Lin went on, involving students from a foreign school and
their parents who went on a creek exploration activity in Shanmin
village in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County in January 2008. Local
health officials reported 7 suspected cases, 5 of which were later
confirmed as scrub typhus.

Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bites of chiggers, any of several
species of mites that are common in areas of heavy scrub. Symptoms
include fever, headache, muscle pain, coughing and gastrointestinal
upset. More virulent strains can cause hemorrhaging and intravascular
coagulation.

McQuiston JH, Nicholson WL, Murphy SM, Marumoto P, Sengebau-Kingzio
JM, et al. Scrub typhus, Republic of Palau. Emerg Infect Dis [serial
on the Internet]. 2006 Feb [date cited]. Available from

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia
tsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of
larval mites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as
both the vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family
_Muridae_ (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and
may support _O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub
typhus are thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and
their rodent hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with
humans (3). Scrub typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia
and the Pacific islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend
from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to
Pakistan and Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its
severity may be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a
person's immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be
complicated in areas where the disease has not been documented
recently or in regions lacking the capacity for laboratory
confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21
days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite.
Fever, headache [lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a
maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
or lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as
pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and
myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of
untreated illness (6). Establishing the diagnosis and initiating
prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates
for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 percent (5). Scrub
typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should
begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting
laboratory confirmation."

Rodents serve as a reservoir, although transovarial transmission in
mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm>). Humans
become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the
chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying
scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Patients with severe scrub
typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy with hemorrhage. - Mod.ML]
