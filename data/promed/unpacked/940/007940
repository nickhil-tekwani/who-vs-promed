CCHF Hospital Admissions in the Stavropol Region Rise to 9
-------------------------------------------------------------
STAVROPOL: Galina Fedosova, the Deputy Health Minister, told Itar-Tass on
Mon 7 May 2001 that the number of people hospitalized with Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the Stavropol region has risen to 9. All of
these cases are rural residents. The disease [is transmitted by tick
bites. The Deputy Health Minister said that more than 400 Stavropol region
residents have sought medical help after being bitten by ticks. None had
exhibited signs/symptoms of CCHF, but they remain under medical supervision.
An outbreak of CCHF has been recorded in the Stavropol region for the third
successive spring. A total of 6 rural residents died of CCHF in the spring
of 1999 and 2000. According to the Sanitary and Epidemiological Service,
the population of ticks has sizably increased in the region this spring as
a result of a warm and snowless winter. The Regional Ministry has appealed
to business executives for help in the purchase of necessary medicines.

[These hospital admissions are presumed to exclude the fatal case reported
in the first post from Stavropol. It would be interesting to know how these
cases are being managed and the nature of the medicines required in
Stavropol. Ribavirin has been reported to be effective, but is an expensive
option in an escalating outbreak. - Mod.CP
