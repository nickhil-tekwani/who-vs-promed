At least 3 people have come down with salmonellosis after purchasing eggs from a popular supermarket. The infection is believed to have come from eggs bought in the Melbourne suburb of Werribee. The Weekly Times reported the eggs were supplied from farms in New South Wales. However, a spokesman for the NSW [New South Wales] Department of Primary Industries [DPI] disputed those claims.

"There is no evidence to suggest the reported illnesses in Victoria are connected to NSW eggs, or even eggs. The matter is an active investigation being undertaken by Victorian authorities. There are no current recalls of eggs in NSW and no warnings with regards to eggs."

Since 2012 12 farms have been identified with _Salmonella_ Enteritidis bacteria and have been working to eliminate the infection. The bacteria in poultry is particularly difficult to get rid of as it infects hens' ovaries, where it is excreted into their eggs as they are formed. The infection spread quickly between farms as farmers buy and sell eggs from each other.

Most of the infections were discovered in 2019 and the majority of the farms have had their hens removed, but the NSW DPI is still clearing 3 properties. There are still salmonella cases in humans in NSW which are linked to a yet-to-be-identified farm. Officials from Agriculture Victoria have warned Victorian egg producers to be careful when trading eggs with NSW farmers.

The NSW DPI is working to introduce mandatory basic testing for all licensed layer flocks in a bid to stop the outbreak spreading further.

Salmonellosis results from ingesting the _Salmonella_ bacteria, which is carried in the feces of infected animals. It is most commonly transmitted through eating undercooked foods or poor hygiene practices and can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea, fever, chills, throwing up and an upset stomach.

[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
