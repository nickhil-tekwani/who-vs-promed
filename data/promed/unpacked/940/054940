Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, has resurfaced in [Shimoga] district [Karnataka], with 2 positive cases reported here in the past 6 days.

This is a fresh outbreak of the disease in the district, as the last positive case was reported on [29 Jan 2018]. A 40 year old woman from Bandya-Kukke village in Thirthahalli taluk [sub district], was treated for fever, ache in joints and head at the local primary health centre (PHC) on [12 Jan 2018]. Her blood samples have tested positive for KFD.

Kiran SK, Taluk health officer of Thirthahalli, told The Hindu that the relatives of the patient have taken her to a private hospital in Manipal [Udupi district, Karnataka] for treatment, and her condition is stable. Similarly, a 75 year old woman from Barangi village in Sorab taluk tested positive for KFD on [13 Mar 2018]. The patient was treated for 2 days at the PHC in Barangi [Shimoga district, Karnataka]. After she showed signs of recovery, she was discharged. The Department of Health and Family Welfare is likely to commence vaccination against KFD in a radius of 5 km [3 mi] around Barangi shortly.

While KFD was concentrated in Thirthahalli and Hosanagar taluks for the past few years, this time, the disease has been reported from Sorab and Sagar taluks also. A total of 13 KFD positive cases among humans have been reported in the district in 5 months. This includes 10 cases from Thirthahalli taluk, 2 cases from Sagar taluk, and one case from Sorab taluk. A 47 year old woman from Ghantejanagallu village in Thirthahalli taluk died owing to KFD during this period.

Following the fresh outbreak, blood samples of those suffering from symptoms of KFD in the affected gram panchayats of Thirthahalli, Sagar and Sorab taluks are being sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune [Maharashtra] for medical investigations.

KFD is a tickborne viral infection that spreads from monkeys to humans through tick bites.

[According to the report above, new cases have been reported from the Shimoga district of Karnataka state. During the last 5 months, a total of 13 cases have been confirmed with one death due to KFD. In addition, cases of KFD have been reported in Goa, Maharashtra and Kerala states during 2018. Despite the fact that effective vaccination is available, there is also need for vector control measures and health education regarding personal protection to reduce the transmission of KFD.

Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the virus family Flaviviridae, and characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. Between 400-500 human cases have been reported annually since the first case was identified in 1957. The disease is transmitted to humans by a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission.
