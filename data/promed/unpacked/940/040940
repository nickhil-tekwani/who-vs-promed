For the 1st time since 1998, a case of yellow fever has been confirmed in Guiana. It is a woman who stayed in the forest towards Saint-Élie and Oiapoque, in the border area with Brazil.

The Institute Pasteur of Guiana yesterday [Mon 21 Aug 2017] confirmed yellow fever virus infection in Guiana, for the 1st time since 1998. The infected person died on [9 Aug 2017]. She could have been infected in the border area of Oiapoque in Brazil, according to the initial investigations of the ARS (Agence Regional de Santé; regional health agency). She had been in the forest near St Elie and in the Oyapock Valley.

The mosquito control department of the CTG [Collectivité Territoriale de Guyane -- official name of French Guiana] began its mosquito control operations around the identified places of transit of the deceased patient: the Cayenne hospital centre, the Kourou medical and surgical centre; the surrounding forest of Saint-Élie; degradation of Petit Saut; the lower Oyapock.

The ARS recommends that unvaccinated people who present with symptoms and who have visited the area since [15 Aug 2017] should consult their doctor without delay. Unvaccinated people can be vaccinated at most general practitioners and at the following centres:

- CPS of the Red Cross,
- traveller centre or CDPS of the Centre Hospitalier de Cayenne,
- PMI centers of the CTG.

The ARS reminds all that vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever.

Transmission to humans, symptoms and treatments:
------------------------------------------------
Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmissible from animal (monkey) to man and man to man by various mosquitoes (genus _Aedes_, but also other genera circulating in the forest). The yellow fever virus is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.

After an incubation period of about one week, the disease is characterized by fever, chills, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting. Severe forms (hemorrhage, liver disorders, kidney problems) can develop in 15 per cent of cases.

Vaccination is the main prevention measure against yellow fever. The vaccine is safe, and very effective, a single dose is usually enough to give lasting immunity and lifetime protection against the disease. In 30 days, it gives an effective immune protection to 99 per cent of vaccinated subjects.

In case of yellow fever, symptomatic treatment may be proposed (rehydration, antipyretic medicines to limit fever, vomiting and pain, antibiotics for superinfections).

[It is hard to know if this case is related to this year's (2017) yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Brazil. The Brazilian state of Amapá borders French Guiana, but there have been no reported YF cases in humans or in non-human primates in the state. However, French Guiana is endemic for YF and the area where the woman was infected is forested and is likely to have foci of sylvan (forest) YF. Yellow fever was detected in 1951 in French Guiana and YF immunization has been compulsory there since 1967. In the year 2000, a cluster survey showed that immunization coverage in the population was estimated at 80-90 per cent, depending on the age category http://www.invs.sante.fr/publications/2002/couv_vaccin_guyane/r_couv_vaccin_guyane.pdf.

The last case of autochthonous YF notified in Guiana before the one cited above occurred in 1998 in a town on the border with Surinam. Since then, the compulsory notification system built around all health care structures and a reference laboratory at Cayenne's Pasteur Institute have received no notification of Yellow fever cases until now. Health authorities in French Guiana are wise to emphasize vaccination as the best preventive measure against YF. One hopes that this is an isolated case, and not an indication of ongoing YF virus transmission in the country or in neighboring Amapá state in Brazil.
