Illegal piggeries and the improper disposal of wastewater in informal settlements have been identified as 2 of the main causes of leptospirosis.

At a Health Ministry outreach program at Muanikoso on Tuesday [15 Mar 2022], health inspectors Savaira Raiyawa and Salote Puamau observed that of the 16 people who'd checked in for leptospirosis the day before, 31% had illegally owned piggeries. They said according to the Public Health Law, these piggeries must be set 200 feet from dwelling places or sources of water. The inspectors said cases had also been found among members of registered villages and informal settlements without proper planning, drainage or water-disposal systems.

While these instances are often monitored and dealt with by public notices or legal action, the 2nd outbreak of COVID-19 and the increase of flooding and cyclones, specifically in the West, had contributed to the spike in cases.

"This is the beginning of our outreach after COVID covering different communities where we have been able to bring services directly to the community who are unable to come to health facilities, especially the elderly and the children," outreach official Dr Kulai Tuisabeta said.

The program provides medical services directly to the community. These include dental and oral care, health inspections and blood and sugar checks. Health Minister Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete said one of the aims of the program was to provide medical services to the community, especially those who were immobile.

Pigs are susceptible to leptospirosis and urine of infected animals can be a source of transmission (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/leptospirosis/leptospirosis-in-swine).

The news release does not state how the diagnosis of leptospirosis was made in the cases. Because the clinical manifestations of leptospirosis can be non-specific, laboratory confirmation is necessary. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.

Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 mi) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls and flooding with fresh water. Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather). - Mod.ML
