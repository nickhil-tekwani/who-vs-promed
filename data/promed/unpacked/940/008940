Straw contaminated with the H5N1 strain of bird flu was the likely
source of an outbreak of the disease at a poultry farm in southern
Germany that resulted in 160 000 birds being slaughtered, an official
said Monday [27 Aug 2007].
Ottmar Fick, the chief veterinarian in the Erlangen district of
northern Bavaria, said it remained unclear how the straw, which was
stored on the farm, became infected, although wild birds were a
possible source.
Two experts from a federal animal disease lab were at the site, he said.
The virus was detected in ducklings at the farm Friday [24 Aug 2007],
and the federal lab confirmed the presence of the lethal H5N1 strain
on Saturday.
Authorities ordered the slaughter of all 160 000 birds on the farm as
a precaution, a process Fick said was completed Sunday [26 Aug 2007]
night. A 3-km (1.85-mile) exclusion zone is in place around the farm.
Several cases of the virus have surfaced among wild birds in Germany
this year [2007]. Last month [July 2007], it was detected in a
domestic goose in the east of the country.

[Contrary to previous information, according to which the affected
fowl were geese, this source speaks of ducklings. From German
sources, we heard similar information. Exact data are expected to be
included in Germany's official notification to the OIE, due soon.
Hopefully, such a notification will also pinpoint the source of
infection, which -- according to the unofficial information above --
was straw, a statement in need of evidence. - Mod.AS]
[I would guess that "ducklings" is a mistranslation from the German
word for "goslings" -- young geese. Has any reader seen the original
German? - Mod.JW]
