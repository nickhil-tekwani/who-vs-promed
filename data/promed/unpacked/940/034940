MENINGOCOCCEMIA OR PURPURIC FEVER - URUGUAY: REQUEST FOR INFO

Uruguayan health officials have begun immunizing children and the elderly
against meningitis to prevent an outbreak of purpura, which results in
hemorrhages under the
skin and mucous membranes that look like purplish spots.
Purpura has killed 13 people in 1999, twice the number that died in 1997
and in 1998.
Public Health Minister Raul Bustos said Tuesday that since there was no
purpura vaccine, officials were immunizing against meningitis because both
diseases have their origin in the same kind of germs.
The Epidemiology Office of the Public Health Ministry has made the
elimination of purpura one of its top priorities.
All Uruguayan children receive free meningitis vaccines when they turn two
years of age.
Health authorities plan to immunize against all strains of meningitis and
have expanded their campaign to include people over age 60, because the
elderly are more susceptible to the disease.

[The two possible diagnoses that come to mind in this situation are
Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF) and meningococcemia. BFP is caused by
_Haemophilus influenzae_ biogroup aegyptius. It is a fulminant systemic
infection that presents with fever, purpura associated with vascular
collapse and peripheral necrosis in children with a history of a recent
(within three weeks prior to onset) episode of purulent conjunctivitis. BPF
was first identified in 1984 in Sao Paolo, Brazil, and has been reported in
other outbreaks in Mato Grosso and Parana. The reported case fatality rate
is 70%. A PubMED search did not reveal any article addressing the issue of
vaccination as an outbreak prevention measure.
Several good reviews of the initial outbreaks are listed below.
1. Brazilian Purpuric Fever Study Group., Brazilian purpuric fever:
epidemic purpura fulminans associated with antecedent purulent
conjunctivitis. Lancet 1987 Oct 3;2(8562):757-61
2. Brazilian Purpuric Fever Study Group., Haemophilus aegyptius bacteraemia
in Brazilian purpuric fever. Lancet 1987 Oct 3;2(8562):761-3
3. The Brazilian Purpuric Fever Study Group., Brazilian purpuric fever
identified in a new region of Brazil. J Infect Dis 1992 Jun;165 Suppl
1:S16-9
Meningococcemia is a fulminant systemic infection with associated petichiae
and purpura caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_, the same organism
responsible for epidemic bacterial meningitis. Serogroups involved have
included, A, B and C, and more recently groups W-135, X, Y and Z. Because
of the frequent association with epidemics of meningococcal meningitis,
vaccination has been used as epidemic prevention. (see Benenson's Control
of communicable diseases in man, and Salzman MB, Rubin LG.,
Meningococcemia, Infect Dis Clin North Am 1996 Dec;10(4):709-25)
It would be curious to know if in fact this outbreak is an outbreak of BPF
and if so, if does anyone have data on the efficacy of HIB vaccine in
preventing BPF. - MPP]
