West Nile virus surveillance data as of Tue 16 Sep 2003
-------------------------------------------------------
Human - cumulative data
-----------------------
As of Mon 15 Sep 2003 there have been a total of 419 probable or confirmed
cases of human infection and 3 deaths in Canada. Saskatchewan remains the
most severely affected province, with 219 probable or confirmed cases,
closely followed by Alberta with 137 probable or confirmed cases:
Province / No. probable cases / No. confirmed cases / No. of deaths
Nova Scotia / 0 / 1* / 0
Quebec / 8 / 0 / 1
Ontario / 31 / 1* / 0
Manitoba / 16 / 2/ 1
Saskatchewan / 210 / 9 / 1
Alberta / 130 / 7 / 0
British Columbia 4* / 0 / 0
Total 399 / 20 / 3
[The probable cases in British Columbia and the confirmed cases in Nova
Scotia and Ontario are considered to be travel-related and not indigenous
cases. Since the last update on Tue 9 Sep 2003 the number of probable or
confirmed cases has increased from 232 to 419. In all, 85 per cent
(357/422) of the cases have occurred in the prairie provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta, but surprisingly, only one of the 3 deaths in
Canada have occurred in these 2 provinces.
In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West Nile
virus infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus. All the
deaths and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec, in contrast to
the situation in 2003, when few cases have been reported from Ontario and
none from Quebec. - Mod.CP]
Equines - cumulative data
-------------------------
As of Tue 16 Sep 2003, 310 presumptive or confirmed equine cases have been
reported; Quebec (6), Ontario (27), Manitoba (39), Saskatchewan (121),
Alberta (117).
[The number of presumptive or confirmed equine cases of West Nile virus
infection has increased by 124 since Tue 9 Sep 2003. In all, 81 per cent
(101/124) of the new cases have been reported from the prairie provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta. There have been no extensions of range. - Mod.CP]
Mosquitoes - cumulative data
----------------------------
As of Mon 15 Sep 2003, 401 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive; Quebec
(62), Ontario (58), Manitoba (216), Saskatchewan (34, Alberta (31).
[This represents an increase of 63 West Nile virus positive mosquito pools
since Tue 9 Sep 2003. In contrast to the data for other animals, the
greatest number of West Nile virus positive mosquito pools was found in the
province of Manitoba (54 per cent), whereas relatively few were found in
Saskatchewan and Alberta (8 per cent each). There have been no extensions
of range. - Mod.CP]
Wild Birds - cumulative data
----------------------------
As of Tue 16 Sep 2003, the following test results by Province have been
reported:
Province / No. submitted for testing / No.tested / No. confirmed positive
Newfoundland and Labrador / 68 / 63/ 0
Prince Edward Island / 255 / 238 / 0
Nova Scotia / 810 / 763 / 7
New Brunswick / 807/ 753 / 5
Quebec / 2131 / 2016 / 405
Ontario* / 1637 / 1403 / 205
Manitoba / 912 / 814 / 124
Saskatchewan / 1195 / 955 / 157
Alberta / 1486 / 1469 / 232 /
British Columbia / 1836 / 1807 / 0
Yukon / 14 / 13/ 0
Northwest Territories / 19/ 18 / 0
Nunavut / 2/ 2 / 0
*Note that in the Ontario count; after the 4th confirmed positive bird, no
further testing is carried out, and the birds are listed as presumed positive.
[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 11 162 birds submitted for
testing, 10 314 birds tested, and 1135 confirmed West Nile virus positive.
In addition there were 3047 sightings of dead birds recorded. This
represents an increase of 333 birds tested and 176 more birds confirmed
positive since the last update on Tue 9 Sep 2003. There has been no
extension of range. - Mod.CP]
