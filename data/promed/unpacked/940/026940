Update on European situation - stakeholder note
-----------------------------------------------
We promised to keep you informed on the latest bluetongue situation
on the continent (the authorities in the affected countries continue
to carry out their sentinel surveillance programs aimed at
identifying any new disease circulating in this season).
The extent to which disease may reemerge on the continent in 2007 is
still not yet clear. We previously knew that the affected countries
had declared the end of their "vector-free periods" (i.e. vectors are
active again in these areas), but up until last week, there was no
evidence of reemergence of active disease in this season.
The 1st new case of this year [2007] has been reported in the North
Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany (within existing restricted area).
A cattle sentinel herd was tested throughout April and May 2007, and
serological tests indicate that one of the animals became infected in
this season. This may suggest that virus is once again circulating in
that region. Defra continues to monitor the situation.

Government scientists are warning a deadly livestock disease which
infected thousands of animals in Europe last year [2006] is very
likely to reach the UK, after its recent reemergence in Germany.
Bluetongue, which is carried by a biting midge, killed 1/3rd of sheep
that were bitten in last summer's [2006] outbreak across Northern
Europe. As temperatures rise, there is a greater likelihood of the
midges crossing the channel, and a case here would mean "Draconian"
restrictions on livestock movements to stop the spread around the
country.

[So far, no additional or firsthand data on the mentioned positive
sentinel animal in Rhine-Westphalia could be found on the Internet,
including EU or German websites.
According to information from Germany's BT reference laboratory (see
ProMED-mail 20070517.1570), the sentinel animals, initially selected
based on negative BT serology and PCR (polymerase chain reaction),
are included in a sentinel program prescribing monthly testing.
Official, firsthand data on the test results will be helpful. If
indeed the positive animal is accurately identified as a
2007-seroconverted animal, this may indicate that infected vectors
have already been active in May 2007. - Mod.AS]
