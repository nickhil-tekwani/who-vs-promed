Avian influenza in the Philippines
-------------------------------------
Information received on 8 Jul 2005 from Dr. Jose Q. Molina, Director,
Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, Quezon City:
Report date: 8 Jul 2005.
In a routine testing done on samples collected from a small farm in
Calumpit, Bulacan province, a low pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus
was detected in ducks using hemagglutination inhibition and PCR.
Samples are being sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for avian
influenza in the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong,
Victoria for confirmation of the specific strain involved.
All ducks in the farm are apparently healthy with no mortalities, and
all the native chickens in the same farm have tested negative.
Control measures:
- ban of movement and sale of live poultry within a 3 km radius of
the affected farm for one week;
- affected flocks will be culled immediately;
- sustained surveillance and testing of all poultry farms in nearby areas.
