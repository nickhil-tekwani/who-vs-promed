Situation update
----------------
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MoARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 Aug 2018, ASF was detected [as of 14 Dec 2018] in 22 provinces/autonomous region/municipalities. More than 630 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

- Qinghai Province: on 12 Dec 2018, the 1st ASF outbreak in Qinghai Province was reported on one farm with 69 pigs in Datong Hui and Tu Autonomous County [1*].

- Sichuan Province: ASF outbreak occurred on one farm with 117 pigs in Bazhou District, Bazhong City [2*].

- Guizhou Province: ASF outbreak occurred on one farm with 26 pigs in Baiyun District, Guiyang City [3*].

- Shaanxi Province: ASF outbreaks occurred on one farm with 33 pigs in Shenmu City, Yulin City [4*].

Actions taken by China [since previous weekly FAO update]
---------------------------------------------------------
The ASF virus from a wild boar case in November [2018] in Jilin Province showed genetic differences from those analysed from outbreaks in domestic pigs [5*].

On 10 Dec 2018, MoARA and the Ministry of Natural Resources released a joint notice on "Strengthening the Joint Prevention and Control Work on ASF in Domestic Pigs and Wild Boars". This included the following measures:
- Sharing information on outbreaks in pigs and unusual death of wild boars, coordinating monitoring and investigation, strengthening epidemiological analysis;
- Strengthening active surveillance in high-risk areas, e.g., wild and domestic pig interface, wild boar habitats in autumn-winter period, elevated hills within 50 km from outbreaks; and
- Breaking up the cycle of transmission, no swill feeding to domestic and wild pigs, enhancing biosecurity, prohibiting the practice of sharing workers and staff between breeders, prohibiting pig breeders and wild boar farms to introduce wild animals, no free range pig farming in wild boar habitat [6*].

Epidemiological study revealed 3 major causes spreading ASF virus: 46% by vehicles and workers without disinfection, 34% by swill feeding, and 19% by transport of live pigs and their products across regions [7*].

Meat products in passengers' luggage tested positive for ASF at port/airports in Taiwan Province of China [8-10*].

After assessment, epidemic zones were lifted in Taojiang County, Yiyang City, Hunan Province on 7 Dec 2018 [11*], Hezhang County and Qixingguan District of Bijie City, Guizhou Province on 13 Dec 2018 [12*], as there was no further detection for 6 weeks after culling of pigs within an affected zone. As of 13 Dec 2018, 37 epidemic zones have been lifted.

[The above 14 Dec 2018 FAO weekly update of the ASF situation in China includes, in addition to the above excerpts, additional ASF-related information from China and FAO's recommendations regarding countries of the region, national considerations, interregional collaboration and solidarity, as well as a summary of FAO's actions so far.

The new ASF outbreak in Qinghai (20181204.6179428), a province hitherto not known to be infected, has been reported to the OIE in http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28924.

In the meantime, Taiwan's agriculture authorities have tightened border checks and raised fines to prevent the transmission of the pig-killing virus through Chinese meat products, which also applies to the meat products from Hong Kong and Macau. The amendment to raise the maximum fine for smuggling banned meat products into the country was enforced beginning Fri 14 Dec 2018. During the 1st day of its effect, 4 violations were reported at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. The fine for passengers bringing in the meat products without declaring ranges between NTD 10 000 (USD 324) and NTD 1 million (USD 32 398). Further information, including details of the 4 new violations and their performers, is available at https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3597383 (thanks to Susan Baekland). - Mod.AS
