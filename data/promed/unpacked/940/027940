CATERPILLAR PLAGUE - BRAZIL (4)
===============================
According to Wallace Peters' atlas, Lonomia achelous (Saturniidae)
may be responsible. Amazon region.
Toxin on spines is fibrinolytic, and leads to burning sensation,
headache and generalised discomfort. Ecchymoses appear within 8-72
hr and spread to the rest of the body. Bleeding may take place from
the orifices.
