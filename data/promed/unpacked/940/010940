A virus outbreak has killed 60 000 juvenile steelhead fish at Robertson Creek Hatchery and prompted the involvement of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Fisheries and Oceans Canada has confirmed that there was an outbreak of infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) virus at the Robertson Creek Hatchery [Port Alberni, British Columbia].

The virus was diagnosed in January [2014] after extensive laboratory testing, said Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) spokesperson Carrie Mishima, who only responded to questions from the News by e-mail. The virus has infected more than 60 000 juvenile steelhead at the hatchery, which have since been destroyed, officials said. Hatchery staff became aware of the outbreak after noticing higher than normal mortalities in juvenile steelhead. Staff noticed signs of the virus and initiated lab tests.

According to the fisheries department, IHN is a naturally occurring pathogen in wild fish throughout the Pacific West Coast from Alaska to California. IHN poses no risk to humans but it can spread quickly and has a 100 per cent mortality rate if a fish population becomes infected. The virus is known to exist in Great Central Lake where the hatchery draws its water supplies. Lab tests identified the virus as the endemic, naturally occurring strain that is commonly found in Pacific sockeye.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] was called because IHN is a reportable disease. Staff have isolated the area where the infected fish were being held, and are cleaning and disinfecting the area. Measures have also been put in place to control the movement of staff and fish in and out of the hatchery. Clean-up will be completed when the CFIA is satisfied that the process has met their requirements.

[Infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is a viral disease affecting most species of salmonid fish reared in fresh water or sea water, caused by the rhabdovirus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). The principal clinical and economic consequences of IHN occur on farms rearing rainbow trout, where acute outbreaks can result in very high mortality. However, both Pacific and Atlantic salmon can be severely affected. For the purpose of this comment, IHN is considered to be infection with IHNV.

Reservoirs of IHNV are clinically infected fish and covert carriers among cultured, feral or wild fish. Virus is shed via urine, sexual fluids and from external mucus, whereas kidney, spleen and other internal organs are the sites in which virus is most abundant during the course of overt infection (Bootland and Leong, 1999; Wolf, 1988).

The principal hosts for IHNV are members of the family Salmonidae. Species reported to be naturally infected with IHNV include: rainbow or steelhead trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), chinook (_O. tshawytscha_), sockeye (_O. nerka_), chum (_O. keta_), amago (_O. rhodurus_), masou (_O. masou_), coho (_O. kisutch_), and Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_). Other salmonids including brown trout (_S. trutta_) and cutthroat trout (_O. clarki_), some chars (_Salvelinus namaycush_, _S. alpinus_, _S. fontinalis_, and _S. leucomaenis_), ayu (_Plecoglossus altivelis_) and non-salmonids including European eel (_Anguilla anguilla_), herring (_Clupea pallasi_), cod (_Gadus morhua_), sturgeon (_Acipenser transmontanus_), pike (_Esox lucius_), shiner perch (_Cymatogaster aggregata_) and tube-snout (_Aulorhychus flavidus_) have occasionally been found to be infected in the wild or shown to be susceptible by a natural route of infection (Bootland and Leong, 1999; European Food Safety Authority, 2008; Wolf, 1988).

Virus entry is thought to occur through the gills and at bases of fins, while kidney, spleen and other internal organs are the sites in which virus is most abundant during the course of overt infection (Bootland and Leong, 1999; Wolf, 1988).

Infection with IHNV often leads to mortality due to the impairment of osmotic balance, and occurs within a clinical context of edema and hemorrhage. Virus multiplication in endothelial cells of blood capillaries, hematopoietic tissues, and cells of the kidney underlies the clinical signs.

The transmission of IHNV between fish is primarily horizontal and high levels of virus are shed from infected juvenile fish; however, cases of vertical or egg-associated transmission have been recorded. Although egg-associated transmission is significantly reduced by the now common practice of surface disinfection of eggs with an iodophore solution, it is the only mechanism accounting for the appearance of IHN in new geographical locations among alevins originating from eggs that were incubated and hatched in virus-free water (Winton, 1991).

Experimental vaccines to protect salmonids against IHN have been the subject of research for more than 40 years, with some showing promise in both laboratory and field trials when delivered by immersion or injection (Kurath, 2008; Winton, 1991; Winton, 1997). Both autogenous, killed vaccines and a DNA vaccine have been licensed for commercial use in Atlantic salmon net-pen aquaculture on the west coast of North America where such vaccines can be delivered economically by injection. However, vaccines against IHNV have not yet been licensed in other countries where the application of vaccines to millions of smaller fish will require additional research on novel mass delivery methods.

This is sad news for the hatchery but we hope it is quickly under control.
