An outbreak of leprosy has struck 11 of 17 districts in East Flores
regency, East Nusa Tenggara, over the past several months, says a
local medical official. At least 74 residents are reported to be
infected by the disease, 20 of whom are in serious condition and are
currently undergoing intensive treatment at a number of community
health centers and hospitals in the regency.

Head of the East Flores Health and Family Planning Agency, Valens
Sili Tupen, confirmed Thursday [25 Oct 2007] that the disease, which
is curable with appropriate treatment, had hit 11 districts. Valens
said the disease was caused by the water shortage in the area,
malnutrition, poor sanitation and people's unhealthy life patterns.
No fatalities have been reported so far, but the number of patients
has gradually risen, given that most parts of the regency are facing
severe drought and that many poor families consume whatever food they can get.

Medical supplies are still adequate at the moment, but we have to
purchase them from Java, since they are hard to obtain in East
Flores," said Valens. He added that the leprosy in East Flores was of
the pauci bacillus (dry) and multi bacillus (wet) types. Based on
medical diagnosis, 29 people have been infected by the dry type and
45 by the wet type.

Valens said patients had been found in Wotanomadu district (11
patients), Ile Mandiri (15), Larantuka (13), West Solor (5), East
Solor (4), East Adonara (4), West Adonara (5), Ile Boleng (3),
Witihama (3), Tanjung Bunga (2) and Wulanggitang (1).

The chronic disease is characterized by the formation of white
nodules on certain parts of the body accompanied by loss of sensation
and eventual paralysis, usually around the arms, knees, ear and neck.
Without treatment, a patient's fingers or toes can become paralyzed
and eventually fall off. The patient will suffer repeated muscle
contractions in the arms, fingers and legs. "Usually, leprosy will
affect the side and skin nerves and other organ networks. Patients
can suffer permanent deformities due to slow treatment," said Valens.

Separately, East Flores Vice Regent Yusni Herin said the local
administration was still facing difficulties in providing complete
treatment to patients due to the expensive price and scarcity of
medicine. Herin said the disease initially affected Solor Island in
2005 and has spread to the 11 districts over a period of 2 years.
"Initially, a Dutch foundation provided medical assistance to the
patients, but it has closed down its mission here," said Herin.

He added that most residents considered leprosy to be a curse from
God, so many sufferers felt ashamed and hid in the forest, while some
were banished by their families to mountainous regions. "This is the
main stumbling block, because it's hard for medical workers to reach
them," said Herin.

[East Nusa Tenggara is a province of Indonesia and is located in the
eastern portion of the Lesser Sunda Islands, including West Timor.
The province has a population of approximately 4.2 million people
(2005). The province consists of about 550 islands but is dominated
by the 3 main islands of Flores, Sumba, and West Timor, the western
half of the island of Timor. The provincial capital is Kupang,
located on West Timor. Solor is another island in this province. The
province is said to lack clean drinking water, sanitation, and health
facilities; 32 percent of children are malnourished, and the child
mortality rate is 71 per 1000, higher that than in most of the rest
of Indonesia; see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Nusa_Tenggara>.

Indonesia ranks 3rd among countries, after India and Brazil, in
having the greatest number of leprosy cases; see
<http://www.lepra.ch/lepra/e/4_2_indonesien.php>.
The top 10 countries in new case detections in 2005 are India,
Brazil, Indonesia, DR Congo, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mozambique, Nigeria,
Ethiopia and Tanzania. Together, they constitute about 96 percent of
year 2005's global new case detections. The Southeast Asia region
contributed about 69 percent of 2005 global new case detections.

WHO defines elimination of leprosy as a public health problem if the
prevalence is less than one case per 10 000 population. Indonesia has
achieved elimination in 18 of the 30 provinces. The prevalence and
new case detection rates declined in all countries in 2004 compared
to 2003 except in Indonesia, where the annual number of new cases
detected remained static at around 15 000 cases over the previous 4 years; see
<http://searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Regional_Strategy_Leprosy-162.pdf>.
However, the number of new cases in Indonesia has recently been
increasing: In 2005, there were 19 695 new cases of leprosy in
Indonesia compared with 16 549 new cases in 2004; see
<http://www.delnor.com/body.cfm?id=154&action=detail&ref=17556>.
The regional prevalence of leprosy in Indonesia is shown at
<http://searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section20/Section54_12167.htm>.

Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_. The
incubation period of the disease is thought to be about 5 years.
Because lepromatous patients excrete enormous numbers of leprosy
bacilli in their nasal secretions, leprosy is thought to be mainly
transmitted by air through droplets from the nose and mouth during
close and frequent contacts with untreated cases. Household contact
with a case of lepromatous leprosy poses an increased risk for
infection. Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin and
clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world
since 1995; see
<http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/corporate-citizenship/news/2007-01-07_leprosy_4.shtml>.
Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment
regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin
and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients
treated with rifampin, dapsone and clofazimine are cured within 12 months

As the news release states, patients with leprosy tend not to seek
recognition because of the stigma associated with the disease.
Whether the new cases reported in East Nusa Tenggara are the result
of enhanced case-finding or ongoing transmission of leprosy is not
known. Leprosy among children would be an indication of ongoing
transmission in the community, but the ages of the "new" cases are
not reported. Better access to the medications used to treat leprosy
is urgently needed in this province to interrupt transmission; WHO
needs to make healthcare officials in this province aware that it
provides leprosy drugs free to patients.
