ANTHRAX, HUMAN, 2001 - USA (06): COMMENT

I interviewed the parents of one of the children exposed in 2001. I
describe the case in great detail in my new book, "I Heard the Sirens
Scream". Though the child nearly died 10 years ago -- was close to
being pronounced -- he is absolutely fine and healthy today.

I think there is an age curve for anthrax (and many other bacterial
ailments). I have no doubt, based on my scrutiny of the cases for my
book, that time will show age at time of exposure, route of exposure,
and time delay to proper antibiotic therapy will prove the decisive
predictors of long term outcome.

As for depression, I think, on an anecdotal basis, that long term
psychiatric outcomes of severe viral and bacterial infections are
generally under-appreciated. When I returned to Kikwit 3 years after
Ebola and Hong Kong 2 years after SARS I found all the adult survivors
experiencing a range of psychiatric symptoms, and angry that nobody
took them seriously or offered effective treatment.

[Infants and children are rarely afflicted with anthrax, mainly
because exposure is usually occupational and they have healthy immune
systems. The older you get from say 30 onwards, the more severe it
tends to be.

Our thanks to Laurie. Her well-rounded e-book is readily available at
a very reasonable download price. She worked very hard and interviewed
hundreds of people. It provides an excellent account of the FBI
investigation and the problems that ensued. According to Laurie some
10 individuals were in turn 'persons of interest' with lives trashed
and 2 suicides. - Mod.MHJ]
