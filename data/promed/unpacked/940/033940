Fungal disease hits bumper apple crop in Himachal
-------------------------------------------------
Already battling with a host of problems, the heavy apple crop of
Himachal Pradesh is now grappling with a new one. A deadly fungal
disease, Marssonina, is causing huge losses to farmers across the hill state.

Excessive rains have led to the disease, which causes dark patches on
the fruit, which also drops to the ground before it is harvested. The
dropped and damaged fruit cannot be packed in boxes and can only be
packed in gunny bags for processing, which fetches very low prices.

The most affected are orchards located in moisture-prone areas, from
where the epidemic is fast spreading to other orchards. Since
harvesting is already on, it is too late to spray fungicides to
control the disease. Apple is the main cash crop of the state.

[Marssonina blotch (MB) of apple is caused by the fungus _Diplocarpon
mali_ (previously _Marssonina coronaria_). It has been found in some
countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Infections first appear
on mature leaves. Symptoms include spots on leaves and fruit as well
as severe premature leaf fall. In affected orchards, apples nearing
maturity are often seen hanging from defoliated branches. MB affects
size, colour, and quality of fruit making the produce unsaleable. It
also reduces fruit set in the following season.

The fungus is reported to survive between seasons in fallen leaf
litter, and spores are spread by mechanical means and wind. MB
development is favoured by humid conditions and multiple cycles of
infection may occur in one crop leading to severe epidemics. Disease
management includes phytosanitary measures, cultural techniques, and
fungicides.

Severe outbreaks of MB occurred in Himachal Pradesh in 2002 and 2008
(ProMED-mail post 20080813.2501), and in India it has also been
reported in Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh.
