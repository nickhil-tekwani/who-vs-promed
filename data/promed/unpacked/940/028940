The Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter is reporting an increase in distemper cases in coyotes and raccoons in the county and is encouraging people to get their pets vaccinated to prevent its spread.

Distemper, a contagious disease that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems of animals and affects both domesticated pets and wildlife, has been mostly reported on the west side of Santa Cruz, but cases have popped up elsewhere in the county such as near Seabright State Beach, according to the county.

The county shelter is offering pet vaccinations from 1-3 pm Mondays through Fridays, with the vaccine that addresses distemper, parvo, and other illnesses costing USD 20. The dog rabies vaccine costs USD 10 with a dog license renewal purchase or is free for 1st-time dog licensees. Microchips for dogs or cats cost USD 15, according to the county.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Animals showing similar behavioral signs might be rabid.

In the western USA, the main terrestrial reservoir of rabies are skunks (see a map of the distribution of major rabies virus variants among carnivores at https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats, and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
