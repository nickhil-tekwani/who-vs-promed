Japanese encephalitis (JE) continued to claim lives of children in
eastern Uttar Pradesh [UP], with the toll mounting to a staggering
figure of 227, following 12 more deaths today [29 Sep 2007].
Official sources said since January 2007, over 1381 JE patients had
been admitted at the famous Baba Raghav Das Medical College here [at
Gorakhpur] and at several district hospitals, of which 227, including
29 Biharis and one Nepali, succumbed.
The JE patients trickle in from Gorakhpur, Deoria, Maharajganj, Sant
Kabrinagar, Kushinagar, Ballia, Gonda, and Balrampur districts of UP.
Gorakhpur has the dubious distinction of being the JE epicenter in
the region. The epidemic [emerging from endemic maintenance - Mod.TY]
affects eastern UP during [the] monsoon every year. Last year [2006],
the killer disease had taken almost 1000 people.
The government undertakes a massive vaccination drive against the
vector-borne disease every year; however, the efficacy and
penetration of the drive comes under a cloud with the mounting toll.

[The JE virus epidemic is somewhat larger than last year's (2006). It
is regrettable that the JE virus vaccine campaign has not achieved
the coverage in this endemic area (see archives below) needed to
reduce the number of clinical cases reported here. Effective vaccines
for JE virus are available.
