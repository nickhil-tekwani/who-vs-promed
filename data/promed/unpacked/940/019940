Just as Turkey tries to return to normal after its battle with the coronavirus, another danger lurks that threatens rural areas. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a deadly disease usually confined to summer, is forcing authorities to adopt new measures to contain it. So far, it has claimed 15 lives across Turkey.

The Health Ministry set up a board of scientists, which held its 1st meeting on Thursday [11 Jun 2020], to determine what actions to take against CCHF. Chaired by deputy health minister Emine Alp Mese, the group discussed the virus' current situation and measures needed to control it ahead of Kurban Bayram, also known as Eid al-Adha. The Muslim holiday, which will be observed in late July this year [2020], sees greater mobility for animals and close contact with people. As every Muslim who can afford to do so ought to slaughter a sheep and a cow, animal markets are set up all across the country for the sale of sacrificial beasts ahead of the holiday.

CCHF, common in more than 30 countries, is prevalent in Turkey's northern regions. The death rate from the fever is generally around 4%, while in some countries it reaches 80%. Turkey ties its success to strict measures, effective treatment methods and a surveillance system that tracks the prevalence of the disease. Authorities announced that the number of CCHF cases [was higher than in] 2019, and by 10 Jun 2020, 480 infections had been reported.

CCHF is a widespread disease that is caused by a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the _Bunyaviridae_ family that results in severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. Animals are carriers, and tick bites or contact with blood or body fluid from an infected person or animal can spread the virus. Common symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, general body pain and fatigue. Personal protection measures are vital for disease control.

Experts urge people to wear protective clothing, covering all bare parts of the body and avoid areas with tick risks like farms, orchards, forests, picnic spots, fields, etc. It is recommended to tuck trousers into socks while going to such places. It is also recommended to wear light-colored clothes to spot ticks more easily. Experts say the body should be checked for ticks when one returns from risky areas, and the tick should be removed with the aid of a glove or similar material instead of bare hands. If it can't be removed, the nearest hospital or clinic should be visited. It is also important not to touch any fluid or tissue from animals with bare hands.

Ali Eroglu, a senior official from the Turkish Veterinary Medical Association, says the ticks have been a vector for more than 200 diseases, threatening animal and human life in certain areas of Turkey. "Since 2002, CCHF has been a threat particularly in the provinces of Giresun, Gumushane, Bayburt, Sivas, Tokat, Amasya and Corum," he told Anadolu Agency (AA) on Thursday [11 Jun 2020]. He warned that though prevalent in those provinces, it is not limited there and is active in all 7 regions of the country. He said cases peak usually in the 2nd half of spring and the 1st half of summer. The highest number of cases in Turkey was reported in 2008 when more than 1300 infections occurred. Similar numbers, though slightly less, were reported in the following years. "This year [2020], we see more cases compared with previous years and at an earlier period," he warned. He says early diagnosis and treatment is vital to prevent deaths from the disease.

Eroglu calls for awareness campaigns to warn citizens about protective measures against the disease. He says disinfection against ticks is inefficient against the disease. "They live in a vast environment and can exist in areas where disinfectants cannot reach. Besides, pesticides used to kill them can affect local ecosystems and human health," he says.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is considered to be one of the major emerging disease threats spreading to and within the European Union following an expanding distribution of its main vector, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_. Every year, more than 1000 human CCHF cases are reported from countries of south eastern Europe and Turkey. The 1st detection of CCHF cases in Turkey was in 2002; since then, more than 9700 cases have been reported, with an overall mortality rate just under 5%. - Mod.UBA

In Spain, on 11 Jun 2020, the public health authorities of the autonomous community of Castille and Leon reported a case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), confirmed by PCR, to the National Center for Microbiology.

The patient was bitten by a tick at the end of May [2020] in the province of Salamanca and developed compatible symptoms in the following days. He is currently in isolation in a healthcare facility, and contact tracing activities have been initiated.

In 2016, 2 cases of CCHF were reported in Spain: The 1st case presented potential exposure to CCHF in the province of Avila, also in Castile and Leon, and the 2nd case was that of a healthcare worker who assisted the patient. In 2018, a fatal case was also reported in the same province of Avila.

This case is the 3rd detection of human cases of CCHF in Spain. Although the risk of CCHF in Spain is considered to be low, additional cases may appear.

Ticks of the genus _Hyalomma _are considered to be the main vectors of the CCHF virus. _Hyalomma marginatum_ is widely present in Spain, as shown by the distribution map published in May 2020.

Hunters, forestry workers, hikers and people working with animals are more likely to be exposed to ticks and, therefore, to be infected. People potentially exposed to ticks should take preventive measures to avoid tick bites.

Health professionals caring for patients infected with the CCHF virus are exposed to a risk of human-to-human transmission, described in 2016 in Spain. The risk of human-to-human transmission in a hospital setting can be greatly reduced by applying appropriate infection prevention and control measures in a timely manner.

[Genotype III CCHFV was detected in ticks from deer captured in western Spain in 2010 and ticks from birds migrating from Morocco in 2013. No cases among humans in Spain had been reported until 2016, when 2 autochthonous cases were diagnosed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708233/pdf/17-1002.pdf). Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the virus corresponds to the African genotype III, which includes viruses previously found in West and South Africa.

Potential reasons for the emergence or re-emergence of CCHF include climate changes that may have a significant impact on the reproduction rate of the vector _Hyalomma_ ticks, as well as anthropogenic factors (for example, changes in agricultural and hunting activities).

CCHFV can cause high case fatality rates and can be transmitted from human to human. There are no vaccine prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions available at present. - Mod.UBA
