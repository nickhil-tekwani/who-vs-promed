A whooping cough outbreak in Nelson and Marlborough may cause a
nationwide epidemic, health officials warn. Nelson Marlborough
District Health Board says the outbreak in the top of the south, with
similar outbreaks in West Coast and Hawke's Bay, may develop into a
nationwide epidemic similar to 2004-2005.

Medical Officer of Health for Nelson Marlborough District Dr Jill
Sherwood said so far in October 2011, it had 27 cases with a further
16 still under investigation. In September 2011, Nelson had 40 cases
of whooping cough. She said this disease was especially serious for
babies who have not yet been immunized.

Dr Sherwood advised parents to keep young babies away from anyone with
a cough. Adults and older children with coughs might have unrecognised
whooping cough and are often the source of infection for babies. "See
your GP quickly if you are concerned about your health or the health
of your child, as antibiotics prescribed early in the illness could
decrease the seriousness of the symptoms," she said.

Whooping cough is a preventable disease. "If babies and young children
are immunized, they can reduce their chance of this serious and
sometimes life-threatening illness," Dr Sherwood said. Babies are not
protected until they have received their 3 initial vaccinations, due
at 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months [2, 4 and 6 months in the USA -
Mod.LL]. The vaccination is free and available from GPs or practice
nurses.
