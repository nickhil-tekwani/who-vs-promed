According to the Puerto Rico Secretary of Health, an elderly San Juan man
has been diagnosed with dengue 3 virus infection, a virus not detected in
Puerto Rico since the 1970s. Dengue 3 virus had been absent from the
Americas from 1977 until 1994, when it reappeared in Nicaragua and Panama.
Infection with this virus could be particularly dangerous for people
previously infected with any of the other three dengue viruses. Residents
of Puerto Rico are being warned to protect themselves against feeding
mosquitoes and to eliminate breeding sites for _Aedes aegypti_, the vector
of dengue viruses.
