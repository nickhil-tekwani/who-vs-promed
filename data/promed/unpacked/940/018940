[This moderator would like to thank Dr. Berger for this comprehensive
listing of vaccines that have been presumptively associated with Guillain
Barre syndrome in recipients. Lest people jump on this as a justification
for anti-vaccine activities, there should be the reminder that GBS is a
very rare occurrence following vaccines, and the threat of GBS post
vaccination is miniscule compared with the threat of serious illness from
the disease the vaccine protects against. In the case of all of the above
diseases mentioned, complications from infection with the natural disease
agent (such as poliovirus, measles, rabies etc.) are far more prevalent
than GBS following receipt of the vaccine. - Mod.MPP]
