The Northern Territory's Health Department says the 2nd person this
year [2009] to have contracted the potentially fatal mosquito-borne
disease Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE] had been fishing around
Darwin's coast. The Health Department says the man's family has
requested that his details, including his age, remain private. He is
in a stable condition in the Royal Darwin Hospital.

The latest infection follows the death of a 58-year-old mango farmer
who died of brain failure after contracting MVE in Darwin's rural
area in March 2009.

The Director of the Territory's Centre for Disease Control, Dr Vicki
Krause, is warning Territorians to be wary of mosquitoes by covering
up and avoiding swampy areas, particularly after sundown.
