In the long 2 years that it took to produce the diagnosis of the 1st case of BSE in Brazil just reported by the OIE, millions of head of cattle were slaughtered, and their beef was consumed locally or exported to the world without any notice. This seems to have happened because there was no real BSE surveillance program in Brazil.

Meanwhile, importer countries like Venezuela, who keep buying thousands of Brazilian cattle for slaughter and thousands of tons of beef, were being defrauded under the false assurance of Brazil being a "BSE-free" country while being affected since December 2010 to date.

Because of all this, the BSE status given to Brazil by OIE is already under a long shadow of doubt.

From now on, BSE diagnostic capabilities must be firmly in place to speed the truth. The powers of commerce and political interests must not prevail over public and animal health. Transparency is the name of the game in the new global food and feed trade.

[The issue is the health of consumers and the health of animals. It is impossible to assure either in the absence of a surveillance system. Mr. Pinate has highlighted the issues facing importing countries.
