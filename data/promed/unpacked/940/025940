Cows infected with bovine TB culled
----------------------------------
A herd of cows has been euthanized in the canton of Fribourg, after it was found that most were infected with bovine tuberculosis.

The herd was tested after one cow became seriously ill last month. Neuchatel's Department of Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs says the testing showed that the herd had "a high rate of infection" and decided to euthanize and incinerate all of the animals.

The health officials say the high rate indicates that the tuberculosis was present for years, and that cows which tested negative could have in fact been carrying the infectious agent.

No human cases have so far been detected.

Health officials say that humans can contract the disease by consuming raw milk or coming in direct contact with an infected animal, but the risk is low. They say that dairy products that are pasteurized or matured can be considered safe.

Infected animals have also been found in cantons Vaud and Valais. Further tests are taking place.
