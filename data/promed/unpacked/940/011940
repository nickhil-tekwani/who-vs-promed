A disease is wiping out most of the orange crop in Bhutan, causing
great concern among the Himalayan country's many orchard owners. The
deadly huanglongbing (HLB) is transmitted by a small fly called a
psyllid that thrives on the leaves of the orange trees. HLB has
already caused extensive damage to orange crops in Thailand.

Oranges are the main cash crop in all but 4 districts of Bhutan and
one of the country's most important exports. HLB has already wiped
out 70 percent of orange orchards in Punakha, while other orange
growing regions like Wangduephodrang, Mongar, Zhemgang and Sarpang
are also severely hit. In Chukha, the entire orange growing region of
Baikuenza has been wiped out.

The Bhutanese Ministry of Agriculture [BMA] said the disease could
"devastate the whole citrus industry in the country if appropriate
measures are not taken soon." Dr Sangay Duba, of the National Plant
Protection Centre [NPPC], said that orchards which used to produce
200 to 300 trucks of oranges every year have barely produced 10 to 15
this year [2009]. "The situation could get worse," he warned.

Scientists say that since most orchard owners in Bhutan are absentee
landlords, they have paid little attention to plantation management
and pest control. There are 57 000 acres of abandoned or illegal
orchards in the country, from where the deadly disease is said to
have spread across the orange growing belt of Bhutan.

Bhutan's government has issued an ordinance for an investigation
team. This team has been given the right of entry into any orange
orchard and can fine farmers if they do not implement recommendations
about pest control. The BMA has proposed that illegal orchards whose
owners are not traceable should be handed over to landless farmers to
be better managed. The NPPC has also developed an "action plan" that
involves training and capacity development, quarantine of plants,
insect proof nurseries and re-planting in HLB-hit areas.

[2] Iran: 1st report

[Ref: MM Faghihi et al: 1st report of citrus huanglongbing disease on
orange in Iran. BSPP New Disease Reports, vol. 18: August
2008-January 2009]

Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as greening, is a destructive disease
of citrus that may limit production of this crop in many parts of
Asia, Africa and South America. HLB is caused by a non-culturable
phloem-limited bacterium of the genus _Candidatus_ Liberibacter.
Three _Candidatus_ species of Liberibacter, namely, _Ca._ L.
asiaticus, _Ca._ L. africanus and _Ca._ L. americanus, have been
identified.

The psyllid _Diaphorina citri_, vector of _Ca._ L. asiaticus was 1st
detected in December 1997 in Iran in an area close to the border with
Pakistan. Since then, high populations of _D. citri_ have been found
in citrus plantations of the Hormozgan and Kerman provinces in
southern Iran. Citrus trees in this region exhibit typical HLB
symptoms including mottling of leaves and yellowing of shoots.

In the present study, leaf samples from 20 symptomatic and 20
symptomless Valencia sweet orange trees (_Citrus sinensis_) and over
50 psyllid samples were collected from various locations in
Sistan-Baluchistan and Hormozgan provinces and tested for the
presence of _Ca._ L. asiaticus by nested PCR. This resulted in
amplification of a 400 bp [base pair] product from 5 out of 20 leaf
samples and 26 out of 50 psyllid samples. No amplicons were obtained
from symptomless sweet orange trees and psyllid samples reared on
healthy sweet orange seedlings. The amplified fragment from a psyllid
sample was sequenced and showed 100 percent identity with
corresponding sequences of _Ca._ L. asiaticus [in the Genbank
database].

This is the 1st report on the occurrence of HLB disease in Iran. The
disease appears to be widely distributed in citrus growing regions of
southern Iran and may be a component of citrus decline in this area.

Citrus greening, a disease that devastates orchards and the
citrus-growing economy, recently reached Louisiana, California and
the State of Parana in Brazil. All the research organizations working
on citrus fruits have been called up.

The list of affected countries continued to grow in 2007 and 2008.
After Brazil in 2004 and Florida in 2005, Louisiana was infected in
2008. The alarm was also raised in 2008 in California, where the
psyllid, a type of sucking insect that carries the disease, was
discovered, following a similar warning from Argentine producers in
the major export zones in the northeast of that country, where the
psyllid is now present, while the disease has also been detected
across the border, in the state of Parana, Brazil.

Mediterranean producers, who have been spared the disease until now,
need to remain vigilant. _Trioza erytreae_, a psyllid that can
transmit the African form of greening, was detected in Madeira in
1994. It has also long been found in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and
Saudi Arabia.

What is needed are disease-resistant varieties and effective curative
methods. A budget of USD 20 million was recently released by
producers and the authorities in Florida. CIRAD [French Centre for
Agricultural Research for Developing Countries] has just been granted
project funding from the Florida Citrus Production Research Advisory
Council (FCPRAC).

[Huanglongbing (HLB) [also called citrus greening, yellow dragon
disease], is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops
affecting leaves and fruits. In Asia and the Americas, it is caused
by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_
Liberibacter asiaticus. However, the species may comprise several
different variants, even within a given region. Its vector is the
Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often
spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission. The vector is
specific to _Citrus_ and close relatives, and thus the disease is
confined to these crops. The other 2 species of _Ca._ L. (africanus
and americanus) can cause HLB in different areas. For more
information on HLB, see links and previous posts listed below.

In Bhutan, HLB was reported for the 1st time in 2003 and appears to
be spreading. In the Americas, the disease is spreading rapidly and,
together with citrus canker (_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar
_citri_), is considered a major threat to citrus industries.
