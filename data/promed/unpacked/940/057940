The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) of Hong Kong said (25 Dec 2017) that a dead Oriental magpie robin found in To Lok Road, Tseung Kwan was confirmed to be H5N6 positive after laboratory testing.

The dead Oriental magpie robin was found and collected in 8 To Lok Road, Tseung Kwan O, last Thursday (21 Dec 2017), and was suspected to be H5 positive after initial laboratory testing last Friday (22 Dec 2017). The Oriental magpie robin is a common resident of Hong Kong.

The spokesman said cleaning and disinfection have been stepped up at the venue, adding that there are no poultry farms within 3 km of where the dead bird was found.

In view of the case, the AFCD already phoned poultry farmers to remind them to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza. Letters will be issued to farmers, pet bird shop owners, and license holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons reminding them that proper precautions must be taken.

The spokesman said the department would ensure that proper precautions against avian influenza have been implemented. The AFCD will continue its wild bird monitoring and surveillance.

"People should avoid contact with wild birds and live poultry and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them. The public can call 1823 for follow-up if they come across suspicious, sick or dead birds, including the carcasses of wild birds and poultry," the spokesman said.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will continue to be vigilant over imported live poultry as well as live poultry stalls. It will also remind stall operators to maintain good hygiene.

The Department of Health will keep up with its health education to remind the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene to prevent avian influenza.

The AFCD, the FEHD, the Customs and Excise Department and the Police will strive to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong Kong to minimise the risk of avian influenza outbreaks caused by imported poultry and birds that have not gone through inspection and quarantine.

All relevant government departments will continue to be highly vigilant and strictly enforce preventive measures against avian influenza. Health advice is available from the "H5N1 Health Advice" page on the AFCD website at http://www.afcd.gov.hk.

[On Mon 25 Dec 2017, the CVO and Assistant Director of Hong Kong's AFCD, Dr Thomas Sit, submitted to the OIE an immediate notification informing the above described event. The report is available, with a map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=25505. Its epidemiological comments say:

"An intensive surveillance system is in place for all poultry farms, poultry markets, and pet bird shops in Hong Kong. The H5N6 infected wild bird was detected in our ongoing surveillance program on wild birds. No spread of disease was evident. There are no poultry farms located within 3 km of where the bird was found. The Hong Kong Wetland Park and Mai Po Nature Reserve are not located within 3 km of where the bird was found. The date of end of the outbreak is the same as the date the bird was found (21 Dec 2017)."

When accessing the HK AFCD website referred to above, one comes across the following 3 AI-related links:

1. "H5N1 health advice," at http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/quarantine/qua_vetlab/qua_vetlab_ndr/h5n1_health_advice.html;
2. "Do not keep backyard poultry," at http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/popup/h5n1_leaflet.html;
3. "Prevention of Avian Influenza - management of Birds," at http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/popup/prevention_aimob.html.

The Government of Hong Kong has addressed the risks related to HPAI H5N1 by the introduction of a well-planned prevention and control policy, meticulously implemented and efficiently publicized since the commencement of the panzootic, in the early years of the 21st century. The government banned the keeping of backyard poultry altogether, including chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and quails, offenders liable to very high fines. On top of steps pertaining to wildlife and domestic animals, there are guidelines for consumers and the public at large. Special emphasis was paid to live animal markets.

HPAI H5N6 in poultry was initially reported from mainland China to the OIE on 1 Sep 2014 (the outbreak started 23 Aug 2014). Since that time, more than 40 outbreaks have been reported and 17 human cases registered.
