Cucurbit yellow vine disease (CYVD), which can inflict heavy losses to
watermelon, pumpkin, cantaloupe, and squash in U.S. production areas
from the midwest to northeastern states, causes phloem discoloration,
foliar yellowing, wilting, and plant decline.
Bacteria were cultured from the phloem of crown sections of symptomatic
plants of _Citrullus lanatas_ and _Cucurbita pepo_. Those bacteria testing
positive in CYVD-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were all
gram-negative and appeared morphologically identical, producing creamy
white, smooth, entire, convex colonies on Luria-Bertani or nutrient agar.
Characterized cucurbit-derived strains of _Serratia marcescens_
were introduced into greenhouse-grown squash plants by puncture
inoculation and into field-grown squash plants by enclosure with _S.
marcescens_-fed squash bugs, _Anasa tristis_. Up to 60 percent of the
bacteria-inoculated plants in the greenhouse and up to 17 percent of field
plants caged with inoculative squash developed phloem discoloration and
tested positive for _S. marcescens_ by CYVD-specific PCR. None of the
controls developed phloem discoloration or tested positive by PCR.
Of the diseased field plants, 12 percent (2 of 35) also yellowed, wilted,
and collapsed, exhibiting full symptom development of CYVD. However,
neither plant collapse nor decline was observed in the greenhouse-grown,
puncture-inoculated plants. The morphology, growth habit, and PCR reaction
of bacteria cultured from crown tissue of a subset of plants in
each experimental group were indistinguishable from those of the inoculum
bacteria.
Evidence presented from our studies confirms that the squash bug can
transmit _S. marcescens_, the CYVD causal bacterium. The _S.
marcescens_-_A. tristis_ relationship described here is the first instance
in which the squash bug has been identified as a vector of a plant
pathogen. Our experiments represent a completion of the steps of Koch's
postulates, demonstrating that _S. marcescens_ is the causal agent of CYVD
and that the squash bug, _A. tristis_, is a vector of the pathogen.

[This report confirms that a strain of the ubiquitous bacterium, _S.
marcescens_ [Sm], is the causal organism of CYVD in cucurbits and that the
squash bug, _Anasa tristis_, is a vector that transmits the pathogen to its
cucurbit hosts. Whereas the results of earlier attempts to identify and
characterize the pathogen were equivocal, this report shows that Sm is a
walled bacterium that can be grown on nutrient agar, thus allowing for
completion of Koch's postulates. CYVD occurs on cucurbit crops in Oklahoma,
Tennessee, Massachusetts, and Arkansas.
From a public health perspective, Sm is now considered a harmful human
pathogen known to cause urinary tract infections, wound infections, and
pneumonia. A pertinent references re: human infections:

[Elkhorn coral is being killed by _S. marcensens_ (see ref. below). Another
example of a microbe pathogenic to both plants and humans is _Burkholderia
cepacia_ (formerly _Pseudomonas_), the cause of pneumonia, especially in
cystic fibrosis patients, as well as the cause of sour skin disease of
onions. - Mod.LL/JW]
