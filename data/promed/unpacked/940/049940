It looks as if California will lose its bovine tuberculosis-free status,
which will likely lead to new costs for the state's $6 billion dairy and
cattle industry, state and industry officials said.
"At this point it's not likely California is going to lose its status. It's
definite," Ben Higgins, executive vice president of the California
Cattlemen's Association, said Tuesday.
State officials met with beef and dairy industry representatives in Tulare
to explain the loss of the federal designation, which allows free
interstate movement of cattle without costly testing for the chronic lung
disease, said Steve Lyle, a spokesman for the California Department of Food
and Agriculture.
"It will be more difficult for industry to move cattle out of state, it
will take longer and cost more money -- that's the major impact," Lyle said.
It was unclear when the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would
officially list California as a TB-infected state. Larry Hawkins, a USDA
spokesman, could not be reached Tuesday.
Preliminary tests showed a dairy in Tulare County tested positive for the
disease in October 2002. Another Tulare County dairyman slaughtered 6400
cows in November 2002 after his herd tested positive for bovine TB last spring.
According to USDA regulations, if 2 or more herds are found infected with
bovine TB, a state loses its TB-free status.
The disease weakens and kills animals and can potentially harm humans who
work closely with infected cows or those who drink raw milk or eat uncooked
meat. But nearly all milk sold in California is pasteurized and meat is
inspected before being sold, and the transmission of the illness is rare
among humans, state officials said.
Hardest hit would be cattlemen in Northern California, who take beef cattle
to pastures in other states. Dairymen would be least impacted because they
buy cattle from other states to replenish herds, state officials said.
The Cattlemen's Association estimates it would cost ranchers between $180
000 and $240 000 a year to test 24 000 cows.
State agriculture officials said they have created a task force to trace
animals that were sold from infected herds and to find ways to allow
Northern California cattlemen to continue taking herds across state lines.
Officials also plan to require testing of cattle before [TB] comes to
California and also test the 600 dairies within Fresno, Tulare, and Kings
counties to see the magnitude of the herds infected, said Dorothy
Davidson-York, a TB epidemiologist.
The recent tuberculosis cases were the first in the state since 1991. State
officials still don't know how the disease got into the state.
Since May, California has tested 152 875 and slaughtered about 7857 cows to
prevent the spread of the disease, state officials said.

[Cattle tuberculosis (TB), a disease, caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_, can
produce internal lesions in animals. Cattle TB can be spread within a herd
when an infected animal coughs, releasing bacteria-laden mucus onto feed
that is consumed, or into the air that is inhaled by nearby cows. - Mod.TG]
