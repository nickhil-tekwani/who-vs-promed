First report of the necrotic strain of potato virus Y (PVY N) on potatoes
in the north western United States. JM Crosslin, KC Eastwell, Washington
State University, Prosser; PB Hamm, Oregon State University, Hermiston; RE
Thornton, Washington State University, Pullman; CR Brown, USDA-ARS,
Prosser, WA; D Corsini, USDA-ARS, Aberdeen, ID; PJ Shiel, PH Berger,
University of Idaho, Moscow. Plant Dis 2002; 86: 1177; published online as
D-2002-0809-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication 19 Jul 2002.
More than 50 isolates of potato [poty]virus Y (PVY) with characteristics of
strains that cause tobacco veinal necrosis (PVY N) were obtained from
potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_ L.) grown in the north western United States
are being characterized at the biological and molecular levels.
Isolate RR1 was obtained from leaves of potato cv. Ranger Russet showing
distinct mottling and leaf deformity, which is in contrast to the leaf-drop
and necrosis usually observed with ordinary strains of PVY (PVY O) in this
variety. Isolate AL1 was obtained from tubers of potato cv. Alturas showing
distinct internal light brown rings and blotches.
When RR1 and AL1 were transmitted to tobacco (_Nicotiana tabacum_ L. cvs.
Samsun NN and 423), they caused systemic veinal necrosis, including stem
and petiole lesions typical of PVY N strains (2). Symptoms induced by RR1
and AL1 on tobacco appeared 9 to 11 days after inoculation, whereas some
other isolates induced delayed veinal necrosis.
All isolates that produced veinal necrosis on tobacco were detectable with
PVY polyclonal antisera. Potato [potex]virus X was not detected by enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in tobacco plants showing veinal
necrosis. Some isolates, including AL1, failed to react in serological
tests using PVY N- specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) obtained from 3
commercial sources. Other isolates, including RR1, were detectable by these
MAbs.
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products obtained
with primers specific for the coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF)
were cloned and sequenced. AL1 possesses a CP more closely related to PVY O
type isolates, which would account for its failure to react with PVY N
MAbs. In this regard, AL1 is similar to the PVY N -Wilga isolate (1). Other
isolates detectable by PVY N MAbs possess a CP more consistent with N
strains of the virus.
Results of RT-PCR tests using primers derived from the P1 ORF sequence (3),
and the restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing of the RT-PCR products,
all suggest that AL1 and RR1 are related to European-type members of PVY
tuber necrotic (NTN) or N strains. However, other isolates under study
appear to be more closely related to previously reported North American NTN
types (3).
The symptomatology of these viruses on tobacco and potato, and the
serological and molecular data clearly show that at least 2 distinct
variants of PVY N have been found for the first time in a major potato
production area of the United States, and pose a potential threat to the
potato industry.

[There are 3 PVY strains commonly described in the literature: PVY-O
(common or ordinary strain), PVY-C (strain C), and PVY-NTN (veinal necrosis
strain). The significance of this report is that the 2 isolates described
(AL1 and RR1) are PVY strains that can cause tuber necrotic ringspot
disease in some potato cultivars. Tubers infected by NTN isolates express
lesions on the tuber surface and intensive internal veinal necrosis in
flesh of tubers, which renders them unsaleable for food or for seed
purposes. A second significant finding in this report is the development of
a RT-PCR technique that can adequately distinguish the 3 strains. This will
facilitate accurate identification of strains and should be a useful
adjunct in potato health programs. A useful reference is
