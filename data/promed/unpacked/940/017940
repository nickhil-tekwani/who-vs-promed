An outbreak of animal brucellosis was registered in the village
Timonin of Dergachovsky rayon [district] in Saratov oblast [region].
The veterinarians have diagnosed brucellosis in 5 cows and 101 sheep
on 1 Dec 2010. 41 people, mostly the owners and the shepherds have
had contact with the sick animals. 5 out of the 33 tested people have
been found infected within the performed tests, without significant
clinical manifestation of the disease. Samples from the remaining 8
exposed people are still under investigation.

The village is currently under quarantine for outbreak control purposes.

[We are indebted to Sabine Zentis for the following, initial
information on the event, published by Rosselkhoznadzor, the Federal
Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, on 1 Dec 2010:

"On an outbreak of brucellosis in the [Saratov region]: an outbreak
is registered in Timonin settlement of the Dergachovsky [district].
The disease was detected in 101 sheep and 5 cattle. Quarantine
activities are being conducted and an investigation is being carried out."
See at <http://www.fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/2658.html?_language=en>.

Brucellosis results from infection by various species of _Brucella_,
a gram-negative, facultative intracellular coccobacillus or short rod
in the family Brucellaceae. 6 named species occur in animals: _B.
abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, _B. ovis_, _B. canis_ and _B.
neotomae_. 3 of them are zoonotic, namely _B. abortus_, _B.
melitensis_, and _B. suis_ biovars 1-4_; rare cases of human
infection by _B. canis_ have been recorded. The reservoir of _B.
abortus_ is, generally, cattle; of _B. melitensis_, small ruminants
(goats and sheep), and of _B. suis_, swine, with the main clinical
manifestation being abortion in these species. Both _B. abortus_ and
_B. melitensis_ are reportedly present in Russia; _B. suis_ has not
been recorded there since 2007. Infected animals abort, mostly during
the 2nd half of their gestation.

It deserves to be kept in mind, that cattle may readily be infected
also by _B. melitensis_, discharging the bacteria in milk, in most
cases without suffering abortions. This phenomenon may have
significant public health impact. It will be helpful if the identity
of the bacterium involved in the described outbreak, and the
vaccination history of the affected animals, become available.- Mod.AS]
