At least 78 children have come down with measles in the Kursk region after their parents refused vaccination for reasons of faith, the local consumer protection department said. Nine adults have also contracted measles, with the majority of the cases registered in the town of Zheleznogorsk, the department said in an online statement on Thursday [16 Jan 2014]. "All of the patients haven't been vaccinated for religious reasons," the statement said.

The patients appeared to belong to a congregation that the department identified as a local Evangelical Baptist Christian Church. After the 1st case of measles was registered in the Kursk region on 31 Dec 2013, local officials and doctors met with leaders of the church in Zheleznogorsk in an attempt to impress the importance of vaccination, the consumer protection department said in another statement earlier this week. "Despite the persuasive arguments of the specialists and the obvious need to take preventive measures, all members of the Baptist church have refused vaccination," the statement said.

More than 500 Kursk residents were vaccinated in the 1st 2 weeks of 2014 as part of a set of emergency prophylactic measures in the region, the consumer protection department said.

In the 1st 9 months of last year [2013], a total of 922 cases of measles were registered in all of Russia, according to consumer protection department figures.

The city government has declared a measles outbreak in view of the rising number of cases here since the start of the year [2014]. The Sangguniang Panlungsod on Wednesday [15 Jan 2014] unanimously approved a resolution declaring an outbreak of the viral infectious disease as 62 probable measles cases were reported from 1-14 Jan 2014 this year, higher than the 23 cases reported for the same period in 2013. "The declaration is indispensable to facilitate holistic and swift responsive actions to protect the health, welfare, and well-being of the people of Olongapo as well our neighbor communities," the resolution said.

Dr Jessie Manuel, hospital administrator of the James L Gordon Hospital, said patients with suspected measles cases are continuously arriving in their hospital. Manuel said there are 80 patients with suspected measles cases being treated at the hospital, with one confirmed death since 1 Jan 2014. He said at least 90 per cent of the patients with measles are below 5 years old, with the youngest at one month old. "We are giving patients strong doses of antibiotics to address complications such as pneumonia," he said. He also said that hospital staff have already identified areas in the hospitals where the patients need to be isolated.

Meanwhile, he appealed to parents to bring their children to health centers for free vaccination, as most of the patients have not yet been given vaccination. "Measles vaccination is free in health centers," he said. With the outbreak, city health workers are now conducting house-to-house vaccination and information drives to prevent the spread of measles.

From: Poh Lian Lim, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore


A previously healthy 32 year old Filipino man presented for medical care at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) in Singapore on 14 Jan 2014 after returning from travel in the Philippines (Luzon). He developed fever on 10 Jan 2014, followed by cough, conjunctivitis, and facial rash on 12 Jan 2014. On examination, he had classic Koplik spots and generalized morbilliform rash. He had visited friends and relatives (VFR) in the Philippines and attended several weddings from 26 Dec 2013 until 8 Jan 2014. The patient reported that a measles outbreak was ongoing in some of the locations he had visited.

The patient was admitted and managed with appropriate isolation precautions. Measles was confirmed by PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample on 15 Jan 2014. The patient's pregnant wife, who had also travelled and was exposed to the patient, was found to be immune to measles and rubella.

We are reporting this because of concurrent media reports of a 7 month old infant with measles onboard a flight to Auckland from the Philippines, which necessitated contact tracing. Our patient was asymptomatic during his flight, but travel and exposure history indicates he most likely acquired his infection during VFR travel in the Philippines. The incubation period of measles (7-21 days) suggests that we will need to maintain vigilance for ongoing international spread of measles as well as secondary cases among susceptible patients.

An unvaccinated infant who flew from the Philippines to Saskatchewan in early January 2014 has now been confirmed to have had the disease. Measles is not very common in Saskatchewan, but the virus is found elsewhere in the world. It's a highly infectious disease with symptoms that include high fever, coughs, a runny nose, and rashes. Officials are also reminding families about the importance of getting children vaccinated.

The Health Ministry says people who were on the same flight as the family may be at risk of infection.

Here are the flights:
- Thu 2 Jan 2014: Philippine Airlines PR116 -- Manila to Vancouver (Arrived 16:30)
- Tue 7 Jan 2014: WestJet 544 -- Vancouver to Calgary (Departed 08:00, Arrived 10:25)
- Tue 7 Jan 2014: WestJet 314 -- Calgary to Regina (Departed 12:05, Arrived 14:30)
