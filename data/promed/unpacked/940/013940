The state Secretariat of Health (SES) confirmed 4 cases of Zika virus [infection] in Mato Grosso. According to the latest report, the disease was registered in the municipalities of Cuiaba (1 case), Rondonopolis (2 cases) and Tesouro (1 case).

The agency recommends that the municipal secretariats of health maintain an alert for early diagnosis of the disease. In addition, they report that visits, orientation and prevention activities are being carried out, mainly in the municipalities with the greatest incidence of dengue.

The government also reported that 164 samples were sent to the responsible laboratory for differential diagnosis, of which 45 are being tested [awaiting processing? - Mod.RNA] and 68 were discarded for not meeting clinical and epidemiological criteria. [Another] 33 are awaiting screening [What type of screening - to assess if they were, in fact, suspected cases before being laboratory tested? - Mod.RNA] and 25 test results were released [4 confirmed and, apparently, 21 discarded. - Mod.RNA]

[Zika virus continues to increase its geographic range in Brazil. As the above report indicates, the risk is greatest where the dengue virus transmission is high, because the mosquito vector that transmits dengue viruses also transmits Zika virus. There are no apparent epidemiological barriers that would limit the continuing spread of Zika virus within Brazil and onward to other countries in the Americas. - Mod.TY
