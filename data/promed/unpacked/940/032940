I would strongly urge caution, if this vaccine is only against the _E.
coli_ O157 serogroup. There are many enterohaemorrhagic _E. coli_, carried
by domestic animals of a variety of serotypes and a great variety of non
O157 serotypes have been reported from human disease around the world.
Currently strains of _E. coli_ O157 are comparatively easy to identify in
a routine laboratory, while identification of the others is a very
exacting task requiring reference laboratory facilities. Removal of _E.
coli_O157, without tackling the problem of the non-O157 serogroups would
create a greater niche for these and probably make the problem even worse.
