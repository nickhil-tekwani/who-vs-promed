Natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in kept ferrets, Spain
---------------------------------------------------
We found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 6 of 71 ferrets (8.4%) and isolated the virus from one rectal swab. Natural SARS-CoV-2 infection does occur in kept ferrets, at least under circumstances of high viral circulation in the human population. However, small ferret collections are probably unable to maintain prolonged virus circulation.

Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in several carnivores of 3 families (order Carnivora): canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, puma/cougar, and snow leopard), and mustelids (ferrets and minks).

Pet ferrets were reported infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Slovenia recently (see ProMED post 20201226.8048809). The susceptibility of mustelids warrants surveillance and alert in households that keep pet ferrets. - Mod.PMB
