In a shocking revelation on dog menace in Kashmir [i.e. the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir], at least 20 persons have died of rabies in the past 5 years, while 80 0000 cases of dog bites have been reported in the valley during this period, according to official figures. The data reveal that hospitals run by the DHSK alone have recorded 58 095 dog bite cases between 2008 and 2012. This is excluding the figures registered by the Anti-Rabies Clinic (ARC) at the SMHS Hospital [Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (S.M.H.S.) Hospital] here, where officials say 22 649 such cases have been registered in the past 5 years.

The year-wide data of the Health Department, a copy of which is with Greater Kashmir, puts the dog bite cases recorded in district hospitals as: 6558 in 2008; 10 655 in 2009; 14 701 in 2010; 7954 in 2011 and 18 228 in 2012. In 2013 (January and February), these hospitals have reported nearly 1811 dog bite cases.

Similarly, the ARC at SMHS has recorded 3772 dog bite cases in 2008, 3909 in 2009, 5790 in 2010, 3772 in 2011 and 5406 in 2012, said a Government Medical College Srinagar official, while quoting figures. He said the clinic treated 774 patients for dog bites in 2013 alone (from 1 Jan 2013 to 23 Mar 2013.

"There are many more cases registered in the valley. If the anti-rabies clinic at SMHS hospital registers 3000 cases a year on an average, the figure would be around 1000 in other districts," said a DHSK official. The ARC has also registered 20 deaths due to rabies in the past 5 years. "On an average, we at ARC record 2-3 deaths due to rabies every year. This is apart from deaths that take place at other places because the ARC is not the only centre registering such deaths," an ARC official said.

Despite the alarming rise in cases of dog bites, the government is yet to devise a concrete policy to address the menace. "In 2009 the ARC has recorded 2 deaths in 3 months, including of a 4-year-old child. Similarly in 2008, 2 deaths have taken place, including 12-year-old and CRPF personnel. "We have recorded two deaths in 2010 and 2011 as well. In 2010, a 6-year-old boy from Achabal (Islamabad) died due to rabies. Also a 65-year-old woman from the district also died due to rabies," the ARC official said. In 2011, a boy drowned in the river Jehlum when a group of dogs chased him near Zaina Kadal. According to officials, nearly half of the cases of dog bites happen to Class III bites, where the victim has one or further bites, scratches, licks on broken skin, or extra contact that breaks the skin.

The data furnished by the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) and the Census Department reveal that for every 13 persons in the valley, there is one stray dog, putting the [stray] dog-human ratio at 1:13. While a WHO-sponsored national multi-centric rabies survey (2006) says that on average the human-dog ratio in the country stands at 1:36, an SMC official said there were one lakh [a lakh equals 100 000] dogs in Srinagar alone. "There are 11 more districts whose dog population has not been counted. A dog starts reproducing at the age of 2 and gives birth to several puppies at one time," he said. At this rate, Srinagar will be engulfed by dogs, whose population is expected to cross 2 million by 2015, in comparison to the expected 1.4 million human population, said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, a member of the Association for Prevention and Control of Rabies in India.

The WHO has suggested the dog-sterilization program would be successful only when carried out in a fast-track mode. The WHO standards recommend that around 70 percent of dogs should be sterilized within 3 months of the start of the process. And this, according to experts, is not logically possible in Srinagar given the huge number of packs of strays and the fact that the process has already hit roadblocks.

Community medicine experts say the rate of sterilisation of 10 dogs per day is too slow to contain the reproduction rate. "The dog sterilisation project has already cost the government much, and looking at the pace at which it is going, the problem seems to worsen in the coming years," said an official at the Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar. Last year [2012], former Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Khalifullah Mir had directed the state government to take speedy measures to remove stray dogs from the roads and put them in dog pounds to be constructed on the city outskirts.

[Kashmir is the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term Kashmir geographically denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Today, Kashmir denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir (which consists of the divisions: the Kashmir valley, Jammu and Ladakh), the Pakistani-administered Gilgit-Baltistan and the Azad Kashmir provinces, and the Chinese-administered regions of Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract. Srinagar is the summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is situated in the Kashmir Valley and lies on the banks of the Jhelum River, a tributary of the Indus. A map of Kashmir can be accessed at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir.

This press report comprises a bewildering array of statistics regarding the present and estimated future canine population of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir but few new proposals for effective control. The low number of human fatalities in relation to the large number of dog bites inflicted suggests that post-exposure treatment is well-organised or that the prevalence of canine rabies virus infection is low. Further information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP
