The Tompkins County Health Department urges residents to be aware of and avoid contact with wildlife after reports of 2 skunks approaching or following people, with 2 reported bites on 18 Oct [2022] in the blocks between North Cayuga, Park Place, Cascadilla Street, and West Court Street in downtown Ithaca. Skunks can travel up to a mile while foraging for food.

The Health Department is trying to locate a person reported to have been bitten this morning [19 Oct 2022] on North Plain Street, Ithaca. She is described as middle-aged or older, wearing a long, hooded sweater, and carrying a backpack.

She approached the skunk, attempting to pet or feed the skunk and was bitten at that time. The skunk then proceeded to follow her for a short period of time. The resident who saw the bite urged the woman to contact the Health Department and seek medical care. If you have been bitten by a skunk, please contact the Health Department to discuss treatment.

Healthy skunks can be observed out during the day, foraging, but should not approach humans. If a skunk is approached, it may do short lunges, stomp, and show their hind end to scare off a person or animal before spraying them. If a person approaches them quickly or ignores the warnings, they may bite and/or spray. Do not attempt to pet or feed a skunk. Skunks that are fed lose their fear of humans and are more likely to approach humans, resulting in bites.

Rabies is normally transmitted by the bite of a wild or domestic rabid mammal. The incubation period for rabies is generally one to 3 months. Exposures can also occur if saliva from a rabid animal enters the body through a mucous membrane, a wound that bled within 24 hours prior to the exposure, or an older wound showing signs of a bacterial infection. Do not handle pets or objects that may be contaminated with saliva from a potentially rabid animal without wearing protective gloves. Wash your hands immediately with soap and water if you do touch the saliva. Remember that a cut incurred while skinning a rabid mammal could also result in rabies transmission, as nervous tissue of an infected animal will carry the virus.

The Health Department has issued the following reminders for everyone:

Avoid contact with any unfamiliar cats or dogs and any wild animals.
All cats, dogs, and ferrets must have initial rabies vaccinations administered no later than 4 months of age. Keep vaccinations current!
Report the following incidents to the Tompkins County Health Department:
- all animal bites or scratches. If you are bitten by cat or dog, be sure to obtain owner's contact information;
- any human or pet contact with saliva or other potentially infectious material (brain tissue, spinal tissue, or cerebro-spinal fluid) of wild animals or any animal suspected of having rabies;
- all bat bites, scratches, or any mere skin contact with a bat, or a bat in a room with a child or a sleeping or impaired person.

https://whtc.com/2022/10/21/rabies-reported-in-bat-in-allegan-county-2nd-case-this-year/


The Allegan County Health Department (ACHD) confirmed on Fri 21 Oct [2022] an animal rabies case in a bat in Allegan County. Officials say this is the 2nd rabies case verified in a bat in Allegan County this year [2022].

The ACHD reminds community members about the importance of vaccinating their household pets and bat-proofing their homes and offers these tips:

- Carefully examine the home for holes that might allow bats entry into living quarters.
- Caulk any openings larger than 1/4 in [6 mm] by 1/2 in [13 mm].
- Use window screens, chimney caps, and draft guards beneath doors to attics; fill electrical and plumbing holes with stainless steel wool or caulking; and ensure all doors to the outside close tightly.
- Prevent bats from roosting in attics or buildings by covering outside entry points. Find where the bats exit at dusk and keep them from coming back by loosely hanging clear plastic sheeting or bird netting over these areas. Bats can crawl out and leave but cannot re-enter.
- When all the bats are gone, the openings can be permanently sealed.
- Install a chimney cap to prevent animals from living in your home.
- Call local Animal Removal Services if there is a bat in the home, and visit "Avoid risk of rabies from bats" at https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/animals/bats/index.html.

The rabies virus, most often found in bats, is in the saliva of infected animals and is spread through bites or scratches. There are simple steps everyone can take to protect themselves from rabies:

- Have pets vaccinated regularly. This will protect them if exposed to animals with the disease and prevent them from becoming ill and infecting humans.
- Do not handle stray, wild, or dead animals.
- Keep pets indoors or supervised to limit their exposure to wild animals that may be rabid.
- Do not feed, or put water for, pets outside.
- Keep garbage securely covered, as these items may attract wild or stray animals.

[5] South Carolina (Anderson County): goat, 12 pet goats and human exposure
Date: Fri 4 Nov 2022
Source: South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control via EIN News [edited]
https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/599541874/rabid-goat-confirmed-in-anderson-county-one-person-and-twelve-pets-exposed


The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed a goat found near Roper Road and Moore Road in Piedmont, SC, has tested positive for rabies. One person was exposed and has been referred to their healthcare provider. Twelve goats were exposed and will be quarantined as recommended in the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians Compendium.

The goat was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 2 Nov 2022 and was confirmed to have rabies on 3 Nov 2022.

South Carolina law requires all dogs, cats, and ferrets be vaccinated against rabies and revaccinated at a frequency to provide continuous protection of the pet from rabies using a vaccine approved by the department and licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Livestock are susceptible to rabies, and all livestock with USDA-approved rabies vaccinations should be vaccinated. Cattle and horses, however, are the most frequently reported infected livestock species. Species for which licensed vaccines are not available (goat and swine), that have frequent contact with humans, or that are considered valuable should also be vaccinated.

"Keeping your pets and livestock current on their rabies vaccination is a responsibility that comes with owning an animal. It is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family, your pets, and your livestock from this fatal disease. That is an investment worth making to provide yourself some peace of mind," said Terri McCollister, DHEC's rabies program team leader.

If you believe that you, your family members, or your pets have come in contact with this goat or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs' Anderson office.

It is important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease. This goat is the 7th animal in Anderson County to test positive for rabies in 2022. There have been 74 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2022]. Since 2002, South Carolina has averaged approximately 148 positive cases a year. In 2021, 5 of the 101 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Anderson County.

Contact information for local Environmental Affairs offices is available at <www.scdhec.gov/EAoffices>. For more information on rabies, visit <www.scdhec.gov/rabies> or <www.cdc.gov/rabies>.

Rabies Case Confirmed in Caldwell County>


On 3 Nov 2022 the North Carolina State Laboratory notified Caldwell County Animal Care Enforcement (ACE) that a cat submitted for testing was infected with the rabies virus. The cat, whose owners live in the Red Oak Road area of Granite Falls, is believed to have been infected by a skunk.

Two adults were also exposed to the infected cat and are undergoing treatment to prevent rabies.

ACE and the Caldwell County Health Department are working closely with pet owners in the Red Oak Road area to prevent further rabies cases.

"One of the best ways to protect your pets is to make sure they are up to date on their rabies vaccinations," said ACE Director Richard Gilliland. "To help residents protect their pets, we're working with Brews & Mews to offer a drive-thru vaccination event on Saturday."

The clinic takes place Sat 5 Nov [2022] from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. at the Caldwell Agricultural Fairgrounds. Vaccines are free for Caldwell County residents with a valid ID and USD 10 for noncounty residents. Supplies for the clinic are limited.

In addition to keeping pets' rabies vaccinations up to date, pet owners should also take the following precautions:

- Supervise your pets to prevent exposure.
- If your animal is exposed to a potentially rabid animal, wear gloves to protect yourself from the infectious saliva that may be on your animal's coat.
- Teach your children to stay away from wild animals, including bats or animals they do not know.
- Avoid attracting wildlife to your home by removing food sources such as food scraps and removing cat and dog food at night.

If there are any questions concerning rabies and/or receiving a rabies vaccination, please contact the Animal Care Enforcement Division at 829 Fairview Drive SW, Lenoir, NC 28645. If there is an emergency situation outside the normal working hours of 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday through Friday, please notify the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office.

A raccoon that got into a fight with 2 dogs after getting on the back porch of a home in Bessemer City turned out to be rabid.

Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement responded to a home on the 800 block of St. Marks Church Road in Bessemer City around 9:07 p.m. Fri 11 Nov [2022], where they heard the 2 dogs who lived at the home fighting with the raccoon.

The dogs chased the raccoon into some nearby woods. Animal Care and Enforcement later located the raccoon deceased in the woods. The raccoon was processed, and a rabies specimen was sent to the North Carolina State Lab.

On Tue 15 Nov 2022, Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement was notified that the raccoon tested positive for rabies. Both dogs were up to date on their rabies vaccinations and received a booster.

This marks Gaston County's 11th case of rabies this year [2022].

Animal Care and Enforcement notified the animal owner and conducted a neighborhood canvas in the area of St. Marks Church Road in Bessemer City to notify the community of the positive rabies result and to verify rabies vaccinations for family animals in the area.

The Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement stresses the importance of having an up-to-date rabies vaccination for all pets. By keeping pets current on their rabies vaccines, owners protect them from contracting the disease from wildlife and spreading the disease to family members and other animals, and to people in the community.

People should never handle or transport sick wildlife. The animal could have rabies. Gaston County residents should contact Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement to capture and transport sick wildlife.

Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement can be reached at 704-866-3320.

[8] North Carolina (Brunswick County): cat, wildlife, human exposure
Date: Tue 15 Nov 2022
Source: Newsweek [abridged, edited]
https://www.newsweek.com/rabid-pet-cat-attacks-owner-north-carolina-1759618


A pet cat attacked their owner after contracting rabies from a wild animal in North Carolina, officials say.

Brunswick County Health Services is urging local residents to "stay aware and take precautions to protect themselves" after the feline tested positive for the viral disease.

The cat is suspected of contracting the virus after being injured during an encounter with an "unspecified wild animal" earlier this month [November 2022], according to authorities. The encounter is said to have occurred in the south-central region of Brunswick County.

The cat subsequently became ill and later attacked its owner, and was taken to a veterinarian where it was euthanized. Further tests then confirmed the cat had rabies.

Its owner has received the necessary rabies vaccinations [PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis - Mod.TG] following the attack, Brunswick County Health Services said. The cat was not up to date with its rabies vaccinations at the time of the incident.

Under North Carolina state law, all domesticated dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies by the time they reach 4 months of age. It is also a requirement to maintain these rabies vaccinations throughout the pet's life with regular booster shots required. There are no legal waivers or [exceptions] to this rule.

The Health Services and the Animal Protective Services division at the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office has launched an investigation following the incident.

Meagan Kascsak, communications director for Brunswick County's government, told Newsweek that "the owner of the animal will be issued a citation if it is confirmed that the animal was not vaccinated or expired."

Kascsak said, "The altercation with wildlife was not witnessed and only assumed due to injuries. Due to injuries and signs of neurological and physical distress, the testing was requested by the veterinarian caring for the animal."

In the meantime, Brunswick County Health Services is calling on the community to take the necessary precautions to prevent any further cases of rabies. These include supervising pets outdoors, keeping them on a leash, and avoiding feeding outdoors. Residents are also being urged to refrain from feeding any wildlife or feral pets and secure garbage cans with wildlife-proof lids.

"Leave young wildlife alone," Brunswick County Health Services said. "If you find a juvenile animal that appears to need help, it is best to leave it alone and call a wildlife professional."

Rabies is most commonly transmitted through direct contact with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected animal. While it usually occurs as the result of a bite, it is also possible, while admittedly rare, for people to get rabies from non-bite exposures such as scratches, abrasions, or open wounds exposed to saliva or other potentially infectious material from a rabid animal.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states: "Other types of contact, such as petting a rabid animal or contact with the blood, urine, or feces of a rabid animal are not associated with risk for infection and are not considered to be exposures of concern for rabies."

[Skunks and bats are common carriers of the rabies virus. Be especially cautious of them.

I noted with interest the case with the goats and human exposure. Pets and/or livestock are susceptible to rabies. The wise producer, backyard raiser, show enthusiast, or any owner of animals should vaccine their pets and livestock. Any mammal is susceptible to the rabies virus and can transmit it to other animals and to humans.

Livestock can be especially dangerous, as the animal often outweighs humans and can react oddly before we realize there could be a problem. Vaccinating livestock may be lifesaving for both you and your animals. One rabid skunk can bite a lot of animals in the herd, but it only takes one to hurt a human. Please vaccinate your pets and your livestock.

Keeping pets up to date on rabies vaccinations is also important. Sadly, and obviously unexpectedly, wildlife can get into our homes through pet doors or by the timing of you opening a door for your own pet, only to have a rabid animal dash in as well. Protecting yourself means vaccinating yourselves and your animals.

If you believe you have been bitten or scratched by a wild animal or any unvaccinated animal, please thoroughly wash your wound with soap and water and then seek medical attention immediately. You may need to take post-exposure prophylaxis. It can be lifesaving. - Mod.TG]
