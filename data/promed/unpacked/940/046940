Health officials in the Cusco region in southeastern Peru have reported dozens of suspected human rabies cases in individuals in La Convención province, according to a Publimetro report.

A total of 85 people are suspected of having contracted wild rabies after being bitten by bats in the various Amazonian localities of Camana, Mayapo, Puerto Huallana, and Alto Pichas.

Regional director of Health of Cusco, Julio César Espinosa La Torre, said that among the group of victims with a bat bite are 15 soldiers transferred to Lima, of this group, 2 cases were confirmed, of which one is deceased.

Espinoza la Torre said that to date, more than 912 civilians and 680 soldiers have been vaccinated in Alto and Bajo Urubamba, in the district of Megantoni, who must receive up to 4 doses, every 7 and 14 days.

"We have had meetings with the heads of the communities in the zones to make them understand that all bitten people should effectively be vaccinated. It is about sensitizing them and showing them the health risk they may have", he concluded.

Worldwide, it is estimated that there are more than 69 000 deaths due to rabies annually.

[Cases of human rabies, including deaths, are frequently reported in the Amazon. There, several strains of the rabid virus circulate in the vampire bat, _Desmodus rotundus_. In remote rural areas, post exposure vaccination schemes are rarely implemented and this results in several human deaths. - Mod.PMB
