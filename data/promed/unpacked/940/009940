Bekasi busy with bird flu, dengue
-------------------------------------
Increasing numbers of both dengue and bird flu patients have forced the
Bekasi Municipal Administration to declare an extraordinary occurrence of
the diseases in the region.
Bekasi Mayor Akhmad Zurfaih said to prevent the diseases from further
spreading and to decrease the mortality rate, the administration would
allocate Rp 270 million [about USD 30 000] for dengue and Rp 26 million
[USD 2888] for bird flu from its budget. "These diseases have reached
alarming levels, and there are indications that the infection rate is
increasing. An extraordinary occurrence state is needed to anticipate the
worst possibilities," he told The Jakarta Post recently. Zurfaid said that
as many as 924 cases of dengue occurred in Bekasi between January and March
this year [2006], and 8 people had died.
Meanwhile, there had been 10 cases of avian influenza in the last 3 months,
with 3 deaths. Zurfaih ordered all related institutions to place extra
focus on the prevention of the diseases and on death minimization. "With
this status, there should be no increase in occurrences, and there should
be no more deaths (from the 2 diseases)," he said.
Oni Sri Rahayu has been at the Bekasi General Hospital since Sunday [2 Apr
2006] for dengue. Her father Herdi, a becak driver, was forced to apply for
a certificate of lack of means from his neighborhood chief to get the
10-year-old girl into hospital. "I hope (with the extraordinary occurrence
status) the government will provide a free medical service, because we
can't pay for her medicine," he said.

City [greater Jakarta] reports surge in dengue patients
-----------------------------------------------
An official said Sunday [2 Apr 2006] that 7624 dengue fever patients had
been recorded in the past 3 months, with 14 deaths. "During the past 3
months, the number of dengue victims has shown a significant increase,"
said an official at the city health agency, Evy Zelfino. She said there
were 2470 patients in January, 2433 in February and 2718 in March 2006.
Evy urged all residents to keep their environments clean to stop the spread
of the disease. "Apart from keeping our neighborhoods clean, fumigation
should also be carried out regularly," she said. She urged residents to
cover, clean and bury water containers and trash, which are used as
breeding grounds by the [_Aedes aegypti_] mosquitoes that spread dengue.

3 cases of dengue fever were confirmed in Puerto Iguazu. For 5 years, no
dengue fever transmission has been reported in Misiones.
The affected persons, 2 adults and a child, are members of the same family.
Their blood samples had been sent to Pergamino Institute in order to
identify the causative agent/strain and the definitive diagnosis.
The Provincial Epidemiology Direction detected and confirmed 3 dengue fever
cases in Puerto Iguazu, 2 adults and one child; all of them are members of
the same family. Misiones province had no patients infected with dengue
fever virus since the last epidemic outbreak that occurred back in 2001.
"Three years ago, we had 2 dengue fever cases, but they were foreign, since
these patients got infected in Rio de Janeiro, and this might not have
happened with the 3 cases detected last week in Iguazu, since they seem to
be locally acquired cases," confirmed the Epidemiology Director, Dr. Julio
Roberto Estevez.
According to this officer, blood samples from the 3 persons affected by
dengue fever in Puerto Iguazu had already been reported as positive in the
1st 2 diagnostic studies performed in the province. "Now we are waiting for
the results of Pergamino National Institute for Virology in Buenos Aires
province in order to determine the causative strain. We are also analyzing
samples from other suspected cases who have the typical symptoms of the
disease (muscle pain, headache and flu-like illness without sneezing), but
until now, all of them had been reported as negative."
Meanwhile, according to routine procedures, before diagnoses were confirmed
in Puerto Iguazu, healthcare personnel from the Public Health Ministry
performed environmental control actions and household and surrounding areas
fumigation in areas near SAMIC Hospital in Puerto Iguazu (where the
affected family lives) and searched for other suspect febrile cases.
Environmental control actions were also performed within the property of
the affected family, a few kilometers from Puerto Iguazu, and blood samples
were taken from neighbors who declared they had had fever within the past
15 days.
"This disease had never gone away. Dengue is currently in our country, and
in Misiones, it never went away after the year 2001, and even infestation
levels (mosquito vector population density) are very high throughout the
province. For some reason that still is [obscure] for me, until now we did
not have native cases in the province, but both in Paraguay and Brazil,
cases were still being detected," pointed out Dr. Estevez.
In fact, yesterday [28 Mar 2006], Dr. Vilma Basualdo, head of Health
Surveillance in Paraguay, confirmed the occurrence of 9 cases of dengue
fever in Asuncion, specifically in La Encarnacion neighborhood, where other
suspected cases were analyzed, so she estimated that there may be at least
30 cases.
Meanwhile, in Foz de Iguazu (Brazil), the existence of an important
transmission focus was confirmed, and 150 cases have been detected since
last week. Also, in Rio de Janeiro 100 affected persons were diagnosed in
the past few days.
"Climate these days does not help at all; we are in summer season and with
plenty of rainfall favoring the reproduction of the mosquito vector.
Certainly, I consider that there had been no more recent cases in the
region, since even though high temperatures were recorded, it was
accompanied by drought," he [Estevez] pointed out.
Dengue fever becomes evident after a one week incubation period, "and,
according to its symptoms, many persons call it "dry flu." Affected persons
must not take aspirin, since it may favor hemorrhagic complications; they
should use paracetamol instead; they must urgently seek medical care, and
they must inform the physician about any trip to neighboring countries,"
said Dr. Estevez.
Dengue is an infectious disease transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitos.
Therefore, the main preventive measure is to eliminate all breeding sites
for mosquitoes, water in any type of container, even flower pots and old tires.
"The problem is that neighbors in general do know preventive measures, but
they do not incorporate them within their habits. Another pitfall is that
municipalities must not abandon their responsibility with respect to basic
environmental sanitation, but, in real life, because of lack of resources
or because they have other priorities to take care of, most of them do not
perform environmental sanitation activities," said Dr. Estevez, the
Epidemiology Director. He said that "we have to understand that dengue
fever prevention is a priority in Misiones, a province where winter exists
only when you look at almanacs."

There is an epidemiological alert in Asuncion now that there are more
confirmed cases of dengue fever. The Health (Ministry) is concerned that
the hemorrhagic form may spread.
Health Surveillance General Direction at the Ministry of Public Health
declared yesterday [27 Mar 2006] an epidemiological alert in Asuncion and
in all Paraguayan borders now that 10 cases were confirmed as positive for
dengue fever in the capital city.
"There is a risk that an epidemic with unpredictable consequences may
occur, so we are urging people to make every effort to prevent it," says
the 2nd bulletin issued to all hospitals in the country.
The 10 confirmed cases occurred in Loma Pyta (15 minutes distance from
Asuncion), and there was another case in Nuestra Se ra del Huerto
neighborhood in Itauguay, and the other 7 cases occurred in La Encarnacion,
where this outbreak started.
Minister of Health Dr. Teresa Leon said in a press conference that they are
concerned because of the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak, particularly
with respect to hemorrhagic dengue fever cases, considering that there are
more than 20 000 susceptible persons that may acquire dengue hemorrhagic
fever, which is the most severe form of the disease.
With respect to the single case registered in Itaugu city (27 km from
Asuncion), she expressed that there are no persons with fever around the
house of the affected 11-year old boy.
What concerns health authorities is the situation in La Encarnacion
neighborhood, where 7 cases had been confirmed.
Meanwhile, there are another 30 suspected cases that will be confirmed or
ruled out during this week. Dr. Leon recommended that if early symptoms
appear (high fever, muscle pain, and retro-ocular pain), persons must go to
physicians and not self-medicate, since many people take aspirin, which may
be harmful. She admitted that there is fear because of the possible
occurrence of dengue hemorrhagic fever, "since we already had serotype one
all over the country; even though we still do not know what serotype is
currently circulating, there is always a risk for the development of
hemorrhagic dengue fever," she declared.
Considering that heavy rainfalls are occurring, Dr. Leon said that all
rubbish in yards must be disposed of, particularly flower pots, containers,
bottles, and anything that may accumulate rainfall water, since this water
serves as a mosquito breeding site.
"Nowadays, the main priority in our country is that the disease must not
spread, since it leads to school and job absenteeism; remember we had a
serious epidemic back in 2000," added Dr. Leon.
On the other hand, a mother, a neighbor in la Encarnacion, complained that
her daughter-in-law, 40-years-old, has all the dengue fever symptoms, but
to date, no healthcare personnel from the 18th Sanitary Region has been to
her household to administer medications to the patient.
SENEPA (Paraguayan National Malaria Eradication Service), as part of the
fight against dengue fever, recommends the following:
* Allow healthcare personnel and officers to enter households, these
persons will be adequately identified and accredited.
* This personnel will capture _Aedes_ mosquito larvae.
* They will identify possible mosquito breeding sites, and they will teach
persons how to eliminate and destroy these breeding sites.
* Cooperation is requested in order to eliminate all water-containing
recipients (paint cans, tin cans, old toys, plastic recipients, and the like).
* Notification of febrile patients can be made calling 215-168/9 and 203-998.

4 cases of dengue fever are reported in the tropics, 86 suspected cases as
of March 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Health personnel reported the occurrence of 4 cases of classic dengue fever
in 3 communities in tropical Cochabamba in the 1st quarter of 2006.
The Departmental Health Services (SEDES, according to its Spanish initials)
stated that the outbreak is well within the usual behavior of this tropical
disease, and it announced that they were sending healthcare worker teams to
the affected areas as a part of preventive measures.
According to the reports by healthcare personnel, it is known that 2 of the
confirmed dengue fever cases occurred in Ivirgarzama community, one in
Villa Tunari and the last one in Shinahota. Patients who were reported as
positive for dengue fever in laboratory tests were part of the 86 suspected
cases registered during the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the 2005 classic dengue outbreak (between June and November), 24
patients suspected to have dengue fever were reported out of a 350-person
possibly-infected-group, according to SEDES data. The most affected regions
in this outbreak were Shinahota and Ivirgarzama.
Now that there is a new outbreak, healthcare personnel said that next week
at least 10 teams will arrive at the affected area so that, in coordination
with local municipalities, breeding areas for the dengue fever vector,
_Aedes aegypti_ or other species, will be destroyed. Household fumigation
will take place only in the areas with a very high mosquito population.
SEDES director, Mr. Jaime Monta del Granado, said that sending teams to
Chapare is part of their routine activity and that dengue fever cases that
have been reported are well within the normal parameters for the disease.

Disease: 2 cases of dengue are reported in Penapolis
-----------------------------------------------
The Municipal Department of Health of Penapolis received yesterday [27 Mar
2006] the confirmation of 2 more cases of dengue in the town. With these,
the total number of cases in 2006 rises to 3; the 1st was on 27 Jan 2006.
According to the Town Hall Department of Social Communication, the affected
persons are adults, a man and a woman. One of the patients lives in the
rural area of the municipality, in the "bairro" Araponga and the other on
Dr. Mario Sabino Street, downtown.
The head of disease surveillance, Ms. Rosalicia Maria Lundstedt, R.N., says
that the routine measures of contact tracing and landscape managing have
already been undertaken. "We undertake these measures notwithstanding
confirmation. With the confirmation of these cases, what is left to do is
insecticide fogging to control adult mosquitoes in a radius of 200 meters
from the residencies of the cases. For this work, we have to wait for a
position from the Superintend cia de Controle de Endemias [the state
vector-borne disease control agency] that coordinates the actions and
supplies the insecticide, she said.
Rosalicia revealed that the town's situation is highly complicated. In the
Breteau index (which measures the infestation by the dengue vector
mosquito), between one and 3.9 is considered an alert. An index higher than
3.9 indicates the risk of an outbreak.
In the light of this we cannot deny that Penapolis will suffer problems
related to the occurrence of new cases, for there is an area of the town
that we call Area 2 that has a Breteau index of 5.14. This area comprises
the "bairros" of Vila Gardim, Vila Martins, S Vicente, Guanabara, Santa
Terezinha, Formosa, Primavera, Bairro Jardim, S Paulo, Residencial M io
Sabino, Residencial Fernanda, S Joaquim, Cidade Jardim, Jardim do Lago,
Vilage, Vilage Regina, Alto das Brisas, S Fernando, Palmares, Monreal, Del
Rey, Portal dos Faveiros, Miguel Barbeiro, Ana Paula and Regina C ia.
According to the last Breteau census, done last January [2005?], the area
called Area 1 (which comprises the "bairros" of Vila Anselmo, Vila F ima,
Vila Am ica, Vila Popular, Jardim Ip Jardim, Bras ia, Bela Vista, Jardim
Erc ia, Jardim Por do Sol, Distrito Industrial, Jardim Eldorado, Jardim
Canad, Vila T uio, Jardim Premier e Morumbi) has an index of 3.15. Area 3
(which comprises the "bairros" of S via Covas, Esplanada, Jardim dos
Sonhos, Residencial Dois Irm s, Morada do Sol, Menino Ariovaldo, Jardim
Para o, Atl tica, Tropical, Colina Verde, Haroldo Camilo, Parque dos Girass
s, Pereirinha, Aphaville, Panorana, Independ cia, Vila Aparecida, Ipiranga,
Planalto, Jardim Pevi, Rosa Alberton, Floren , Altimari, Edejama, Jardim
Paula Pereira, Shangri-le Vila Santos) has an index of 2.28.
These indexes are frightening. Rosalicia said that since 1999, the town did
not have such indexes. "I consider these indexes frightening, for they
reflect the lack of consciousness of the persons. The citizens are not
taking care of their backyards, since larvae were found in homes in several
bairros of the town." She emphasized that Area 2, particularly in the
neighborhood of Del Rey and Cidade Jardim, is totally infested.
"The highest tolerable index for a municipality is 1.99, [in order] to not
have dengue transmission," she explained. When the latest Breteau index
results were made public, Rosalicia called attention to the fact that
dengue cases should occur, since dengue virus 1, 2 and 3 circulate in the
municipality.
"For this reason [we] are under the risk of having hemorrhagic dengue in
Penapolis. We recommended that population be alerted to perform a search in
their backyards, removing everything that can hold water. But this has to
be done continuously, or what happens is that the town administration
performs a dragnet to remove water-holding objects, but sometime later the
backyards are again cluttered with these objects, making way for the female
mosquito to lay her eggs.
