Bighorn sheep in Elkhorn Mountains dying of pneumonia
------------------------------------------------------------
State wildlife officials said a number of bighorn sheep in the
Elkhorn Mountains south of Helena have died of pneumonia over the
past few weeks.

Officials have picked up about 6 carcasses, and the Fish, Wildlife
and Parks lab in Bozeman, MT, confirmed they died of the respiratory
disease. The Elkhorn herd was established in 1996 when 25 sheep were
transplanted there from Rock Creek near Philipsburg.

An aerial survey last March [2007] counted 198 sheep. Only 35 were
spotted earlier this week [14-18 Jan 2008]. Agency officials said
they won't know how severe the die-off was until another survey is
conducted near the end of March [2008]. The agency has no previous
mid-January counts with which to compare this week's survey.

Recreationists who see groups of live sheep, or find sick or dead
sheep in the Elkhorn Mountains, are asked to call FWP in Townsend at
(406) 266-3367.
