Macau has recorded this year's [2022] 2nd case of tsutsugamushi disease, also known as scrub typhus, the Health Bureau (SSM) announced.

Earlier this month [May 2022], the bureau reported that the 1st case, a 67 year old local woman, developed symptoms 4 May [2022]. Symptoms include mild fever, coughs, and runny nose. On 7 May [2022], her symptoms worsened to swelling in the right axillary lymph node. The next day [8 May 2022] she started to feel shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, dizziness, and weakness.

Originally, the private Kiang Wu Hospital diagnosed her with breathing and cardiac failure. The diagnosis was later corrected after the medical staff found an eschar the size of a soybean on her back. The patient works out every day at the Mong-Ha Hill and regularly walks on the lawn there.

The 2nd case is a 61 year old woman, a local resident who works as a cleaner in Mong-Ha Hill. She developed symptoms of fatigue and muscle pain around 4 May [2022]. The symptoms continued to worsen, and she developed a high fever on 10 May [2022]. She went to the Kiang Wu Hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with scrub typhus.

According to the SSM, symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle pain, and skin rash. A distinctive symptom is the formation of painless penetrating ulcerative eschars at the wound of the tsutsugamushi mite bite. The SSM warns that serious complications are possible, such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and myocarditis, resulting in respiratory failure, shock, and even death. The mortality rate can be as high as 60%.

Members of the public are recommended, when they visit the countryside, to take measures to lower the possibility of getting bitten by the insects, such as wearing mosquito repellent made with DEET, as it helps repel tsutsugamushi.

Pet keepers should frequently wash and trim their pets and use flea combs to remove fleas on the pets, as well as regularly inspect pet bedding and conduct deworming.

Maintaining personal hygiene, including doing laundry regularly, especially immediately after spending time in nature, will also help stop the spread of the disease, the SSM added.

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid (_Leptotrombidium_) mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; regional lymphadenopathy occurs at the site of the bite and may lead to generalized lymphadenopathy (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231374-clinical).

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing. The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23763648_Validity_of_the_Weil-Felix_test_in_the_diagnosis_of_acute_rickettsial_infections_in_Sri_Lanka).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken 2-4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region.

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html), and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

Macaw, also known as Macao, with an estimated population of 682 300 residents, is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta. Hong Kong is about 64 km (40 mi) to its east across the Delta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau).
