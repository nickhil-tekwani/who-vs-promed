Outbreak of Measles in Belarus, January-June 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Between January and June 2006, 87 measles cases were notified in
Belarus. Measles cases were reported in 5 of the 7 regions.
Particularly efficient transmission has been noted in 3 regions:
Minsk city (38 cases), Minsk region (29 cases), and Grodno region (17
cases). [For the location of these regions, see Figure 1 in the
original text, which shows the geographical distribution of measles
cases, and Figure 2, which illustrates the measles cases by week of
rash onset and their location.]
The majority (89 percent) of measles patients were older than 14
years, 52 percent of cases were older than 24 years and 6 percent
older than 40 years. Vaccination status is known for 61 of the 87
cases. 21 (34 percent) were unvaccinated against measles: 9 because
of their age (4 children under one year and 5 adults older than 40
years) and 12 due to contraindications or diagnosed measles in
childhood without laboratory confirmation.
Among the 40 patients known to have been vaccinated, 13 had received
one dose and 27 had received 2 doses of measles vaccine. All of
these, except for 2 patients, received their last dose of measles
vaccine more than 10 years ago. Of the 26 patients with unknown
vaccination status, 23 were aged 26 to 36 years and, therefore, would
have received only one dose of measles vaccine, according to the
historical schedule. The proportion of patients who had received 2
doses of vaccine among all reported cases was considerably lower in
the capital of the country in comparison with regions (Minsk city, 13
percent; Minsk region, 38 percent; Grodno region, 65 percent).
Of the 87 measles cases, 79 (91 percent) were admitted to hospital.
In Belarus, it is routine to admit patients with suspected measles to
hospital. The proportion of cases with severe clinical manifestations
was about 30 percent. 85 cases have been laboratory confirmed by
detection of measles IgM antibodies; 2 cases were epidemiologically
linked with laboratory confirmed cases.
The national laboratory investigates patients who are reported to
have exanthematous rash. During the 1st 6 months of 2006, 190 sera
samples were tested for measles specific IgM, and 350 sera samples
were tested for rubella specific IgM antibodies. Measles viruses were
isolated at the national laboratory from 25 measles patients living
in different regions. Sequencing of 450 nucleotides of the N gene of
7 isolated measles viruses identified them all as type D6, the same
genotype causing a measles outbreak in Ukraine. Comparative analysis
of the 7 Belarusian strains indicated that 3 different lineages of
the D6 genotype are in circulation. This indicates multiple
importations of the virus.
Measles trends in Belarus
-------------------------
Routine immunization against measles began in Belarus in 1967. In
1987, a 2 dose vaccination schedule (at the ages of 12 months and 6
years) with measles monovalent vaccine was adopted. In 1996, one dose
of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine replaced the monovalent
measles immunizations, and in 2000, a 2-dose MMR schedule was
introduced. The vaccination coverage of both the 1st and 2nd doses of
the vaccine has been over 95 percent for the last 10 years.
Due to vaccination, the measles incidence rate in Belarus decreased
from 600-800 per 100 000 population at the beginning of the 1960s to
1-5 per 100 000 population at the end of the 1990s. Since 2000, the
measles incidence rate in Belarus has been less than 1 per 100 000
population, and in 2004 and 2005, it was less than 1 per 1 000 000
(only 2 cases in 2004 and only one case in 2005 were reported).
In accordance with the World Health Organization Regional Office for
Europe measles elimination program guidance [2], laboratory
confirmation of measles is carried out in Belarus by detection of
specific IgM antibodies in blood sera [1]. In 2003-2005, all reported
measles cases were confirmed at the national measles/rubella
laboratory (Research Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology,
Ministry of Health), which is part of the WHO measles laboratory network.
Discussion
----------
Investigation of sera samples from 232 patients with exanthema (2.3
cases per 100 000 population) in 2005 revealed only one measles IgM
positive case. No measles case was detected between February 2005 and
January 2006, indicating that transmission of measles virus in
Belarus had been interrupted [3]. However, recent multiple
importations of measles virus have resulted in its limited spreading
within Belarus.
Measles cases were most frequent in unvaccinated individuals or those
vaccinated more than 10 years ago. Even in a highly vaccinated
population, susceptible individuals remain due to primary and
secondary vaccination failure. The geographical clustering of 2-dose
vaccinated patients may indicate cold chain problems in the past. The
transmission of measles was also facilitated by initial delay with diagnosis.
The following control measures were taken: maintaining the high level
of 1st and 2nd immunization doses of MMR vaccine, intensifying
surveillance of exanthematous diseases, timely revealing and
isolation of measles patients during the infectious period,
vaccination of unvaccinated and one-dose vaccinated contacts and
follow-up of all contacts.
In the city of Minsk, serological investigation of measles IgG level
in healthcare staff and subsequent immunization of susceptible
individuals is also being carried out.

[The most interesting aspects of this survey are the conclusions
that: (1) Even in a highly vaccinated population, susceptible
individuals remain due to primary and secondary vaccination failure;
(2) the geographical clustering of 2-dose vaccinated patients may
indicate cold chain problems in the past; and (3) that the outbreak
was maintained by separate introductions of D6 genotype measles virus
from neighboring Ukraine. - Mod.CP]
