Botulism is no joke. Whether it's from home-canned potatoes, pruno, fermented seal flipper, or meat paste.

There might be something lost in translation, but according to Ennahar Online, at least 2 people have died, and another 8 are ill from botulism toxin-containing meat paste. A 2nd person died, on Fri 3 Jul 2015, following a cardiopulmonary problem in Batna. This is the 2nd death from botulism after the death of a child in Khenchla. There are 8 people in the University Hospital of the province, according to the APS agency, quoting the director of the health facility.

The consumption of rotten meat paste (cachir) would be the cause of this serious disease, pending "the result of bacteriological analysis by the Pasteur Institute of Algiers." Quantities of nearly a ton of cachir and 339 kg of chicken paste were withdrawn from sale in the provinces of Batna and Khenchela.

[Botulinum, the most toxic of known toxins, is produced by the Gram positive spore-forming anaerobic bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, found in soil worldwide. Botulism is caused by the consumption of contaminated products containing spores. Spores produce toxin when they germinate in the product or in the digestive tract. Humans are most often intoxicated by consumption of the preformed toxin in such things as home-canned vegetables or even baked potatoes left unrefrigerated. As little as 0.001 microgram per kilogram body weight may be lethal. The time from ingestion of the toxin until clinical signs are observed will vary with the amount of toxin ingested. The onset of clinical signs may be as short as a few hours but is seldom more than 24 hours. A very small amount of material containing the toxin can cause symptoms. Signs can develop rapidly and death can occur in a little as 6 hours after initial onset. Clinical signs may begin in human beings between 12-36 hours after ingestion of the toxin. The clinical signs and symptoms in human beings include ptosis, blurred vision, diplopia [double vision], dry mouth and throat, dysphagia, and dysphoria [feeling unwell]. These are a result of cranial nerve palsies. These early signs are followed by symmetrical descending flaccid paralysis, with generalized weakness and progression to respiratory failure. - Mod.LL
