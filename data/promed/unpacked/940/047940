Due to a sudden outbreak of unknown virus disease in Bagerhat [district, Khulna division] farms shrimp are dying every day in a large scale.

Following the situation, panic has been created among shrimp cultivators of the district and they [have been] thrown into utter distress. Most of the shrimp cultivators cultivated shrimp after borrowing money from the banks or money lenders. If the shrimp die in such a large scale every day and it continues further most of the shrimp cultivators of the district will not be able to pay off their debts and cultivate shrimp for the next time.

The Fishery Department of the district has so far been unable to ascertain the cause behind the death of shrimps.

[It is uncertain why a viral disease is suspected. In the Indian Subcontinent, a shrimp disease frequently reported is white spot disease. Information about this episode would be appreciated. - Mod.PMB
