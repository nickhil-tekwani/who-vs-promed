A major outbreak of 'mosaic' disease has occurred on soybean crops in Ahmednagar district. The virus disease has been observed in the crops within just one month after sowing. Agricultural scientists visited soybean plots in the area.

They said that the disease is spread through seeds and sap-sucking insects. To control the disease, infected plants should be uprooted and destroyed immediately. If the disease incidence is high, the seeds from that field should not be used for sowing in the next year.

[_Soybean mosaic virus_ (SMV; genus _Potyvirus_) is a major pathogen of soybean (_Glycine max_) worldwide. It has a narrow host range and, other than in soybean, has only been reported only in few members of other families (Fabaceae, Amaranthaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Solanaceae).

Yield losses of over 80% have been reported in soybean; a major concern is reduced seed quality. Symptoms may include mottling and distortion of leaves; necrosis of leaves and shoots; stunting and occasionally death of plants. Seeds from infected plants often show mottling which is associated with poor germination. Crop damage depends on host genotype, virus strains, disease incidence and timing of infection within the growth cycle of the host; infections after flowering and low virus incidence usually have little economic impact.

SMV is transmitted by over 30 species of aphids in a non-persistent manner, as well as with infected seeds. Disease management may include cultural practices (such as early planting when aphid populations are still low) and use of certified virus free seeds; insecticides have not shown to be effective to reduce rate of transmission, even if vector populations are lowered. Several SMV resistance genes have been identified, but are not effective against all known viral strains. SMV has beed found in mixed infections with some other viruses of the crop (for example, _Bean pod mottle virus_, genus _Comovirus_), resulting in more severe symptoms, higher yield losses and increased rate of SMV seed transmission.

Members of the genus _Potyvirus_ (type species _Potato virus Y_) are found worldwide and cause significant losses in a wide range of crops. _Potyvirus_ is one of the largest plant virus genera containing about 15% of all named plant virus species.
