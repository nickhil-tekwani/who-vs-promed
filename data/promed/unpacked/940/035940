Since the 61-year-old was confirmed to have cholera, 5 more local cases of
cholera were diagnosed and confirmed by the Department of Health of the
Hong Kong SAR. The last case of the 5 was diagnosed on 3 June 2001. _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1 El Tor Inaba was isolated from all 6 cases.
So far no specific items of food, food outlets, or persons were identified
as the source of infection.
