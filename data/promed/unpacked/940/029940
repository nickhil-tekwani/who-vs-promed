In its latest weekly update yesterday [26 Mar 2020], the World Health Organization (WHO) marked another week with no new Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The last new case reported was on 17 Feb 2020.

Still, the WHO warned that, with continued insecurity and population displacement in previous Ebola hot spots, limited access to affected communities, and potential shortages of resources, a high risk of re-emergence remains, and surveillance and response operations must be maintained. The WHO also repeated its call for an urgent injection of USD 20 million to ensure that response teams, who are continuing to investigate suspected cases and provide support for survivors, can keep operating through the beginning of May 2020.

"If no new resources are received, WHO risks running out of funds for the Ebola response before the end of the outbreak," the agency said.

After validating 9 historic probable cases last week, the WHO says a total of 3453 Ebola cases have been reported in 29 health zones since the outbreak began in August 2018, with 2273 deaths (overall case-fatality rate, 66%).

[Note that the WHO AFRO dashboard figures above state 2264 deaths, but here WHO claims 2273 deaths. But the total number of cases are the same. Approaching the end of the Ebola outbreak is especially welcome with the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to the region. - Mod.LK]

- Thu 26 Mar 2020. Disease outbreak news: Update
[WHO Disease Outbreak News (abridged, edited)]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/19-March-2020-ebola-drc/en/


No new cases have been reported in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 17 Feb 2020 (Figure 1). However, due to challenges related to continued insecurity and population displacement in previous hotspots, limited access to some affected communities, and potential shortages of resources amidst other local and global emergencies, there remains a high risk of re-emergence of the virus. Therefore, it is critical to maintain surveillance and response operations in the period leading up to the declaration of the end of the outbreak, as well as after the declaration, as outlined in the WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak.

Active outbreak response activities continue, which include investigating and validating new alert cases, supporting appropriate care and rapid diagnosis of suspected cases (which continue to be detected), supporting survivors through a multi-disciplinary programme, and strategically transitioning activities. From 18-24 Mar 2020, an average of 4619 alerts were reported and investigated daily. Of these alerts, 358 were validated as suspected cases, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. From 16-22 Mar 2020, 2747 samples were tested, including: 1479 blood samples from living, suspected cases; 374 swabs from community deaths; and 894 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, laboratory activity was conducted at similar levels as compared to the prior week.

Last week, 9 historical probable cases were validated, whose dates of symptom onset were between October 2018 and July 2019, bringing the cumulative number of probable cases to 143. Further historical probable cases are expected to be validated as investigations into past cases continue.

As of 24 Mar 2020, a total of 3453 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1), including 3310 confirmed and 143 probable cases, of which 2273 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1935) were female, 29% (n=979) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers.

WHO has not received funding for the Ebola response since December 2019. An urgent injection of USD 20 million is required to ensure that response teams have the capacity to maintain the appropriate level of operations through to the beginning of May 2020. If no new resources are received, WHO risks running out of funds for the Ebola response before the end of the outbreak.

[2] Lessons
Date: Fri 27 Mar 2020
Source: UCLA Newsroom [edited]
https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/what-the-ebola-outbreak-could-teach-us-about-how-to-contain-the-novel-coronavirus


A new research paper examining the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak in Africa could hold crucial insights for policymakers grappling with the novel coronavirus pandemic -- namely, the importance of public engagement and trust during health crises.

The study (https://darinchristensen.com/files/sl-accountability-ebola.pdf), co-authored by Darin Christensen, assistant professor of public policy in the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, shows that where people lack confidence in their health providers, they are less likely to seek testing and treatment when they feel sick. This stymies efforts to identify, treat and isolate infected patients to limit further contagion.

By the end of the Ebola outbreak in early 2016, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated there were more than 28 000 cases of the disease in West Africa, with roughly half coming from Sierra Leone. Simple interventions that encouraged people to seek treatment increased reporting of Ebola cases by 60%, which the authors estimate reduced the virus' reproduction rate by 19%.

"The epidemic generated tremendous fear, and families faced tough choices about whether to care for loved ones at home or report to clinics for testing and, if needed, isolation," said Christensen, a political economist who holds a joint appointment with UCLA's political science department. "That choice may seem obvious in a rich country. But in poorer countries, like Sierra Leone, citizens often have little confidence that health providers will treat them with compassion or deliver effective care. Interventions that build that trust encourage timely testing, exactly what was needed to contain Ebola and, now, COVID-19."

Conducted across 254 government-run health clinics covering approximately one million people -- more than 15% of Sierra Leone's population -- the research tested the effects of 2 interventions aimed at increasing public involvement with, and trust in, the country's health system.

Under the 1st intervention, community members participated in meetings with local health clinics, and articulated complaints and suggestions designed to improve health services.

The clinic staff also shared public health advice with community members, like encouraging women to come into the clinic to give birth. This experiment turned patients into "accountability agents who hold health system actors to account," according to the paper.

The other intervention was an incentive program that gave out awards to health care workers at clinics that were doing a good job of providing services. The intent was to motivate providers to encourage their clinics to provide a higher quality of care.

The study found that these accountability interventions prior to the Ebola outbreak spurred a vast increase in testing and the reporting of Ebola cases, including those who tested both positive and negative for the virus. The reporting did not reflect higher rates of disease in the areas that benefited from the interventions. The higher rates of testing resulted in more effective containment, and, ultimately, there were 30% fewer deaths among Ebola patients in the areas that benefited from the interventions.

As governments, particularly in less-developed countries, seek to contain the spread of COVID-19, "there has rightfully been a lot of focus on the test kits and other equipment needed to fight this virus," Christensen said. "But it's also important to think about how we encourage people to change their behavior, to get tested, to self-quarantine. Our research suggests that strengthening ties between health providers and the communities they serve could bolster containment efforts as the current pandemic spreads to poorer countries.

"Many governments don't have the capacity or mandate to enforce strict restrictions on travel or gatherings," Christensen continued. "They must appeal to their citizens to voluntarily change behavior. The Ebola epidemic demonstrates that public engagement and confidence help determine whether people heed those calls."

The research team also has a forthcoming companion piece (https://darinchristensen.com/files/ebola-ccc.pdf) that underscores the effectiveness of crisis-response measures that emphasize community engagement.

Lessons learned that would benefit healthcare workers currently working on SARS-CoV2 infections:
- Build trust
- Integrate mental health care and other health needs into the response
- Recognize that impacts will be felt differently by women [This was true for Ebola, but with SARS-CoV-2, it may be that men may need special attention.]
- Strengthen multilateral coordination
- Invest in preparedness
