[This makes the 2nd report from Mediterranean islands in 2 days. It
will be interesting to see whether both outbreaks are due to serotype
2, which was the strain involved in the series of outbreaks in 2000.
In this regard, I again refer you to Peter Rodier's comments on the
upsurge in the Mediterranean; see Bluetongue,upsurge - Mediterranean
basin 20011122.2864. - Mod.PC]
