Dr. Veronica Madulid, provincial health officer, said more dog bite victims
were reported to her office. Two recent victims were 12-year-old Ryan Puche
and his sister Liezel, 9. Both bitten by a buang ayam (crazy stray dog),
they are now suffering from severe headache, fever, and the shakes.
The children's parents sought medical treatment from the Albay provincial
health office only after the two kids complained of fever and headaches.
But the health office does not have sufficient medicine for the children.
Madulid told The Manila Times that all health services from the health
department were available except medicines. [!
Despite the passage by Albay province two years ago of a rabies control
ordinance, rabid stray dogs proliferate in the streets with children as
their number one victims. Gonsalo Legaspi, regional regulatory division
chief of the Department of Agriculture, said the Bicol region has the
highest number of rabies cases and fatalities in the country. Dr. Madulid
said the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Albay passed the ordinance in 1998.

[While this report has a distinct political advantage and the children's
clinical condition is unconfirmed, it is clear that anyone travelling in
the Philippines, and especially in Bicol, should be aware of the risk of
rabies. Urban rabies is amply controlled through annual canine vaccination
and stray dog control. It is one of the easiest zoonotic diseases to
control when done correctly. - Mod.MHJ
