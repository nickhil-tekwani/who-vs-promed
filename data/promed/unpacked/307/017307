Hepatitis on the rise in Badin
------------------------------
Hepatitis B and C is on the rise in [Badin] district [Sindh province]
as 45 percent of people are suffering from the disease in Badin and
its adjoining villages, a report said. According to Civil Hospital
sources, there were 30 percent of patients [with] hepatitis C. When
contacted [a physician] in charge of a private blood bank said [that]
35 percent patients tested [positive for] hepatitis C and 10 percent
of them were believed to have contracted hepatitis B.

Dr Abdullah said the people were suffering from the disease due to
lack of basic health facilities, unhygienic and polluted atmosphere
[not responsible for blood-borne infections such as hepatitis B and
C. - Mod.CP], use of recycled syringes, and blood transfusion.

He said the hepatitis tests cost about [PKR] 3000 [USD 38.26] to PKR
5000 [USD 63.77] and [the] common man could not afford it. The people
have demanded of the government to constitute special medical teams
and provide medicines to eradicate the disease from the district.

EDO [Executive District Officer] (Health) Dr Abdul Sattar Channa said
there was no centre to treat hepatitis patients.

[The incidence of hepatitis B and C virus infection in Badin is
extraordinarily high, and indicative of inadequacies in the provision
of reliable blood transfusion and basic medical services. Hepatitis B
virus infection is preventable by vaccination and hepatitis C virus
infection responds to treatment with interferon and/or ribavirin.

The organisation and provision of such services, however, is a task
for Central government rather than local authorities.

Badin District is located in Sindh province east of the river Indus.
Its location can be found by accessing the map at

The region is swampy, but fertile for growing rice. Badin is the main
town of Badin District.
