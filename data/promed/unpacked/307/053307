A California chicken producer has issued its 1st recall since being linked to an outbreak of an antibiotic-resistant strain of salmonella that has been making people sick for more than a year, company and federal food officials said Thursday night, 3 Jul 2014. The FDA said it has found evidence directly linking Foster Farms boneless-skinless chicken breast to a case of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg, an antibiotic-resistant strain of the [bacterium] that has sickened more than 500 people [now over 600] in the past 16 months and led to pressure from food safety advocates for federal action against the company. As a result, Foster Farms issued a recall for 170 different chicken products that came from its Fresno facilities in March [2014].

The USDA said its investigators 1st learned of the case on 23 Jun 2014, and the recall was issued as soon as the direct link was confirmed. The location of the case and identity of the person were not released.

Foster Farms says the products have "use or freeze by" dates from 21 to 29 Mar 2014 and have been distributed to California, Hawaii, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Oregon and Alaska. The chicken would have the establishment number "P6137," P6137A" or "P7632" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. The long list of products in the recall include drumsticks, thighs, chicken tenders and livers. Most are sold with the Foster Farms label, but some have the labels FoodMaxx, Kroger, Safeway, Savemart, Valbest and Sunland. No fresh products currently in grocery stores are involved. The USDA said it was working with the company to determine the total amount of chicken affected by the recall.

The company emphasized that the recall was based on a single case and a single product, but the broad recall is being issued in an abundance of caution. "Our 1st concern is always the health and safety of the people who enjoy our products, and we stand committed to doing our part to enhance the safety of our nation's food supply," Foster Farms said in a statement. The company was linked to previous salmonella illnesses in 2004 and in 2012.

Recalls of poultry contaminated with salmonella are tricky because the law allows raw chicken to have a certain amount of salmonella -- a rule that consumer advocates have long lobbied to change. Because salmonella is so prevalent in poultry and is killed if consumers cook it properly, the government has not declared it to be an "adulterant," or illegal, in meat, as is _E. coli_.

In a letter from USDA to Foster Farms last October 2013, the department said inspectors had documented "fecal material on carcasses" along with "poor sanitary dressing practices, insanitary food contact surfaces, insanitary nonfood contact surfaces and direct product contamination."

[It interesting how defining an adulterant is different between enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ in beef and _Salmonella_ in chicken, despite the fact that both are commensals in their zoonotic host and pathogenic in man. In parallel, small turtles are illegal to sell, but small chicks are not, yet both can be vehicles for salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
