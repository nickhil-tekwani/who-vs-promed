Turkish authorities in the northern coastal town of Samsun have
erected a quarantine zone and begun slaughtering poultry after
suspected cases of bird flu, news agency Anatolia reported on
Saturday [2 Feb 2008].

"Samples have been taken, and slaughtering has started within a given
area. A 10-km (6-mile) protection and observation zone has been set
up, inside which health checks have begun," Anatolia cited a
statement from local authorities as saying.

Disinfection sites are in operation around the Galeric area, where
poultry from 7 farms have been slaughtered, it said.

Last month [January 2008], the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu was
found in a village about 350 km west of Samsun, which lies on
Turkey's Black Sea coast.

In January 2006, bird flu killed 4 children in a small town in
eastern Turkey after the virus spread to more than 1/3rd of Turkey's
81 provinces.

Authorities in Turkey, the 1st country outside east and Southeast
Asia where humans have contracted the virus, declared the country
bird flu-free in April 2007.

[According to a similar Reuters newswire, the Turkish Agriculture
Ministry said on Sun 3 Feb 2008 that the bird flu virus was detected
in dead chickens found late last month (January 2008) in the northern
part of the country, after it had started culling poultry due to bird
flu suspicions. The statement said it was informed about the dead
chickens on 28 Jan 2008 in Samsun province, on the Black Sea coast,
and that studies showed the virus was transmitted to farm chickens
from wild birds. "Bird flu disease was detected in the samples after
examinations in our ministry's laboratories," a statement from the
ministry said. It did not say whether the virus was the deadly H5N1
strain; see
<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L03668807.htm>, but Turkey's
recent notifications to the OIE on the outbreaks in backyard poultry
on its northern coasts, dated 22 and 28 Jan 2008, were confirmed as
H5N1, see:

Bird flu has spread to 3 more districts of Bangladesh, the livestock
department said on Sunday [3 Feb 2007], taking the number of affected
areas to more than half of the country's 64 districts.

The latest outbreaks were reported in southwestern Gopalganj,
northeastern Sylhet and northern Mymensingh district, officials said.

The port city of Chittagong was put on high alert after some dead
crows tested positive for the H5N1 virus, local officials said.

Officials said the government was taking measures to contain the
spread of the disease, but ignorance among millions of farmers across
the impoverished country remained a stumbling block.

Despite a government drive to burn or buy [bury?] the dead birds, many
farmers and backyard poultry breeders continue to ignore warnings,
officials said.

"More than 200 000 volunteers are visiting rural households and
educating people to report dead or sick birds [and on the] safe
disposal of poultry waste and other safe health practices," said
Mushtaque Ahmed, senior scientific officer at the Institute of
Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research.

Touching or eating sick poultry is the common way to become infected
by the bird flu virus that has killed more than 220 people globally
since late 2003.

So far, no human infection has been reported in Bangladesh, though
some 4 million people are involved in poultry farming across the
country.

The neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal has put 26 people in
isolation with bird flu symptoms after the most serious outbreak of
the disease in poultry.
