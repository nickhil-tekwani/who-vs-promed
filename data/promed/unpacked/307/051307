An egg-producing chicken farm in the centre of the Emsland region [Lower Saxony], with approximately 10 200 layers kept in 'floor system management' [see comment below], has been found infected by avian influenza. All the birds have been humanely killed.

The suspicion of bird flu had emerged through the self-check sampling system, applied according to the prescribed policy of the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (LAVES). The suspected infection has been confirmed by the national reference laboratory of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) on Riems Island, which has announced that it is the highly pathogenic form of avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H7N7. Experience has shown that the virus strain can be transmitted to humans only by close contact with diseased or dead birds and their products or excretions. One should avoid direct contact with infected animals. Based upon the official test results, the Emsland district authorities perform all necessary measures to combat the disease, in line with the European and federal regulations. "In addition, we call on all poultry farmers to review their biosecurity measures and apply them consistently," said District Administrator Reinhard Winter. A 10 km [6 mi] surveillance zone and an inner 3 km [2 mi] protection zone have been imposed.

Poultry shall not be moved from and into these areas. In addition, epidemiological investigation is being undertaken to determine the cause and to detect possible contact holdings. In case no new cases emerge within the coming 30 days, and cleansing and disinfection operations accomplished, the measures may be lifted.

The latest outbreaks of HPAI cases were recorded in Lower Saxony in December 2014, in the district of Cloppenburg and in the Emsland district, and caused by HPAI H5N8. In March and June 2015, outbreaks of the low pathogenic form of avian influenza type H7N7 were reported from the district of Cuxhaven and in the Emsland district.

In Germany, regular monitoring tests for avian influenza are applied to poultry flocks and wild birds. Additional information is available at http://www.tierseucheninfo.niedersachsen.de.

[The housing and management of layer hens can be carried out using one of 2 methods: caged layer production or floor production. In the floor production method, the birds are maintained in the house, on a litter covered floor.

The source of infection remains to be sorted out. The most recent HPAI H7N7 outbreak in Europe has taken place recently in the UK (Lancashire, Preston, England); so far, no additional cases reported there. The previous European event took place in northeastern Italy (Emilia Romagna; August 2013), where about 1 million birds were destroyed. Italy's epizootic is described in the presentation to the EU's SCFCAH (Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) meeting of 9 Sep 2013; see at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1011092013_avian_italy_en.pdf. According to the information provided by the Italian animal health authorities, all workers taking part in depopulation measures on infected premises applied strict prevention procedures and wore protective clothing (overalls, rubber gloves, boots, turbo ventilated masks with FP3 filter, etc.). They were regularly checked for symptoms of avian influenza infection. Infection was detected in 3 of the workers, mainly expressed by conjunctivitis.

The most serious HPAI H7N7 epizootic, so far, was recorded in the Netherlands in 2003; it involved infections in humans, mostly expressed by conjunctivitis, but one death, of a veterinarian, unfortunately took place.

Hopefully, spread in Germany will be prevented by the strict control measures already in operation. Official notification is anticipated. -Mod.AS
