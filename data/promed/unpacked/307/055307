The number of cattle that have died from anthrax in Lonjsko Polje is increasing, and the number of sick residents has also increased: now there are a total of 8 human cases.

At the fire station in Osekovo, doctors examined everyone who was in contact with infected animals, and tomorrow [19 Jul 2022] livestock vaccination will begin. To prevent the spread of infection in the nature park, the movement of people and vehicles is restricted. It is assumed that the animals became infected at the watering holes because anthrax spores got into the groundwater by shifting streams after the earthquake.

Not all contacts -- that is, not all who worked with those cattle -- respond on time. [The incubation period is a function of dose and can vary from a day to a few weeks. - Mod.MHJ] That's the problem we'll still have. In the entire area of Lonjsko Polje, it is necessary to vaccinate all cattle against anthrax as soon as possible, said the director of the Public Health Institute of Sisak-Moslavina County, Inoslav Brkić.

"The number of infected and dead cattle is increasing," Adrijan Vucić spoke from the field to the Studio 4 show. The services are on the ground, and work is being done to vaccinate the cattle so that the damage is not even greater and to protect people's lives.

[The information being shared is, sadly, of poor quality. Cutaneous infections come about from exposure to contaminated blood when handling carcasses or from being bitten by a Tabanid fly that has been feeding on a moribund or dead animal. The lesion usually develops in 3-4 days and is characterized by inflammation and itching; there is no pain. The black ulcer takes a number of days to appear. When sampling skin lesions, the best method is to use a hypodermic syringe and insert the needle under the lesion to obtain the blood fluid forming there. Three days of a long-acting antibiotic is usually adequate -- in my experience, doxycycline is the best -- to kill the organism, as most are very sensitive to antibiotics and quickly die. The problem is the toxic fluids produced, and these must be drained quickly, carefully, and until no more appears.

I very much doubt that the spread of disease is through contaminated groundwater. The vegetative cells in the cattle blood split on the ground and in these puddles do not survive long. In our experience, spores in water last only a few months (and are hydrophobic anyway ). The circumstances described are perfect for biting flies, and they will be present in large numbers. The female Tabanids are active snackers and will go from cow to cow with their contaminated mouth parts. Cattle within 1 km [0.6 mi] are at immediate risk, so vaccinate the infected herd and its neighbors. As these flies can fly longer distances, it is wise when you can to extend the vaccination out up to 10 km [6.2 mi]. Because of these longer flights, one should be on the lookout for singular unexpected deaths. They are not numerous, but they do occur and will test positive. Your livestock owners should be made aware of the possibility of these cases and the need to immediately phone in any information and suspicion. - Mod.MHJ
