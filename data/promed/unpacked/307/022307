Septoria, a fungal disease on wheat, has hit some areas on the Copperbelt [province] and some parts of the country. Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) said that Mpongwe [district] is showing serious drop in yields on early planted wheat by around 33 per cent in some areas and up to 50 per cent on other patches.

"In other parts of the country, wheat growers have reported minimal evidence of septoria. The overall impact that this may have on production will not be known until harvest is completed," ZNFU notes. [They] urged farmers to remain vigilant by assessing effects of septoria as they harvest. ZNFU has assured farmers to carry out a full assessment post-harvest.

Zambia now boasts of being self-sufficient in wheat production. The country has also become a source of wheat for the Democratic Republic of Congo.

[Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_, and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 per cent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash), and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.

Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED-mail post 20160516.4225677), as well as Australia and New Zealand (ProMED-mail posts 20161031.4598540 and 20140417.2410219).
