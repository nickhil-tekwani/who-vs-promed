The Department of Health and Family Welfare plans to take up a vaccination drive and step up surveillance activities to tackle Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, in the 2019-20 season.

In 2018-19, 14 persons died in the state of monkey fever -- 12 deaths in Shivamogga district and 2 in Uttaa Kannada district. As many as 440 positive cases were reported in the state during this period, of which 341 cases were from Shivamogga district. Aralagodu Gram Panchayat in Sagar taluk was identified as epicentre of the outbreak, where 10 deaths were reported. No positive case has been reported since [23 May 2019].

Kiran SK, deputy director of Viral Diagnostic Laboratory, Shivamogga, the main arm of the department in tackling the disease, told The Hindu that, last year [2018] 14 taluks spread over 8 districts of Karnataka had been identified as areas affected with KFD. The plan now is to administer vaccine to 5.17 lakh [517 000] persons in these taluks. The order for the vaccine has been placed with the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Bengaluru. The lab will start receiving the vaccine from the 1st week of July [2019], he said.

The vaccination drive used to commence in the last week of October, by which the ticks that spread the disease from monkeys to humans would become active. This year [2019] on, to enhance immunity among people in the affected areas, the vaccine will be given from the 2nd week of July. The booster dose will be given in October last week, he said.

To step up surveillance, the department has decided to strengthen field stations of KFD in Sagar, Honnavar, and Belthangady. One entomologist, 2 insect collectors, who will collect ticks from forests, and 3 multi-purpose workers would be appointed at each station. The recruitment process would conclude by [1 Aug 2019], Mr Kiran said.

He said surveillance involved identifying the unnatural death of monkeys in forest, collecting blood and viscera samples for tests, and disposing of the carcasses safely. The coordination between field level staff of the Health and Family Welfare, Veterinary and Forest departments was necessary for the success of surveillance activities. A rapid response team, comprising officers from the 3 departments, would be formed by September in affected districts to ensure better coordination, he added.

Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. KFDV was identified in 1957 when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka (formerly Mysore) state, India. Since then, between 400-500 humans cases per year have been reported.

Hard ticks (_Hemaphysalis spinigera_) are the reservoir of KFD virus and once infected, remain so for life. Rodents, shrews, and monkeys are common hosts for KFDV after being bitten by an infected tick. KFDV can cause epizootics with high fatality in primates. Transmission to humans may occur after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most importantly a sick or recently dead monkey. No person-to-person transmission has been described (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

Active animal and tick surveillance planning, along with an early vaccination campaign can serve as effective means of early detection of suspected patients as well as preventing further cases. - Mod.UBA]
