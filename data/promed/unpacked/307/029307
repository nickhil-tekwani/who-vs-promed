Plague reported contracted by area cat
--------------------------------------
Veterinarians at White and White Veterinary Hospital in Ennis,
Montana, have diagnosed the 1st case of plague this summer in an
indoor/outdoor pet cat. Over the years, veterinarians there have
diagnosed numerous cases of plague and tularemia, all in domestic
cats and in the summer months.

Cases have ranged from as far north as Norris to this most recent
case in the south, residing at Raynold's Pass.

A diagnosis of plague is confirmed either by growing the culprit
bacteria from a fine needle aspirate or by demonstrating an increase
in antibodies in the cat from the onset of the disease, compared to a
convalescent blood sample taken 3 to 4 weeks later. An independent
lab in Colorado confirmed the Raynold's Pass cat did have plague. The
cat has since made a full recovery.

Indoor/outdoor cats in rural areas that hunt rodents are the most
likely to encounter the 2 diseases.

Signs [in animals] include swollen lymph nodes, lethargy, anorexia
and a high fever.

[The causative bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_, is transmitted to people
through fleabites and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when
infected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.
They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially
cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea
treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some
products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for
an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your
veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and
puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under
the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front
leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia and fever. Please
take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in
your pet. Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves
when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the
veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one
palpating the swelling.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home
via a pet vehicle and can also transmit disease to you, the owner or
caretaker of the pet. - Mod.TG]
