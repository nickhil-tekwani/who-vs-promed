The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [23 Dec 2022] said that 3 new confirmed melioidosis infection cases had been recorded in the past week [17 to 23 Dec 2022]. The patients live in Sham Shui Po and the CHP's epidemiological investigations reveal that the cases' onset dates were all between early September [2022] and early November [2022].

The first case involved a 62 year old man with multiple underlying illnesses including diabetes and coronary heart disease, who is also receiving dialysis for end-stage renal failure. He developed fever and cough on [2 Sep 2022] and was admitted to the Caritas Medical Centre (CMC) after attending the accident and emergency (A&E) department of the hospital the previous day. He was later discharged after his condition stabilized. He was hospitalized again on [5 Dec 2022] due to a persistent fever and was discharged on [10 Dec 2022]. On [15 Dec 2022], he attended the A&E department of the CMC again, due to fever and abdominal pain, and was admitted. He is still hospitalized and his current condition is stable. His peritoneal dialysis specimen was confirmed positive for _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ upon testing.

The 2nd case involved an 80 year old man with multiple underlying illnesses including impaired fasting glucose and hypertension. He developed chest pain on [15 Oct 2022] and attended A&E at CMC on [15 Nov 2022], and the clinical diagnosis was pneumonia. Later, his chest pain worsened and fever developed, so he returned on [9 Dec 2022] and was admitted. His condition has been stable all along and he was discharged on [16 Dec 2022]. His sputum specimen was confirmed positive for _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ upon testing.

The 3rd case involved an 82 year old man with multiple underlying illnesses including diabetes and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He developed shortness of breath on [10 Nov 2022] and attended a general outpatient clinic on [5 Dec 2022] due to a persistent cough. On [8 Dec 2022], his shortness of breath worsened so he attended A&E at CMC and was admitted. His condition has been stable all along and he was discharged on [16 Dec 2022]. His sputum specimen was confirmed positive for _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ upon testing.

A total of 46 melioidosis infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong so far in 2022, among which 30 cases living in Sham Shui Po were recorded since August [2022].

The government had earlier [announced the] inclusion of melioidosis as a statutorily notifiable infectious disease under Schedule 1 to the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance (Cap. 599). The CHP will continue to work closely with the Hospital Authority to enhance surveillance against melioidosis cases. A spokesman for the CHP reiterated that person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but [said that] melioidosis bacteria can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. According to the literature, cases of infection are commoner after typhoons or storms. The bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ causing melioidosis in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or storms, and the bacterium may spread more easily with strong winds or storms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

The CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromised conditions, in order to receive appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (the commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus on the soft tissues or lungs can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be reduced to 40%-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials, and, in fact, bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _B. pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in the treatment of infection with the organism.
