A deadly livestock disease called lumpy-skin disease [LSD] has threatened to wipe out about 2000 cattle in Gwembe district in Southern Province. ["Deadly" and "wipe out" are somewhat excessive expressions; see commentary. - Mod.AS]

Officials at the district veterinary office said the disease, earlier reported in Chisanga and Chipepo areas, has now spread to all parts of the district.

According to a report obtained from the Veterinary Department, Munyumbwe area has lost more animals to the disease than all other parts of the district. From the 92 cases of bovine lumpy-skin attacks in the area, about 29 animals have died since December 2011. Munyumbwe has a herd size of 309[herds] and 1425 animals, which are at risk of contracting the disease.

In Chipepo and surrounding areas, 7 deaths have been reported from the 24 cases recorded in December 2011, while 17 animals were treated [see comment]. Chipepo area has 45 [herds] and 360 animal population at risk. Gwembe Plateau has recorded no animal deaths, but 5 cases were reported and treated in December 2011.

Veterinary officials in Gwembe have expressed worry at the farmers' reluctance to have the affected animals treated [or rather vaccinated? -- see comment].

The officers said the response has been poor and called on livestock farmers to ensure that they treat their animals of manageable diseases in order to boost the animal population in the district.

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD, knopvelsiekte) is a pox disease of cattle characterised by fever, nodules (on the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs), emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, oedema of the skin, and sometimes death (mortality rates as high as 40 percent or more have been encountered but they are usually lower). The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and death due to secondary bacterial infections. Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus is thought to be predominantly by insects, natural contact transmission in the absence of insect vectors being inefficient.

Lumpy skin disease occurs in most African countries. The most recent outbreaks outside Africa occurred in the Middle East in 2006 and 2007 and in Mauritius in 2008. (The summary above is partly based upon chapter 2.4.14. of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2011 available at http://www.oie.int/en/international-standard-setting/terrestrial-manual/access-online/).

The "treatment" mentioned in the media report above probably refers to supportive treatment, meant to address secondary bacterial infections; there is no specific antiviral treatment available for LSD-infected cattle. 2 vaccines, however, against Neethling and Kenya sheep and goat pox virus, have been used widely in Africa with success. The proverbial "Prevention is better than cure" is certainly applicable in this case: timely vaccination of susceptible cattle would have been the preferable measure to be promoted.

LSD is endemic in Zambia. During the 1st half of 2011 (most recent OIE report available), 2547 cases, including 55 mortalities, were reported. In fact, the very 1st identification of the clinical syndrome took place in Zambia (formerly Northern Rhodesia) in 1929. Initially, it was considered to be the result either of poisoning or a hypersensitivity to insect bites. Between 1943 and 1945, cases occurred in Botswana (Bechuanaland), Zimbabwe (Southern Rhodesia), and the Republic of South Africa. The infectious nature of the disease was recognized at this time. A panzootic in South Africa, which lasted until 1949, affected some 8 million cattle and consequently incurred enormous economic losses.
