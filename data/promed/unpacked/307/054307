Fish-killing virus found in Lake Superior
-----------------------------------------
The fish-killing viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus finally has
turned up in Lake Superior. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
officials announced this week that VHS, which can be lethal to at
least 25 fish species, was found in organ samples taken from
seemingly healthy fish in 4 sites on Lake Superior.

It is the 1st confirmed presence in Lake Superior of the virus that
turned up in Wisconsin waters in 2007. That finding, in Lake
Winnebago, led to stringent regulations on the movement of bait fish
across the state and other measures that appear to have been
effective in slowing its spread. Beyond Winnebago, the virus has been
found only in the Wisconsin waters of Lake Michigan and the connected
waters of Green Bay.

Wisconsin officials said the news will not lead to any changes in the
way VHS is managed because they adopted a plan that assumed it
eventually would turn up in the Lake Superior system because it is
connected to the other Great Lakes, all of which have tested positive
for the virus. Not surprising. The Lake Superior findings are the
result of research from Cornell University.

"We're disappointed with Cornell's finding, but not surprised,"
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR)Secretary Matt Frank
said in a news release Wednesday. "The good news is that our VHS
rules for boaters and anglers stay the same and will continue to
protect our inland waters."

The DNR reported that the Cornell team collected nearly 900 fish in
June 2009. Those fish were screened with a new tool that indicated
"trace amounts" of the virus in a small number of fish taken from 2
locations near Duluth as well as in the waters off Michigan's Baraga
and Chippewa counties.

In 3 of those areas the findings were classified as "preliminary
positive." The only confirmed positive was taken from a single yellow
perch off Michigan's Chippewa County near the community of Paradise.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus is an extremely serious
pathogen of fresh and saltwater fish, and is causing an emerging
disease in many lakes of the United States and Canada.

Viral hemorrhagic disease affects freshwater and saltwater fish. The
causative virus is in the family _Rhabdoviridae_ and is a
_Novirhabdovirus_. The disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic
carriers, or by clinically ill fish. It can be transmitted through
the water or through direct contact. The virus is also carried in
sexual fluids, urine and feces. When the water has an overall
temperature of 20 C [68 F], the infectivity of the virus is lost in
approximately 24 hours. Conversely, the infectivity is maintained for
several days when the water temperature is a constant 4 C [39.2 F].
Therefore, it stands to reason that the incubation time is related to
water temperature and ranges from between 7 and 15 days.

The disease transmits easily between fish of all ages. Mortality is
highest at low water temperatures between 37 and 54 deg F (2.7-12.2
deg C). Some fish will show no external signs while others show signs
that include bulging eyes, bloated abdomens, inactive or hyperactive
behavior, and hemorrhaging in the eyes, skin, gills, and at the base
of the fins. Infected fish may also have lesions that look like those
caused by other fish diseases, therefore testing is necessary to
determine whether the fish is infected with VHS virus.

There are 3 different syndromes associated with the virus outbreak.
Those 3 symptoms include nervous, chronic and acute. They may overlap
to the point that all of these may be seen at one time during an
outbreak. Some fish may hemorrhage, some may be seen to have
neurological signs, such as swimming in circles. It is considered a
reportable disease in many states in the USA.

VHS has been found specifically in the waters of Lake Huron, Lake St
Clair, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the St Lawrence River. Due to its
high mortality and severe economic consequences, VHS is classified as
a reportable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE). - Mod.TG]
