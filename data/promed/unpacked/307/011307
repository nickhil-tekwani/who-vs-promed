CDC has been contacted by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Taiwan, Republic of
China, concerning an outbreak of enterovirus among infants and young
children. Since April 1998, a large number of children have contracted
hand, foot and mouth disease, and a increased number of children have been
hospitalized with viral (aseptic) meningitis or encephalitis. Of those
hospitalized, approximately 30 children < 3 years old have had a short
febrile illness (2-4days' duration), decompensated suddenly, and died
within 12-24 hours. Some of the fatal cases had hand, foot and mouth
symptoms. It is still unclear whether the three types of cases (hand, foot
and mouth disease, meningitis/encephalitis, and fatal) are related. During
this investigation, enteroviruses have been isolated from stool,
cerebrospinal fluid, and other specimens. In particular, enterovirus 71 has
been identified most often, but it is not yet confirmed as the cause of the
outbreak.
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is usually a mild, self-limited
illness that primarily affects infants and young children. The most common
cause of HFMD is infection with coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), a member of the
enterovirus group of viruses. Usually there are no complications of HFMD
caused by CA16 infection, although aseptic or viral meningitis may occur
occasionally. A second common cause of HFMD is enterovirus 71(EV71). In
addition to HFMD, EV71 may also cause aseptic or viral meningitis,
encephalitis, or a polio-like paralysis. EV71 meningitis or encephalitis
may, on rare occasions, be fatal. Currently, there is no specific antiviral
treatment licensed for CA16, EV71, or other enterovirus infections.
Treatment of mild cases is symptomatic, directed at relieving fever,
headache, and malaise. Children ill with meningitis or encephalitis are
usually hospitalized.
Transmission of enteroviruses is usually from person-to-person; coming into
contact with respiratory secretions (mucus, saliva) that contain the
enterovirus. Enteroviruses are also excreted in stool, and can spread by
direct contact with it. Therefore, good hygiene -- including frequent hand
washing, appropriate cleanliness during diaper changes -- and not sharing
items such as spoons and cups, etc. are simple actions that can be taken to
reduce transmission. The current HFMD outbreak among infants and children
in Taiwan is not related to the foot-and mouth disease outbreak that
occurred among swine in Taiwan in 1997. Although the names of the two
diseases are similar, they are not related and are caused by different
viruses.
CDC is providing consultation to the Ministry of Health and is on-site in
Taiwan to assist with the investigation and control of the outbreak.
