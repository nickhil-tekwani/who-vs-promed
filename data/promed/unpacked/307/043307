The Brazil Health Ministry website reported there have been 1053 measles cases and 5 deaths, as of 2 Aug 2018. This negative news is a significant increase from the 20 Jul 2018 Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) report, which said Brazil had confirmed 677 measles cases during 2018. Also, indigenous Brazilians living close to the Venezuelan borders are particularly vulnerable to measles outbreaks.

According to this PAHO update, 126 measles cases, including 53 deaths, were reported from the Yanomami communities in the municipality of Alto Orinoco, state of Amazonas, Venezuela, where there is currently an outbreak.

Moreover, according to the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, which carries out biological research and development in Brazil, samples were taken from measles patients in Roraima, the most common place to cross the border, and are from the D8 genotype. This is the same measles genotype currently circulating in Venezuela, reported the LA Times.

In addition, PAHO/WHO recommends advising that all travelers over 6 months of age who cannot show proof of vaccination or immunity receive the measles and rubella vaccine at least 2 weeks before traveling to areas where measles transmission has been documented. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says to visit your health care provider 4-6 weeks before your trip to get vaccines or medicines you may need. On 15 Mar 2018, CDC updated its Healthy Packing List for international visitors to Brazil. But, as of 2 Aug 2018, CDC had not issued a Travel Alert for Brazil regarding their measles outbreak.

In the USA, there are 2 approved measles vaccines, MMR-II and ProQuad, which are available at certified pharmacies.

[The indigenous peoples in the Yanomami communities are particularly at risk of contracting measles because of their low resistance to diseases that are introduced from outsiders. There are approximately 35 000 Yanomami remaining alive. The Yanomami lived in relative isolation until recently, and consequently are na√Øve to most diseases encountered in Brazil. It is difficult to reach them in the tropical rain forest of Southern Venezuela and Northern Brazil, where they live. But according to a 5 Jul 2018 report from CNN, the Brazilian MoH said medical teams have been deployed to the region as well as 711 400 doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. One has to hope the community will be receptive to receiving the vaccine. - Mod.LK

The 1st case of measles in South Carolina since 1997 has been reported in Georgetown County, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. DHEC says it received a report on Fri [10 Aug 2018] of a confirmed case of measles in a resident who lives in Georgetown County. The state agency is investigating and trying to contact people who may have been exposed. DHEC said that it has instructed healthcare providers to look for patients with symptoms of measles and immediately report cases to their regional public health office.

According to DHEC, measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000 but is still common in parts of the world. DHEC says this is the 2nd confirmed case of measles in South Carolina since 1990, with the last case being found in Charleston in 1997.

"Measles is an acute viral respiratory illness and is highly contagious," said Dr Linda Bell, DHEC's state epidemiologist, in a news release. "It is critical that healthcare providers and the public be aware of the symptoms associated with this disease. The best way to prevent measles is by vaccination. I strongly encourage everyone to review their immunization records and make sure there are no other immunizations you need." ...

[This case was most likely travel-associated, either through the patient having been exposed during travel or by being exposed to an infected individual from another country. Either way, the individual would not have been vaccinated and, therefore, was susceptible. See below for cases in Michigan, with similar risk and exposure. - Mod.LK

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed 2 new cases of measles, reported in Oakland and Washtenaw Counties. In light of that and with the start of a new school year just around the corner, the Branch-Hillsdale-St Joseph Community Health Agency is urging parents to protect their children from measles and other diseases through vaccination.

Director of personal health and disease prevention Yvonne Atwood says: "Measles is one of the most highly communicable infectious diseases. All persons who have not had the disease or been successfully immunized are susceptible." She adds: "Measles, like the other vaccine preventable diseases, can have very serious complications such as secondary infections, blindness, and even death."

The state says neither of the recent cases are related to the 2 previous Michigan cases this year [2018]. But, all of the cases were the result of exposure outside of the country.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has been notified of a further 5 cases of measles in Dublin, bringing the total number of cases in recent weeks to 11. A spokesperson for the HSE said that the organisation is "particularly concerned" about the risk of measles in children who attended Temple Street Children's University Hospital on certain dates in July and August 2018 and "may have been exposed to an infectious case of measles".

Earlier this month [August 2018], it was confirmed that 2 adults and 2 children were likely to have developed measles from contact with one of the 2 earlier cases at hospitals in Dublin. If an adult or child attended Temple Street Hospital on any of these dates and develops symptoms of measles, they have been advised to stay at home and phone their general practitioner for advice.

People at increased risk of getting measles are those who are not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine or who have not had measles in the past. ...

There are ongoing outbreaks of measles in multiple countries in Europe and worldwide. Most of the cases in the EU in 2018 were reported from Romania, France, Greece and Italy. Most people who get measles on holiday do not know they were exposed until they develop disease, the HSE said. Unrecognised exposures to measles have occurred at airports, on planes, at concerts, in shops, and in healthcare settings. In 2018, 31 deaths associated with measles have been reported in EU countries.

Vaccination remains the most effective measure against infection. Children aged 6-11 months who are travelling to other countries and regions where measles outbreaks have been reported are recommended to get the MMR vaccine. A dose given before 12 months of age does not replace the dose that would normally be given at 12 months of age, the HSE advised.

Older children should be age-appropriately vaccinated. Children who have missed their recommended doses should get the MMR vaccine from their GP. Adults may be at risk of measles, particularly those under 40 years of age who have never had measles or 2 doses of a measles vaccine.

[5] Italy: vaccination

An amendment from Italy's anti-establishment government that removes mandatory vaccination for schoolchildren is sending shock waves through the country's scientific and medical community. It suspends for a year a law that requires parents to provide proof of 10 routine vaccinations when enrolling their children in nurseries or preschools. The amendment was approved by Italy's upper house of parliament on Fri [10 Aug 2018] by 148 to 110 votes and still has to pass the lower house.

The law had originally been introduced by the Democratic Party in July 2017 amid an ongoing outbreak of measles that saw 5004 cases reported in 2017 -- the 2nd-highest figure in Europe after Romania -- according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Italy accounted for 34 per cent of all measles cases reported by countries in the European Economic Area, the center said.

Italy's Five Star movement and its coalition partner, the far-right League, both voiced their opposition to compulsory vaccinations, claiming they discourage school inclusion. League leader and interior minister Matteo Salvini said in June 2018 that the 10 obligatory vaccinations, which include measles, tetanus, and polio, "are useless and in many cases dangerous, if not harmful", according to ANSA news agency. "I confirm the commitment to allow all children to go to school," he added. "The priority is that they don't get expelled from the classes." Health minister Giulia Grillo, a Five Star member, said the government wants to "spur school inclusion and simplify rules for parents".

Doctors and experts have warned that the amendment might invert a positive trend that saw Italy's inoculation coverage rising after spending years lagging behind the World Health Organization's recommended 95 per cent coverage level to ensure "herd immunity". "Italy's measles vaccine coverage was par with Namibia, lower than Ghana," said Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at San Raffaele University in Milan. "But the law was working; the coverage was improving. We should strengthen it, not weaken it. Now, children who are not vaccinated will endanger other children at school who are too small for vaccines or cannot be vaccinated because they suffer from immunosuppressive diseases."

In 2015, child immunization rates in Italy for the 1st dose of the measles vaccine was 85 per cent, according to WHO figures. The 2nd dose was 83 per cent.

Italians' trust in the efficacy and safety of vaccinations was affected by an infamous ruling in 2012 from a Rimini court that established a link between autism and the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccination, experts say. While the ruling was overturned 3 years later, it helped anti-vaccination theories to spread in Italy and globally. "Italy is part of a global trend of distrust in mediators -- doctors and scientists -- who can interpret and explain data," said Andrea Grignolio, who teaches the history of medicine and bioethics at La Sapienza University of Rome. "With the advent of the internet, people have the illusion they can access and read data by themselves, removing the need for technical and scientific knowledge."

While European countries behave differently as far as mandatory vaccinations are concerned, and the actual efficiency of forcing parents to inoculate their children is disputed, Grignolio and Burioni agree that, in the case of Italy, the law was having the desired effect. By 2017, child immunization rates for the 1st dose of the measles vaccine had increased to 92 per cent, though the 2nd dose remained low at 86 per cent. The majority -- 89 per cent -- of measles cases in Italy in 2017 were among unvaccinated people, and 6 per cent of infections affected people who received only one dose of vaccine, according to a report from the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC).

Others maintain that the skepticism about vaccines is in line with a more general lack of trust in Italy's institutions, a sentiment that the populist Five Star Movement was able to channel in its political agenda, winning support at the latest general elections. "Distrust in vaccines is one of the symptoms of a more general distrust in institutions," says Riccardo Saporiti, a data journalist and contributor to Wired Italy who has written about vaccine coverage in Italy. Saporiti argues that distrust in Italian institutions started in Italy with what was called Tangentopoli (Bribesville), a corruption scandal that shattered the postwar political establishment in the 1990s. "It destroyed Italians' trust in politics, and then it spread to anyone with a specific expertise," he said. "Five Star's slogan at the 2013 elections was 'One is worth one,' which is the denial of any concept of competence and merit."

In a data analysis for Wired, Saporiti uncovered that in some areas in Italy, one in 2 children born in 2013 did not get the MMR vaccination. However, the future is not all dark, according to Grignolio, who says 10 per cent of Italians who are somewhat hesitant about vaccinations can be convinced to inoculate their children. "When there's an obligation, they will comply. But the newly approved self-certification is a joke," he said.

[The removal of mandatory vaccination for schoolchildren is a dangerous step backwards. It reflects the growing vaccine hesitancy prevalent in many countries, as well as a distrust of institutions and of science. Measles tripled in Europe in 2017, ECDC reports: 30 European nations reported a total of 14 451 measles cases in 2017, more than 3 times the number reported in 2016 with 4643 reported cases. WHO estimates that more than 450 children die each day from measles, making it a leading cause of death. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease with an outstanding safety record. It is the best and least expensive way to prevent the disease and protect the population at risk. - Mod.LK
