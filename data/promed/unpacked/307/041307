Comment on the use of impregnated bednets by US military in Liberia
----------------------------------------------
I was one of the team that evaluated and cared for the 43 Marines and
Sailors who were med-evaced from Liberia to Bethesda Naval Hospital. [I am
responding] to the query about why no Marines were using bednets while in
Liberia. Bednet use is a part of the standard Navy/Marine Corps procedures
for malaria prevention. The Marines deploying to Liberia had bednets back
on their ship. The decision not to go ashore with bednets was multifactorial:

1. Operational considerations (essentially fast in and fast out with as
little equipment as possible) made bringing cots, poles, and bednets
difficult.

2. The initial plan was only for 1-3 nights, not 10-12 nights

3. Marines were staying in an old airport building with a hard floor, not
the ideal setup for use of bednets with poles that need to be driven into
the ground.

A review of the situation leading to this outbreak addressed the lack of
bednet use as a significant factor in development of these cases. A newly
developed, easily folded, easily deployed bednet with a floor was
demonstrated, and is in the process of coming into the Department of Defense
supply system for future deployments.

[Impregnated bednets have a protective efficacy of around 50 percent if
used properly. The reason for not finding higher efficacy is that the net
provides protection only while the individual is sleeping under it. Thus
there is exposure to mosquitoes early in the morning and in the evening
before going to bed, and soldiers on night duty will not be protected. The
use of nets in the given situation would therefore have reduced the number
of cases, but probably by less than half. Under intense transmission as in
this situation, chemoprophylaxis provides better protection than
impregnated bednets. - Mod.EP]

[But another response, from a former Marine, highlights the problem of poor
compliance with prophylaxis among the military. In such circumstances, any
reduction in illness among active duty troops provided by impregnated bednets
is operationally important. It is good to hear that the experience of this
outbreak has led to immediate modification of bednet design. I suppose
neither Marines nor Sailors sleep in hammocks any more, but the jungle
hammock with integral bednet is a very practical design, & could be readily
rigged inside buildings on the light dismountable tubing frames used for
garden hammocks, probably no heavier in total weight than camp cots. - Mod.JW]
