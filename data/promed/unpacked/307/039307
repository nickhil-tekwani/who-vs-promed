Reports of 3-day sickness are increasing in prominence following summer rainfall across parts of Queensland and New South Wales.

Three-day sickness, or bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), is a viral disease is spread by mosquitoes and biting midges. It is called 3 day sickness because the clinical signs of the disease usually last for 3 days. More information on the MLA [Meat and Livestock Australia] website is available at https://www.mla.com.au/research-and-development/animal-health-welfare-and-biosecurity/diseases/infectious/three-day-sickness/.

Veterinarians and livestock agents in Central and Southern Queensland have told Beef Central this week there have been widespread reports of cattle going down with 3-day and some cattle losses also occurring.

Predictions of a La Nina and a wet summer led to higher than usual demand for 3-day vaccine late last year [2021] which overwhelmed available supplies and meant many herds were not protected in what has turned out to be a more severe 3-day season than usual.

Clermont, Central Queensland, veterinarian Dr Alan Guilfoyle said he has heard numerous reports of cattle down, but not a lot of reports of cattle dying in his region.

Further south at Dalby, Peter Bird from Eastern Rural said reports of 3-day sickness were quite prominent and some serious cattle losses had been reported in the region.

Roma livestock agent Rod Turner from Nutrien said there were also plenty of reports of 3-day in the region, but while large numbers were affected, reports of actual losses appear to have been limited.

Dr Guilfoyle said the best treatment for affected cattle was anti-inflammatories, and also hydration.

"A drink of water goes a long way on a hot day," he said.

He said the best advice for producers going forward was to plan ahead and order vaccines early in the year to improve the chances of securing the supplies they need to vaccinate in June or July.

[This article contains some excellent information about this disease. It should be noted that bovine ephemeral fever is not a zoonotic disease.

The following is excerpted from Fenner's Veterinary Virology, 5th edition (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bovine-ephemeral-fever):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Although the clinical and epidemiological presentations of bovine ephemeral fever are highly characteristic, laboratory confirmation is required. A diagnostic increase in antibody titer, or preferably seroconversion, can be detected by enzyme immunoassay, including blocking ELISA, by neutralization assays, which are virus specific, or by immunofluorescence or agar gel precipitin tests, which are cross-reactive with related rhabdoviruses. Although virus isolation was the traditional 'gold standard,' real-time RT-PCR assays are now routinely employed to achieve rapid (i.e., 'same day') confirmation of bovine ephemeral fever.

Immunity, prevention, and control
---------------------------------
"Infection results in solid, long-lasting immunity. Because outbreaks tend to involve a high proportion of animals in a herd, repeat clinical episodes usually involve young animals born since previous outbreaks. Prevention by vector control is impractical in the areas of the world where this disease is prevalent. Vaccination has been used in endemic countries, including Australia, Bahrain, China, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Namibia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Turkey. Both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines are used, although repeated immunization is often required. Problems with conventional vaccines stem from their lack of potency -- inactivated vaccines require more antigenic mass than it has been possible to achieve economically, and live-attenuated vaccines suffer from a loss in immunogenicity linked to the attenuation process (see Chapter 4: Antiviral Immunity and Virus Vaccines). Immunization with the bovine ephemeral fever virus G protein alone can confer protective immunity in cattle, as can recombinant vectors that express this protein." - Mod.TG
