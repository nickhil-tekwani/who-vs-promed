2 dead, over 100 infected with viral encephalitis [Japanese encephalitis]
in China's Gansu, Guangxi
-------------------------------------------------
2 outbreaks of viral encephalitis have been reported in Gansu and Guangxi,
with more than 100 children infected and 2 deaths recorded. While the
figures are not cause for nationwide alarm, the outbreaks have health
authorities on alert, as they come at the start of the mainland's peak
season for the disease. A Hong Kong Department of Health spokesman said it
wrote to the Ministry of Health yesterday [22 Jun 2005] to inquire about
the outbreaks.

In Gansu's Tianshui city, where 100 cases of viral encephalitis [Japanese
encephalitis] were found between 25 Apr and 10 Jun 2005, blood samples of
infected children were still being examined, the Lanzhou Morning Post
reported yesterday [22 Jun 2005]. An official from the city's Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control [CDC], who declined to be named, said it was
likely to have results from the provincial CDC in 2 days. He stressed that
the cases were "sporadic" and the infections were not concentrated in a
village or local community.

The Post said some of the infected children were given encephalitis B
[Japanese encephalitis] vaccines before they fell sick, but the official
said there was no evidence the vaccine and the disease were linked. He
could not confirm how many children had fallen ill, but the paper said the
city's No 2 People's Hospital had treated 26 children and its No 4 People's
Hospital had treated 74. 44 children remain in the hospital.

In Guangxi's Beihai city, 2 children died after contracting encephalitis B
[Japanese encephalitis], a kind of viral encephalitis, and 6 were still in
2 hospitals, a city official told the South China Morning Post yesterday
[22 Jun 2005]. He said the infected children were aged from 2 to 6 and
those in hospital were in stable condition.

On Monday [20 Jun 2005], the Modern Express reported that the People's
Hospital in Hepu county had received a suspected encephalitis B [Japanese
encephalitis] patient on 8 Jun 2005 and had reported the case to the
county's CDC, which sent samples to its provincial counterpart where the
disease was identified. More cases were found in the area later, and one
child died last Thursday [16 Jun 2005], according to the paper. It is not
known when the other child died. The city official said some of the
children were from Gongguan township.

The Hong Kong Department of Health spokesman said the Ministry of Health
provided regular figures on infectious diseases, including encephalitis B
[Japanese encephalitis], on the mainland and notified it if there were
serious outbreaks. Statistics on the Ministry of Health's website show
there were 25 reported cases of encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] last
month [May 2005], compared with 10 cases in April 2005. Last year [2004],
the country had 5422 encephalitis B cases and 200 deaths.
