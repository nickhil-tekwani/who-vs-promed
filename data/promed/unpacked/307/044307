BSE - Switzerland 981008155837

In June Swiss scientists using immunological and immuno-histochemical tests
for the BSE prion found 8 cases of BSE infection among 1761 apparently
healthy herd mates of Swiss cattle which had developed BSE (a prevalence of
4.5/1000). It was then decided to test for the prion in 3000 healthy cattle
over the age of 30 months being slaughtered at abattoirs for human
consumption. In late September one infected cow was found, a four-year-old
sent for slaughter because her milk output had fallen due apparently to
mastitis. This is the first time BSE infection has been detected in a cow
that would otherwise have been eaten, in time to take it out of the food
chain.
All 3,000 have now been tested with the fast Western blot developed by the
Zurich-based firm Prionics. Of those 2,200 have also been tested using
slower immuno-histochemical methods. All the results so far agree,
including the one positive result. One possible reason for the good
agreement between tests (in the previous study different tests agreed on
only 4 of the 8 positives) is that this time, brains were divided into
hemispheres and each was sent for one test or the other. Prion distribution
seems to be laterally symmetric, so this reduced sampling error.
The apparent prevalence of 1/3,000 is less than the 1/1,000 infected cattle
in apparently healthy herds in Switzerland calculated by Doherr and
colleagues, based on observed clinical incidence and estimated incubation
time of the disease. The discovery of only one case does not allow the
empirical calculation of a clinically significant rate. But if the
prevalence is 1/3,000, some 50 infected cattle over the age of 30 months
are being eaten per year in Switzerland.
The results of the Prionics test were available within 24 hours, which
allowed the infected carcass to be destroyed before it was sold for meat.
Swiss authorities are now considering whether to mandate testing of all
cattle at slaughter. There are fears that too many false positives would
make this prohibitively expensive, as for each case detected the entire
herd would have to be destroyed. Prionics points out that of the 3000 tests
in the current series, 2999 were negative, indicating that while there
might be false negatives, the rate of false positives is not substantial.
Professor Picoux pointed out [ProMed 6 October that the cow found in the
current series may not have been strictly subclinical, as she had displayed
behavioural changes which were put down, possibly erroneously, to pain from
mastitis. The early symptoms of BSE are notoriously difficult to
distinguish from other syndromes with neural involvement. This cow possibly
exemplifies the reason for much under-reporting of BSE on the Continent:
older cattle with falling milk output or odd symptoms are simply sent for
slaughter. Some of those could have been developing BSE, but are killed
before they get a chance to develop clear symptoms.
The European Commission wants all EU countries to test cattle in abattoirs
for such hidden infection. It is to be remembered that the levels of BSE
infection expected on the Continent simply on the basis of British cattle
exports, to say nothing of the continued feeding of meat and bone meal of
questionable hygiene to livestock, are well in excess of what has been
reported. That, incidents such as the recent surge of cases in Portugal,
and the continuing, and to many people implausible, apparent absence of BSE
in Germany, suggest substantial under-reporting.
The implications of the Swiss result for Britain, which has had the most
BSE, are complex. Only cattle aged 30 months or younger are eaten in
Britain, on the assumption, based on feeding trials, that cattle of that
age, even if they were infected as calves, have not yet accumulated enough
prions to be infectious. But the youngest cow to develop BSE on record in
Britain was 20 months old, showing some are fast incubators. Models predict
that 200-300 cattle under 30 months per year are infected with BSE and
enter the food chain currently in Britain. Of these 3-5 could be fast
incubators and carrying detectable quantities of prion.
If one were to test cattle routinely at abattoirs in Britain, it is
possible that only those 3-5 would be detectable, and thus could be kept
out of the food chain. So routine testing may not be cost-effective. On the
other hand, these predictions are based entirely on modelling. Some think
that at least a study similar to the Swiss one should be carried out in
Britain to actually measure the extent of infection, especially if there is
a subclinical strain that is not reflected in models based on clinical
incidence.
The Swiss data do not shed light on infection before 30 months. They did
not test younger cattle as relatively few of them would be expected to have
accumulated enough prion to be detectable, so a much larger sample size
than the government was prepared to pay for initially would have been
required to detect at least one case. The 30-month cut-off was also
practical (perhaps one reason it was chosen as the limiting age in Britain)
as because of dental development, the head of a cow 30 months or older can
be readily distinguished from a younger one at the abattoir.
Whether or not screening cattle in abattoirs can make meat safe is debated.
It is claimed by some, disputed by others, that infected cattle which have
not yet accumulated detectable quantities of prion are not infectious. So
animals that test negative are safe to eat whether infected or not. The few
private Swiss butchers now using the Prionics test to screen beef before it
is marketed advertise their wares as BSE tested, not BSE free. The efficacy
of screening at preventing the transmission of infection to people also
ultimately depends on whether detectable levels of prion in brain occur at
the same time as potentially infectious levels in muscle. That is not known.
