Outbreak of Anthrax Reported in Kerala's Athirappilly Forest Region
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Several wild boars have died in Kerala's Athirappilly forest region in the last few days due to an anthrax outbreak, the state government said on Wednesday [29 Jun 2022].

Health Minister Veena George said the presence of anthrax has been confirmed in wild boars in the Athirappilly forest area. "Wild boars have died en masse in the Athirappilly forest area. Subsequently, the Health Department, the Animal Husbandry Department and the Forest Department conducted an investigation. Samples of these were tested to confirm the case of anthrax infection," George said in a statement.

She said the health department is taking immediate steps to prevent the spread of anthrax, a bacteria naturally found in soil and commonly affecting domestic and wild animals when they contact it.

The health department said the people who went to remove and bury the carcasses of the wild boars are being monitored. They are also being given the necessary preventive treatment, it added.

If animals, including wild boars, are found to be dying en masse, special care should be taken, the health authorities said and asked people not to go to such places.

They also requested people to report to the authorities if any such cases are noticed.

Alert in Thrissur as Anthrax confirmed at Athirappilly
-------------------------------------------------------
Surveillance and preventive measures intensified in Thrissur's Athirappilly as anthrax has been confirmed in wild boars, which were found dead in the area.

Farmers were in a panic as several wild boars were found dead in the last few days in areas near Vettilappara forests and in the palm estates in Athirappilly, where their cattle too graze. The Health Department, the Animal Husbandry Department, and the Forest Department have conducted investigations and samples were tested to confirm the anthrax infection. Confirming the anthrax outbreak in Athirappilly, Health Minister Veena Gorge said the department is taking immediate steps to prevent the spread of anthrax.

According to the health department sources, as many as 13 people, who went to remove and bury the carcasses of the wild boars, have been added to the primary contact list and have been placed under medical surveillance. They have been given preventive treatment. The health department is trying to trace the source.

Meanwhile, Thrissur Collector [Indian Administrative Service officer] Haritha V. Kumar said that there was no need for the people to panic about the situation. "Preventive measures have been intensified. There is less chance to spread the disease from animals to human beings. So far cases of infection have not been reported in domestic animals or cattle," she said.

A control room has been opened. A high-level meeting of all departments concerned was conducted to discuss the emergency measures to be taken. Anthrax was reported in wild boars in the Athirappilly area in 2020 too. There were not many complications at that time, according to health department officials.

Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_, which is found in soil naturally. It commonly affects domestic and wild animals when they contact it. People can get sick if they come in close contact with the infected animals or contaminated animal products.

A vaccination drive has been started for all domestic animals in Athirappilly Panchayat. People have been asked to report the authorities if they notice animals die en masse. They were alerted to avoid going near dead animals and to not use meat or milk of the anthrax-infected animals.

[Anthrax is sporadic in Kerala, and most reports are from wildlife outbreaks (refer to list in the see also section below). But when they occur it is necessary to make sure that local domestic livestock are vaccinated for their protection. Unfortunately local livestock are grazed in national parks, in spite of any regulations to the contrary. And this will put the local human population at risk when they butcher any animals dying from the disease.
