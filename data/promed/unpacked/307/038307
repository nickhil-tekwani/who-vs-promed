Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says chickens infected with a
highly pathogenic H7N3 strain of avian influenza on a farm in
Saskatchewan have all been destroyed. The strain is the same one that
triggered an outbreak in 2004 in British Columbia that resulted in 17
million chickens being destroyed, but it is not considered a danger
to humans.

As many as 50 000 chickens were culled on the farm, which is 40 km
north of Regina, using carbon dioxide gas; their carcasses have been
buried in a remote area of the farm where normal decomposition of the
bird carcass apparently effectively deactivates the avian influenza
virus, which is an accepted disease control and biocontainment
measure.

The CFIA says after the cleaning and disinfection of all barns,
vehicles, equipment and tools on the property, and if no new cases of
infection are found in the area, new birds will be allowed to be
introduced onto the farm.

The CFIA will, however, continue to monitor any new flock to make
sure they are virus-free along with another farm in the same area as
a precautionary measure for a period of 21 days.

The farmer will be compensated for the market value of all the birds
destroyed as well as any costs incurred in their destruction.

The CFIA says that although none of the chickens from the farm
reached the food chain, the disease would not make the meat unsafe
for human consumption.

After the virus was discovered, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
quickly banned all imports of live birds, including chickens and
turkeys, from Saskatchewan along with all unprocessed bird products,
a move which was shortly followed by Japan.

The bans are, however, unlikely to have much of an effect, because
the poultry industry in Saskatchewan is fairly small, and the United
States has not imported any poultry products from the province since
2007.

Avian influenza is a contagious disease in birds, and the movement of
live birds, bird products, or things that may have come in contact
with birds may cause the spread of the disease.

General restrictions for the entire province of Saskatchewan and
additional restrictions for the 3-km and 10-km regions around the
infected farm apply, and CFIA permits are required to move certain
products; no restrictions apply to the movement of poultry meat and
eggs purchased from grocery stores.

The CFIA's actions are in line with international scientific
recommendations and guidelines.

[This appears to be an update of ProMED-mail post 20071001.3249. It
was determined that it was highly pathogenic H7N3. This was the same
strain that occurred in 2004.

Yet this particular premises sounds like it is fairly isolated.
Neither this article nor the CFIA website identify how this virus
came to be at the poultry production site. - Mod.TG]
