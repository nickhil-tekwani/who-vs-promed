Probable cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Bulgaria: a
preliminary report
-------------------------------------------------------------
Between 20 Mar and 10 Apr 2008, 6 probable Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) cases were reported in the municipality of Gotse
Delchev, in Blagoevgrad district, Bulgaria, an area bordering Greece
and Macedonia. CCHF is an endemic infection in Bulgaria, and
particularly in this area. In recent years, several cases of CCHF
have been reported (between 2 and 20 cases annually), with a
mortality rate varying between 10 and 50 percent (1).

Description of the cases
------------------------
The cases presented with different clinical manifestations. The 1st
case was a man in his 40s who became ill on 20 Jan [2008] with fever,
myalgia and joint pain, one-day diarrhea, and weakness. He was treated
at home with aspirin, paracetamol, augmentin, and diclac. On 25 Mar
[2008], epistaxis [nosebleed] with heavy bleeding developed. A
tamponade was applied at the otorhinolaryngology department of the
local hospital. He was admitted in the infectious disease ward with a
suspicion of haemorrhagic fever. His condition rapidly deteriorated
(strongly expressed leuco- and thrombocytopenia) and he died on 26 Mar
[2008].

The 2nd case was a man in his 30s from the same town. The illness
began on 22 Jan [2008] with fever and weakness. On 26 Mar [2008], he
[coughed up] bloody sputa and was taken into the infectious disease
ward. On 27 Mar [2008] he was transferred to the infectious disease
hospital in Sofia. He was discharged soon afterwards in good condition.

These 2 patients had, on 17 and 18 Mar [2008], each removed ticks from
cows in the neighboring village with unprotected hands, and had taken
part in the slaughter of a sick calf. The veterinary authorities
reported the calf to have been sick from tannin poisoning.

The 3rd case was a healthcare worker in her 50s who had taken care of
the 1st patient when he was bleeding. Although she reported having
used gloves, she was abundantly stained by blood and vomit from the
patient. She received immunoprophylaxis by specific hyperimmune gamma
globulin against CCHF. She was hospitalised on 2 Apr [2008] and
discharged in good condition a week later.

The 4th case was a woman in her 40s from the same town, a close
family contact of the 1st patient. On 10 Apr [2008], she was
hospitalised with fever, weakness, stomach pain, nausea, and
vomiting. She had contact with the 1st case's blood when he had a
nosebleed before being taken to the hospital. As a result, she
received immunoprophylaxis by specific hyperimmune gamma globulin
against CCHF. The symptoms of this patient were considerably less
severe than in the other cases, and she was discharged from hospital
in good condition on 18 Apr [2008].

2 further cases were from other villages in the municipality and
did not have any relationship to the cases described above. A man in
his 40s became ill on 31 Mar [2008] and a man in his 60s became ill
on 9 Apr [2008]. They both had similar clinical pictures: fever,
muscle and joint pain, weakness, and bleeding from the nose. It was
ascertained that they had both removed ticks from cattle by hand.
Following medical treatment, both are in good condition.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
A team of experts from the Ministry of Health, the National Centre
for Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, and the Hospital for
Infectious Diseases in Sofia, which included epidemiologists,
virologists, and infectious disease clinicians, have visited Gotse
Delchev to perform an epidemiological investigation and
consultations. The investigative team also included local specialists
from the hospital, the Regional Inspectorates for Public Health
Protection and Control and the Veterinary Service. The cases have
been discussed by a wide circle of specialists in the Ministry of
Health and the conclusion has been drawn that the cases are probably
CCHF cases, 4 of them having been in contact with each other.

In order to discard possible cases of anthrax, tularemia, ornithosis,
influenza (including avian influenza), and babesiosis, serological
and virological tests have been carried out on the patients, as well
as 19 people in close contact with them. All test results were
negative. Additional virological investigations are currently being
carried out at the National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic
Diseases in Bulgaria. Samples from the patients have been sent to the
Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rome, Italy for confirmation of
the diagnosis. The results will be delivered by the end of this week.

Conclusions
-----------
The outbreak generated intense media and public interest in Bulgaria.
A round of consultation meetings with the local population concerned
has begun. This allows people working with animals to have some
guidance on how to minimise the likelihood of injury or diseases and
to protect themselves from tick bites. At the same time, numerous
meetings have been held with general practitioners in the
municipality concerned. The respective veterinary authorities also
organised massive tick control measures, aiming to protect domestic
animals from ticks and tick-borne disease. All the reported cases in
this cluster occurred in areas with climatic conditions favourable to
intensive growth of the tick population: 4 patients had
been exposed to ticks, and 2 were exposed through blood from a
patient.

The team of experts from the Ministry of Health that carried out the
investigation also considered the cases from the point of view of the
new International Health Regulations. The team were of the view that
the cases are neither unusual nor unexpected and there is no risk of
international spread. They therefore decided that these cases are not
subject to
a notification of events that are a public health
emergency of international concern. Nevertheless, because of the
great media attention and the close proximity to the border with
Greece, the Ministry of Health informed the European Region of the
World Health Organisation (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control about the situation and the measures taken, as
well as publishing this article in Eurosurveillance.

The descriptions of these cases are consistent with the diagnosis of
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. In view of the seriousness of the
disease and its presumed endemicity in Bulgaria it would be
appropriate for the Bulgarian authorities to provide a diagnostic
facility for identification of the causative virus as part of their
health-care system, particularly as tick-infested farm livestock do
not generally exhibit signs of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus
infection.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by infection with a
tick-borne virus (belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. The disease was first characterized in the Crimea in
1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later
recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus
resulting in the current name of the disease. Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in the
south of the former Soviet Union. It is also distributed throughout
the Mediterranean, in northwestern China, central Asia, southern
Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. -
