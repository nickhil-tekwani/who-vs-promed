CJD, RISK ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN PITUITARY EXTRACTS
**************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
[Ms. Oney had contacted both ProMED-mail and BSE-L for advice. Knowing that
BSE-L had more expertise in this area I awaited their informed response,
which I have attached to Ms Oney's (second) message; along with a reply from
Gil Katzenstein. The true core of her concern is included in her first
paragraph so her first communication has been deleted. - Mod.MHJ]

In a previous e-mail I indicated my concern that some fertility treatments
used today could possibly be putting women at risk for contracting
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), , because women who had taken
gonadotropin shots in the 1980s and before for fertility problems are at
high risk of getting CJD and that some (I think 6) have died of it in
Australia. That gonadotropin came directly from the pituitary glands of
human cadavers. The web address for the article is
http://www.airtime.co.uk/bse/lynete.htm
[From its title this article was not written to calm the reader. - MHJ]
By mistake I stated Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (HCG) is secreted from the
pituitary gland. It is from the placenta. However, other gonadotrophins used
in infertility treatment, FSH and LH, are secreted by the pituitary gland
and extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women. They are sold under
various brand names. They are mainly taken by infertile women. However, men
sometimes take FSH to stimulate the testicles to help mature sperm [sic].
I'm concerned that these hormones could put people who have taken them at
high risk for CJD because of their connection with the pituitary gland. And,
the fact that the women whose urine they are extracted from are
postmenopausal worries me even more because the older a person is the more
likely they are to be incubating CJD.
Does anyone know if this worry is founded? Are these people at high risk for
CJD? Are their resultant children? Why aren't synthetics being used? Is
there any research on this? How many other hormones are derived from glands
such as the pituitary gland and used to treat humans?

In the hypophysis we have follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, follitropin),
luteinizing hormone (LH), thyrotropic hormone (THH), adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH), somatotropic hormone (HGH), prolactin, oxytocin and
vasopressin.
Today peptide hormones can be synthesized chemically or by genetically
manipulated bacteria. It is also possible to reduce the CJD-infectivity of
human derived hypophyseal hormones by several orders of magnitude
(Pocchiari,M.; Peano,S.; Conz,A.; Eshkol,A.; Maillard,F.; Brown,P.;
Gibbs,C.J.Jr.; Xi,Y.G.; Tenham-Fisher,E.; Macchi,G. - Combination
ultrafiltration and 6 M urea treatment of human growth hormone effectively
minimizes risk from potential Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease virus contamination
- Hormone Research 1991; 35(3-4): 161-6). But of course especially in the
past therapies with this hormones increased the risk to get CJD. Until now
from thousands of growth hormone recipients less than hundred developed CJD
with incubation times around 15 years.

All cases I have seen in the literature about iatrogenic CJD and human
derived hormones indicate that the hormone(s) was PITUITARY-derived (no
living donors, only cadavers). My understanding is that hCG is of placental
origin, therefore, the only potential risk would be associated with
placentally purified hCG.
Both experimentally and epidemiologically, some tissue is considered to be
non-infectious (incapable of causing disease, neuropathology changes in the
recipient +/or generation of PrPres, the abnormal, disease-associated
isoform). Urine, I suspect, is in this category.
