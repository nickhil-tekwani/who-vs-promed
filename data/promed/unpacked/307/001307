The Pennsylvania Department of Health and Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Rhode Island Department of Health announced Friday that Trader Joe's Valencia Creamy Salted Peanut Butter made with sea salt may be linked to 29 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Bredeney across multiple states.

Trader Joe's has voluntarily recalled the peanut butter in question -- Trader Joe's brand Valencia Creamy Salted Peanut Butter made with sea salt, with use by dates of 5/23/2013 and 6/28/2013 -- and advises consumers who may have the product in their homes to discard it. The product is also available through online retailers.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health said it is working with the CDC and public health officials in several states to investigate the outbreak and advises consumers who have recently eaten the product and become ill with diarrhea or vomiting to consult with their health care provider. No samples have yet tested positive for _S._ Bredeney.

Foodborne illness prevention
----------------------------
The United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) provides these recommendations for preventing salmonellosis:
- Wash hands with warm soapy water for 20 seconds before and after handling food and after using the bathroom, changing diapers and handling pets.
- Wash utensils, cutting boards, dishes, and countertops with hot soapy water after preparing each food item and before you go on to the next item.
- Consider using paper towels to clean kitchen surfaces. If you use cloth towels, wash them often in the hot cycle of your washing machine.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding this outbreak. In 2007, 628 cases of _S._ Tennessee were linked to peanut butter and 2 years later, 600 cases of _S. Typhimurium were also linked to commercial peanut butter.

As of yet, there are no "smoking peanut butters" found; that is, the same organism has not yet been isolated from the implicated food. In addition to these USA outbreaks, an outbreak of salmonellosis (serotype Mbandaka) was reported from Australia in 1996, that was related to peanut butter with the organism isolated from both peanut butter and patients (1, 2). Burnett and colleagues (3) studied peanut butters that had been experimentally inoculated with salmonella, and had viable organisms at 5 deg. C for 24 weeks. There was less retention at 21 deg. C. More importantly, Shachar and Yaron (4) demonstrated that thermal treatments are inadequate to consistently destroy _Salmonella_ in highly contaminated peanut butter and that the pasteurization process cannot be improved significantly by longer treatment or higher temperatures.
