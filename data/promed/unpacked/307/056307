[The following gives the gist of the report.  Mod.JW]
In South America, monkey deaths, particularly of howler monkeys (_Alouatta_
spp.) signal the probable arrival of YF in an area. As reported in the 1st
ref. below, on 13 Sep 2004 the 1st monkey deaths of 2004 were reported in
Tocantins state; the deaths had occurred around 2 Sep 2004. On 16 Sep 2004,
2 more dead monkeys were reported, and there were more notifications on 21
Sep & 28 Sep (the latter probably occurred around 18 Sep), all in different
townships, these last close to the border with Goias state. A state of alert
was declared for Tocantins & Goias.
New information: On 1 Oct 2004 a _Cebus apella_ monkey was found dead close
to the border with Mato Grosso state, and was reported on 13 Oct. About 300
families live in the area. YF vaccination was intensified in that area, and
the population of the region was alerted to the importance of getting
vaccinated.
On receipt of thisreport, the states of Bahia & Piaui, declared official YF
alerts. These 2 states lie in the transition zone for YF, into which YF
periodically breaks out from its endemic focus further West.
