The Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) on Fri 5 Jul 2019 evening confirmed a 2nd outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] in domestic pigs in 3 days, and the 3rd since 2018.

The disease was located in a backyard pig farm in the village of Novachene near Danube River, only 16 km southeast of the village of Zhernov, where the previous case was confirmed on Wed 3 Jul 2019 [see 20190704.6552546], the agency said in a statement.

The BFSA took the necessary measures for the control and eradication of the disease according to the European and national legislation, the statement said.

Earlier on Friday [5 Jul 2019], at a meeting of the Management Board of the State Fund Agriculture, the country's Minister of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Desislava Taneva, called for rigorous implementation of prevention and control measures.

According to Taneva, this is a very dangerous disease that spreads quickly and easily; "there is no cure and vaccine for it, and the economic losses are enormous.''

The 1st outbreak of African swine fever in domestic pigs in Bulgaria was confirmed last August [2018] in the village of Tutrakantsi, some 250 km southeast of Novachene.

[The location of the recent outbreak in Bulgaria, adjacent to the ASF-affected Romanian territory, can be viewed in OIE's ASF map (for the period starting 1 Jan 2019) at https://tinyurl.com/y66z3hs3 (click on the Romanian cluster, zoom in centering on Bulgaria's Pleven province).

The disease has been extensively spreading in Romania's wild boar population as well as in backyard holdings, including territories bordering Pleven province in Bulgaria. Surveillance in Bulgaria's wild boar population is warranted. - Mod.AS
