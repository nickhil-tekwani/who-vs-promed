[The presence of West Nile virus (WNV) in Europe was 1st recorded in 1958. Since then, the virus has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease, predominantly in Southern countries.

In Europe, WNV circulates in resident and migratory birds, presumably reflecting co-evolution of virus and host over a long period (Gould et al. 2006 EID 12: 549-555). - Mod.PMB
