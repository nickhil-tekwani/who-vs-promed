Ticks have become such a menace across Switzerland that the government is urging everyone to get vaccinated against one of the diseases they cause, early summer meningo-encephalitis (ESME) [tick-borne encephalitis, TBE]. Health insurers will reimburse vaccination costs.

Previously only recommended in specific regions, the net for vaccinations has now been cast wider. That's because of an increase in cases of ESME [TBE], a disease which attacks the central nervous system: 380 cases were reported in 2018, compared to 100 per year in previous years.

According to the government information platform ch.chexternal link, the most widespread tick species in Switzerland is the wood tick [_Ixodes ricinus_ commonly known as the castor bean tick or sheep tick]. It prefers deciduous woods with abundant undergrowth, the edge of the forest and forest paths, and waits on low growing plants until a warm-blooded host (a person or animal) brushes against the plant. Ticks do not fall from trees.

Ticks have to be properly removed with tweezers. If part of the tick remains under the skin for longer than around 36-48 hours, there is a risk of becoming ill.

The Swiss league for patients with tick-borne diseases external link recommends that people prevent bites by avoiding bushes and tall grass, by wearing clothing that covers the arms, legs and feet, and by checking the body carefully for ticks and their larvae.

[With the steady increase in TBE cases over recent years, advice for those individuals who frequent wooded areas in Switzerland to be vaccinated is prudent.

In a previous comment in 2017 concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr Ivo M Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased markedly since 2000, roughly about 50 percent. The reason for the increase of TBE incidence in Central/Western/Northern Europe is unknown.

TBE is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ixodes ticks. - Mod.TY
