Dengue kills 4 persons in India's Kolkata (Calcutta) city
-----------------------------------------------
Dengue has claimed 4 lives in one week in the Eastern Indian city of
Kolkata, not even sparing the city's upscale neighborhoods, local news
agency Indo-Asian News Agency (IANS) reported on Tuesday [23 Aug 2005].
Kolkata, one of the 4 major Indian metropolitan cities, is also the capital
of the eastern Indian state of West Bengal.
According to IANS reports, West Bengal Health Chief Prabhakar Chatterjee
has admitted that the fever that swept through some areas of south Kolkata
is dengue or brain fever.
"We have got reports of 4 deaths so far, 2 each in 2 private hospitals of
Kolkata. Blood tests have revealed the presence of dengue in 8 other
people," Chatterjee told IANS Tuesday [23 Aug 2005]. The unofficial death
toll is said to be 7.
"We have instructed all medical colleges and hospitals to contact the
School of Tropical Medicine and National Institute of Cholera and Enteric
Diseases (NICED) whenever they find a patient with dengue symptoms,"
Chatterjee said.
Health officials said about 100 people suffering from fever were showing
symptoms of dengue, which often causes death when the fever reaches the
brain. The disease spreads through the bite of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
Reservoirs constructed for scores of big and small housing projects, water
collected in road excavation sites, accumulated garbage and rooftop water
accumulation are the breeding ground of the _Aedes_ mosquito.
An emergency meeting was held Monday [22 Aug 2005] between the Kolkata
Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the state health department to combat
dengue, the reports said.

Dengue alert after child deaths, 6 dead and a hundred hit
-----------------------------------------------
With dengue striking terror across the city -- 4 of its 6 victims in the
last 48 hours are children -- the health department has launched a drive to
identify the areas that have been hit the hardest and draw up a plan for
its cure.
"2 separate teams under senior officers along with virologists from the
School of Tropical Medicine are on the city streets and will submit a
report to us. They will focus on the areas where dengue has struck and the
breeding ground of the _Aedes_ mosquitoes (which cause the fever) and
destroy them, "said Prabakar Chatterjee, the director of health services.
The _Aedes_ mosquitoes are larger and darker than the usual ones, and the
fever is accompanied by acute pain in the joints and muscles, nausea and
bleeding from gums, nose and other parts of the body.
"The unexplained part is that these mosquitoes attack only in the mornings
or early hours when a person is sleeping. The bleeding is unstoppable, and
the damage to the body is at times life-threatening," said Jayati Sengupta,
pediatrician and coordinator at AMRI Hospitals.
Last evening [19 Aug 2005], a 9-year-old girl from Lake Gardens succumbed
to Dengue Shock Syndrome after a 2-day battle for life. "When she came to
us, she was bleeding all over the body and was in great discomfort. We
tried to save her, but could not," said Sengupta.
"2 other girls, [an 11-year-old, and a 10-year-old], are also suffering
from dengue symptoms. [The former] is in a state of shock. We are asking
parents to be extremely careful about any fever which is alarmingly high.
The best thing to do is rush to hospitals without delay," said Sengupta.
Apart from Lake Gardens, dengue has been reported from several areas,
including Dhakuria, where an 8-year-old child and a 25-year-old person died
yesterday [19 Aug 2005] morning. Residents around Prince Anwar Shah Road
and Deshapran Sashmal Road have also been alerted following the deaths of 2
children in the last 30 hours.
"A large number of people are suffering from the fever. We are trying to
take all precautions," said Ratan Dey, the local Trinamul councilor.
Health department officials said the teams doing the rounds of the city
have been asked to remove stagnant water in the areas where dengue has
struck this year [2005].
"On reaching the focal point (the most affected area), they will spray
insecticides and take every possible precaution," Jayshree Mitra, the
director of medical education, said. "We are taking all-out efforts to stop
this viral hemorrhagic fever from spreading in the city," she added.

KMC confirms city's 1st dengue death
-------------------------------------------
2 other persons have reportedly died after suffering from the viral fever
that has hit wards 92, 94, and 97, Express News Service reported.
The city's 1st case of dengue fever has been "officially" confirmed by the
health department of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation [KMC].
Several cases of people falling sick with viral fever have also been
reported from various wards in southern parts of the city.
Dr. Dipankar Das, deputy chief municipal health officer, told Newsline that
a resident from ward 40 under KMC has been found to be suffering from
dengue. "The patient is under treatment at a private city hospital. This is
the 1st and only case of dengue that has come to our notice under the KMC
area," said Das.
In another incident, 2 other persons have reportedly died after suffering
from the viral fever that is on the rise and has affected people living in
wards 92, 94, 97 and the adjoining localities of other wards.
Ratan Dey, councilor of ward 93, told Newsline that 2 residents of
Masjidpara, in ward 93, have died due to viral fever.
"3 deaths have also taken place in ward 94. Over a 100 people are suffering
from viral fever in my ward alone. This figure is on basis of people's
complaints. To provide some immediate relief, the KMC has put up a health
camp at Masjidpara. Since morning today [20 Aug 2005], 86 people have
visited the camp for a check up," said Dey.
2 KMC doctors are on duty at the said health camp for the 1st half of the
day. Dey, however, said that the incidence of fever is high, and the
available aid is inadequate. "The problem is much bigger for the KMC to
tackle. On behalf of the local councilors, I request the state to provide
help at a larger scale," said Dey.
Member of the mayor-in-council (health) Dr. Subhod Kumar Dey said that the
reported deaths under the KMC are probably due to viral fever.
"We are probing into the cause. It is difficult to say whether the deaths
in Masjidpara and the adjoining locality, as reported by the local
councilor, are due to dengue," said Dey.
"Information available with me suggests that, under the KMC, only one
person has been found to be suffering from dengue. One case has been
reported in Salt Lake and 2 in Dum Dum. On our part, we are taking the
necessary steps," Dey added.

Cambodia has fewer dengue cases in children this year [2005], thanks to the
ongoing dengue prevention efforts by the government, local media reported
on Tuesday [23 Aug 2005].
Statistics from the Ministry of Health show that, so far this year [2005],
an estimated 4300 children across the country have contracted dengue fever,
and 68 of them have died of dengue hemorrhagic fever, the lethal form of
this mosquito-borne disease.
The death rate among children sickened by dengue is roughly half of the
fatality rate during the same period last year [2004], according to health
officials.
"If we compare the situation with last year [2004], we are doing better
this year," The Cambodia Daily quoted Mam Bunheng, secretary of state for
the Health Ministry, as saying. "The management of the program is going well."
In Siem Reap province, where a significant outbreak of dengue fever
occurred 2 years ago, this year [2005] only 5 or 6 dengue cases a month
were treated in Angkor Hospital for Children, where a good portion of
patients from surrounding provinces come for treatment.
"We have not seen an increase in the past couple of years like we did in
2003," Ngoun Chan Theaktra, medical director of the hospital, said.
Mam Bunheng said that the lower figures are a testament to ongoing dengue
prevention campaigns, including using insecticides to kill mosquitoes and
larvae, and educating parents to protect their youngsters from the
disease-carrying insects.
But health officials say the disease remains a significant concern. They
hope that, by the end of the year [2005], the number of dengue cases will
continue to drop.

Almost a month after the start of the dengue epidemic in the capital,
hospitals are still seeing more patients coming in with the disease.
At least 31 new patients were admitted into 3 city hospitals on Monday [22
Aug 2005], with the Budi Asih hospital in East Jakarta recording the
largest number of 20 patients.
Meanwhile, the Tarakan hospital in Central Jakarta and Fatmawati hospital
in South Jakarta received only 2 and 5 new patients, respectively.
There have been no new reports of fatalities. Jakarta health agency
spokeswoman Zelfino said that, from 1 Jan 2005 to Thursday [18 Aug 2005]
last week, there had been a total of 12 036 dengue patients in Jakarta,
with 60 deaths.

Dengue deaths reach 605 in Indonesia this year [2005]
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia has recorded 605 dengue fever deaths this year [2005] but has
avoided any "extraordinary outbreak," a health official told AFP.
The health ministry's Rita Kusriastuti said that 43 509 infections had been
reported, boosting the incidence rate to 19.6 per 100 000 residents from
18.8 for the same period last year [2004]. But she said no "extraordinary"
outbreaks had occurred, as officials stepped up public information
campaigns to combat the mosquito-borne disease.
"It is true that the figure is high, but there are yet no areas where the
spread of the dengue can be declared as having reached an extraordinary
stage," Kusriastuti told AFP. Extraordinary outbreaks, defined as when the
death rate exceeds 2 percent of those infected, were declared in 12 of
Indonesia's 32 provinces last year [2004].
The official said health authorities were still paying particular attention
to outbreaks in North Sumatra, West Sumatra and Jakarta.
Dengue is an annual hazard for Indonesians. Last year [2004] it killed 800
people and infected 79 480 others.

Health officer reiterates campaign against dengue
-----------------------------------------------
Dengue cases continue to rise, with 78 cases reported since January of this
year [2005].
Dr. Nelly Abiera, Provincial Health Officer, said death cases had been
reported from the towns of San Remigio, Tobias Fornier and Culasi, each
town having had one death each.
"In the current situation, people should continue to intensify the
cleanliness campaign and the preventive measures undertaken to ensure that
the breeding places of _Aedes aegypti_, the dengue carrier mosquito, are
eliminated.
Flower vases, flower petals, bromeliads and old tires should be removed and
cleaned, as this type of mosquito thrives in clean standing water."
Abiera campaigned for "tepok kiti-kiti" ("goodbye dengue").
Dr. Abiera also stressed that the utmost care and close observation must be
taken, especially when symptoms of dengue, like fever, rashes and bleeding
or hemorrhage, appear. Medical help should be sought right away. She also
forewarned about the use of "aspirin or aspilet," which must never be
administered to children sick of dengue, for they will only aggravate the
situation.
"The massive information campaign must be coupled with the distribution of
the brochure 'How to Manage Dengue,'" Dr. Abiera concluded.
