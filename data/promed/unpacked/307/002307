METHANOL CONTAMINATION, VODKA - UK: ALERT (03)

There's a newer, safer, more selective -- but much less memorable --
antidote for methanol toxicity.
The moderator's instructive comment about methanol is correct but neglects
2 points commonly taught in this toxic topic.
Better than ethanol, Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole, Antizol) inhibits
alcohol dehydrogenase and does not trigger delirium, fetal risks, liver
injury, gastropathy, or frequent vomiting.

Also, Folinic acid (leucovorin) is recommended for restoration of 1-carbon
metabolism, especially for methanol exposure.

[Dr. Greenberg is quite right. This moderator apologizes for the oversight,
as Dr.Greenberg pointed this out in July of 2003. - Mod.TG]
