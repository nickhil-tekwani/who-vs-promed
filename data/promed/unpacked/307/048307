As of 11 Sep 2012, a total of 14 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 11 states and the District of Columbia.

The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (1), Colorado (1), District of Columbia (1), Maryland (3), Minnesota (1), Nebraska (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (1), New York (1), Ohio (1), Pennsylvania (1), and Virginia (1). All 14 ill persons have been hospitalized; 3 deaths have been reported.

Collaborative investigation efforts of local, state, and federal public health and regulatory agencies indicate that imported ricotta salata cheese is the likely source of this outbreak. On 10 Sep 2012, Forever Cheese, Inc. recalled one lot of Frescolina brand ricotta salata cheese due to _L. monocytogenes_ contamination.

The cheese was sold to distributors for retailers and restaurants in California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington between 20 Jun and 9 Aug 2012.

An outbreak of illness linked to consumption of tainted ricotta salata cheese has been linked to 3 deaths and 14 hospitalizations in 11 states, according to a release on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website.

The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria _Listeria monocytogenes_ -- is possibly linked to consumption of Frescolina brand ricotta salata from Forever Cheese lot T9425 and/or production code 441202. The cheese was sold to distributors for retailers and restaurants in California, Colorado, Washington D.C., Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington between 20 Jun and 9 Aug 2012. The company has issued a voluntary recall.

According to the CDC report, all 14 ill persons were hospitalized: 4 of the illnesses were related to pregnancy; 2 of these were diagnosed in newborns. Deaths were reported in Minnesota, Nebraska, and New York.

Representatives for Forever Cheese claim that all distributors and retailers are being contacted in an effort to recall any and all remaining product in the marketplace. The company encourages consumers with questions to contact Jeff DiMeo at Forever Cheese from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. ET, (888) 930-8693, and mention Recall. The CDC advises consumers to discard any remaining cheese.

According to the Food and Drug Administration, _Listeria_ is an organism that can cause foodborne illness. Symptoms of infection may include fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. Pregnant women and adults with weakened immune systems are at the greatest risk, and most healthy adults and children rarely become seriously ill.

[For a discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in 4 prior ProMED-mail posts this year (2012): Listeriosis - UK (04): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120517.1136357; Listeriosis - UK (03): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, background 20120420.1107753; Listeriosis - UK (02): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, comment 20120418.1105643; and Listeriosis - UK: (Northern Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120415.1101822.

Ricotta is not properly a cheese because it is produced from the whey that separates from the milk during the production of cheese (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricotta). Ricotta Salata is a dried, salty, aged ricotta made from sheep's milk. Ricotta means re-cooked and salata means salted. It is firm, ideal for grating and often used in salads or pasta dishes (http://www.gourmet-food.com/italian-cheese/ricotta-salata-cheese-1000464.aspx).

The news reports above indicate that _Listeria monocytogenes_ has actually been isolated from the particular lot of ricotta salata cheese that has been recalled, but they do not say whether genotyping has been done on isolates from the ricotta salata and patient specimens to see if there is a match, which would confirm the linkage of this lot of cheese to the clinical cases.
