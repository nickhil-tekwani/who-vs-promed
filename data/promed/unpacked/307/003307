Extinction threat to wild salmon
----------------------------------
Wild pink salmon around the Broughton Archipelago are declining
rapidly and will die out within 10 years if no action is taken, say
researchers. They say the data, published in Science, raises serious
concerns about the global expansion of aquaculture. Sea lice from
farms [aquaculture farms - Mod.TG] are known to infect wild salmon,
but until now the impact on wild populations has been uncertain.

"The impact is so severe that the viability of the wild salmon
populations is threatened," said lead researcher Martin Krkosek from
the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.

Modelling studies
Dr. Krkosek and colleagues compiled data on the numbers of pink
salmon in rivers around the central coast of British Columbia. They
compared populations of salmon that had come into contact with salmon
farms with those that had not been exposed, from 1970 to the present day.

Using a mathematical model of population growth rates, they show that
sea lice from industrial fish farms are reducing the numbers of wild
pink salmon -- a Pacific salmon species -- to the extent that the
fish could be locally extinct in 8 years or less.

Dr. Krkosek said the population growth rate was "severely depressed.
It means that the probability of extinction is 100 percent and the
only question is how long it is going to take," he told BBC News.

Natural parasites
Scientists say commercial open-net salmon farms are a "haven" for sea
lice -- naturally occurring parasites that attach to the skin and
muscle of salmon. Mature fish can survive being infested by a few
lice but tiny juvenile salmon are particularly vulnerable to attack.
They come into contact with sea lice when they swim past fish farms
on their migratory routes from rivers to the sea.

"Salmon farming breaks a natural law," explained study co-author
Alexandra Morton, director of the Salmon Coast Field Station, located
in the Broughton Archipelago. "In the natural system, the youngest
salmon are not exposed to sea lice because the adult salmon that
carry the parasite are offshore. But fish farms cause a deadly
collision between the vulnerable young salmon and sea lice. They are
not equipped to survive this, and they don't."

Scientists say there are a number of solutions to the problem,
including moving farms away from rivers used by wild salmon or
putting farmed salmon in pens that are completely sealed off from the
surrounding environment.

"The most obvious thing to do is to move the farm out of the way of
the wild fish," Dr. Krkosek told BBC News. "Don't put them on the
migration route, and don't put them near the spawning rivers. Another
option is to move to closed containment technology where the net pen
is replaced with a physical barrier that prevents the exchange of
parasites -- that would solve the problem too."

National treasure
Dr. Krkosek said the impact of fish farms on wild salmon has been "an
emotionally, politically and economically charged debate" in Canada.
"Salmon are considered a natural treasure to Canadians, but salmon
farming has a lot of economic opportunity -- we really need economic
activity to supplement coastal economies where fisheries and other
resource centres are not doing as well," he explained. "So there are
economic benefits to having salmon farms, but the way that it is
currently being done is very damaging to the environment and there
are better ways of doing it."

The report in Science has implications for other parts of the world
where salmon is farmed, such as Norway and Scotland. Other species of
salmon are known to become infected with sea lice, but they vary in
their ability to withstand this.

Sid Patten, chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers'
Organisation, said the Canadian research bore "little resemblance to
the situation in Scotland". He said fish farmers, wild fish interests
and the Scottish government had been working together for many years
around the north-west coast and islands to develop local area
management plans "for the benefit of both wild and farmed salmon".

"I am delighted to report that there are very positive results coming
from this process such as increased numbers of wild salmon returning
to some rivers," he said. "This summer, the Scottish government
presented our work to the Canadians who were very interested in
exploring a similar model for Canada."
