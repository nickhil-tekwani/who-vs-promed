The Indianapolis Zoo says their 13-year-old male African elephant, Kedar, has tested positive for elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV).

The Zoo started testing the blood of each elephant twice a week after 2 elephants, Nyah and Kalina, died in March [2019]. Lab and pathology tests confirmed both elephants had EEHV, which is a virus that causes fatal hemorrhagic disease in elephants, mainly Asian elephants.

The Zoo says they are bringing the full force of knowledge and support from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the National Elephant Herpesvirus Laboratory at Smithsonian National Zoo to bear on treating Kedar and monitoring the other elephants in the herd.

Zoo staff conducted a blood test on Kedar on [Thu 2 May 2019], and the results came back negative. Staff tested Kedar's blood again and the results came back positive for EEHV. Because of the frequent blood testing, veterinarians were able to diagnose the virus early. Staff immediately started Kedar on antiviral treatment.

The Indianapolis Zoo is now conducting daily blood tests on all the elephants in the herd. "We are doing absolutely everything in our power, using the most informed medical information available to us," said Shumaker. "Please keep our Zoo elephants and care staff in your hearts, thoughts, and prayers," Shumaker added.

[Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus 1A is a member of the _Proboscivirus_ genus and is a major cause of fatal hemorrhagic disease in endangered juvenile Asian elephants worldwide. This virus causes fatal hemorrhagic disease commonly identified at North American zoos. In African elephants, this virus often causes benign external herpetic lesions, but the virulence is greater in Asian elephants, in which there is endothelial disease that in many cases can be fatal. However, deaths due to EEHV have also been documented in African elephants, indicating that although Asian elephants are more susceptible, this pathogen can be lethal to both species. - Mod.PMB
