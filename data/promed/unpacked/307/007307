Animal health officials in Virginia have confirmed the commonwealth's 1st equine case of West Nile virus (WNV) for 2013. Further west, officials say a 3rd Kentucky horse has tested positive for the virus.

According to a 12 Sep 2013 statement from the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), the affected Russell County horse had been vaccinated for WNV 2 weeks prior to becoming ill. The horse is receiving supportive therapy, the statement indicated. In 2012, Virginia reported only one confirmed equine WNV case. (So the question is: Was the horse already exposed to the virus and incubating it prior to being vaccinated? Did the horse not have an opportunity to develop an immune response to the vaccine? - Mod.TG]

Meanwhile in Kentucky, a 6-year-old Standardbred gelding from Todd County tested positive for WNV on 11 Sep 2013, according to a statement from Kentucky Equine Programs Manager ES "Rusty" Ford.

Ford's statement indicated that the affected horse presented with a fever on 2 Sep 2013; his condition subsequently worsened. On 7 Sep 2013, the horse exhibited hind limb ataxia and inappetence, and on 8 Sep 2013 he became recumbent. As of 11 Sep 2013, the horse was described as "up and walking with some improvement noted."

"None of the 3 West Nile-affected horses in Kentucky were reported to have been properly immunized," Ford's statement read.

In 2012 Kentucky reported 13 cases of WNV in horses.

As of 5 Sept 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal Health Monitoring and Surveillance had confirmed 64 cases of WNV in 23 states this year [2013].

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted disease that affects humans and animals (mammals). The virus' natural life cycle involves mosquitoes and birds. The cycle starts with infected birds which can travel long distances in a short amount of time. When a mosquito bites a bird carrying the West Nile virus, the mosquito then becomes infected. This infected mosquito then feeds on another bird, a horse, human, or other mammal, which then becomes infected with WNV. Once a horse has been bitten, it may take only 5 to 15 days for signs of West Nile virus to appear. Horse to horse transmission does not occur. The virus is most prevalent from May to October when mosquitoes are most abundant.

The most common signs of WNV infection in horses include stumbling, uncoordination, weak limbs, partial paralysis, muscle twitching, and in some cases, death. Fever has occurred in less than one fourth of all confirmed equine cases.

Each horse may exhibit any combination of these signs, which include:
- Muzzle tremors: the muzzle will twitch sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. There will be no apparent reason for it -- no flies. Just a constant twitch.
- Muscle twitching: the horse looks like he is trying to get flies off his body.
- Behavior: depression is common. Hyper-responsiveness such as flinging around a stall, and other anxieties. Sweating has been noted, but does not always occur.
- Head pressing, aimless wandering, or circling.
- Facial paralysis: on one or both sides of face. The right ear may droop but the left ear stand up. The muzzle may be paralyzed on just one side or both sides so that the lips won't seal and the horse is constantly drooling.
- Vertigo-balance problems: the horse may actually lean on a wall to stand up. He stumbles a lot and is uncoordinated.
- Tongue paralysis: the tongue may lop out of the mouth. The horse doesn't seem to be able to pull its own tongue back into the mouth. And in some advanced cases, the tongue has to be pushed back into the mouth but if the muzzle is paralyzed, the tongue will just drop back out.
- Weak, stiff walking, tired.
- Impaired vision.
- Convulsions.
- Collapse, usually in advanced cases. With some the horse will fall to its front legs as if praying and can't get up. In others, the horse may just sit down and may be unable to stand on the back legs. He'll dog sit. If collapse is on all 4 legs, this case probably won't make it because the horse can't stand on his own and these are the most difficult cases to care for.

Treatment is vital for any horse with WNV. At this present time there is no specific "medicine" for a horse once he develops WNV, although there are some promising advances being made in that area.

However, your veterinarian will be able to provide supportive therapy that can save your horse's life if he does develop WNV.

For advanced cases, horses usually have to be hospitalized. For mild cases, home care may be adequate. But regardless, nursing care and treatment are important to the recovery process and each animal is assessed according to it's age and health. In cases of WNV, 33 percent will die, 50 percent will fully recover, and 17 percent will have 'problem recoveries' -- relapse or incomplete recovery.

Prevention is much easier than treatment. Prevention consists of a vaccine, followed by a 2nd vaccine in 2-3 weeks, and then an annual booster. The vaccine is usually in combination with eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and frequently these are combined with the vaccine for tetanus. The vaccine is safe and effective and should be used.
