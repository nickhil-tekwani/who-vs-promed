The Guyana minister of health, Frank Anthony, confirmed on Tuesday [23 Nov 2021] that Venezuelans who entered Guyana through the town of Port Kaituma [Barima-Waini, Region 1] in the north west of the South American country, have been diagnosed with malaria. The minister was part of the team of officials who traveled to the area for a first-hand assessment of the needs of citizens arriving from the Bolivarian country.

Frank Anthony had indicated at a press conference on Monday [22 Nov 2021] that Venezuelans are guaranteed health care, after Guyana media reported the entry of people through the town of Puerto Kaituma, in north west Guyana. He reported that about 200 people, part of 25 families from Venezuela, had settled in the town of Anabisi, an area near Puerto Kaituma. He said that, in addition to malaria, several other diseases such as respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and diarrhea were detected among immigrants and pointed out that a large number of them were caused by limited access to drinking water. There are also cases of poor nutrition, a problem that affects children especially.

The majority of malaria cases in Guyana are commonly detected in regions 1, 7, 8, and 9. "To combat it, the Ministry of Health has developed several plans to protect people against malaria. One of them is the distribution of thousands of mosquito nets," Frank Anthony said.

In a previous statement, shortly after Venezuelan immigrants were discovered in the territory of Guyana, the government said that it is aware of its humanitarian obligations to these people and that it will actively participate in sustained efforts to deliver food and medical aid in regions where immigration affects Guyana. "The Government remains committed to the migration situation resulting from economic and social instability in neighboring Venezuela," the minister concluded.

[The malaria situation in Venezuela has deteriorated over the past decade. In our latest report from July 2019 (see below) we wrote: "Over the past 5 years, the malaria control programme in Venezuela has not been functioning, and malaria has resurged in most of the country, which is well illustrated by this report." This is still the situation and therefore it is not surprising that refugees from Venezuela have malaria. - Mod.EP
