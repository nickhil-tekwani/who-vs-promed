The South Korean government declared the country Tuesday [23 Mar
2010] as clear of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), after a series of
outbreaks since January this year [2010] dented the domestic dairy
industry.

"Despite unfavorable winter weather conditions, our strong quarantine
measures helped root out the disease in 81 days," Park Hyun-chool, a
farm ministry official, told reporters in a briefing, adding the FMD
alert level has returned to the pre-outbreak level.

A total of 82 livestock markets nationwide, temporarily closed to
stem further spread of the highly contagious disease, will be open
again starting Tuesday [23 Mar 2010], while restrictions on the
movement of livestock are lifted, according the ministry.

If there is no additional outbreak by mid-June [2010], South Korea
would apply for the status as an FMD-free country with the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and initiate discussions with
dairy importers including China and Japan, the ministry said.

"In principle, resuming exports would be possible after we regain the
FMD-free status in September [2010], but the government would make
efforts with other countries concerned to reopen exports as soon as
possible," another farm ministry official told reporters.

FMD is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal disease that can
affect cloven-hoofed animals including pigs, sheep, and goats, while
humans are hardly affected by the virus. The 1st outbreak in 8 years
came early January [2010] in a local cattle farm located in Pocheon,
Gyeonggi Province, about 45 km [30 mi] north of Seoul.

[A total of 7 foci have been recorded during this outbreak which
started early January 2010, caused by FMDV serotype A. Its summary,
including a map showing all locations, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8828>.

The final follow-up report to the OIE, submitted 11 Mar 2010,
notifying the 7th outbreak (in farmed deer), included the following
epidemiological commentary:
"In order to determine whether the risk zone which had been
established following the 6th foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak
in Pocheon city could be lifted, serological tests were conducted in
all cloven-hoofed animal rearing farms.
On 9 Mar [2010], 2 serum samples collected from farmed deer were
found to be positive for FMD virus antibodies. After re-collecting
serum from all deer in that farm and re-test, all 12 serum samples
were found to be positive for FMD virus antibodies, but FMD antigen
was not detected on 10 Mar 2010. There were no positive results in
other farms."

The 12 deer were culled, similarly to all bovines on the previous 6
foci, in line with the stamping-out policy applied throughout this
outbreak, which has been controlled and eradicated by the Korean
authorities in an exemplary manner.

According to the S Korean reports, the source of the outbreak(s) or
origin of infection remained "unknown or inconclusive". The World
Reference Laboratory found the virus strain involved to be closely
related to Thai and Vietnamese strains; the genotyping report is
available at
