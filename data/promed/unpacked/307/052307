An alert has been issued after 3 suburbs in Melbourne recorded cases of flesh-eating skin disease. A Melbourne toddler came close to losing her leg after contracting a flesh-eating infection caused by Strep A [_Streptococcus pyogenes_ or Group A streptococcus (GAS)].

[The child] was just 11 months old when she suffered from a bout of colds that lasted for about a month. The child had a fever and was taken to hospital where she was diagnosed with the bacteria that was affecting her limb. Luckily, doctors were able to save her leg, but the youngster's right calf was scarred. "It was a very precarious point in her life," [her mother] said.

According to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI), 750 million people are impacted by the disease, which kills more than 500 000 people around the world every year. The illness [GAS infection] can cause acute rheumatic fever, heart disease, kidney disease, and toxic shock syndrome. Young children, the elderly, and pregnant women are susceptible to the bug.

Dr Josh Osowicki from MCRI told 7 NEWS the [bacterium] needs a vaccine. The medical institute is trialling vaccines and new treatments. Part of the study involves deliberately infecting healthy adult volunteers with the germ [GAS] in a controlled environment.

[The news report above says that an alert has been issued because 3 suburbs of Melbourne recorded cases of a flesh-eating skin disease (necrotizing fasciitis) caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_, but we are not told who issued the alert, how many cases were reported over what period of time, from which locations in the Melbourne suburbs, and what the patient characteristics are. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Necrotizing fasciitis, also called "flesh-eating disease" as in the news report above, is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection that destroys the soft tissues covering muscle (fascia). Patients usually complain of intense pain in the involved region that initially may seem out of proportion to the external appearance of the overlying skin. _S. pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus or GAS) is the most common cause, but other bacteria including _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Vibrio vulnificus_, _Aeromonas hydrophila_ can cause necrotizing fasciitis, (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/562854), as well as fungi of the order Mucorales, and mixtures of multiple intestinal bacterial species.

GAS infections can be highly contagious; skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowding in shelters for the homeless would be expected to facilitate its spread from person to person.

M protein is the major somatic virulence factor of GAS, which has been divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html). Molecular analysis of the Melbourne isolates may aid in documenting whether this outbreak has a common source and is associated with other forms of invasive GAS infection, such as toxic shock syndrome or bacteremia, or more superficial GAS infections, such as scarlet fever and pharyngitis.

Melbourne, located on Port Phillip Bay between 2 peninsulas, the Bellarine, on the west, and Mornington, on the east, with a population of about 4.6 million residents, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and is the 2nd most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne).
