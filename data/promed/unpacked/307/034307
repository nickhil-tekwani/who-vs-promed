With the identification of a 2nd raccoon infected with rabies in Manhattan
in recent weeks, the Health Department is reminding New Yorkers to stay
away from raccoons, skunks, bats, stray dogs and cats, and other wild
animals that can carry rabies.

12 rabid animals have been identified in New York City this year [2009].
Eight were found in the Bronx, 2 in Manhattan (most recently in Central
Park), one in Queens (Long Island City), and one in Staten Island
(Tottenville). Raccoons are the most commonly reported rabid animals in New
York City. Rabid raccoons are a relatively common occurrence in Staten
Island and the Bronx, but rare in Queens and Manhattan. Bats with rabies
have also been found in all 5 boroughs.

People and unvaccinated animals can get rabies, most often through a bite
from an infected animal. Infection leads to a severe brain disease that
causes death unless the person is treated promptly after being bitten
[Generally, this is post exposure prophylaxis and must be given within a
short time after the bite. After symptoms are apparent, very few with
special treatment survive. - Mod.TG]. To reduce the risk of rabies, New
Yorkers should avoid all wild animals as well as any animal that seems
sick, disoriented, or unusually placid or aggressive. Report such animals
by calling 311. Animals that have attacked or may attack should be reported
to 911.

In 2008, 19 animals tested positive for rabies in New York City. They
included 13 from the Bronx (4 raccoons, 7 skunks, one bat and one cat) and
4 from Staten Island (all raccoons), as well as a bat from Brooklyn and a
raccoon from Queens.

To protect yourself against rabies:
* Do not touch or feed wild animals, or stray dogs or cats.
* Keep garbage in tightly sealed containers.
* Stay away from any animal that is behaving aggressively or a wild animal
that appears ill or is acting unusually friendly. Call 311 or your local
precinct to report the animal.
* If you find a bat indoors that may have had contact with someone, do not
release it before calling 311 to determine whether it should be tested.

To protect your pet against rabies:
* Make sure your dog or cat is up to date on rabies vaccinations. [As there
are a number of horses around NYC, this would include horses as well. -
Mod.TG]
* Do not leave your pets outdoors unattended.
* Do not try to separate animals that are fighting.
* If your pet has been in contact with an animal that might be rabid,
contact your veterinarian, and report the incident to 311.
* Feed pets indoors.

If you are bitten by an animal:
* Immediately wash the wound with lots of soap and water.
* Seek medical care from your health care provider.
* If you know where the animal is, call 311 to have it captured.
* If the animal is a pet, get the owner's name, address and telephone
number to give to the Health Department so they can ensure the animal is
not rabid.

[Rabies is a preventable viral disease of mammals most often transmitted
through the bite of a rabid animal. The vast majority of rabies cases
reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) each year
occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Domestic
animals account for less than 10 percent of the reported rabies cases, with
cats, cattle, and dogs most often reported rabid.

Rabies virus causes an acute encephalitis in all warm-blooded hosts,
including humans, and the outcome is almost always fatal. Although all
species of mammals are susceptible to rabies virus infection, only a few
species are important as reservoirs for the disease. In the United States,
several distinct rabies virus variants have been identified in terrestrial
mammals, including raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. In addition to
these terrestrial reservoirs, several species of insectivorous bats are
also reservoirs for rabies.

Animals may act strangely, perhaps more friendly or docile, while others
are more aggressive. Nocturnal animals may be seen in the day time. There
may be hypersalivation because the paralysis affecting the throat prevents
the animal from swallowing its saliva or any other fluids. It should be
noted, human beings can only observe clinical signs of the animals, whereas
human beings can vocalize the type of pain they feel and thus express their
symptoms.

Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and
ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific,
consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise. As the disease
progresses, neurological symptoms appear and may include insomnia, anxiety,
confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations,
agitation, hypersalivation, difficulty swallowing, and hydrophobia (fear of
water) [However, this has long been a misnomer. People and apparently
animals are not afraid of the water, but rather unable to swallow water or
other fluids due to the paralysis of the throat, and, consequently, are
unable to swallow their own saliva. - Mod.TG]. Death usually occurs within
days of the onset of symptoms.

Rabies can be found almost anywhere there are mammals, including the
boroughs of New York City.
