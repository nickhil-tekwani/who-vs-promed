Dogs may have been sickened or died as a result of tainted IAMS or Eukanuba pet food, according to Fox 19 News in Cincinnati. Information on the voluntary massive recall, which was for potential salmonella is available at http://www.chicagonow.com/steve-dales-pet-world/2013/08/iams-eukanuba-recalls-dry-pet-foods/.

Three dogs died this week who shared 2 common denominators; they all stayed at a local pet daycare and they all ate a type of pet food that was recalled by P&G [Procter & Gamble Company] on Wednesday (14 Aug 2013).

According to Pet Spot, 6 dogs at their facility showed signs of HGE or hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. 3 of the dogs died, 3 became ill. MedVet, a pet hospital in Madisonville [Cincinnati], is waiting on test results to confirm the illness causing the deaths and illness of those dogs was HGE.

Again, so far, there is no confirmation the recalled food was responsible for the dogs' illness or death. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis is a disease of dogs characterized by sudden vomiting and bloody diarrhea. The signs are typically severe, and HGE can be fatal if not treated.

[The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) has voluntarily recalled specific lots of dry pet food because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_ spp.. These lots were distributed in the United States and represent roughly one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent) of annual production. No _Salmonella_-related illnesses have been reported to date in association with these product lots. The complete recall listing of the foods may be found at http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm365154.htm.

Please be aware the veterinary community is somewhat divided on the issue of _Salmonella_ spp. causing clinical signs in dogs. Numerous attempts to produce hemorrhagic gastroenteritis using _Salmonella_ in dogs have failed, but a few succeeded. The failures have outnumbered the experimental successes.

Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) is a clinically recognized but poorly described syndrome of dogs characterized by acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and marked hemoconcentration. Small and toy breed dogs appear overrepresented. No sex or age predilections have been identified.

The etiology is unknown, but an intestinal hypersensitivity to or a consequence of _Clostridium perfringens_ infection and enterotoxin production is suspected. Hypersensitivity to other bacterial, dietary, or parasitic antigens cannot be excluded. Leakage of fluid, plasma proteins, and RBC into the intestinal lumen occur secondary to increased intestinal permeability.

An acute onset of profuse hemorrhagic diarrhea (often said to resemble raspberry jam) in a small or toy breed dog is characteristic of HGE. Vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and abdominal pain are common. Marked, peracute fluid loss can result in hypovolemic shock before clinically recognizable dehydration. Other historical findings (such as, dietary indiscretion, vaccination status, etc.) are unremarkable. HGE is not considered contagious.

The diagnosis is typically based on signalment [veterinary medical history] and acute onset of clinical signs with hemoconcentration (PCV [pack cell volume] 55 percent) and normal to slightly decreased total plasma protein concentration. Selective culture for fecal pathogens (such as, _Clostridium_ spp , _Salmonella_ spp, _Yersinia_ spp, _Campylobacter_ spp, enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_, etc.) and evaluation for _Clostridium_ spp enterotoxin by fecal ELISA can be considered. Abnormalities on CBC are usually limited to hemoconcentration and neutrophilic leukocytosis. If neutropenia is present, sepsis and/or parvovirus enteritis may be a concern.

Aggressive IV fluid therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Prognosis is good with appropriate treatment. However, serious complications, including marked hypoproteinemia, DIC [disseminated intravascular coagulation], sepsis, hypovolemic shock, and death, can occur.

So, while the deaths of the animals mentioned in the article may be related to the recall it is equally as likely these deaths may not be related. Further tests and investigation are clearly needed.
