White blood cells could carry human equivalent of mad cow disease.
Hemophiliacs could face an increased risk of infection with the human
equivalent of mad cow disease through white blood cells, a doctor warned on
Friday. Dr. Christopher Ludlam, chairman of the UK Hemophilia Center
Director's Organization, said there was a possibility that white blood
cells in people infected with the new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(nvCJD), but without symptoms, could transmit the infection.
In a letter to The Lancet, he said the abnormal prion brain protein that
causes the disease was found in the tonsils and spleen of victims. White
blood cells are produced in both organs. Two batches of Factor VIII blood
concentrate, an essential clotting agent, that were produced from plasma
from people who later developed the disease have already been withdrawn in
Britain. "We should not underestimate the anxiety that nvCJD has created
for those with hemophilia," Ludlam wrote. He said Britain is already
considering a move to remove white blood cells from donated blood and
plasma. But even if the new policy is approved, it would take time to
implement and new cases of the disease could lead to further recalls of
clotting factor concentrates.
