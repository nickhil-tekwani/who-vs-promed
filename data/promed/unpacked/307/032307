Travel-related notifiable diseases imported to Norway 1998
----------------------------------------------------------
The Norwegian surveillance system for communicable diseases (Meldingssystem
for Smittsomme Sykdommer (MSIS)) requires a reporting clinican to record
whether an infection was acquired in Norway or abroad, and the patient's
country of origin. In 1998, MSIS received reports of 10 644 cases of
notifiable diseases, 52% of whom (5554) had acquired infection in Norway
and 34% (3637) had acquired infection abroad. In 1453 cases (14%) the place
of infection was unknown.
Seventy-nine per cent of the cases infected abroad (2861/3637) were
Norwegian residents who had travelled abroad, and the remaining 21% (776)
were chronic infections or carrier states among immigrants believed to have
acquired their infection in their former countries of residence before
entering Norway. The 2861 cases related to travel constituted 27% of all
notifiable diseases reported to MSIS in 1998. In 1997, 2381 travel related
case were notified among a total of 8423 (28%).
A fatal case of _Plasmodium falciparum_ infection occurred in a patient who
had not been abroad. This was probably a nosocomial infection, and the
circumstances surrounding this case are still under investigation.
In Norway, about one million people travel abroad each year, almost a
quarter of the country's population. In recent years, travel to more exotic
places in southeast Asia, southern Africa, and the Caribbean Islands has
increased. Thailand in particular has become a more popular destination:
the number of people travelling to Thailand by charter flights in 1998 was
46% higher than in 1997. This increase is reflected in the numbers of
notifications reported to MSIS especially regarding foodborne and enteric
infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and dengue fever.
