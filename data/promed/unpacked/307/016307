San Diego Hepatitis A Outbreak, 2017
------------------------------------
Since early 2017, the Public Health Services Division, in the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, has been investigating a local Hepatitis A outbreak. The majority of people who have contracted hepatitis A are homeless and/or illicit drug users, although some cases have been neither. The outbreak is being spread person-to-person and through contact with a fecally contaminated environment. No common sources of food, beverage or drugs have been identified that have contributed to this outbreak, though investigation is ongoing. The CDC notes that person-to-person transmission through close contact is the primary way people get hepatitis A in the USA.

Vaccination efforts are being implemented in targeted locations by County staff and in collaboration with health care partners. Health providers are asked to inform the Epidemiology Program if they have a patient suspected to have the hepatitis A infection, before the patient leaves the emergency department or provider's office (see contact number below).

On [1 Sep 2017], the San Diego County Public Health Officer declared a local public health emergency due to the ongoing hepatitis A virus outbreak in the county. The County Board of Supervisors ratified this declaration on [6 Sep 2017] and again on [12 Sep 2017]. The declaration shall be ratified every 2 weeks by the County Board of Supervisors until the declaration is rescinded.

The table below will provide a weekly update of total cases, deaths, and hospitalizations.

San Diego County Hepatitis A Outbreak Cases and Deaths as of 10 Oct 2017

Cases / Deaths / Hospitalizations
490 / 18 (3.7 percent) / 342 (70 percent)

Please note: Table does not include all reported hepatitis A cases in the county; only those that are local-outbreak-related. Also, data are provisional and subject to change.

10 Oct 2017 / 490 / 342 (70) / 18 (3.7)

In the past week, 20 cases have been reported with 1 additional death. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. The epicurve published last August 2017 (Hepatitis A - USA (20): (CA) fatal 20170817.5256184) showed that the outbreak had been continuing at a relatively stable rate of about 15-20 new onset cases/week. The San Diego County government after starting a vaccination program for the high risk cohort had started recommending hepatitis A vaccination for food handlers. The vaccine recommendation has also been expanded to those who work in health care in addition to prior recommendations for those who work in public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters and behavioral and homeless service providers. The county has also set up handwashing stations in high risk areas. Given an incubation period of 15-45 days with a mean of 28 days, the immunizations, as well as increased environmental cleaning and hand washing stations, these methods may be taking effect. Only time will tell.

It appears that indeed a change in the paradigm of prevention of hepatitis A was necessary to attempt to curb this large outbreak. As the globe warms and the ecology of many food/water and arthropod spread infections changes with it, similar changes in the paradigm of prevention of other infectious diseases will need to change as well.

"as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure" - Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, The Prince.
