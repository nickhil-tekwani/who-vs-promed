Frozen bodies on Spitsbergen, Norway found to contain 1920s virus
British scientists have managed to isolate the virus behind the 1918
influenza. The virus was isolated from the bodies of victims that had been
buried in the eternal frost on Spitsbergen, Norway. Traces of the virus was
also found in the brains of the dead, which may eventually give a link
between the influenza and "sleepy sickness", encephalitis lethargica, a
disease that put the sufferers into long-lasting comas in the 1920s,
researchers hope.
The victims were coal miners and researchers had been hoping that the
frozen state of the bodies would have also preserved the virus.

[Apparently the report refers to PCR detection of RNA fragments from partly
frozen human remains, rather than viral isolations. It will be interesting
to read the published reports, which were presented recently at a European
conference. The "sleepy sickness" referred to is encephalitis lethargica
(von Economo disease), a pandemic encephalitis of unknown etiology that
occurred at around the same time as the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Some
scientists have linked the encephalitis epidemic, which produced a large
age cohort of post-encephalitic parkinsonism, to influenza, largely based
on temporal and anecdotal data. For example, it was argued by Ravenholt
and Foege (Lancet 1982;2:860-864) that encephalitis lethargica DID NOT
occur in the blockaded parts of Samoa which were untouched by pandemic
influenza in 1918-1919, but DID occur in the islands that were not
blockaded and therefore experienced epidemic influenza. However, the
association has recently been called into question by Taubenberger and
colleagues (American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, annual
meeting, December 1999), who found no evidence of influenza gene fragments
in autopsy specimens from acute and post-onset tissue samples from patients
with encephalitis lethargica. This and much else about the 1918 H1N1
strain remains in question, including the basis of its pathogenecity and
its association with high mortality in healthy young adults. It is likely
that in the next few years much of the story will be gradually pieced
together.
In order to get PCR positives from old and possibly degraded tissues the
labs may sequence short genome segments. By sequencing multiple different
short sequences they can try to reconstruct what the whole genome, or just
the HA (hemagglutinin) gene, looks like.
The reason all of this is important is that it holds the secret to whatever
it was about the 1918 virus that made it so deadly. So far no one has
reported anything that would suggest a virulence mutation, but it is hoped
that the key to what happened in 1918 lies somewhere in the sequence of the
HA, and/or in any of the other 7 influenza virus genome segments.
