One person has died of rabies in Limpopo [province, South Africa] this week [week of 2 Feb 2014], bringing the total number of rabies-related deaths to 4 in the last 10 months [since April 2013].

Provincial Health spokesperson Adele van der Linde said the recent death was reported in Malamulele near Giyani. "The department once again issues a warning to residents of Limpopo, but especially in the Vhembe and Mopani districts, to immediately seek help when bitten or scratched by a domestic or wild animal that is suspected of being rabid," said Van der Lind. She said the average incidence of human rabies in Limpopo was 3 deaths per financial year, mostly in the Vhembe district.

Van der Linde said a series of training sessions had been held at all health institutions in Vhembe last year [2013] to focus on case management and the prevention of human rabies. Annual road shows were also held in Vhembe and Mopani district in September [2013], which was World Rabies Month. "Our main challenge remains the issue of ignorance. People do not seek medical attention soon enough," Van der Linde said. "People are bitten or scratched by their own animals but don't see the need to go to a health facility for treatment."

She said rabies was a re-emerging disease in South Africa, particularly in densely populated rural areas, but that infected people can survive if they are treated in time. "If a person comes into contact with a rabid animal, whether it be a bite or a scratch, they should seek immediate medical attention. There is an effective, safe vaccine against rabies," she said. She stressed that domestic pets must be vaccinated against rabies regularly. The Department of Agriculture is currently vaccinating pets free of charge in communities across the province. "Dogs and cats should be vaccinated at 3 months of age, with a booster at 9 months, and then every 3 years afterwards. In high risk areas, annual revaccination is recommended," she said.

She said stray animals, animals that are behaving strangely or that appear sick must be avoided. Once the rabies virus has entered the body, it goes to the brain where the virus multiplies, causing brain dysfunction and ultimately death. The disease is spread from animal to animal, and occasionally from animals to humans.

[Limpopo is the northernmost province of South Africa. It is named after the Limpopo River that flows across the province. The province was formed from the northern region of Transvaal Province in 1994, and initially named Northern Transvaal. The following year, it was renamed Northern Province, which remained the name until 2003, when the name of the province was formally changed to the name of its most important river -- on the border with Zimbabwe and Botswana -- after deliberation by the provincial government and amendment of the Constitution. Limpopo is the South African province with the highest level of poverty, with 78.9 per cent of the population living below the national poverty line. In 2011, 74.4 per cent of local dwellings were located in a tribal or traditional area, compared to a national average of 27.1 per cent.

From the above press report it appears that adequate amounts of rabies vaccine are available, but that the vaccine is not distributed effectively.
