Extent of misclassification of death from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD)[new variant CJD, nvCJD] in England 1979-96: retrospective examination
of clinical records
The increase in the number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
[nvCJD] recorded at the end of 1998 was genuine and not due to better
awareness and detection of the disease as has been previously claimed,
report researchers in this week's BMJ (British Medical Journal). At the end
of 1998, the UK CJD surveillance program recorded a rise in the number of
cases of variant CJD (nvCJD), but it was unclear whether this was a real
increase or a result of better ascertainment of the disease.
In order to clarify whether better identification of deaths from CJD was
the cause of the increase, Dr. Azeem Majeed from the Office for National
Statistics along with colleagues from the National Creutzfeldt-Jacob
Disease Surveillance Unit (CJDSU) and the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine examined the medical records of people aged 15-44 who had
died in England during 1979-96, from neurological disorders that could have
been confused with CJD [and nvCJD].
The authors found no previously unsuspected cases of CJD in the records
they analyzed and say that this means the surveillance program is unlikely
to have missed a significant number of cases. Majeed et al conclude that
the recent increase in cases of variant CJD (nvCJD) is real and not due to
better identification of the disease.

How can anyone get the whole story merely by "examining medical records"?
This BMJ PR (British Medical Journal Press Release) regarding desk research
"of medical records" by statisticians is contradicted by some real research
in which medical records were compared with retrospective histopathological
examination of brains. That research has been summarized several times on
BSE-L (BSE-List server) and is given yet again below:
The late Clive Bruton was Curator of the Coursellis Collection Brain Bank,
Dept of Neuropathology, Runwell Hospital, Essex (a large institution for
the mentally ill). The collection consisted of 6559 brains collected
between 1964 and 1989 from psychiatric and general hospitals across
South-East England and East Anglia.
His major prion research contribution was as the first-named author of the
well-known paper Bruton, CJ et al (1995) "Diagnosis and incidence of Prion
(Creutzfeldt-Jakob) disease: a retrospective archival survey with
implications for future research", Neurodegeneration, 4, 357-368.
The paper covers the histopathological examination of over 1000 brains in
the collection from patients who had been considered to have died from
"dementia". The findings are very well-known. In summary, the data
indicated only 60% of prion disease cases with pathologically typical
spongiform encephalopathy had been clinically identified as such in life.
This UK under-diagnosis in 1964-89 in fact tied in well (as has also been
pointed out here) with "classical" CJD figures in the UK prior to 1990
fluctuating around 30 per year and, after the setting up of the CJDSU,
vastly increased surveillance and histopathology of the brains of all
suspected cases, fluctuating around 50 per year from 1992 onward.
