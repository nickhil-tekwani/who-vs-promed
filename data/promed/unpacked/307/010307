BUFFALO GNATS - USA: (LOUISIANA), ALERT

We are seeing a hatch of the southern buffalo gnat
(<http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Cnephia+pecuarum>
_Cnephia pecuarum_ Riley). These gnats have a very toxic bite, and we
have had a number of deaths [of birds] associated with the bites
starting at the end of last week. Please let everyone know that this
is a very serious problem for outdoor aviaries and will cause serious
problems to birds, even deaths. It appears that regular screen will
keep the gnats out.

Birds that are affected will appear depressed and, especially with
macaws, will have swollen red face patches where there are no
feathers. This appears to be a problem all along the Gulf coast.
Please let everyone who has birds know.

Avian raisers with questions should contact Dr. Tully at
<ttully@vetmed.lsu.edu> (225-578-9557), Dr. Greg Rich
<DrMardiGra@bellsouth.net> (504-455-6386), or your avian veterinarian.

[The gnats are members of the blood-sucking insect family
_Simuliidae_. While entomologists describe them as black flies, these
insects may be gray, tan or greenish in color. They feed on the blood
of humans and animals.

The swarming of these pests can overwhelm some animals, causing them
to injure themselves or die after stampeding, trampling or crashing
into structures. They also transmit various illnesses such as
leucocytozoonosis, a disease of turkeys, geese, ducks and sometimes poultry.

Some wild birds and some poultry and, in some cases, livestock have
died either from toxic shock syndrome associated with the bites of
these gnats or from the continual nuisance effects that may result in
the birds or animals injuring themselves severely.

The gnats are generally daytime feeders, allowing people to escape
their nuisance by retreating inside. People can use repellents
containing DEET on themselves, but these products may need to be
applied frequently. Light-colored clothing also may repel the gnats.

Fortunately, these gnats only have a lifespan of about 21-25 days,
and as the weather becomes hotter, their lifespan may decrease.

Backyard producers can protect their poultry flocks by providing
shelter, because the gnats do not like enclosures. Fly sprays that
are permethrin-based or other animal products labeled for poultry or
livestock may be helpful to animals. Please be sure and check the
label or check with your veterinarian, as using the wrong insecticide
on your pet or poultry flock can be just as devastating as the gnats.

Individuals whose birds are ill or dying and who are unsure of the
cause can submit them to your local veterinarian who may submit them
to a diagnostic laboratory. If your bird is deceased, chill the
carcass, but do NOT freeze it until you can get it to your veterinarian.

For those who have not experienced these gnats, you are lucky. They
are tiny but horribly painful. A swarm of them could easily cause
shock, pain, and injury just from trying to escape the wicked bite.
