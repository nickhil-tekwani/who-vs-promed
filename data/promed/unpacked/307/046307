Malaria increase sharply in Maputo Province
-------------------------------------------
The number of cases of malaria in Maputo province increased sharply
in the 1st quarter of this year, according to the provincial governor,
Maria Jonas.

Speaking on Monday [25 Apr 2011] in Machava, in the southern city of
Matola, on the occasion of World Malaria Day, Jonas said 49 854 cases
of malaria had been diagnosed in the province between January and
March this year, compared with only 19 018 in the same period of
2010.

Jonas regarded this 68 per cent increase in malaria cases as a matter
of serious concern, and stressed the need for all citizens to become
involved in the efforts to halt the spread of malaria.

"Let us all be soldiers in the struggle against malaria," said the
governor. In particular, she urged everyone to support the
government's campaigns to spray insecticide against the mosquitoes
that carry the disease.

The Maputo Provincial Director of Health, Cremilda Anli, announced
that the province is spending about a million US dollars a year on
spraying. Despite this, cases of malaria have risen.

Anli stressed the need to publicise information on how to prevent
malaria -- including home spraying, and the distribution of
insecticide treated mosquito nets, particularly to pregnant women and
children under the age of 5.

World Malaria Day was instituted by the World Health Organisation
(WHO) in 2007, in an attempt to encourage the global struggle against
the disease.

There has been some progress internationally over the past decade.
The number of deaths from malaria fell from 985 000 in 2000 to 781 000
in 2009. About 90 percent of all malaria deaths occurred in Africa,
and 92 percent of them were among children aged under 5.

[Malaria is endemic in Mozambique, and a sharp increase as described
most probably is either due to a breakdown in control measures or a
reporting problem. ProMED will be happy to post further information.
