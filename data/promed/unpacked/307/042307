Outbreak of Enterovirus 71 in the city
--------------------------------------
Since August of this year cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth disease
(HFMD) have been recorded in several kindergarten and schools in St.
Petersburg. This disease is known to cause vesicular rash on palms,
soles and around the mouth [The original text is accompanied by a
graphic illustration of lesions on a child's hand. - Mod.CP]. Young
children are usually the most affected. The disease has been present
among young children for several months. Doctors often misdiagnose
the disease, attributing the rash and fever to allergic reactions.
The infection is contagious and spreads easily among pre-school
children. A quarantine is not usually announced or enforced, hence
information on the extent and progress of the outbreak is sparse.
HFMD is associated with enterovirus infection. Enterovirus
71-associated infection is considered to be the most medically
significant, since this virus has neuropathogenic potential.

Since the beginning of May 2009 enterovirus 71 has been causing
widespread out breaks of hand, foot and mouth disease among infants
and children in China [see ProMED-mail archived reports listed below].

[HFMD occurs mainly in children under 10 years old but can also occur
in adults. Children are more likely to be at risk for infection and
illness because they are less likely than adults to have antibodies
to protect them. Such antibodies develop in the body during a
person's 1st exposure to the enteroviruses that cause HFMD. Good
hygiene practices can lower the risk of infection. There is no
specific treatment for HFMD. Symptoms can be treated to provide
relief from pain from mouth sores and from fever and aches:

The extent and progress of the outbreak of HFMD in St. Petersburg is
unclear from this report and may not be significantly different from
outbreaks in previous years. It is not clear if the presence of
enterovirus 71 has been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. Further
information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
