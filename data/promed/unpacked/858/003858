South Korea reported 3 more suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] on Wed 1 Dec 2010, despite its strong efforts to curb the
spread of the animal disease.

The suspected cases were reported at cow farms in a southeastern city
where an outbreak was 1st reported Monday [29 Nov 2010]. The results
of tests on additional farms will be available Thursday [2 Dec 2010],
according to the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

South Korea has taken strong measures to prevent the spread of the
animal disease that affects all cloven-hoofed animals, including
pigs, sheep and goats, since the outbreak was reported at 2 pig farms
in the southeastern city of Andong, about 270 km southeast of Seoul.

The price of domestic beef shot up 9.6 percent Tuesday [30 Nov 2010]
as the number of cattle slaughtered dropped from the daily average of
930 head in October 2010 to 273 head on Monday [29 Nov 2010], when
tests on the 2 pig farms confirmed an outbreak of the disease. The
disease or meat from infected animals does not affect humans.

An additional case was confirmed Tuesday [30 Nov 2010] at a cow farm,
also in Andong. The affected farms have some 9150 head of animals,
but an additional 24 000 animals at nearby farms will also be
destroyed to prevent a further spread, the ministry said.

All 84 livestock markets across the nation were closed Wednesday [1
Dec 2010] for an indefinite period due to a foot-and-month disease
[FMD] outbreak in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province.

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries originally
planned to close down 82 cattle markets on the mainland to prevent
spread of the disease, but 2 markets on Jeju Island joined the
shutdown voluntarily.

Cases of FMD were discovered in 2 pig farms and a cattle farm in
Andong, Monday and Tuesday [29 and 30 Nov 2010], respectively.

Another farm in Yeongyang, some 30 km away from Andong, was suspected
of harboring the disease, but tests proved negative.

According to health officials, the owner of the farm visited Viet Nam
last month [November 2010], and there are migrant workers from
Southeast Asia working there. In the past, this has been an infection
route for the highly contagious disease, however, the exact infection
source has not been confirmed yet.

A total of 120 cattle and 12 100 pigs have been slaughtered because
of the outbreak as of Wednesday [1 Dec 2010]. Some 30 000 more
livestock are expected to be culled to prevent the spread of the disease.

Meanwhile, 2 civil servants of Andong were injured during quarantine
measures and sent to hospital. According to the local administration,
a 52-year-old official working at a prevention post collapsed and was
taken to the hospital, where he is in critical condition.

Another city employee, 39, fell from a 2-meter high bridge and
injured her spine.

[The results of the tests from the new suspected cases are expected soon.

South Korea's traditional policy regarding FMD is "stamping out
without vaccination." This policy, which excludes vaccination, has
been decided upon due to the wish to resume exports, which depend
upon recovering the status of "FMD free country where vaccination is
not practised" 3 months after the elimination of the disease. For
further details on conditions for the "Recovery of free status," see
article 8.5.9. in OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.8.5.htm>.

Gyeongsang, is available at
