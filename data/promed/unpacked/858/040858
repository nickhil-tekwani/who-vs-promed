Mink breeders are so dissatisfied with the authorities' handling of the killing of their mink that they are now suing the state. The purpose is both to ensure better financial compensation and to ensure a fair process for the killing of the minks.

[One of the mink breeders] was directed to kill his herd due to the government's plan to reduce infection among the hard-hit North Jutland farms. He feels so badly treated by authorities and politicians that he is therefore now, together with the North Jutland Mink Breeders' Association and a number of North Jutland mink breeders, suing the state. "We feel insulted. We feel trampled on, and all our rights are set aside", [he] says.

The purpose of the lawsuit is to point out the mistakes committed by the authorities, according to the mink breeders. They have now contacted [a lawyer]. She will be in charge of advising the mink breeders legally. Although she only became involved in the case on Friday [9 Oct 2020], she already has a clear idea of where the problem lies, according to the mink owners. "No decision has been made in advance. No information has been received on when they will arrive. You will not receive a letter of legal certainty stating your rights. Fifty men come in spacesuits and take their life's work from them", says [the lawyer].

The lawsuit has both a long-term and short-term purpose. In the short term, they want to stop the ongoing killing of mink until they have ensured that the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration complies with all relevant rules in the area. "We must have a fair compensation that covers our costs, and it must be equal for everyone -- regardless of whether [your farm is] infected or not. If we do not succeed, I cannot foresee the consequences, says [the lawyer].

Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Mogens Jensen did not want to comment on the mink breeders' lawsuit.

On 1 Oct 2020 [the government] changed course and re-introduced the killing of infected mink. Killing was dropped in early July [2020] when 3 infected herds were killed. Instead came demands for protective equipment and more surveillance. The mink breeders receive compensation for the skins, regardless of whether they are infected. Growers can choose between an amount now or some of the compensation now and a later calculation according to the autumn prices.

For the breeding animals, however, they only receive 20% compensation if the fur animals are infected. It has not been possible to get a figure for how large a share the breeding animals make up, but each breeding animal produces 6.3 puppies, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration informs.

Authorities imposed stricter restrictions on infected mink farms on 2 Sep 2020. There were demands for protective equipment during visits and changes of clothes and baths after a visit to a mink farm. An "iron ring" was placed around them, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration [DVFA] wrote. All farms were subject to protective equipment and had to write detailed plans for protection against infection.

At that time, 6 farms were infected. Since then, the number has risen to 63.

[According to DVFA's "Map of study for COVID-19 in mink", as of Saturday (10 Oct 2020), the total number of infected mink holdings in Denmark is 63 (out of a national total of 1136), already spread in 6 of the 11 communities of North Jutland region (in brackets, number of infected holdings): Hjorring (30), Frederikshavn (18), Jammerbugt (8), Bronderslev (3), the Island Laeso (2) and Aalborg (1). In addition, the virus has been confirmed on one mink farm in the commune Ikast-Brande within Mid Jutland Region, which is situated about 100 km (62 mi) south of North Jutland. The website does not provide information about the starting dates of the various outbreaks, the sizes of the holdings and their respective morbidity and mortality rates. Notably, COVID-19 has been recently reported to cause serious losses in mink breeding farms in Utah, USA, said to "wipe out older mink and leaving the younger mink unscathed"; most of the deaths were recorded in minks between the ages of 1 and 4 years (20201009.7847704).

DVFA's map, presenting the above updated Danish data, is available at https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/Leksikon/Sider/Kort-over-screening-af-COVID-19-i-mink.aspx.

Update 4 on the COVID-19 situation in Denmark, "addressing the developments regarding SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms in Denmark", was submitted by the Danish CVO to OIE's director general on 1 Oct 2020 (20201004.7835635). The report's final segment included the following: "In line with the new control and surveillance strategy and as stated in previous updates, only the animals in the first 3 infected farms were culled. The 4th farm was confirmed infected on 14 Aug 2020 and the farm has now entered the testing program to verify that the infection is no longer active. I will keep you posted about any further developments concerning this issue".

A new update may include details of the recent enhanced spread within North Jutland, the 1st outbreak in Mid-Jutland, and the background to the change of Denmark's control policy since 1 Oct 2020, currently applying culling of infected holdings and, as it seems from the above media reports, also of uninfected holdings.

So far, COVID-19 has been reported to the OIE from mink farms in 4 countries: Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, and USA. Information from other mink-producing countries is pending; this relates, in particular, to China, a leading fur producer. - Mod.AS
