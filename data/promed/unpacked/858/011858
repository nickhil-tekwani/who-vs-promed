FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE VACCINATION - BRAZIL
==========================================
ex: Animal Pharm
As of January, 1996, factory-gate price of oil-based FMD vaccines
in Brazil are expected to go from R$0.42 to R$0.45 (US$0.47) per
dose. The prices have been static since May 1994 and reflect
changes in new industry costs. Under new national legislation,
vaccine production standards have been upgraded to meet Min of Ag
biosecurity standards. These insist on no virus escapes.
The only manufacturer in compliance is Bayer in Rio Grande do Sul,
which spent US$4 million to upgrade its facilities. Under the new
regulations a state cannot be considered free from FMD if in-state
vaccine plants do not meet the new standards. Rio Grande do Sul
recorded its last FMD outbreak in 1993 and was the first Brasilian
state to adopt this legislation.
The next state expected to adopt this legislation is Sao Paulo, which
has the Pfizer, Rhodia, and Mallinckrodt vaccine companies. A casualty
is IRFA, which unable to upgrade, is now buying vaccine from Bayer.
Another aspect is that many states, mainly in southern Brasil, have
banned the old water-based vaccine leaving some companies with large
stocks. These vaccines are still allowed in northern Brasil. [However,
it should be noted that the oil-based vaccine, which underwent field
trials in the 1970s, is now well proven by its successes and has many
advantages over the water-based vaccine. Mod.]
The national FMD eradication campaign has been reorganised. Vaccination
will now be done in two concentrated periods in May and November,
instead of the previous year-round administration. [The epidemiological
advantages of the new programme should be obvious, if not to the
vaccine producers complaining at having to build up stocks prior to each
campaign. Mod.] The Brasilian Government is forecasting FMD vaccine sales
of US$250 million for 1996; the industry expects US$160-170 million.
In SAO PAULO, the number of recorded FMD outbreaks in 1994 was 179, and
only 18 in 1995 following two rounds of vaccination. The first covered
95.6% animals, and the second 94.8%. The state is optimistic of no new
large-scale spread. [When I was at PANAFTOSA in the mid-70s new outbreaks
regularly followed the seasonal importation of replacement stock from the
interior, which included convalescent animals with chronic infections. MOd.]
