Hand, foot and mouth disease cases increase 17.8 per cent in 1st 7 months
------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 23 454 hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases were reported throughout the country [Malaysia] between 3 Jan to 6 Aug [2016], an increase of 17.8 per cent [from the] 19 916 cases during the same period last year [2015]. Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the average number of cases each week increased to 757 from 642 during the corresponding period of last year.

"Although most cases were not serious, it could spread quickly to almost 100 per cent of children below the age of 10, especially in places like nurseries and kindergartens," he said in a statement today [11 Aug 2016]. He added that Selangor recorded the highest number of cases at 7471, followed by Sarawak (3007), Johor (2294), Kuala Lumpur (2084), Sabah (1535), Perak (1361), Penang (1357), Malacca (1198), Negri Sembilan (889), and Kedah (641), while in other states it was less than 500. He said 3 districts in Selangor had the most cases, namely Petaling (2699), Hulu Langat (1801) and Klang (1023).

Dr Noor Hisham also said 1885 HFMD cases were reported between 31 Jul and 6 Aug [2016], 600 cases more than the 1285 reported the week before.

Medical practitioners and the public can report HFMD cases in nurseries, kindergartens and schools to the nearest district education office, he said.

Hand, foot and mouth disease: China cases up, Japan cases down in 1st half of 2016
---------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease that occurs most often in children, but can occur in adolescents and occasionally in adults. In most cases, the disease is mild and self-limiting, but more severe clinical presentation with neurological symptoms such as meningitis, encephalitis and polio-like paralysis may occur.

In the 1st 6 months of 2016, China and Japan are reporting different patterns of the viral disease compared with last year [2015].

In China through 30 Jun, a total of 1 305 593 cases of HFMD including 122 deaths were reported in 2016. This includes 452 668 cases reported in June alone. This compares with the same period in 2015 when China reported 984 699 cases of HFMD and 28 deaths.

The reverse is true in Japan this year to date. Japan saw a big HFMD year in 2015; however, so far this year the numbers are way down. Through the 1st 7 months of the year, Japan has reported 17 387 HFMD cases. This compares to the same period in 2015 when the country reported 216 971 cases of HFMD.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is the commonest cause of HFMD in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has also been associated with HFMD and outbreaks of this disease.

EV-71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in South East Asia over the several years. EV 71 is a non-polio enterovirus.

Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.
