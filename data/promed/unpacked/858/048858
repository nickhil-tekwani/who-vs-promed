May I be permitted to comment on the mail regarding rabies vaccine
protection against Lyssaviruses other than serotype 1 viruses, in
particular the recent bat incident? The rabies positive bat under
discussion was found in Spain. The Tignor et al. (1972 and 1977) references
quoted refer to Duvenhage virus, isolated from a human victim bitten by a
bat in South Africa. Later studies (in rodents) tended to confirm that
protection afforded by current rabies vaccines against the most frequently
isolated European bat lyssavirus (EBL1) is not absolute.
A paper on the evolution of European bat lyssaviruses (Armengual et al.,
1997) indicates that EBL1 (now known as genotype 5) and EBL2 (genotype 6)
viruses are different from Duvenhage virus (genotype 4). The paper also
indicates that the two lineages of genotype 5 and genotype 6 can each be
subdivided (into a and b) and it is speculated that EBL1b could have been
introduced to Europe from Africa via the south of Spain.
My point in bringing these comments to your attention is to emphasize
insufficient work (and as far as I am aware none at all with regard to EBL2
viruses) has been carried out to be certain that current rabies vaccines
will or will not protect against European bat rabies viruses, although it
must be stated that no person bitten by a rabies infected European bat and
given correct post-exposure treatment has succumbed to the disease. All
persons who handle bats should consider pre-exposure vaccination. All
persons bitten by bats should immediately seek medical advice including
that on post-exposure treatment. In Europe, we simply do not know the
extent of rabies in bats and in almost all affected countries the disease
came to light when a member of the public was bitten by an infected bat.
