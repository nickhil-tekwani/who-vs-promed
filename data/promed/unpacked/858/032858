South Africa: 2 Die of rabies after dog-bite in Eastern Cape
-----------------------------------------------
Senior officials from the Eastern Cape Health and Agriculture Departments
met, on Mon 26 Jul 2004, to consider precautionary measures following
reports of 2 rabies-related deaths in the province. Eastern Cape health
spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said details were still sketchy, but, 2 people,
from the Elliotdale area, near Butterworth in the Transkei, were confirmed
dead, after allegedly contracting rabies. "The 2 were bitten by dogs, but
did not die instantly... They were taken to clinics where rabies was
diagnosed," said Kupelo. Rabies is an acute infectious viral disease of the
nervous system transmitted via the saliva of infected animals.
According to Dr. Bevan Goqwana, the Eastern Cape MEC for health, early
diagnosis could save lives [i.e. allowing time for post-exposure
prophylaxis - Mod.CP], but those who were left undiagnosed faced certain
death. "Symptoms (among humans) include tremors, lots of salivating,
increased aggression, and they can't maintain their postures," he said.
It was believed these recent deaths were the 1st [rabies-related]
fatalities in the Eastern Cape since 1994. A team jointly comprised of
agriculture and health officials are going out on Tuesday [27 Jul 2004] to
the Elliotdale area of Mbashe.
