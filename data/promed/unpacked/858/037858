[The above report indicates that 930 suspected cases have been reported this year (2019) from 1 Jan - 30 Apr 2019. There are 332 suspected cases during the April 2019 reporting period, up from 254 suspected cases on 19 Feb 2019. There are 3 new presumptive and 3 new confirmed yellow fever cases during the April 2019 reporting period. The YF virus is endemic in Nigeria, and cases occur there sporadically. Because the 2019 outbreak that began in Edo state may have started as sylvatic (forest) yellow fever spread by various _Aedes_ species with subsequent rapid development suggesting urban yellow fever transmission spread by _Ae. aegypti_, it is reassuring to learn that the Edo state outbreak was declared over with a reported vaccination coverage of 120%. This startling level of coverage may have occurred as a result of individuals vaccinated outside the state being vaccinated in the state as well, and/or by individuals having been vaccinated twice within the state. It is encouraging to learn that phase 3 vaccination will be implemented in all LGAs where no YF campaigns have been implemented thus far in Edo, Ekiti, Katsina and Rivers States. - Mod.TY
