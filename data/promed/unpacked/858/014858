Russia: Cases of Hemorrhagic Fever Increase in Frequency in Tulskaya Oblast
----------------------------------------------------
Public health physicians in the Tulskaya Oblast are warning the public that
cases of hemorrhagic fever are becoming more frequent. 26 cases of
hemorrhagic fever have been reported in Tula [the administrative center, or
capital city, of Tulskaya oblast] since the beginning of 2004.
The vectors of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome are rodents, which
begin to increase in number in the spring. This year rodent numbers have
increased 5- to 10-fold. This may be because there has been a gap of 2
years in the allocation of funds for rodent control.
The main carrier of the infection is the gray rat. Cats, dogs, foxes,
wolves, and other animals can become infected by killing and consuming
virus-carrying rodents, which do not themselves exhibit signs of illness.
The virus responsible for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is
transmitted to humans through contact with rodent excreta and detritus.
[There is little or no person-to-person transmission. - Mod.CP]
