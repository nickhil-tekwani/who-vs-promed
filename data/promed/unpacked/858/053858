--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With 2 million confirmed cases and more than 100 000 deaths worldwide, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has generated fear, uncertainty, and doubt as the world has witnessed COVID-19-related deaths and overwhelmed hospitals in Wuhan, China; Italy; and New York City. With no preexisting herd immunity, vaccine, or proven antiviral treatment, public health decision making must rely on mitigation through social distancing. Such public health decisions cannot be answered by simple epidemiologic methods, because they involve "tradeoffs, uncertainty, and values," leading to the use of models to inform administrative and policy decision makers (1). At the behest of decision makers at the local, regional, hospital system, and national levels, all the models discussed herein have been designed to forecast demand for hospital resources -- namely acute and critical care beds and mechanical ventilators -- to understand hospital capacity constraints and to determine when peak demand will occur. Rapidly developed to be fit for purpose and user friendly, these models all inform local decision makers but have been used worldwide and continue to evolve. However, they differ fundamentally in their methodological approaches and the degree to which their projections can be customized to local context. They also are all exemplars of British statistician George E.P. Box's famous aphorism, "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) COVID-19 hospital forecasting project at the University of Washington has gained much media exposure. Initially based on observed mortality in Wuhan City, the IHME model has been augmented by 8 (on 5 Apr 2020) and then 19 cities (on 10 Apr 2020) in Italy and Spain and by French data on older persons in hospitals and nursing homes on 13 Apr 2020 (2). The IHME's mortality curve-fitting approach echoes that of William Farr, a British statistician and epidemiologist: "The death rate is a fact; anything beyond this is an inference." Seeking to identify a "natural law of epidemics," Farr fit curves through epidemic mortality data in 1840 and found that epidemics could be described as bell-shaped curves (normal distributions) (3). His approach preceded the discovery of viruses and the acceptance of the germ theory of diseases, so it contained no mechanistic understanding of disease transmission (3). Likewise, the IHME approach uses the observed mortality curves in cities that have already reached their peak during the pandemic to predict deaths in other areas that have not yet had their peaks and derives hospitalization rates from hospitalization-to-death ratios, from which it predicts intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilator use (2). Originally starting with 4 interventions equally weighted for effectiveness, since 5 Apr 2020 the IHME has included the effects of only 3 social distancing measures (school closures, stay-at-home orders, and nonessential business closures [now excluding travel restrictions]) by using 3 different models (short-term day 5, long-term day 20, and a time-dependent weighting of these predictions) (2). The IHME's approach to curve fitting mortality assumes that the shape of the curve (with adjustments for the timing of policy interventions) incorporates infectious disease transmission.

In contrast, the University of Pennsylvania's COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME) is a dynamic transmission or mechanistic model (4). In 1908, John Brownlee explored the then-established germ theory concept of infection transmission and recognized the need to incorporate the host population into epidemic modeling on the basis of infectiousness: "If there be given a number of susceptible persons in a community, and if one, say, infects 3, the whole body of the susceptible persons will become involved, and the last remaining few finally swept off. Even when allowance is made, on various hypotheses, for the chance of infection being small, because of dilution of the susceptibility by the insusceptibility only lengthened, not changed in form" (3). His research pioneered susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered infectious disease models (SEIR, or simply SIR when excluding exposures) that rely on a population of susceptible persons who may become exposed to the infectious agent and may result in transmission of infection from which they may recover (such as influenza) with or without immunity or develop chronic disease (such as hepatitis C virus). Data inputs to such models include specification of such concepts as basic reproductive number (R0), the number of additional cases that 1 infection will generate (2.3 in Wuhan) (in the absence of mitigation, 1 - 1/R0 = the proportion of the population likely to be infected, or approximately 60% [for R0 = 2.3] [5], and mitigation or vaccination that reduces the R0 to <1 leads to resolution of the epidemic); doubling time, the number of days for the epidemic to double in cases (7.4 days in Wuhan); incubation period, the number of days from infection to symptoms (5.2 days in Wuhan); and serial interval, the number days between illness onset in the initial infection and onset in secondary transmissions (7.5 days in Wuhan) (6). Exposure details might include duration and degree of infectiousness before and during symptom onset; population density on the basis of contacts at school, at work, or randomly in the community; heterogeneity in infection transmission (such as superspreaders); and asymptomatic or mild infections that do not lead to hospital evaluation but might be transmissible.

To facilitate tailored predictions by administrators and policymakers to their local circumstances, the CHIME model simplifies these disease inputs into regional population at risk, where the number infected depends on the regional population size, hospital market share, and currently hospitalized census (7). The CHIME model calculates the basic reproductive number (R0) from inputs for the doubling time and recovery (infectiousness) in days with a constant mitigation reduction from social distancing at the date of implementation (7). The severity impact of infection includes the proportion of acute and ICU hospitalization and mechanical ventilation and the average length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and the ICU with or without a ventilator. The CHIME model assumes uniform or homogeneous susceptibility to infection risk, regardless of population density, contact location, or heterogeneity in infectivity (4), and calculates R0 on the basis of a predetermined relationship to input specifications. It can incorporate asymptomatic or mild infections by accounting for such persons when estimating proportions of need for hospitalization, ICU care, and mechanical ventilation. Of importance, the investigators compare their projections with those of other existing models (cross-validation) (4).

In their report for Annals, Giannakeas and colleagues use their COVID-19 Acute and Intensive Care Resource Tool (CAIC-RT) to examine the steady-state consequences of constrained hospital resources on patient throughput (8). In contrast to the other models described here, the CAIC-RT ignores the epidemic and focuses on capacity imposed by resource limitations. This type of model originates in an engineering field called operations research, which seeks to maximize outputs given constraints and to identify queues and bottlenecks that may benefit from additional resources, such as those in factory production. The CAIC-RT can be tailored to local age distribution of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting to a health care system or hospital and to the age-stratified proportion requiring hospitalization, critical care, and mechanical ventilation (9). At the beginning of the epidemic, the system has sufficient resource capacity to care for all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eventually, with full use, the steady-state assumption becomes necessary. On the basis of the number of acute care and ICU beds and mechanical ventilators (potentially supplemented by surge capacity or by shifting non-COVID-19 beds to COVID-19 ones as user inputs), as well as mean LOS for each, CAIC-RT calculates the maximum number of patients moving in and out of each of those resources on a daily basis due to admissions, discharges, deaths, or transfers from one resource to another or from or to another health care facility. By setting inputs equal to outputs (on the basis of LOS), CAIC-RT determines the maximum daily patient flows and assumes that as soon as a patient leaves a resource, that resource is filled by another; therefore, it does not explicitly account for day-to-day variation resulting in queues or bottlenecks, as typically occur during epidemics.

The aforementioned models differ in their approaches, data needs, reproducibility, methodological complexity, and transparency, as well as in their assessment of face validity, uncertainty, verification, cross-model validity, and external validity (10). As with hurricane-tracking models, they make varying projections; yet in the face of uncertainty, they provide useful real-time forecasts to prepare for the pandemic, as evidenced by their broad use. Of note, 2 of the models consider mitigation of basic reproductive number, but only 1 permits user input. Any reduction in R0 through mitigation results in a flatter curve, delaying the peak and lowering the likelihood of exceeding resource capacity, but would also reduce herd immunity, because more persons remain susceptible. In the absence of a vaccine, this reduced herd immunity leads to a higher risk for subsequent resurgent epidemic waves. Beyond its mortality impact, this pandemic has triggered a substantial worldwide economic downturn, particularly for economically vulnerable persons and small businesses (5). With tradeoffs between economic recovery and health objectives (5), these models make useful predictions that inform timely health care system preparations but also decision making by policymakers who seek to minimize mortality and not overwhelm the health care system, yet who seek to manage the economy, while awaiting development of safe and effective vaccines and antiviral treatments. Regardless of the model, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will end.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 20 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- The urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine underscores the pivotal role immunizations play in protecting lives and economies. Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, marking the European Immunization Week 2020, stressed 'we must not, especially now, let down our guard on immunizations' (http://www.euro.who.int/en/about-us/regional-director/statements/statement-vaccination-must-be-maintained-during-covid-19-pandemic-to-be-effective). WHO and UNICEF have released a joint statement to mark European Immunization Week 2020, which is available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/events/events/2020/04/european-immunization-week-2020/statements/whounicef-joint-statement-maintaining-routine-immunization-services-vital-during-the-covid-19-pandemic.

- WHO has published a brief on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19. Concerns have been raised that NSAIDs may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects. However, as explained in the brief, at present there is no evidence of severe adverse effects. The brief is available at https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/the-use-of-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-(nsaids)-in-patients-with-covid-19.

- WHO has recently published an updated strategy to help guide the public health response to COVID-19 which is available here, and is one of the topics for today's 'subject in focus' below.

- An update on Emergency Medical Teams, the Global Health Cluster, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Risk Communications and Community Engagement is also provided in today's 'subject in focus' below.

Subject in focus
----------------
1. Updated strategy to help guide public health response to COVID-19
WHO published the 1st Strategic Response and Preparedness Plan on [3 Feb 2020]. Since then, we have learnt a huge amount about COVID-19, and how best to slow and stop it spreading through communities around the world. WHO has been rapidly translating this new knowledge into guidance for national governments, health workers, and everyone else involved in the global response to COVID-19. On [14 Apr 2020], WHO published a strategy update (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/covid-19-strategy-update---14-april-2020) reflecting what we have learnt to inform the next iteration of the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP) due in the coming weeks.

The update is intended to help guide the public health response to COVID-19 at national and subnational levels. The update emphasizes the need to tailor the response to COVID-19 carefully to local contexts, however, there are some important lessons that can be applied in a broad range of situations.

One important lesson is that the faster and the more effective we are at finding all suspected cases of COVID-19, testing, isolating, and treating the confirmed cases and tracing their contacts, then the harder we make it for the virus to spread. This in turn makes it easier for health systems to cope, deliver quality care, and save lives.

This principle applies in all contexts, but it can sometimes be a challenge to put into practice even in settings with ample resources. Together with the whole UN system, WHO has worked and is continuing to work closely with all partners and national governments to ensure that all populations, but especially the most vulnerable populations, including those in humanitarian settings, benefit from a coordinated and effective response. Alongside the SPRP, that applies to all countries, the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (issued on 25 Mar 2020), sets out the most urgent health and humanitarian actions required to prepare and respond to COVID-19 in the most fragile contexts.

The update also sets out key criteria and considerations for countries that are considering lifting some of the widespread restrictions on movement, often termed "lockdowns", that have been used to suppress the spread of COVID-19 through communities. By ensuring these criteria are met, it should be possible for countries to sustain a steady state of low-level or no transition at the same time as resuming some social and economic activities. However, without careful planning, and in the absence of scaled up public health and clinical care capacities, the premature lifting of physical distancing measures is likely to lead to an uncontrolled resurgence in COVID-19 transmission and an amplified 2nd wave of cases.

Finally, the update sets out the shift required in the international system to support countries to plan, finance, and implement their response to COVID-19. The world has never faced this scale of challenge before. COVID-19 is a truly global crisis, and the only way to overcome it is together, in global solidarity.

2. Partner coordination
Emergency Medical Teams (EMT)
-----------------------------
- Over 100 EMTs and focal points worldwide are working closely with the EMT Secretariat, and are continuously engaging in monitoring, guiding, and facilitating national and international COVID-19 response operations. A weekly Global Coordination Call is held, providing the network with updates on current operations, technical guidance, and sharing of current experiences and practices from various EMT responses to COVID-19.

- As of [19 Apr 2020], international EMTs have deployed to 15 countries. 32 EMTs are responding nationally to support and reinforce the local health systems in all Regions.

- The EMT Secretariat met with the Regional Group for the European Region on [17 Apr 2020]. Following discussions, there was an agreement for the Secretariat to provide regular updates and present the types of support needed globally in order to raise awareness and facilitate deployments of available EMTs.

- Recently, Chinese EMTs were deployed to Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, and UK EMT to Zambia. Additional deployments of Chinese EMTs are under discussion to Algeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zimbabwe. Requests from Botswana, Sao Tome and Principe, and Yemen are also being processed.

- The following guidance and recommendations have been finalized: technical guidance on COVID-19 community facilities and treatment centres; recommendations on pre-hospital emergency medical services; and recommendations for medical surge capacity and deployments of EMTs. A modularized just-in-time training package on COVID-19 for the EMT workforce is currently being finalised.

Global Health Cluster (GHC)
---------------------------
- All 29 countries with IASC [Inter-Agency Standing Committee] activated Health Clusters/Sectors are reporting confirmed COVID-19 cases. The 900 national and international health cluster partners are urgently responding to COVID-19 specific needs whilst maintaining essential health services for 65 million people affected by humanitarian crises.

- The GHC is collaborating with other clusters to inform adaptive approaches to implement key public health actions in complex setting (such as isolation in camp-like settings with Shelter and Camp Coordination and Camp Management Clusters).

- Updating of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) has been launched at country and global level, involving partner consultation, and consideration of including additional countries.

- A GHC COVID-19 Task Team is being established to (i) identify & promote minimum standards for humanitarian settings; (ii) support multi-sectoral action; and (iii) intensify advocacy to address unmet needs/operational barriers. The Task Team will build upon and strengthen existing global partner initiatives with strong field driven engagement to capture operational practice and lessons.

Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)
--------------------------------------------------
WHO continues to facilitate direct and remote technical assistance to countries through GOARN regional and global network of networks to support health operation. UNICEF, IFRC, US CDC, and OCHA are embedded in the global COVID-19 incident management team in Geneva; and are supporting all pillars of response. Work is ongoing to launch public information hub on GOARN Knowledge Platform for COVID-19 to share resources from partners and other stakeholders.

GOARN activities include:
- Operational coordination;
- Collaboration on training and capacity building, including Field Epidemiology Training Programmes, regional and global networks, and alumni networks;
- Roll out and implementation of Go.Data (https://www.who.int/godata/about); and
- Response research (including support to COVID-19 Research Innovation and Research Roadmap working groups).

Risk Communications and Community Engagement (RCCE)
---------------------------------------------------
IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO with GOARN support are strengthening coordination and collaboration among key stakeholders at the global and regional levels in risk communications and community engagement (RCCE). As the COVID-19 pandemic develops into a global humanitarian crisis, there is increasing coordination with IASC Results Group 2 on Accountability and Inclusion and its humanitarian partners to join and align efforts in regard to country operations, solutions and tools for stronger community engagement and accountability approaches on the ground.

- The RCCE global strategy has been completed, and is a 'live' document that will be revised and enhanced following the Strategic Preparedness Response Plan revision and Global Humanitarian Response Plan.

- Strengthened coordination of partners with a focus on needs of migrants and vulnerable populations, community engagement in remote populations and addressing reports of stigma and xenophobia.

- Work is ongoing to a launch public information hub for COVID-19 on GOARN Knowledge Platform to share RCCE resources from partners and other stakeholders, and enable access to RCCE information.

- A rapid consultation on social, cultural, behavioural perspectives in the COVID-19 response was undertaken. Briefs were completed on information, misinformation, disinformation and on compliance with physical distancing measures for COVID-19 and implications for RCCE in Eastern and Southern Africa (April 2020). A GOARN RCCE Data Collection Tools Repository was developed for rapid access to tools for COVID-19 RCCE data collection. Africa and Asia RCCE coordination groups are triangulating community insights with the intent to inform RCCE priorities and strategies within these regions.

- A joint "live" guidance has been developed on "Community Engagement and COVID-19 Movement Restrictions: Tips for Engaging People in Low-Resource Settings Remotely and In-Person."

- Guidance and webinars on engagement with faith-based organizations and religious leaders are underway this week ahead of Ramadan. A community action guide with tips for individuals and communities to take simple actions to support and protect people around them during the epidemic is available at https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331767/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ramadan-2020.1-eng.pdf

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 36 771 (50.5% of the total newly reported cases) new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 76.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 7.9% and Canada at 4.1%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 34.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 17.7%, Chile at 13.6% and Peru at 10.9%..

The European region newly confirmed 26 882 (36.9% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 2648 (50.0%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update. Russia did not report on newly confirmed cases or deaths. The UK reported 21.8% of the newly confirmed cases, Spain with 15.7%, Turkey with 14.8%, Italy 11.3%, Germany 6.6%, and Belgium 4.9% (France was 2.8%).

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1343 new cases representing 28.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia at 22.9%, United Arab Emirates at 10.1%. Qatar at 9.3%, and Pakistan at 9.0%.

In the African region, there were 22 countries reporting no cases in this 24 hour period. That being said, Ghana reported 24.0% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 19.4%, South Africa at 14.3%, Cote d'Ivoire at 12.1%, and Algeria at 10.9%.

In the Western Pacific region, Singapore reported 44.9% of the newly reported cases, followed by Japan at 29.4%, the Philippines 12.9%, and Malaysia at 6.3%.

In South East Asia, India reported 68.8% of newly reported cases, followed by Indonesia at 14.5% and Bangladesh at 13.8%. Removing India from the denominator, Indonesia represents 46.4% of the newly reported cases, Bangladesh 44.3%, Thailand 3.8%, and Sri Lanka and he Maldives each at 2.4%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through [20 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends, and has dropped today with the European region dropping lower than it has since 23 Mar 2020. The America's region does not appear to have decreased,

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 4 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
