Influenza B Virus, Hong Kong Strain; Late-season Outbreak in Texas
------------------------------------------------------------------
A rare strain of flu not protected against by the current vaccine has caused
a late-season outbreak in Houston and other parts of the state, the Texas
Department of Health (TDH) reported on Thu 6 Jun 2002. In what is probably
an omen of the upcoming winter flu season, the Hong Kong [strain] of
influenza B virus made several hundred school-age children in Houston,
Galveston, El Paso, and Austin ill in March, April, and May 2002. The [Hong
Kong] strain had not be seen in the United States since 1991.
"This flu strain is what's known as a herald wave, a prophecy of what we're
likely to see next winter," said Dr. W. Paul Glezen, head epidemiologist at
the Baylor College of Medicine Influenza Research Center. "We could have a
pretty sharp outbreak of it." Glezen added that the Hong Kong strain of
influenza B virus isn't more severe than other strains. The source of
pandemics (worldwide influenza epidemics) is influenza A virus.
TDH epidemiologist Neil Pascoe characterized the outbreak as "minor" but
said it was noteworthy because of the lateness of its occurrence and the
rarity of the strain. He said it is "highly unusual" for Texas to have
outbreaks in May and suggested it may indicate continued transmission over
the summer. But Glezen said that the outbreak in Houston seemed to die out
after April 2002, when there were 74 laboratory-confirmed cases at Texas
Children's [Hospital]. Exact numbers [of cases] in the outbreak are not
known because Texas doctors are not required to report influenza cases.
Doctors confirmed that the first Texas case occurred on 6 Mar 2002 and the
most recent case on 28 May 2002. There have been no cases in June.
Glezen attributed the outbreak to a change in the virus and a susceptibility
built up by years of non-exposure to the virus, which last caused an
epidemic in the United States in 1988-1989. Except for Southeast Asia, where
it has consistently circulated, it has been absent from much of the world
since the early 1990s. In the United States, the strain will be covered by
the next influenza vaccine, which will be available in the fall.
Pascoe said physicians shouldn't rule out an influenza diagnosis simply
because the flu season is over, and he called for those with symptoms to
stay at home, cover their mouths and noses when they cough or sneeze, and
wash their hands frequently to reduce the spread of virus.

[The epidemiology of influenza B viruses differs from that of influenza A
viruses -- influenza B viruses generally cause less severe outbreaks of
respiratory infection in man. However, the influenza B viruses are more
frequently implicated in the development of Reye's syndrome in children.
Reye's syndrome is rare, with only 0.37 to 0.88 cases per 100 000 children,
but it has been associated with 22 to 42 percent fatality. Influenza B
viruses were isolated first in 1940. However, there has been no indication
that hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase subtypes comparable to those of the
influenza A viruses exist, although progressive antigenic variation can
generate different strains. The influenza B viruses appear to go through
cycles of prevalence. In some years influenza B viruses are virtually
absent, whereas in others they may predominate. In contrast to influenza A
viruses, which have natural reservoirs in pigs, horses, and birds, the
influenza B viruses are mainly isolated from humans. - Mod.CP]
