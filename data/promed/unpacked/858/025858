20 children were affected after an accidental inhalation of certain chemical compounds, and they developed symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.

It is not clear how these children became intoxicated with chemicals. Apparently, some chemical substances might have been dispersed in a premise next to Cristo del Parque school in Codegua community, and these may be the causative agents of the symptoms described in affected children.

More than 20 children started their usual school activities in the morning, but soon they developed symptoms such as dizziness, headache, and nausea, and some children developed vomiting.

Facing this situation, authorities from Cristo del Parque school decided to call parents of affected children, and they brought the most severely affected children to the nearest local health care facility.

One of the children had to be brought to the Rancagua Regional Hospital because he developed intense abdominal pain.

Ms. Ana Maria Silva, Mayor of the local community, added that the local Health Commission should investigate this occurrence, since some health-related complications have been recently described in this community because of the use of pesticides, such as high numbers of cases of cancer, congenital malformations, and problems in pregnant women, and this event is not the 1st of its kind.

Codegua has been one of the communities in this region that has been significantly affected because of the excessive use of pesticides, and chemical spill emergencies have also been reported.

We have to remember that last January [2012], one person died after being poisoned with ammonia fumes from a local packing shed in the area.

[The exposure to the toxin may have been by inhalation. However, it is also possible this was an event of hysteria.

The symptoms described in the article are general and could relate to any chemical. While the health officials acknowledge there have been problems in the area with malformations and other illnesses, there is no indication that this is the same situation that has caused the malformations.
