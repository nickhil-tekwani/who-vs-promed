Re: PRO/IN> Highly pathogenic H5N8 in Kazakhstan [20200919.7796269, 20200926.7815554, 20201006.7838872]

We report here emerging results of analyses of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 viruses in the north of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Recently HPAI viruses of the H5N8 subtype have caused outbreaks in the Russia Federation in July [2020] and in the Republic of Kazakhstan since September [2020]. Viruses detected in domestic ducks, geese, chickens and a single mute swan in the Republic of Kazakhstan in September 2020 were of the A/H5N8 subtype and had a multi-basic cleavage site motif consistent with a highly pathogenic phenotype in galliform birds (PLREKRRKRGLF) and belong to A/H5 GsGd clade 2.3.4.4b.

For all gene segments the Kazakhstan viruses cluster together in phylogenetic trees, with the closest genetic relatives for a putative ancestral strain last detected in around 2017/2018. However long branch lengths from these putative ancestral relatives for each gene to current outbreak strains suggest undetected maintenance of Kazakhstan-like viruses as a complete genotype from emergence likely in early 2018 through to detection in September 2020.

No subsequent information on the detection, circulation or spread of this emergent H5N8 virus is currently available, prior to the detection of the viruses in Kazakhstan. The viruses can be clearly distinguished in all gene segments from those of H5N8 viruses that caused widespread outbreaks in Europe during the first half of 2020.

The phylogenetic tree topology, the lack of evidence for reassortment with LPAI gene segments from either domestic or wild anseriforms, the relatively short branch lengths within the Republic of Kazakhstan cluster linked by a long branch to ancestral strains suggests
a) a very similar virus is responsible for all outbreaks in Kazakhstan,
and
b) long-term and under-surveilled but continued circulation is more likely to have occurred in galliform poultry in unknown regions/locations.

The threat of this virus to the poultry sector through winter 2020/21 remains, along with the potential for re-spillover and diffusion mediated by wild birds; risk mitigation - proportional to previous years - is required.

This work was done through close collaboration between the AI International Reference Laboratory, APHA-Weybridge, the Royal Veterinary College UK, Kazakh Scientific Research Veterinary Institute, Almaty and the National Veterinary Reference Centre, Nur-Sultan, Republic of Kazakhstan.

[Kazakhstan reported on 16 and 17 Sep 2020 outbreaks of HPAI H5 on its northern territories, affecting, respectively, wild birds (unidentified Anatidae and Corvidae) and poultry (species not given); both notifications were included in 20200919.7796269, which was accompanied by the following commentary by Mod. CRD:

"Since August 2020, Russia reported 39 outbreaks of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza]. All were associated with the H5 hemagglutinin subtype, but only 2 of the 39 have been fully characterized as H5N8. These outbreaks occurred in both domestic poultry and wild birds and were located in Omsk, Kurgan, Tyumen, and Chelyabinsk oblasts. These oblasts border the North Kazakhstan region. See reports and updated maps at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=35477, https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=35280, and https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=35614.

"For this HPAI event from Kazakhstan, the neuraminidase has not yet been typed. Determining the subtype and strain of this virus is very important".

The current report from OIE/FAO International AI Reference Laboratory, for which Prof Brown and his colleagues are gratefully acknowledged, provides detailed information on the strain circulating in Kazakhstan. Complementary data of the H5 AI strain circulating on the Russian side of North Kazakhstan, compared to the Kazakh strain, will be helpful.

Recently, HPAI outbreaks have been reported to the OIE from the Karachay-Cherkessia Republic in the North Caucasus region of Southern Russia (poultry, H5, 20201006.7840560) and from central Israel (poultry & wild, H5N8, 20201015.7864774, 20201014.7861465). Both are located on flyways of migrating birds from central/northern Asia. Details on their respective genotyped profiles will be helpful. - Mod.AS
