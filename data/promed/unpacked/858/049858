[With the substantial increase in reports of dengue coming into ProMED, only outbreaks of 50 or more cases will be included in the weekly updates. In order to limit posts to key facts, individual reports will give its date, total number of dengue cases, indicating confirmed cases as (conf.) and unconfirmed cases as (unconf.), if known. DHF cases also include those termed serious cases. If the numbers of cases are increasing or decreasing that will be indicated. The dengue virus type is noted if available. The URL of the original report will be given, and the language of the report indicated if it is other than English. URLs for map locations of the country will be included. - Mod.TY]

Although dengue fever cases have reached epidemic levels this year [2012], its bout has been less fatal than in previous years and is on the decline due to seasonal patterns and growing immunity, World Health Organization officials said at a press meeting yesterday [3 Sep 2012].

"It certainly fulfills all the criteria [for an epidemic] this year [2012], but although there have been many more cases, they've not been as serious with not as many deaths," said Dr Nima Asgari, team leader in the WHO in Cambodia's emerging diseases surveillance and response unit.

The decrease in deaths was largely due to better education about dengue treatment and prevention, and particularly to public hospitals -- which often used to rehydrate patients to the point of drowning them -- becoming more aware of the need to adjust fluid dosage to individual patients' needs, Asgari said.

"Based on historical data, we do expect a decrease from now on this year [2012]," he added.

According to Dr Steven Bjorge, WHO team leader for malaria and other vector-borne diseases, this year's [2012] large number of reported dengue cases -- the largest since 2007 -- may mean a greater drop-off of cases later in the year, as individuals already exposed to one of the disease's 4 strains cannot be re-infected by that given strain.

The Health Ministry's Cheamon Thavy, director of dengue fever health education at the Health Ministry's National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control, agreed this year's [2012] dengue levels show an increase from other years except 2007, and added: "I think it will decrease from now on."

As of [14 Aug 2012], the Ministry of Health reported the year's [2012] dengue numbers at 24 127 cases and 106 deaths in 33 public hospitals, Thavy said.

By the same time last year [2011], there were less than 10 000 cases, and in the dengue epidemic of 2007, there had been 29 000 by the 8th month.

WHO officials acknowledged that such data did not represent all dengue cases because they do not include patients who went to private clinics or did not seek medical care, and they may include chikungunya cases, [caused by] another mosquito-borne virus with similar symptoms.

Nevertheless, Bjorge maintained that, with an approved dengue vaccine many years and dollars away, the data show that Cambodians must continue to focus on changing personal habits, for example getting rid of uncovered still water or filling it with guppy fish, which eat mosquito larvae.

Hai Ra, head of dengue control for the provincial health department in Kampong Cham, which has seen more than 100 dengue cases and 8 dengue-attributed deaths this year [2012], said yesterday [3 Sep 2012] that dengue case rates have been falling despite increasingly wet weather as the torrential end of the rainy season approaches.

He said health officials have had success encouraging community participation in dengue education campaigns but stressed that these programs must continue regardless of whether the rate of dengue cases increases or decreases over the coming months.

[According to the newswire above, dengue infection in Cambodia is on the decline due to seasonal patterns and growing immunity. From 1 Jan 2012 to 20 Aug 2012, at least 27 590 and 111 deaths of dengue infection had been reported in Cambodia (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Cambodia (12) 20120827.2087). In 2011, a total of 9451 cases and 44 deaths due to dengue infection, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.47 percent were reported for the same period.

According to the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) report on the dengue situation, dated 23 Aug 2012, a total of 23 929 cases and 101 deaths due to dengue infection, with a CFR of 0.4 percent, were reported between 1 Jan 2012 and 31 Jul 2012. The trend of dengue activity is declining in Cambodia. However, the activity remains above the historic seasonal baseline; 7941 cases and 40 deaths, with a CFR of 0.5 percent for the same period in 2011 (see http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/Dengue.Report.23Aug2012.pdf).
