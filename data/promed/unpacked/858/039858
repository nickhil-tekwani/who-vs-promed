["_Gyrodactylus salaris_ is an ectoparasite affecting mainly Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), but can survive and reproduce on several salmonids, such as rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), Arctic charr (_Salvelinus alpinus_), North American brook trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_), grayling (_Thymallus thymallus_), North American lake trout (_Salvelinus namaycush_), and brown trout (_Salmo trutta_) (in declining order of susceptibility).

"_G. salaris_ is restricted in its distribution to Europe. It has been recovered from farmed Atlantic salmon or farmed rainbow trout in several (mainly northern) European countries. In the wild, the parasite has been found on wild salmonids, mainly Atlantic salmon parr, in rivers in Russia, Sweden, and Norway. _G. salaris_ is more common in farmed rainbow trout than previously thought, and is likely to be present in more countries than those currently known. In 2006, _G. salaris_ was reported from fish farms in Italy and, in 2007, from fish farms in Poland and Macedonia. In 2009, _G. salaris_ was identified by the OIE reference laboratory, from fish farms in Romania. Great Britain and Ireland have been demonstrated to be free of the parasite."
