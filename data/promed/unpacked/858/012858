An avian botulism outbreak has resulted in the deaths of nearly 2000
ducks and other birds at a private hunting lake near 2 of Nevada's
most important wetlands for birds.

The Reno Gazette-Journal reports the die-off has occurred since late
August 2011 at Six Man Club, a private lake near both the Stillwater
National Wildlife Refuge and the state-run Carson Lake and Pasture.

The 2 wetlands, located around Fallon about 60 miles east of Reno, are
major stops on the Pacific Flyway for a wide variety of migrating
birds. Although birds frequently fly between the 3 water bodies,
officials say the outbreak has not spread to Stillwater or Carson
Lake.

They say an abundance of fresh water in Stillwater and Carson Lake
could help prevent its spread there.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin
produced by the bacteria, _Clostridium botulinum_. This bacteria is
widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source
and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and
produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with
warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism
bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of
toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly
affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (e.g.
chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not
affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in
a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots), feed on animal
carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume
toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4
maggots.

Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of
decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the
nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds
are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the third
eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck
muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also
result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory
failure, or predation.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning
(in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in
removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment. If possible,
avoid altering water depth by flooding or drawing down water levels
during hot weather. This may increase invertebrate and fish die-offs,
a protein source for the bacteria.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade and protection
from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism
antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given
early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are
NOT immune to botulism toxin.
