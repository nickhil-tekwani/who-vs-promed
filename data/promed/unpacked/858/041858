Informative news content indicating the death of sheep and cows in some Jordanian cities, including Sahab, Mafraq, and others, and the possibility of the emergence of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], also circulating in neighboring countries such as Palestine, have recently spread.

The published news articles included inconsistent or inaccurate information. Questions from the general public and farmers about the very presence of the disease in local livestock, its spreading rate, the location of disease foci, and control measures undertaken remained unanswered.

The Jordanian Media Credibility Monitor (Akeed) tracked a number of news articles related to the FMD issue. It was found that the media published denials by official authorities of the existence of FMD, as well as -- in other reports -- official confirmations thereof. There were conflicting reports on the number of dead animals, mostly underestimating them, and on the results of their postmortem examinations. The Russian decision to stop importing livestock from Jordan due to the presence of FMD came as a surprise, while this decision corresponds to a local denial of importing livestock from Russia [see comment].

The media published news about vaccination campaigns against the disease without providing any information about the reality of the disease and its spread. Farmers have not been updated about the evolution of the disease and its distribution, and about the measures they should undertake to limit its spread, such as intra- and inter-regional animal movement restrictions, etc.

(Akeed) believes that the media's failure to provide accurate and detailed information is not in line with the media's mission to educate society and contribute to solving urgent economic, political, or other problems. Concern for the reputation of the local product regionally or internationally does not justify the media's failure to reveal information which may affect the interests of a certain group. Reliable information should be published by the media through verification and investigation of facts and details that are difficult for the ordinary citizen to access. (Akeed) also believes that limiting the information has amplified the size of the issue and transformed it from a simple transient matter to an issue around which question marks are raised. Clarity, transparency, and information integrity are basic principles in news journalism.

(Akeed) did not monitor a sufficient number of field reports, or interviews with stakeholders from farmers or veterinarians. (Akeed) also did not find a sufficient number of awareness media reports under the umbrella of agricultural or health media that provide guidance from specialists, directing farmers to the optimal method to prevent the spread of infection and the handling of affected herds, and explaining to consumers the retained safety of animal products during an FMD outbreak.

[Akeed -- in Arabic, "sure" -- is one of the projects of the Jordan Media Institute; it is "a tool for media accountability, which works within a scientific methodology in following up the credibility of what is published on the Jordanian media according to declared standards".

Situations such as the one described above are not restricted to a single country. Unfortunately, deficient epidemiological information on epizootics, inaccuracies, and pressures exercised by economic/trade interests to decrease transparency are seen too often. Jordan is fortunate to have an effective whistleblower which takes care of an exemplary corrective follow-up.

A media report dated 4 Nov 2021 cited the spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, stating that "the infection was in a small number of imported calves, and work is underway to carry out a follow-up, obtaining all relevant information about the event" (Saraya News, <tinyurl.com/t2cj57zv>).

Jordan's later Immediate Notification to the OIE, dated 11 Nov 2021 (ProMED post 20211111.8699579) included the following epidemiological comment: "A small herd of 10 calves showed clinical signs of fever, mouth lesions, and salivation. The herd is located around the Sahab livestock market. Epidemiological investigation is in process, samples were sent to the national laboratory, the results confirmed the cases".

It may be assumed that susceptible imported calves may have gotten infected from the local virus following their arrival. This may decipher the comment in the Akeed article, addressing the "local denial of importing livestock from Russia".

A report titled "Agriculture: Jordan is free of foot-and-mouth disease" was published by Khaberni.com News on 23 Jan 2022, at https://tinyurl.com/2p9xwehu.

A TV report titled "More than 200 sheep died due to foot-and-mouth disease in Mafraq" was published by Royanews.tv on 14 Jan 2022. The report includes a picture presenting numerous dead lambs among unaffected adult animals; see at https://royanews.tv/news/267719.

Such events, illuminating the high susceptibility of ovine and caprine offspring to the FMD virus manifested by sudden mortalities that may exceed 50% of the flock's juveniles, are known to occur in several Middle Eastern countries during the winter months (lambing season). Rural practitioners are/should be familiar with such distressing episodes. For a relevant paper from Turkey, see Gulbahar MY, Davis WC, Guvenc T, et al. Myocarditis Associated with Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Type O in Lambs. 2007. Vet Pathol. 44(5): 589-599; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1354/vp.44-5-589.

As of 27 Dec 2021, a total of 4 outbreaks were officially reported from 3 of Jordan's 12 provinces -- Amman, Mafraq, and Irbid -- affecting sheep, goats, and cattle. A follow-up report, including vaccination data, is anticipated. - Mod.AS
