About 70 Peruvian schoolchildren between 10 and 15 years of age began showing symptoms of foodborne illness after eating food provided by a state-run social program in northern Lambayeque province, local media reported. The children were admitted on Monday afternoon, 27 Oct 2014, to several hospitals in the area after they began vomiting after eating bread with tuna and milk with boiled oats provided by the Qali Warma program, RPP Noticias reported.

The La Republica website said that the children are students at state-run schools in the Mochumi and Illimo districts, to which the regional coordinators of the food program were dispatched to assess the situation. The Qali Warma food program has had similar problems in the past, situations that the coordinators attribute to poor handling of the food by the providers, both businesses and individuals.

[The short incubation period with an illness presenting with emesis (vomiting) is likely to be caused by the ingestion of a staphylococcal enterotoxin.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration's Bad Bug Book at http://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/causesofillnessbadbugbook/ucm070015.htm:

"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

"A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning." - Mod.LL
