The Ebola virus is circulating in Central African wildlife, but conditions have perhaps not been met for an epidemic to occur, the director of the Pasteur Institute of Bangui, Emmanuel Nakoune Yandoko, said on Monday [1 Sep 2014]. For years, his institute has conducted research to understand why every year there is an outbreak of Ebola virus in the sub-region but not in the Central African Republic [CAR].

For him, the presence of antibodies in CAR citizens is preventing manifestation of Ebola in the country. "Through this study, we found that 13 per cent of the Pygmies had antibodies against Ebola virus, and 10 per cent of the non-Pygmy population living in the area also had antibodies." To answer the question of whether Ebola virus was circulating in CAR, rats, bats, monkeys and cane rats were captured and tested, and evidence of infection was found in the livers of these animals.

Prime minister Mahamat Kamoun said: "It is time to be alert to this serious outbreak of Ebola rampant in Africa."

[The hypothesis posited is that the immunological experience of CAR inhabitants is preventing outbreaks, even though the virus is circulating. It is possible, but more evidence is needed.

Is 10 per cent seroprevalence high, compared with that in the African countries that are suffering outbreaks? How does the prevalence and infection intensity in wildlife compare in CAR and in countries with epidemics?

The Ebola epidemic is clearly demonstrating the need for integrating disciplines such as epidemiology and disease ecology to be able to comprehend the dynamics of Ebola virus. Much research is needed. Only when a sound understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transmission dynamics of this disease is achieved will we be in a position to properly anticipate and control these devastating outbreaks. - Mod.PMB
