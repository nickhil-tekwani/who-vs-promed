Queensland authorities and affected cattle producers are continuing
negotiations over how to combat an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) which has
affected several stations in the state's north. Between 12 and 15 thousand
head of cattle on 7 properties are believed to be involved, after TB
lesions were detected in a cow after slaughter.
Jane Paterson reporter for the ABC: "Three cattle producers are affected by
the latest TB outbreak in Queensland, one of them rumored to be
Queensland's biggest private cattle operators who bought breeding stock
from the infected property. A meeting of authorities and cattle industry
representatives in Brisbane agreed the outbreak can be eradicated, by
slaughtering breeding cows having come into contact with the infected
beast, and isolating steers in the same category until they too are
slaughtered. What's not agreed is how affected producers will be
compensated. At this stage, the DPI will pick up testing and administration
costs, with property owners being offered full market value for breeding
stock only, that need to be destroyed."

[Queensland is in the process of eradicating TB. However, this is a major
outbreak. This outbreak may delay eradication attempts. Although there is
potentially a plan for compensating the owners, this many animals
represents more than most eradication attempts have in the budget. It will
be interesting to see if they can actually eradicate TB within the goals
previously set. -Mod.TG]
