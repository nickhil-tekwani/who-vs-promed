Infectious salmon anemia, Norway
--------------------------------
Information received on 27 Jun 2013 from Dr Keren Bar-Yaacov, Chief Veterinary Officer, Legislation, Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Brumunddal, Norway

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 26 Jun 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 26 Jun 2013
Report date: 27 Jun 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 27 Jun 2013
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease [see further]
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Infectious salmon anemia virus
Nature of diagnosis: Suspicion, clinical, laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: (2013/5) 11248, Vesteralen, Bo, Nordland [see map]
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Jun 2013
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Water type: Salt water
Population type: Farmed
Production system: Semi-open
Affected animals
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar)/ 3 (scale 0 to 5) / 3 (scale 0 to 5) / 1 236 000 / 3000 / 540 / 0 / 0

Epidemiological comments: From an epidemiological point of view, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) at present considers the infectious salmon anemia (ISA) outbreak in Vesteralen likely to be a 1st occurrence in this geographical area. ISA was already present in Nordland in February and April 2013. However, at that time the disease did not affect the same area in which this notified outbreak has occurred. Therefore the NFSA assumes the currently reported outbreak is not a reoccurrence of ISA disease. The previous occurrences of ISA outbreaks took place in a quite different area within Nordland, the current outbreak occurs at a distance of more than 110 km [about 68 miles] from other ISA-outbreaks. The ISA cases seem to be separate outbreaks without any epidemiological correlation, although the previous occurrences of the disease belong to the same administrative region, Nordland, which is an extensive region. For ISA cases the Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers the genotyping to determine whether these ISA outbreaks are an occurrence or a reoccurrence.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, zoning, tracing forward, tracing back, surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone, official destruction of clinically diseased aquatic animals, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals

[Infectious salmon anemia (ISA), an OIE reportable disease, is an orthomyxovirus infection of sea-farmed Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) that induces a systemic and lethal condition characterized by severe anemia and variable hemorrhages and necrosis in several organs. The disease course is prolonged with low daily mortality (0.05-0.1 per cent), typically only in a few cages, but cumulative mortality may become very high. Initially reported in Norway in the mid-1980s, ISA in Atlantic salmon has since then been reported in Canada (New Brunswick in 1996 and Nova Scotia in 2000), the United Kingdom (Scotland in 1998), the Faroe Islands (2000, reported to OIE), USA (Maine in 2001), and Chile (2002-2007). The virus has been reported from rainbow trout in Ireland in 2002 and from coho salmon in Chile (2004). The above and additional information on ISA are available in chapter 2.3.5 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals 2012 at http://tinyurl.com/ply56g6. - Mod.AS
