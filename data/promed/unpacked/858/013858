Suspected Avian Influenza in the Netherlands
---------------------------------------------
A suspected outbreak of Avian Influenza was reported by the Animal Health
Service to the National Veterinary Inspection Service (RVV) on Fri, 28 Feb
2003, involving 6 layer farms in the Gelder Valley. This area is
characterized by a very dense poultry population. In all 6 affected farms a
high mortality (exceeding 80 percent) among the chickens was observed.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is a list A disease which should
be dealt with according to EU regulation 92/40/EEC. The definite
diagnosis, currently under performance in the national veterinary research
institute in Lelystad, might take up to 14 days. At this stage, HPAI is
strongly suspected. In view of this strong suspicion, the following steps
have been imposed:

a. Stand still: From 1 Mar 2003, 1.30 pm, all movements of live poultry,
hatching eggs, table eggs, used bedding, and poultry litter are forbidden
in the Gelder valley. From 12.00 pm, same date, such movements are
forbidden in the whole country -- outside the Gelder valley -- as well,
excluding table-eggs. Poultry should be kept indoors within the Gelder
valley; this relates to game and pet birds as well.

b. Export ban: The export of live poultry and hatching eggs is prohibited,
with immediate implementation.

At this stage, there is no reason to suspect any public health risk. To be
on the safe side, advice from the Food and Commodities Authority (VWA) has
been sought.

[Obviously, the Dutch authorities have timely taken the prescribed severe
measures to contain this outbreak and prevent its spread. This might be a
complex burden, in view of the location and the regional structure of this
intensive industry. Discovering the disease on 6 farms simultaneously might
indicate earlier contacts with other farms, which should be excluded and
certainly are presently investigated by the authorities.

According to Netherlands' reports to the OIE, HPAI has never been recorded
there in the past. - Mod.AS]
