Three unvaccinated children in a family have lost their lives to measles within a span of just 3 weeks in the Danigarhi village in Unnao.

Thirty-five more children in the same village have developed rashes and are suffering from fever. Out of these, 3 have been hospitalised due to their serious condition.

In view of the outbreak, the district health department has launched a vaccination drive to inoculate kids against measles despite resistance from locals.

A team of doctors has been deployed in the village to look into cases and check the spread of the disease.

Unnao chief medical officer (CMO) Satya Prakash has confirmed the 3 deaths due to measles. He said, "All the minor victims were unvaccinated. We are closely monitoring the situation. Our teams have vaccinated 60 per cent of the children in the village and are treating the ones down with measles."

It has been learned that doctors faced stiff resistance from the villagers during the vaccination drive. The doctors had to call clerics for intervention, and later, necessary announcements were made from the places of worship.

District magistrate Apoorva Dubey also went to the village and spoke at length with the villagers and helped them clear their myths, said a senior health department official.

"The vaccination drive began in the village after intervention from the clerics and officials. However, some people are still not convinced and continue to stall. They are being spoken to regularly," said the CMO.

["In a special drive, the West Bengal Health Department will start the measles-rubella vaccination campaign (MRVC) across the state from 9 Jan [2023].

"Health officials and people associated with the vaccination exercise said that because of the thrust of COVID-19 vaccination, exercises like MRVC had taken a backseat. The target of the exercise is to vaccinate around 1 million children in Kolkata and 2.33 crore [23.3 million] in West Bengal. Children aged between 9 months to 15 years will be covered in the vaccination programme between 9 Jan and 13 Feb [2023]."

"The State Health Department and different agencies like World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and Lions Club International will participate in the campaign, which will provide free vaccines to children through schools."

The City of Tshwane has assured residents that there was currently no measles outbreak in the city, expressing concern about the National Institute for Communicable Diseases' (NICD) recent declaration of a measles outbreak in South Africa.

This follows the reporting of cases in the 5 provinces of Limpopo, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, the Free State, and North West.

Since May last year [2022], 14 laboratory-confirmed cases have been recorded in Pretoria.

By June [2022], 4 cases of measles had been detected in the province, and, according to Health Department spokesperson Foster Mohale, 3 of these cases were from individuals living in Pretoria, while the 4th case was from a person in the West Rand.

He said the 4 had been notified after ultimate confirmation through laboratory testing conducted by the NICD.

The NICD said a total of 169 cases of laboratory-confirmed measles had been reported by 7 Dec [2022] across the 5 provinces. It said laboratory-confirmed measles cases increased in Limpopo and Mpumalanga to 98 and 50 cases, respectively.

"The age of cases across the country ranges from 2 months to 42 years; 44% of cases were in the 5 to 9 years age group and 28% in the 1 to 4 years age group. Of the 169 cases, 125 had an unknown vaccination status, 18 were vaccinated, and 26 were unvaccinated."

Tshwane MMC for Health Gertruida Marx said the city was monitoring measles cases closely by implementing outbreak response teams.

"We are in a state of readiness to manage the situation and mitigate the spread as far as possible. Since 28 Dec [2022] the City of Tshwane has implemented a measles vaccination campaign at all our 24 primary health-care clinics. This is a preventive measure targeting children from the age of 6 months to 15 years, regardless of their vaccination status."

She added that measles was a highly contagious but preventable disease.

Symptoms include fever and a rash, cough, conjunctivitis (red eyes), and coryza (runny nose). Complications of measles can include diarrhoea, dehydration, brain infection (encephalitis), blindness, and death.

Complications are more serious in those who catch measles as young infants (under 2 years of age) and in children who are malnourished.

"In order to minimise the spread of measles, parents and caregivers are encouraged to take a measles vaccination, as it is the best preventive measure. Given the potential seriousness of the disease, it is imperative that childhood vaccinations are kept up to date," said Marx.

["The number of measles cases in South Africa continues to rise as the country is experiencing an outbreak, says the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD).

"An interim situation report published by the NICD on Thursday [5 Jan 2023] shows there was a significant rise in cases between October and December 2022.

"In total, 305 laboratory-confirmed measles cases were reported in South Africa for specimens collected during that period.

These are in Limpopo (131 cases), Mpumalanga (69 cases), the North West (80 cases), Gauteng (14 cases), and the Free State (11 cases).

The report shows children between the ages of one and 9 have been most at risk of contracting measles."
