The Gombe State Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Unit has identified 30 people suspected to have contracted the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) in the state.
Dr Sirajo Abdulkarim, the officer in charge of the programme, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gombe on Wednesday.

Multidrug resistant TB is a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to all TB drugs. [By definition, multidrug resistant TB or MDR-TB is due to strains resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin, not necessarily "all" drugs used to treat TB. - Mod.ML]

Dr Abdulkarim said 5 of the 7 victims with severe infection had died while the remaining 2 were referred to the University of Ibadan Teaching Hospital for treatment. "We have been able to identify suspects -- about 30 of them who were sent to Zaria [a city in Northern Nigeria]; and out [of] them, 7 cases were confirmed with the disease. Because of the efforts and the surveillance system we’ve put in place and the efforts that we made in identifying these suspects, the National Programme supplied us with this machine which can easily detect the disease within 8 minutes. You can make a diagnosis of multidrug resistant TB and any TB that is difficult to diagnose." Abdulkarim said it was the effort made by the programme that led the National TB and Leprosy Control Programe to provide the machine for detecting the disease in Gombe.

According to Abdulkarim, the period for the treatment of the multidrug resistant TB can take as long as 20 months, whereas treatment of other forms of TB takes only 6 months. He, therefore, called on the federal government to establish another centre in the northern part of the country to solve the problem of distance, where the access to treatment was concerned. Abdulkarim said it would be preferable to establish the centre in Gombe since the state already had the diagnosis machines.

NAN reports that Bauchi, Borno, Taraba, Yobe, Jigawa, Nasarawa, and Plateau states have been referring TB patients to the centre in Gombe for diagnosis.

[In the WHO African region (http://www.afro.who.int/en/countries.html), which includes Nigeria, 1.9 per cent of new cases of tuberculosis, and 9.4 per cent of previously treated cases are reportedly multidrug-resistant (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/2/11-092585.pdf). However, national data are lacking for many of the WHO African region countries with a high TB burden, including Nigeria (see figure 1 at http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/2/11-092585.pdf). The lack of data on drug-resistant TB in many African countries is of great concern, especially since the African region accounts for over 80 per cent of the TB cases among people living with HIV infection and since higher mortality from multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has been documented in HIV positive patients.

Conventional diagnosis of drug resistant TB relies on mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing, a slow and cumbersome process. During the prolonged time required for testing, patients may be inappropriately treated and drug-resistant strains may continue to spread in the community. In addition, although routine drug susceptibility testing of all confirmed TB cases should be the goal, there are very few laboratories that can diagnose MDR-TB in developing countries, and only 34 countries and settings have a system in place to routinely test all patients with MDR-TB for 2nd line anti-TB drug resistance.

The availability of a new molecular technology -- that is, Xpert MTB/RIF -- allows in less than 2 hours the detection of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, as well as detection of rifampin resistance, by amplifying DNA present in unprocessed sputum samples with minimal hands-on technical time, even in countries with severely limited laboratory infrastructure (Boehme CC, Neeta P, Hillman D, et al. Rapid molecular detection of tuberculosis and rifampin resistance. N Engl J Med. 2010; 363: 1005-15. Available at: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0907847). Rifampin resistance often indicates MDR-TB. Perhaps the "machine" used to diagnose MDR-TB that is referred to in the news report above is Xpert MTB/RIF. Molecular technologies are expected to contribute substantially to surveillance of drug-resistant TB in low-resource settings in the future (Small PM, Pay M. Tuberculosis diagnosis -- time for a game change. N Engl J Med. 2010; 363: 1070-1. Available at: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1008496).

Gombe State, located in the north eastern part of Nigeria, is one of the country's 36 states, the boundaries of which roughly correspond to those of the Gombe Emirate (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gombe_State). Gombe city is the capital of Gombe State and has an estimated population of 261 536 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gombe, _Nigeria). Ibadan, where 7 Nigerian patients with MDR-TB have been hospitalized, is located in south western Nigeria, 128 km (about 80 miles) inland north east of the coastal city of Lagos.
