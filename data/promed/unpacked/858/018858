The Texas Department of Agriculture has quarantined 32 counties to
prevent the spread of the Asian citrus psyllid, the department
reported last week. The psyllid is capable of transmitting citrus
greening [huanglongbing], a disease in citrus plants, which is not
believed to exist in Texas.

Researchers from the Texas A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical]
University quarantined 32 counties where the psyllids were detected.
Nurseries and other citrus producers and sellers in the quarantined
areas must enter a compliance agreement with TDA [Texas Department of
Agriculture] that requires a treatment plan for all psyllid host
plants prior to selling and exporting to other counties within the
state.

Businesses that ship citrus plants to other states will be required
to contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Texas A&M researchers
have been conducting surveys across the state for the last year
looking for citrus greening. So far, all tests have produced negative
results.

In 2005, citrus greening was detected in Florida and has now spread
to 23 counties there. Once citrus trees are infected with greening,
the fruit yield and quality are greatly reduced, and trees become
susceptible to other health problems.

[Citrus greening or huanglongbing (Chinese for "yellow dragon
disease") is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus. Symptoms
include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small,
irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste.
Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected
trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live
for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. The disease
occurs throughout much of Asia, Africa south of the Sahara and some
parts of South America. It has not been reported from the
Mediterranean region or Australia, where it is a serious quarantine
concern. The causal pathogens are highly fastidious phloem-inhabiting
bacteria, which so far cannot be cultured. Three different species
have been reported: _Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_, _Ca. L.
africanus_ (including a subsp. _capensis_) and _Ca. L. americanus_,
recently described from Brazil.

The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of
the narrow host range of its natural vectors. The Asian citrus
psyllid _Diaphorina citri_ is the vector for both the Asian and the
American strains. The African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_ is the
vector for the African strains. Even the psyllids on their own are a
serious pest of young citrus trees. The pathogens can also be
transmitted by grafting, dodder (a parasitic vine), and possibly by
seed from infected plants and transovarially in the vectors. Disease
management requires an integrated approach including use of clean
planting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector
control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop
reservoirs.

Asian citrus psyllids were discovered in Florida in 1998 and _Ca. L.
asiaticus_ was found there in 2005. In September 2001, the Asian
citrus psyllid was found in Texas. The presence of the
pathogen-specific vector in Texas poses a severely increased risk of
introduction of the disease and has put the local citrus industry on
alert. Strict quarantine of areas with vector activity and ongoing
surveys for disease symptoms are applied in response to the threat.
