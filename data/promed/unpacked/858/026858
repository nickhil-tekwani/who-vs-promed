The OIE reported on Tuesday [5 Jul 2005] that Aujeszky's disease, also
known as pseudo-rabies, had been detected on several pig farms in the
Bolivian department of Chuquisaca. The authorities have declared a
quarantine of the region and instituted movement control of animals and a
vaccination campaign.
The 1st report was on 5 May 2005. According to Ernesto Salas Garcia,
national director of epizootics of the national animal health service
(Servico Nacional de Saude Agropecuaria e Inocuidade Alimenticia da
Bolivia), the outbreak began on 23 Apr 2005, and the focus was in
Chuncusla, Monteagudo township, Hernando Siles province, Chuquisaca
department. This was an intensive rearing pig farm with 3000 animals in
which 158 suckling pigs died in 15 days, but this event was not immediately
notified to the veterinary authorities.
9 out of 19 specimens collected by the farm's veterinarian were positive
for Aujeszky's disease antibodies by the ELISA [enzyme-linked
immuno-sorbent assay] test. The Official Veterinary Service found 28 out of
159 samples positive in the same township.

[This is a disease of the central nervous system, principally of pigs,
caused by an alpha-herpesvirus. - Mod.LJS]
[The OIE indicates that the last report from Bolivia of Aujeszky's disease
in pigs was in 1998 and was detected through serology.
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/sit_pays_mald_pl.asp?c_pays=25&c_mald=21>.
Clinical signs of Aujeszky's disease are similar to those of rabies and
prompted the names mad itch and pseudo-rabies.
The disease is primarily found in swine, the natural host, although it may
also affect cattle, sheep, dogs, cats and goats. Wildlife, such as
opossums, rodents, skunks and raccoons, may, on occasion, be infected.
Human infections are limited.
The disease is most often found in swine, primarily because of the confined
method of raising pigs. The disease is transmitted through fecal-oral
contact or through nose-to-nose contact. Opportunities for such contact may
more easily occur in this type of swine raising.
There is no recommended treatment for this disease. In certain age groups
of swine, vaccination may eliminate the expression of clinical signs. Test
and removal is another method of eliminating the disease from the premises.
