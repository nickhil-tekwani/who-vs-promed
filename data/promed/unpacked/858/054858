_E coli_ confirmed as children hospitalized
----------------------------------------
3 girls have been admitted to hospital with suspected _E. coli_
infection, one of them in a serious condition. Fife NHS Board said 2
babies from West Fife, aged 18 months and 20 months, were thought to
have contracted _E. coli_ O157.
The younger girl is in a serious condition in Glasgow's Yorkhill
Hospital. The source of her infection was unknown, a spokesman said.
The 20-month-old, thought to have caught the infection from the other
baby, is in comfortable condition in Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital.
A third girl from East Fife, aged 9, is the only child confirmed as
having the infection, which she most likely caught during a farm
visit. The spokesman said she was also comfortable in Victoria
Hospital and there was no connection between her case and the other 2
possible cases.
Those who have been in contact with any of the 3 children have been
notified, and Dr. Charles Saunders, consultant in public health
medicine, said he was not aware of anyone else being affected.
"We are working closely with colleagues in environmental health and
others in an attempt to trace possible sources of the infection. In
the meantime anyone with diarrhea, vomiting, or other symptoms that
could be food poisoning should inform their GP surgery and arrange to
send in a sample for testing."

[One case in this report appears to have been associated with a visit
to a farm. The source of the other cases is not stated, nor is the
relationship between the cases. Given the ages of the children, were
they in daycare together? - Mod.LL]
