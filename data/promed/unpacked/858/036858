A trip to a theme park now has 2 guests having to undergo [preventative] treatment for rabies.

The Hampton-Peninsula Health District has alerted guests a rabid fox attacked 2 people at Busch Gardens, Williamsburg [Virginia], WTKR reported.

A boy was bitten on 5 Jul 2021 by the fox and had to have 4 injections of rabies treatment. [Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP - Mod.TG] WTKR reported. He is OK.

A man was also exposed to the fox. The fox was captured and died shortly after, WAVY reported.

Anyone who was exposed to the fox is being told to contact the health department. Exposure can come from either a bite, scratch or coming in contact with the animal's saliva through an open wound or the eyes, nose or mouth. It also applies to a pet coming in contact with the fox.

[2] Nebraska: bat, human exposure

Staff at the Omaha Henry Doorly Zoo are informing recent campout guests they may need medication after a possible exposure to rabies.

It is recommended by the Douglas County Health Department and the Nebraska Department of Health that all guests who were staying at the zoo overnight on 2-3 Jul 2021 and on 29-30 Jun 2021 receive the rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).

The group includes 186 overnight campers, along with a few zoo employees.

The Zoo reports those people have been notified. The Henry Doorly Zoo is also offering those guests refunds for the events and will be covering the expenses of the postexposure prophylaxis.

On Sun 11 Jul 2021, a person reported to a zoo campout leader that she woke up and noticed a wild bat near her head, a press release from the zoo states. She was examined by a Zoo EMT who did not find any bite marks or scratches on the woman. The woman was still advised to contact her doctor to talk about a possible rabies exposure.

The Henry Doorly Zoo reports the bat was wild and not a bat belonging to the Zoo. After an investigation, 7 bats were found inside the aquarium and were euthanized. Of the 7 bats, one tested positive for rabies, while 6 tested negative.

"The health and safety of our visitors, animals and employees is of the utmost importance to us," said Dr. Sarah Woodhouse, Director of Animal Health for Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium. "We want to assure our guests who have visited the Aquarium during the day there is no need to be concerned about the rabid bat. Bats are nocturnal and therefore not active -- or awake -- during the Zoo's normal operating hours."

Dr. Woodhouse says, "The bats we identified were little brown bats (_Myotis lucifugus_), a common bat species in Nebraska anyone could find in their backyard or attic. It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat." No other wild bats have been found in the zoo.

All other campouts at the zoo will be moved to other zoo venues until zoo staff is confident all bats have been removed.

For details about what to do if you find a wild bat, you can contact the Nebraska Humane Society.

A 7-year-old boy was badly bitten by a dog at the Huron River Mobile Home Park [South Rockwood, Michigan] and is now being treated for a possible rabies exposure. B is a strong boy with a long road ahead of him as he recovers from the dog attack. The dog wasn't captured, leaving the family unable to find its vet records.

B said he's still sore and in pain from the attack.

"I heard him screaming and I saw his face was red and I started screaming help," recalled his sister, AZ.

His sisters, ZZ and AZ, saw the violent attack Friday afternoon [17 Jul 2021]. It's believed a long haired black and brown German Shepherd attacked the boy, biting the inside of his thigh before taking off.

"I was coming to help him but I was terrified and trying and run," AZ said.

Their mother, SZ was at work at the time. She said they were walking to a friend's house to play when it happened. His mother had to witness B's recovery and since the dog is still on the loose, B has to get a multitude of painful shots to make sure he doesn't catch rabies.

"They all had to go into muscle and as you can see, he doesn't have too much," SZ said. "They were limited in where they could give him the shots." It took 4 nurses and 2 doctors to make sure B received his injections Saturday [17 Jul 2021].

His mother is just thankful her son is still alive and on the fast track to overcoming the injury. One thing is certain -- playtime will never be the same for the family or the community.

"This is a small park. Everybody knows everybody and now I get panic attacks if I can't hear them," SZ said.

B has 3 more shots to go, but he's more concerned about the dog coming back. If you see the animal, do not approach it. Call 911 and authorities will get in contact with animal control.

A bat that was in a Brooklawn home has tested positive for rabies, the city said in a release on Wednesday [14 Jul 2021].

City animal control is advising residents to be careful "when coming in contact with stray and wild animals," and not to approach animals they think could be rabid, the release said. Residents should also watch out for behavior from animals that's out of the norm, including bat sightings during the daytime, "excessive drooling or foaming at the mouth" and aggressive behavior, the city's release said.

The city asked residents to call animal control if they see a bat at home, and report unusual animal behavior to the office by calling 203-576-7671.

[5] South Carolina: fox, human exposure

Retired Administrative Law Judge JDM was attacked by a grey fox on North Congress St. in Winnsboro on Tuesday [13 Jul 2021], about 6:15 a.m.

JDM, who lives on Evans Street, reported he was just beginning his morning walk when he was attacked from behind by the fox. "Just as I passed the driveway of one of the houses on N. Congress Street, the fox bit the heel of the shoe on my right foot. I never saw him until he bit me. The attack threw me off balance, and I fell on the ground," JDM said.

"I was trying to get free from the fox's bite, kicking at him and struggling to get away when a passerby in a pickup truck saw what was happening and came to my aid," McLeod said. "That scared the fox and he ran off back into the yard where he had come from."

JDM said someone called the Winnsboro Department of Public Safety (WDPS). He said after an initial examination of his foot on the scene by emergency medical personnel, it appeared there was no wound. However, after McLeod returned home, he was concerned and went to the Fairfield Providence emergency room.

"They found a small puncture on my right ankle," McLeod said, "so I've had to start the series of rabies vaccine as a precaution."

Later on Tuesday [13 Jul 2021], after the fox was again sighted in the same yard, WDPS officers returned to the yard, according to officers. A report from WDPS stated the officers found the fox and it charged twice at officers. After it was shot once, it came at an officer again. It was killed with a 2nd shot, according to the incident report.

The fox's body was taken to the Fairfield County Animal Shelter and turned over to DHEC. A necropsy is being performed on the fox to determine whether it is rabid. Results could be back a soon as Thursday, 15 Jul 2021, according to a shelter official.

More information will be posted as it becomes available.

[6] Texas: cattle, alert

Picture this: You're traipsing through a sprawling Texas field and a 2,000-pound cow suddenly approaches. It's salivating a ton and could even appear to be choking. Stumbling toward you, it bellows fiercely.

Not to be alarmist, friends, but the animal may have rabies. According to a news release from Pet Talk, a service of the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University (TAMU), rabies has spiked among Texas cattle in 2021. This year [2021], cases have already exceeded those from 2020, which in turn had reported double the number of infections recorded in 2019.

[Always be on alert for strange acting animals. It does not matter if you are in a fancy neighborhood, or a sparse part of town or driving through the country side and stop to take a selfie. The possibility of an animal with rabies to investigate you is always present. And yes, that curious creature may be a cow or a bull. Our livestock animals are susceptible to rabies, just as we are.

If you are bitten, wash the wound thoroughly with soap and copious amounts of water. Then seek medical care. When dealing with large animals such as horses or cattle, the difference in our sizes vs theirs can cause much damage to our comparatively smaller bodies. They can be dangerous.

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs providing medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities." https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html. - Mod.TG
