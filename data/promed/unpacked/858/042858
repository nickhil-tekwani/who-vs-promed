So far this 2003/4 wet season, 15 cases of melioidosis have presented to
the Royal Darwin Hospital, the referral center for the endemic Top End
region of the Northern Territory. Previously the epidemiology of
melioidosis was reviewed using notifiable diseases data (1).
In that report, it was noted that a cluster of cases occurred after heavy
rainfall in Queensland. The association between rainfall and cases is also
well-described, with a shift in the presentation of disease to pneumonia
and more severe disease after heavy rain (2). Clustering has also been
noted after other severe weather events such as the Katherine floods in Jan
1998 and heavy rainfall after tropical cyclone Thelma in Dec 1998
(manuscript in preparation).
It is unlikely that melioidosis was introduced by returning Australian
soldiers following WW2 as stated. There is extensive molecular diversity of
isolates throughout northern Australia, including many isolated coastal
islands with little external contact (3).
Introduction of melioidosis is believed to have occurred to areas outside
the endemic area such as a focus in southwest West Australia, where
clinical isolates over 25 years were clonal on ribotyping (4).
