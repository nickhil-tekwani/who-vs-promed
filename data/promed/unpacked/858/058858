New disease threat to sweet chestnut trees found in orchards
------------------------------------------------------------
The Forestry Commission and The Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) are working to eradicate outbreaks of a serious new disease affecting sweet chestnut trees in southern and central England.

Chestnut blight, caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_, has been confirmed in 2 small orchards of European sweet chestnut (_Castanea sativa_) sourced from the same nursery in France. The sites in Warwickshire and East Sussex are the 1st findings in Britain, although the disease has spread throughout much of Europe since it was first discovered in Italy in the 1930s.

Dr John Morgan, Forestry Commission, said, "It is very disappointing to discover this disease has been introduced into England. It represents a serious threat to our sweet chestnuts, so we are taking steps to eradicate it before it spreads into woodland trees or other plantations. We are investigating the source of the outbreaks and will follow up other importations of sweet chestnut trees. Surveys are being carried out in nearby sweet chestnuts for the disease."

Martin Ward, Fera, said, "This is a significant finding, the first of its type in the UK. We are working with authorities in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland to follow up plants which have arrived from the supplying nursery in France, and we are liaising with our counterparts in France to investigate this situation. We will be considering whether any changes to the EU requirements on this disease are necessary."

The UK companies which received the French plants and the growers of the affected trees are co-operating with the authorities. Where infection is suspected or has been confirmed, Plant Health Notices are served requiring uprooting of the trees and burning on site in the effort to eradicate the disease.

[Chestnut blight is caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_. It affects chestnut (_Castanea_ spp.) and some other tree genera (for example oaks, maples, and eucalypts), but susceptibility varies between species. Most susceptible are the European chestnut (_C. sativa_), which is most often used for commercial chestnut crops, and the American chestnut (_C. dentata_). In the late 1800s, the disease spread from the Far East, where native species show very low susceptibility, to North America, where it caused massive extinctions. In the 1930s, it spread to Europe and recently it was also detected for the 1st time in Australia (ProMED-mail post 20100915.3350).

Virulent and hypovirulent forms of the pathogen exist. Virulent strains induce variable symptoms, which may include necrosis and cracking of the bark (cankers), orange to beige fungal growth, distortion of bark due to the destruction of the underlying tissues, yellowing of leaves, wilting of shoots, and dieback of branches. Symptoms progress quickly, and death of the tree occurs due to girdling by cankers.

Hypovirulent strains cause mild and/or transient symptoms which do not normally kill the host. The fungus enters through wounds and survives as a non-lethal parasite on a number of tree species. It is spread mainly by infected plant and other materials, mechanical means (including insect activity, cutting tools and machinery, birds over long distances), wind, and splashing rain.

Hypovirulence is due to infection of the fungus by _Cryphonectria hypovirus 1-EP713_ (CHV1-EP713; type species of genus _Hypovirus_). The virus can be transmitted through hyphal anastomosis converting the recipient strain to the hypovirulent phenotype. However, transmission is limited by a vegetative incompatibility system in the fungus. In continental Europe, the disease has lost its severity due to the natural spread of the hypovirus, which has enabled re-growth of chestnuts in many affected regions. Hypovirulence provides the basis for disease management, and research is in progress on virus diversity, dispersal and the establishment of hypovirulence.

Since the disease was apparently introduced into the UK with legal plant imports, reassessment of national plant quarantine guidelines and procedures, as suggested above, seem indeed warranted. Although the reported outbreaks appear to be localised, once a plant pathogen has been introduced into a new area eradication is very difficult and rarely successful.
