An Egyptian woman died of bird flu on Monday [30 Oct 2006], bringing
the total number of human deaths in Egypt to 7, the state news agency
MENA announced. The victim was a woman from the Nile Delta town of
Samanoud who had slaughtered and handled domestic poultry, it said.
It was the first human death in Egypt from the virus infection since
May [2006].
The 39-year-old woman had been admitted to hospital with a high
temperature and respiratory trouble on 4 Oct 2006. She moved to a
specialist hospital in Cairo on 12 Oct and was receiving Tamiflu, the
standard treatment for the deadly virus, MENA said. It said people
with whom she was in contact have tested negative for the H5N1 virus,
which first appeared in Egypt in February [2006] and caused great
damage to the poultry industry.

With 15 infections, Egypt has had the largest cluster [i.e. number;
the cases are not linked by place of residence or by relationship -
Mod.CP] of human bird flu cases outside Asia, and the latest case
came a month after authorities found a cluster of new cases in birds
following a 2-month lull in detected poultry cases. The initial bird
flu outbreak caused panic in Egypt, where poultry is a major source
of protein and where poor families frequently breed chicken
domestically in cities and rural areas to supplement their diet and income.
MENA said the deceased woman had raised a flock of 11 ducks from her
home north of the Egyptian capital. Two became sick and died, and she
then slaughtered the rest before she was hospitalized.
Egypt's commercial poultry industry has started to recover from the
disease and the vast majority of commercial flocks have been
vaccinated, but only about 20 percent of domestic birds had received
vaccines, officials say.
