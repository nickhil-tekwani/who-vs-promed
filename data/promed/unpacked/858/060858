A pregnant Indonesian woman from Sumatra island has died of bird flu,
increasing the country's human death toll from the disease to 76,
health officials said. Two tests had confirmed the 26-year-old woman,
who died on Saturday [12 May 2007] evening in Medan, had the H5N1
bird flu virus, Runizar Ruesin, head of the health ministry's bird
flu centre, said by telephone on Monday [14 May 2007].
The woman had been suffering from fever and respiratory problems when
she was hospitalized on 8 May 2007. Surya Dharma of the North Sumatra
health agency said on Sunday [13 May 2007] that the woman, who was 4
months pregnant, had been in contact with dead fowl.
Three out of the 5 chickens her family had and 2 pigeons died
suddenly 2 weeks ago, said the official. The family burned the dead
birds but ate the remaining chickens. "The family slaughtered the
rest of the chickens, cooked and ate them," Dharma said by telephone,
adding that a team had been sent to investigate whether anyone else
in the family could have been infected.

As previously reported, one week before she died, several chickens in
the house had died. The several remaining living chickens were
slaughtered and eaten by the family. The family had also invited the
local priest to the meal.
When the victim became unwell, she was initially looked after at home
by the village midwife. After 6 days at home, on Mon 7 May 2007, she
was taken to Haji Hospital in Medan, and on 10 May 2007 was
transferred to the Adam Malik Hospital with suspected avian
influenza. The Adam Malik Hospital is the major avian influenza
referral hospital for northern Sumatra and is one of the 44
designated avian influenza referral hospitals in the country.
The head of the Avian Influenza management team at the Adam Malik
Hospital, Prof. Luhur Soeroso, was worried that new cases would
present. This case appears to be very similar to those which occurred
in May last year [2006] in Karo, North Sumatra, where 7 out of 8
family members died from avian influenza after eating chicken meat
that was likely contaminated with avian influenza virus.
He commented on the "less than optimal handling" of this latest
incident, saying that he would take the matter up with the hospital director.
The death of this woman adds to the long list of deaths in Indonesia
from avian influenza. The official health department government
figures cite 75 previous deaths to avian influenza, this latest one
bringing the total to 76.
