Abstract
--------
We detected infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b in 2 red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) cubs found in the wild with neurologic signs in the Netherlands. The virus is related to avian influenza viruses found in wild birds in the same area.

[From 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses have caused outbreaks across the Eurasian region, affecting both poultry and wild birds, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8.

Regarding infection of these viruses in mammals, recently, HPAI H5N8 infections were reported in humans in Russia (see ProMED post 20210221.8204014).

Several subtypes of AI viruses (H7N7, H4N5, H4N6, H3N3, and H10N7) have caused epidemics in harbour seals and gray seals, but they do not appear to become established in these carnivore species. Regarding terrestrial carnivores, red foxes have been shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1, and there was recent documentation of a spill-over of HPAI H5N8 to wild carnivores. Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB
