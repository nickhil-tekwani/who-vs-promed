The yellow fever epidemic in Angola, which has led to 369 deaths since December [2015], is decreasing; 6 weeks ago the confirmation of new cases stopped.

The latest report of the World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that there were more than 70 suspected cases of the disease in the last week of July 2016, half of those recorded in the previous period.

Until 28 Jul [2016], 3818 suspected cases of the disease were recorded, out of which 879 were confirmed; 119 deaths were recorded, according to the source.

An additional vaccination campaign of more than 17 million people is expected before the start of the rainy season.

At least 42 countries are endemic for yellow fever and face epidemics regularly.

The transmission of the disease in 2016 [in Angola] was labeled as explosive, depleting the stock of vaccines.

Such an increase is probably due to the severity of the weather phenomenon El Niño, which led to a higher density of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, which transmits the disease. More than 16 million people of Angola and the DRC have been vaccinated against yellow fever since February [2016].

To manage the availability of vaccines, WHO reports that it will be giving 1/5th of the normal dose of the vaccine to the 8.5 million people in Kinshasa (DRC's capital) still waiting for it. Research shows that this emergency dose will be enough to provide effective immunity against infection for at least 12 months, the organisation states.

Yellow fever [YF] is a viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and causes fever, muscle aches, loss of appetite, vomiting and nausea and can lead to death.

[This report is somewhat confusing. It states that the last cases were confirmed 6 weeks ago, but there were 70 suspected cases reported the last week of July 2016. If some of these 70 cases are confirmed, it indicates that there is some YF virus transmission continuing, although incidence is clearly declining. One hopes that vigorous surveillance with laboratory support continues.

The National Vaccination Program, Ministry of Health, in the Democratic Republic of Congo completed a reactive vaccination campaign against yellow fever in Kisenso health zone from 21-27 Jul 2016.

The population in Kisenso health zone was 486 600. The Kisenso health zone was divided into 17 health areas. In each health area, there were 8-13 vaccination sites depending on the population needed to cover. The total number of vaccination sites in Kisenso health zone was 156. The vaccination dose was full (0.5ml) for anyone except pregnant women and children less than 9 months who did not have indication of the yellow fever vaccination.

The vaccination coverage reached 103.5 per cent by 27 Jul [2016]. The local government has decided to continue the campaign for all vaccination sites in one health area where the vaccination coverage was relatively low (65.8 per cent as of 27 Jul [2016]) and one vaccination site in all the other 16 health areas on 28 Jul [2016]. Some people came to get vaccination from neighboring districts so that the coverage rate based on the population became over 100 per cent.

The mass vaccination campaign for the entire population in Kinshasa province, about 10 million people, will be implemented from 18-27 Aug [2016] with minimal dose (0.1ml) for people aged over 2 years and full dose (0.5ml) for children aged from 9 months to 2 years. The vaccinations required are expected to arrive at Kinshasa on 10 Aug [2016]. The syringes of 0.1ml have already arrived at Kinshasa on 1 Aug [2016].

The reactive vaccination campaign provides lessons learned for massive vaccination of yellow fever. The following 3 points were suggested by the Japan Disaster Relief Infectious Diseases Response Team: 1) implementing an effective communication strategy on mass vaccination through the media and public advertisement before and during the campaign, 2) determining a detail logistics plan and ensuring resources before the campaign for procuring the necessary consumables and conducting supervisory visits for the vaccination sites during the campaign, and 3) monitoring serious adverse events of the vaccination, which are rare, but a certain number of people may need medical interventions.

The Ministry of Health has taken an initiative for yellow fever outbreaks with the coordination of 6 commissions: surveillance, treatment, vaccination, logistics, communication, and vector control.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Koji Wada for forwarding this report.

It is good to learn that the syringes are already in the country. One hopes that the vaccine arrives on 10 Aug 2016 as expected so that this very ambitious campaign to vaccinate approximately 10 million people in 10 days can be initiated on time. Communication with the public ahead of the start of the campaign will be critical to insure cooperation and understanding by the populace. It would be ideal if a follow up study could be done in a large segment of the population to confirm whether the 1/5th fractionated dose is as effective as previous studies have indicated. However, given the challenge of mounting this massive campaign, such a study may not be feasible. - Mod.TY
