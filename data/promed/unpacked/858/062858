Poliovirus in Cameroon -- update -- 17 Mar 2014
-----------------------------------------------
In Cameroon, 3 additional wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported with onset of paralysis on [6, 25, and 31 Jan 2014] from 3 new regions (North West, Adamaoua, and Centre) confirming continued WPV transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of 4 cases in October 2013. In total, 7 WPV1 cases have now been reported from West, North West, Centre and Adamaoua Regions, with onset of paralysis ranging from [1 Oct 2013 to 31 Jan 2014]. Genetic sequencing of WPV1 isolates suggests prolonged undetected circulation of poliovirus. Due to continued poliovirus circulation in Cameroon, gaps in surveillance, and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic, WHO is elevating the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high.

Following confirmation of the outbreak in October 2013, Cameroon conducted 3 nationwide immunization campaigns, with a 4th nationwide activity starting on [9 Mar 2014]. Even though independent monitoring suggests some improvements, serious gaps in quality remain (both in implementation and monitoring) which must be urgently addressed. Quality varies greatly by region. The main reason for non-vaccination of children is that houses had not been visited (43 percent of non-vaccinated children). Analysis of overall population immunity (non-polio acute flaccid paralysis data 6-59 months) suggests upwards of 40 percent of children remain under-immunized (with 30 percent having received zero doses of oral polio vaccine -- OPV). The continuation and expanding spread of transmission indicates serious gaps in quality of outbreak response.

The confirmation of new cases has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity in April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.

It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health (http://who.int/ith/chapters/en/) recommends that all travelers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

A new case of wild poliovirus was confirmed in Warder woreda [district], Dollo zone (Somali region) with a [5 Jan 2014] date of onset. A joint investigation team is conducting an investigation into the 10th case [there were 9 confirmed cases of WPV1 in Ethiopia in 2013, so this case is the 10th associated with the ongoing outbreak in the Horn of Africa. - Mod.MPP], a 25-month-old male who reportedly received 7 oral polio vaccine doses. An additional round of the supplementary immunization activity (SIA), targeting more than 4 million children under 15 in Somali region and other high-risk areas, was planned for [14-17 Mar 2014].

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- In Cameroon, 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases are reported this week, from 2014. The new cases confirm continued transmission of this strain and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of 4 cases in October [2013].

Afghanistan
- No new WPV1s were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 is 14, and 3 for 2014. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [31 Jan 2014] from Kunar province, Eastern Region.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Mop-ups are being conducted this week in selected high-risk districts in the south, east and north of the country, with nationwide activities planned for late March [2014], using trivalent OPV.

Nigeria
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 is one, and for 2013 is 53. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [1 Feb 2014], from Kano.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent cVDPV case had onset of paralysis on [24 Dec 2014] (from Maiduguri, Borno), linked to previous transmission in Chad from 2013.
- Analysis of recent Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) indicates overall quality continues to improve, including in highest-risk areas. According to Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS), almost 90 percent of Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the 11 high-risk states achieved coverage of at least 80 percent during last week's conducted IPDs. This compares to less than 65 percent of LGAs in these same states achieving the same level of coverage just 12 months ago.
- The next IPDs are planned for April, using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV.

Pakistan
- Three new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, all from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA -- 2 from North Waziristan and 1 from South Waziristan). The total number of cases for 2014 is now 27. The total number of cases for 2013 remains 93. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [15 Feb 2014] (one of the 2 WPV1s reported this week from North Waziristan).
- No new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 is 45, and 4 for 2014. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [27 Jan 2014] (from FR Bannu).
- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in the world (both wild and cVDPV2). Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in all areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- The densely populated Peshawar valley is considered to be the main 'engine' of poliovirus transmission, alongside North Waziristan, due to large-scale population movements through Peshawar from across this region, and into other areas of Pakistan. The quality of operations must be urgently improved in Peshawar, and immunizations resumed in North Waziristan.

Central Africa
- In Cameroon, 2 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week [see above report in [1] announcing a 3rd case], with onset of paralysis on [6 and 25 Jan 2014], confirming continued WPV1 transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of 4 cases in October [2013] [see prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis update (24): Syria susp, Cameroon, global 20131024.2019404 for details on these cases. - Mod.MPP].
- Genetic sequencing suggests prolonged undetected circulation.
- Since confirmation of the outbreak in October [2013], 3 nationwide campaigns have been conducted, and a 4th is currently underway. However, quality varies greatly by region, and serious gaps remain. As many as 40 percent of children remain under-immunized (with 30 percent having received zero doses).
- The confirmation of new cases has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity in April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- NIDs with trivalent OPV were held in Chad from [28 Feb 2014] to [2 Mar 2014] with trivalent OPV, and the next nationwide campaigns are planned for late March [2014], using bivalent OPV.
- In CAR, additional campaigns are currently being planned, in response to the high risk of international spread of polio from Cameroon.

Horn of Africa
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is 217 (194 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 9 from Ethiopia [see report above in [2] announcing a newly confirmed case in Ethiopia]). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2013] (from Bari, Somalia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. Recommendations from the recently held Horn of Africa Technical Advisory Group (TAG) are now actively being incorporated into outbreak response planning. The TAG had underscored that the initial response to the outbreak was appropriate, however expressed grave concern that gaps in SIA quality and surveillance remained in key infected areas of the region.
- In particular, the TAG expressed concern at critical quality gaps in implementation in key areas of Ethiopia. The group recommended that infected countries should focus efforts on high-risk and infected areas, by conducting high-quality SIAs no more than 4 weeks apart.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance in Israel since [3 Feb 2013] and continue to be detected in 2014 (17 positive samples collected this year, the most recent of which was collected on [16 Feb 2014]; in 2013, 169 positive samples were collected).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national routine immunization schedule.
- Positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip, the most recent positive sample were collected during the week of [5 Jan 2014].
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2014] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of laboratory-confirmed WPV1 cases is 25. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [17 Dec 2013] and was reported from Mara, Edleb governorate [Syria].
- Additionally, there are 13 cases confirmed from contested areas but not yet reflected in official figures.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.
- The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation.

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- National campaigns were conducted in West Africa [22-25 Nov 2013]. Further national campaigns are planned for April and May [2014] (multi-country).

[According to the above reports, there continues to be WPV transmission in non-endemic, recent outbreak associated areas with the confirmation of 3 new cases in Cameroon and one new case in Ethiopia. Unfortunately, the case in Ethiopia has a reported history of having received 7 doses of polio vaccine prior to onset of illness. The questions that arise here are whether there was immunization failure due to recipient factors (such as concurrent infections with other GI viral organisms), or whether there was vaccine failure due to poor management of cold chain.

In the prior polio update on ProMED-mail (Poliomyelitis - update (03): Lebanon ex Syria, susp, global, RFI 20140312.2328674) there were reports of a suspected case of polio in a refugee camp in Lebanon. To date, there is no further information available. Of note is that the MOH of Lebanon launched a week-long nationwide polio vaccination campaign on 10 Mar 2014 "to vaccinate all children in Lebanon, the Lebanese and non-Lebanese children of refugees and displaced people, aged between 1 and 5 years, regardless of vaccination history of previous doses" (machine translation of MOH media page, http://www.moph.gov.lb/Media/Pages/Polio2014.aspx). This campaign is part of the increased efforts with WHO and UNICEF assistance to raise immunization levels in the region in response to the WPV outbreak in Syria.

A surrogate indicator of high risk for wild poliovirus transmission is the documentation of cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) in a country, as it is an indicator of pockets of susceptibles/un- or under-immunized. To date in 2014 there have been 4 confirmed cVDPV associated polio cases, all in Pakistan, with the most recent date of onset of illness 27 Jan 2014. In 2013, there were a total of 62 cVDPV2 and 1 cVDPV3 cases. The majority (45) were in Pakistan, 4 cases each in Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad, 3 cases in Afghanistan, and 1 case each in Niger, Somalia and Yemen (the 1 case of cVDPV3 was in Yemen). All countries recognized as having current WPV circulation or at high risk of WPV circulation if introduced into the country.
