Scarlet fever remains a concern for doctors after a sharp rise across the country during 2015 -- and health officials have warned that we're not at the peak of infections yet. Since [13 Dec 2015], there have been 22 reports of scarlet fever cases in Lincolnshire [in the past 4 weeks], with 10 reported on week ending [13 Dec 2015], 5 cases on week ending [20 Dec 2015], and 7 cases during the week ending [27 Dec 2015].

Nationally, scarlet fever cases have risen dramatically, up from 4643 cases in 2013 to 15 637 in 2014 and 17 637 in 2015.

Scarlet fever was often deadly in the Victorian era but became milder in the late 20th century. Symptoms include a sore throat, headache, and fever accompanied by a distinctive rash on the chest or stomach.

[The scarlet fever outbreak that occurred throughout England in 2014 and 2015 was worse than at any time in the past 50 years (http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/fastest-rise-in-scarlet-fever-cases-for-half-a-century-10045621.html).
