4 people are undergoing rabies treatment after being exposed to a dog that tested positive for the disease. Health officials say the dog bit 2 people and exposed 2 others before it was euthanized. Test results later showed the dog was rabid.

The Department of Health and Environmental Control says the dog was given to an adoption agency in the Irmo area by animal control. The dog was from the Monticello Road area and had signs of healed wounds around its neck. The dog was later placed in foster care in the Gaston area. Other animals that were in contact with the dog have received rabies boosters and placed into quarantine.

DHEC officials say if your pet is bitten, scratched, or licked by a wild or stray animal that it is important to get your pet to a vet immediately. "Time is of the essence," said DHEC's Sandra Craig Craig in a news release. "A beloved pet might be saved if treated properly and in a timely manner. This is also important in order to protect the people who come in contact with your pet."

[If you go to the SC DHEC data pages on rabies http://www.scdhec.gov/Health/DiseasesandConditions/InfectiousDiseases/InsectAnimalBorne/Rabies/DataReportsonRabies/ there is a different cast on this problem:

2014 Laboratory confirmed animal cases 139, 2 in dogs, 12 in cats;
2013 [ditto] 123, 2 dogs, 6 cats;
2012 [ditto] 137, 0 dogs, 4 cats;
2011 [ditto] 107, 1 dog, 5 cats;
2010 [ditto] 106, 4 dogs, 3 cats.

The commonest wildlife species affected is raccoons, followed by skunks & foxes, and bats, though I suspect that the latter numbers depend very much on how enthusiastic they are to check bats. Domestic dog & cat vaccination works very successfully in preventing human exposure. Very cost effective.

Lexington County is in central South Carolina, to the immediate west of the state capital, Columbia; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/south_carolina_90.jpg - Mod.MHJ
