The 1st human cowpox virus infection in the United States has been
documented in an unvaccinated laboratory researcher, according to a
report by investigators from the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.

The findings were reported by Andrea McCollum, MPH, an epidemiologist
from the Mycotic Diseases Branch of the CDC at the IMED 2011:
International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance.

"Current recommendations by the CDC's Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices include vaccination of laboratory workers who
handle cultures or animals infected with non-highly attenuated
orthopoxviruses that infect humans, including cowpox virus," Dr.
McCollum told Medscape Medical News at the conference. "This patient
was offered a vaccination but declined ... because the patient was
not intentionally conducting work with an orthopoxvirus."

According to Dr. McCollum and colleagues, cowpox infections occur
rarely, even in Eurasia where the virus is endemic. "Laboratory
exposures to vaccinia virus have been documented, but, to date, there
have been no reports of accidental laboratory-acquired cowpox
infections," the authors note.

The unvaccinated lab worker became infected in July 2010 while
working with a nonhuman pathogenic poxvirus and developed a
suspicious, painful, ulcerated lesion on a finger that lasted
approximately 3 months. In October 2010, biopsy specimens of the
suspected orthopoxvirus were submitted to the CDC for testing.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction assays on the biopsy tissue
showed positivity for a non-variola orthopoxvirus and cowpox DNA and
negativity for vaccinia virus. "Further sequencing identified the
strain as cowpox Brighton," Dr. McCollum and colleagues note. "The
investigation revealed cowpox virus stocks in the laboratory's
freezer but no known or intentional use of cowpox in the patient's
laboratory in the previous 5 years," they add.

Sequencing of an isolate from the laboratory worker revealed a
recombinant region consistent with recombinant cowpox strains stored
in the freezer. In addition, cowpox was detected in multiple viral
stocks and 2 viral lines, including the viral stocks used by the
patient prior to the onset of illness. Orthopoxvirus DNA was also
found in environmental swabs of several surfaces in the laboratory
and a freezer room, although no live virus was recovered from the swabs.

According to Dr. McCollum, the patient described noticing a small cut
at the site of the lesion a few days before lesion onset. "The
patient had no recollection of an accidental needle stick," she said.
"Evidence suggests that the patient was likely infected by handling
laboratory reagents or environmental surfaces that were contaminated
with cowpox virus."

Dr. McCollum said that orthopoxvirus infections can be severe,
particularly in individuals with a risk factor for severe
complications, including those with an immuno-compromising condition,
eczema, or other similar skin conditions, and pregnant women. "Cowpox
infections are transmissible by contact with lesions or matter from
lesion exudates, and lesions are considered capable of producing
infectious virus until a scab falls off and a fresh layer of skin
forms," she said. "Prompt recognition, diagnosis, and reporting of
orthopoxvirus infections to appropriate public health agencies can
help reinforce appropriate infection control practices."

Independent commentator Prof. Hermann Meyer, from the Institut fur
Mikrobiologie der Bundeswehr in Munich, Germany noted that infection
with cowpox virus from an injury is relatively common. There have
been several cases in Europe of human cowpox cases in people who have
had close contact with pet cats or rats, luckily without dire
consequences. However, Dr. Meyer points out that upon infection with
a genetically modified virus, it is unclear whether a foreign gene
will be expressed and whether it might lead to unexpected clinical
signs; fortunately, that was obviously not the case with this
patient. It is important to "stick to good laboratory practice rules:
wear protective gloves; frequently disinfect hands and surfaces; and
avoid working directly with these agents if you are pregnant,
immuno-compromised, diabetic, etc."

[Cowpox virus is a misnomer. Cowpox virus is not normally present in
cows. The natural hosts are probably rodents, but it has been
isolated from a variety of animals, including domestic and wild
felines and canines, elephants and humans. Human infections have
usually been traced to handling of cowpox-infected animals, or, as in
this case, gross environmental contamination. Infections in humans
are usually benign, isolated lesions which slowly resolve without
deleterious consequences. Cowpox virus isolates exhibit unusual
genetic diversity. - Mod.CP]
