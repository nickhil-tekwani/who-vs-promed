Woman dies of haemorrhagic Congo fever in Oman
----------------------------------------------
Muscat: An expatriate woman has died of haemorrhagic Congo fever [Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus infection] at Al Buraimi Hospital, according to an official at the Ministry of Health. The Oman News Agency, quoting an unnamed ministry official, reported that the woman was admitted to the government hospital in Buraimi last Wednesday [18 Jan 2012]. "All necessary procedures were followed in such cases of communicable diseases, but the woman died in the midnight due to her late arrival at the hospital," the health ministry official said.

The pathogenic virus, especially common in East and West Africa, is a widespread tickborne viral disease, a zoonosis of domestic animals and wild animals that may affect humans, with a mortality rate of almost 30 per cent.

The Health Ministry official said that epidemic detection teams in the country continue to take precautions and are liaising with the departments concerned such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Regional Municipalities and Water Resources to get to the root of the cause of disease. The official, who stressed that the viral fever was not widespread, urged the public not to panic and spread false information through social media without authentic information.

[A similar report from the Oman Observer was forwarded also by Shamsudeen Fagbo <oloungbo@yahoo.com>. No additional information regarding the the circumstances of the infection of the expatriate woman, or the exact location, are revealed. The meaning of the victim's designation as expatriate is uncertain, and it may be that the infection was not contracted in Oman.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever caused by a bunyavirus virus classified in the genus _Nairovirus_. All members of the genus _Nairovirus_ are transmitted by argasid or ixodid ticks, but only 3 have been implicated as causes of human disease: the Dugbe and Nairobi sheep viruses, and CCHF, which is the most important human pathogen among them. Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans do occur. The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia. CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high mortality rate. Fortunately, human illness occurs infrequently, although animal infection may be more common.

The geographical distribution of the virus, like that of its tick vector (members of the genus _Hyalomma_). is widespread. Healthcare workers in endemic areas should be aware of the illness and the correct infection control procedures to protect themselves and their patients from the risk of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection.

CCHF virus may infect a wide range of domestic and wild animals. Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas. Animals become infected with CCHF virus from the bite of infected ticks. However, the most important source for acquisition of the virus by ticks is believed to be infected small vertebrates on which immature _Hyalomma_ ticks feed. Once infected, the tick remains infected through its developmental stages, and the mature tick may transmit the infection to large vertebrates, such as livestock. Domestic ruminant animals, such as cattle, sheep and goats, become viraemic for around one week after becoming infected.

Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire the virus from direct contact with blood or other infected tissues from infected livestock, or they may become infected from a tick bite. The majority of cases have occurred in those involved with the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. The length of the incubation period for the illness appears to depend on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection via tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a maximum of 13 days.

Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia (aching muscles), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia. There may be nausea, vomiting and sore throat early on, which may be accompanied by diarrhoea and generalised abdominal pain. Over the next few days, the patient may experience sharp mood swings, and may become confused and aggressive. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the right upper quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly and haemorrhagic phenomena. The mortality rate from CCHF is about 30 per cent, with death occurring in the second week of illness.

Health care workers who have had contact with tissue or blood from patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF should be followed up with daily temperature and symptom monitoring for at least 14 days after the putative exposure.
