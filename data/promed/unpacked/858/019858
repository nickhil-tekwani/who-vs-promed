A veterinary practice has warned dog owners and walkers after 2 dogs were found to have the flesh-eating disease Alabama Rot.

Bellevue Veterinary Clinic says it has been treating 2 dogs for the condition, symptoms of which include lesions and sores across the dog's body.

It's thought the dogs picked up the disease after walking in woods near Gare Hill on the outskirts of Longleat Forest.

The vet, from Frome, told Somerset Live: "We have recently been treating 2 suspected cases of CRGV, commonly known as Alabama Rot. Both these dogs have been walked in the Gare Hill woods area. The cause of this disease is unknown, but it is believed to be picked up in muddy wooded areas and causes skin lesions and kidney failure. We advise that you wash your dogs after a muddy walk and check for skin lesions on a regular basis as they are commonly the 1st sign. If you find any lesions on your dog's feet, legs, stomach, chest or face, then please don't hesitate to call."

Sores and lesions on the dog's body are the most visible symptom. According to Filip Jaszczak, of Marske Vets, there are other symptoms to watch for.

"Should you notice suspicious lesions on the skin or unexplained loss of appetite, lack of energy, vomiting, changes in amount of produced urine, then please contact your vet," said Filip, whose practice dealt with the suspected case.

The cause of the disease is unknown, but it is believed that it is linked to walking in muddy areas and woodlands. US research suggests a link with the bacteria _E.coli_, but there is no evidence for this in UK cases.

Within a week, dogs who have it will display symptoms linked to kidney failure. The most obvious symptom, however, will be the sores. The good news is that treatment can work; however, it is only successful in around 20-30 percent of cases.

The disease damages blood vessels in the skin and kidney, causing blood clots in vessels, which then damage the lining and delicate tissue of the kidneys. This is what cause the skin ulcers, but, more tragically, can lead to fatal kidney failure.

Because the cause is still unknown, there is no known way to prevent dogs from contracting it. But there are steps you can take to try and reduce the risk. As it is thought to be contracted during muddy walks, owners should wash off any woodland mud.

[As published in 20180107.5542890, fish vet Fiona Macdonald is researching whether _Aeromonas hydrophila_, a heterotrophic, Gram negative, rod-shaped bacterium present in water sources and soil, might be involved in the aetiology of CRGV.

In a document sent to Veterinary Times entitled "CRGV (Alabama rot) - an organism of interest?" Dr Macdonald explained: "There is a suspicion initial cases of CRGV occurred in areas with substantial amounts of water as a result of unusually high rainfall; both running and standing water was close to 4 C [39 F] for some weeks around the time of the cases.

"To date, dogs appear to be the only species affected, with no reported cases in wild ponies, foxes, cattle or deer. There have been recorded cases of infection with _A. hydrophila_ in dogs, which mirrored leptospira infections, and this pathogen has been on the list of possible causes of CRGV since early manifestations of the problem."

Dr Macdonald is appealing for help from UK vets. She said: "I want blood samples from suspected CRGV cases, and I'm happy to send out swabs along with a sampling protocol to any vet for them to swab any suspicious lesions. She can be contacted at <fiona@fish-treatment.co.uk>." - Mod.AS
