COA contains foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Penghu pigs
-----------------------------------------------------------
Blisters indicating a strain of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] have been
found in the mouths of 5 piglets in Penghu County, the Executive
Yuan's Council of Agriculture (COA) reported yesterday [3 Nov 2011]
evening.

On 30 Oct 2011, the Penghu County Government discovered 5 infected
piglets, according to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine of the COA. The pigs had been imported from the Taiwan
mainland.

The 5 infected piglets and their 3 pen-mates were immediately
slaughtered. All contaminated holding pens, equipment, and tools were
disinfected and the outbreak is completely contained, according to the
COA.

Blisters in the mouth are a symptom of FMD, a fast-spreading and
sometimes fatal disease that strikes cloven-hoofed animals.

Authorities determined that herds from the infected pigs' original
ranch on the Taiwan mainland are free from FMD. An investigation of
cloven-hoofed livestock within a 3-km (1.8-mile) radius of the ranch
also came up clear.

[The Penghu Islands are an archipelago off the western coast of Taiwan
in the Taiwan Strait consisting of 90 small islands and islets
covering an area of 141 square kilometers [55 square miles]. A map is
included in the report to the OIE, submitted on 4 Nov 2011 (see at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=11234}.

According to the report, the outbreak took place in Makung City (map
at http://healthmap.org/r/1p59). This is the 3rd time, since 2010,
that FMD is recorded in Penghu in pigs transported from mainland
Taiwan.

The current OIE report includes the following lucid and detailed
epidemiological comments:

"Five of 200 pigs were found with vesicular lesions in Penghu animal
quarantine establishment after they were transported into Penghu
Island from Taiwan Island. The incident was reported by the prefecture
animal disease control competent authority and the 5 sick pigs with 3
other pigs in the same pen were immediately destroyed on 30 Oct 2011
after sampling. The prefecture animal disease control competent
authority traced back to the farm of origin in Taiwan Island. The
investigation showed that all pigs on origin farm were clinically
healthy. The FMD vaccination programme has been resumed in Penghu
Island since 27 May 2011. Enforced biosecurity measures including
movement control, cleaning and disinfection are implemented in Penghu
animal quarantine establishment. The positive results of RT-PCR tests
and virus isolation tests were provided by the national laboratory
confirming that those pigs were infected with the FMD virus serotype
O. The establishment and those surrounding farms that keep
cloven-hoofed animals (a total of one cattle/goat/deer farm, one
goat/pig farm, 4 goat farms and 11 cattle farms within 3-km radius of
the establishment) have been under vigilant monitoring and
epidemiological investigation and no clinical or epidemiological
evidence of infection has been found".

Following the reported introduction of FMDV serotype O into Taiwan
from mainland China in 2009, 26 outbreaks have been reported in Taiwan
so far, all in swine. In 2009, 11 (subclinical) outbreaks; in 2010, 5
outbreaks, of which 3 subclinical and 2 clinical, one of which --
similar to the current outbreak -- in piglets transported to Penghu
from mainland Taiwan. The current outbreak is the 10th during 2011; 3
of the earlier outbreaks were clinical (one of which in Penghu), 6
were subclinical. For OIE reports on all outbreaks since 2009, go to
