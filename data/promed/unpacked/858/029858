Israeli travelers - Russian Far East ex Nepal

40 Israeli travelers who were traveling in the [Russian] Far East
became ill with enteric fever. This news came from the news agency NRG
on 6 Jan 2009. The source of the outbreak probably was the canteen at
the Jewish Center Beit-Khabat in the city of Pokhara in Nepal. All the
travelers had been there before going to the [Russian] Far East. The
chairman of epidemiological control of tropical diseases in Israel,
Professor Eli Schwarz, mentioned that none of these cases became
infected by enteric fever from exposures within Israel. All the
patients had been hospitalized, properly treated and then returned to
Israel. "There is no threat for the spread of enteric fever within
Israel," the professor said.

stated in the posting.

Enteric fever (caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotypes Typhi or
Paratyphi serogroups A-C) has a totally different presentation than
the more common kinds of salmonellosis. Vomiting and diarrhea are
typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it
is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be
positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course
of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

Initial symptoms typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise,
dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain,
and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often
only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is
protracted fever and mental dullness [classically called coma vigil -
Mod.LL]. Diarrhea may develop, but usually does not. Many patients
develop hepatosplenomegaly. After the 1st week or so, many cases
develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions
("rose spots") are about 2 cm in diameter and blanch on pressure. They
persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections
are common.

As many as 10 percent of untreated infections may be fatal, and
relapses are not uncommon. The illnesses caused by Paratyphoid
serotypes are generally milder. The specific organism or organisms
related to this report are not stated.

The development of enteric fever in Israeli travelers going to Nepal
is well known (1) and was reported to be higher than in other
travelers, possibly due to the low vaccination rate for typhoid in the
Israeli travelers. More recently, there was a significant increase in
the percentage of cases related to Paratyphoid, which is not a
vaccine-preventable infection (2,3). Of note, the Paratyphoid serotype
cases were observed not to be any milder than the typhoid serotype
cases.
