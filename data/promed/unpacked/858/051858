[1] Lithuania, wild boar, control

It's open season on wild boar after Vilnius ordered a record cull amid an outbreak of African swine fever that has prompted Russia to ban pork imports from across the EU.

But there is concern in this Baltic state that killing off 90 percent of its estimated 60 000 wild boar will upset the delicate balance of the food chain.

"We feel bad about shooting a female carrying babies, but we have to because we know the possible consequences," said Aurimas Trunce, head of a hunting club in southern Lithuania.

African swine fever is harmless to humans but lethal to pigs and has no known cure.

It has spread throughout the Caucasus and Russia since 2007 and is endemic to areas of Africa, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

The FAO warns of "vast losses" if it migrates from Russia to China, which is home to half of the world's pigs.

The Lithuanian cull is one of the largest in the world, but state veterinary officials in Vilnius say similar measures are now being applied in Belarus and parts of Russia.

They believe the virus crept over the border from neighbouring Belarus and fear it could spread to and decimate commercial pig farms, triggering a wave of bankruptcies.

"Our agriculture sector will suffer a huge loss if we do not solve this problem," Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius has warned.

An EU member since 2004, Lithuania has also imposed a state of emergency in affected areas, slapping a temporary ban on shipments of live pigs, and is mulling a cull.

Time is of the essence, insist state veterinary officials that are overseeing the 6-month cull in the wild ending in June 2014. Come spring, the virus will spread faster as warm weather brings back birds and the mites they bear.

But environmentalists are also sounding the alarm, warning that the massive cull will wreak havoc with the food chain of wildlife populations.

Stronger animals could also develop an immunity to the virus, the environmentalist added.

"It is outrageous that hunting will also be allowed in nature reserves," Gaidamavicius said.

With wild boars virtually wiped out, predators like wolves will turn to hunting deer and could severely deplete their numbers, experts insist.

EU and UN experts admit excessive hunting could have other undesired effects: It might encourage individual animals to migrate in an effort to escape hunters and thus spread the virus.

In a bid to stop more infected animals migrating from Belarus, Lithuania has also asked Brussels to co-finance a fence along its southern-eastern border.

All wild boar hunted down in the cull will be incinerated if tests show they carry the virus; those not infected could still be used for meat.

Of the nearly 1500 animals killed in January 2014, only 2 tested positive for the disease, according to state veterinary officials.

The EU has termed Moscow's 29 Jan 2014 import ban of its pork "disproportionate." Russia imports a quarter of the bloc's pork exports, worth around EUR 1.4 billion (USD 1.9 billion) annually.

Lithuania has adopted a carrot and stick strategy for the mass cull: It is offering hunters 250 litas (USD 98.00) for each carcass, but hunters who refuse to participate risk having their licenses suspended.

[The report includes an interactive map showing the location of the event.

Since ASF penetrated Russia from Georgia in November 2007, the virus has become established in most of western Russia from south to north. Russia reported ASF as "resolved" on 16 Dec 2013, but a few days later had to report new outbreaks.

The Russian ASF OIE reporting history can be summarised as follows:

1. Initially started on 5 Nov 2007, Follow-up report No. 18 (Final report) declaring the disease "Resolved" submitted on 9 Jun 2009 (total 65 outbreaks)
2. Restarted on 11 Sep 2009, Follow-up report No. 110 (Final report) declaring the disease "Resolved" submitted on 16 Dec 2013 (total 302 outbreaks)
3. Restarted reporting on 1 Jan 2014, follow-up Rep. No. 1 10 Feb 2014 (2 outbreaks so far, status: "continuing")
4. Restarted reporting on 14 Jan 2014, follow-up Reps. No. 1-4: 27 Jan 2014, 3 Feb 2014, 5 Feb 2014, 11 Feb 2014 (5 outbreaks so far, status: "continuing")

At present, 2 separate epizootics in tandem are covered in 2 separate threads to the OIE. An explanation for that divided reporting would be helpful. - Mod.AS
