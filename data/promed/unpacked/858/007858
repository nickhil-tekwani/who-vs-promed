LEAF RUST, GRAPEVINE - AUSTRALIA (NORTHERN TERRITORY): ERADICATION

The Northern Territory [NT] has successfully eradicated Australia's
only grapevine leaf rust outbreak.
The fungus, which is believed to have come from East Timor, could
have damaged AUD 4.6 billion (about USD 4.06 billion) wine and table
grape sector after its discovery in Darwin in 2001.
Now, the Top End has seen the world's 1st successful eradication of
rust disease. Chief plant health manager Stuart Smith says every
diseased vine in Darwin and surrounds has been destroyed.
"The rust is caused by a very small bright orange spore, which then
grows into the tissue of the plant and you end up with pustules and
orange marks on the underneath of the leaf," he said.
"Certainly when the disease becomes widely established the leaves die
off earlier than they would normally and the whole plant reduces in vigour."

[Leaf rust on grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_) is caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora euvitis_. It affects only the genus _Vitis_ causing dark,
necrotic lesions on the upper surface and orange spore masses on the
underside of leaves. Heavy infection causes early senescence of the
leaves and premature leaf fall. The disease can cause poor shoot
growth, reduction of fruit quality and yield loss. Spores are spread
by wind and air-currents and mycelium may persist in grapevine shoots
during winter. Long-distance spread often occurs on infected plant
material. It is present in Asia, the Caribbean, and parts of the USA,
Central, and South America. More data is needed on the fungus present
in the Americas to clarify if it is the same species. Disease
management includes use of tolerant or resistant cultivars and
application of fungicides. Another species in the same genus,
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, causes soybean rust.
Grapevine leaf rust occurs as close to Australia as Indonesia and
East Timor and was 1st detected in a Darwin backyard in 2001. Further
NT-wide and interstate surveys found no sign of the disease outside
the Darwin or Palmerston areas. As a result of this restricted
detection and that the fungus has a restricted host range, an
eradication programme was started. A quarantine area was declared and
all properties and households within (approximately 35 000) were
surveyed. All diseased grapevines had been destroyed by the end of
2003. It was speculated that the pathogen might have been imported
from Southeast Asia by the monsoon, on travellers' clothing or with
illegal propagating material.
For many plant pathogens, an attempt of eradication requires that all
local hosts species be destroyed. The eradication process continues
with a host free period with regular surveys, followed by closely
monitored controlled replanting of host crop species. If no further
outbreaks are detected, eventually eradication is declared and
restrictions on the general cultivation of all host species are
lifted. Eradication of plant pathogens is extremely difficult and
rarely successful, but since rust spores may be carried on the wind
rust eradication is even more difficult. Success would be more likely
in areas isolated by natural barriers -- in this case deserts, areas
of non-host native vegetation, and the ocean. This world-1st success
is also due to the quick reaction of local authorities, a cooperative
attitude of the public, and Australia's powerful quarantine and
biosecurity system. All concerned deserve congratulations.
