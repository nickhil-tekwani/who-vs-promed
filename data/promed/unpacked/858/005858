Animals at a Middletown farm are being quarantined after 3 people got sick, Rhode Island health officials announced [Mon 16 Apr 2018].

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management [DEM] said one child and 2 adults came down with cryptosporidiosis after having contact with goats during "pet and cuddle" events at Simmons Farm on West Main Road on [25 and 31 Mar 2018].

"Cryptosporidiosis lives in the gut of infected humans or animals. It is spread through contact with the feces of an infected person or animal, typically when people touch their mouths with contaminated hands," according to the Rhode Island Department of Health [RIDOH].

Symptoms include diarrhea with abdominal pain and cramping, as well as vomiting, nausea, and fever.

About 60 goats and 5 cows are being quarantined, Simmons Farm owners told NBC 10 News. They will also be screened.

"The quarantine put in place by DEM pertains to all livestock at the farm. All livestock must be kept in a manner that precludes any physical contact with the public until the quarantine is lifted," the RIDOH noted. "Anyone who has visited Simmons Farm within the last month should monitor themselves for the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis. If symptoms do develop, a healthcare provider should be contacted. The farm owners have voluntarily closed the petting zoo along with their farm stand."

"We feel it is important now that we have been properly informed to inform all of you that, unfortunately our goats have contracted cryptosporidium, a common parasite that can be passed to humans, as a precautionary measure we voluntarily closed the Farm stand and all petting opportunities for this past weekend [14-15 Apr 2018], the health and well-being of our customers is of upmost concern to us," according to the post.

The RIDOH also offered the following tips:
- wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds after contacting livestock, before preparing or eating food, after using the toilet, or after changing diapers;
- avoid allowing clothing to be contaminated with feces, and wash any clothing that is contaminated. (People's clothing is often contaminated when they pick up goats whose hooves have fecal matter on them.);
- make sure that only healthy animals are in contact with the public;
- keep animals in sanitary environments;
- make hand-washing stations available for patrons;
- avoid eating in areas where animals are kept

Marshall said most people who contract cryptosporidiosis can recover in about 2 weeks, adding that people with weak immune systems are more at-risk.

[_Cryptosporidium_ spp is common in farm animals like calves and goats. Outbreaks associated with petting farms and swimming pools are common. Good hand hygiene is the main preventive measure. The infection is usually self-limiting in immunocompetent people and treatment can be tried with nitazoxanide. - Mod.EP
