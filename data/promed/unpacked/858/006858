Health officials have told governments they can keep Tamiflu for
longer to help fight the swine flu pandemic. It means stockpiles of
the drug that governments started to build up 5 years ago in response
to the outbreak of bird flu will not need to be thrown away before
winter in the Northern Hemisphere, when the pandemic is expected to
spread. Some 220 million individual treatments of Tamiflu -- each with
10 capsules to be taken over 5 days -- have been sent to governments
around the world since 2004 by the manufacturer, Swiss pharmaceuticals
company Roche Holding AG, said spokeswoman Claudia Schmitt on Tuesday
[18 Aug 2009]. It is unclear how many of the treatments remain in
stockpiles and how many have been used to treat outbreaks of bird flu
and, more recently, swine flu, Schmitt said.

Antivirals such as Tamiflu can shorten swine flu [influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection] by about a day if started within 2 days
of the onset of the disease. GlaxoSmithKline's Relenza is believed to
be similarly effective. European Union members also have approved the
extension of the shelf-life of Relenza, or zanamivir, from 5 years to
7 years.

Tamiflu packages state that the drug should be used within 5 years of
manufacture. Health authorities in Europe, the United States, Canada,
Hong Kong and Australia have approved extending that to 7 years for
use against the pandemic strain of swine flu, said Schmitt. The
extension does not apply to Tamiflu's use against seasonal flu.

The decision may be in time to help some Asian countries that
stockpiled the drug against the earlier outbreak of bird flu to avoid
the expense of replacing it during the pandemic declared in June 2009.
The World Health Organization accepts the decisions to approve the
extension of the shelf life, and it is acceptable to apply the
extension retroactively in this case, said WHO spokesman Gregory
Hartl. "It is WHO's view that shelf-life extensions are a matter for
national regulatory authorities," Hartl said.

WHO estimates that up to 2 billion people could become infected with
the disease [influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] over the
next 2 years, so it would be impossible at the current rate to provide
doses of the drug to everyone infected. To help bridge the gap, Roche
has licensed several other producers to make a generic version of the
drug oseltamivir, which Roche markets as Tamiflu. In addition, Schmitt
said, "we are scaling up production of Tamiflu so we will be able, if
required, beginning next year to produce about 400 million treatments
per year." She said Roche was still fulfilling the promise it
announced in May 2009 to donate 5.65 million treatments of Tamiflu to
WHO to help developing countries cope with the pandemic. That comes on
top of an earlier donation of 5 million treatments.

The World Health Organisation said on Tuesday [18 Aug 2009] it was up
to national regulatory authorities to decide whether to extend the
shelf life of the flu drug Tamiflu by 2 years, as recommended by Swiss
drug maker Roche (ROG.VX). The United States, Canada, Australia, Hong
Kong and the European Union's drug watchdog have extended Tamiflu's
shelf life to 7 years from 5 after company data showed the active
ingredient's longer stability, a Roche spokeswoman said.

Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, is the front line antiviral
being used against the influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, commonly
known as swine flu, which is causing an influenza pandemic. Capsules
kept in government stockpiles worldwide or currently on the market
carry a 5-year expiry date. "It is WHO's view that shelf-life
extensions are a matter for national regulatory authorities," WHO
spokesman Gregory Hartl said in a statement sent to journalists.

The WHO says most people infected with H1N1 have mild symptoms, and
Tamiflu should be given only to flu sufferers at high risk, including
pregnant women or those with complications such as pneumonia. The
European Medicines Agency has said it is acceptable to apply the
extension to current stocks of the drug during a flu pandemic, a
decision followed last month [July 2009] by Switzerland.

"We are working with health authorities to also extend the shelf life
in other markets because it makes sense," Roche spokeswoman Claudia
Schmitt told Reuters. Roche was providing its stability data to
governments to help them extend the shelf life of their stockpiles,
she said. "Governments have had stockpiles since the bird flu time,"
she added, referring to the H5N1 avian flu strain which erupted in
2003 and also responds to treatment with the antiviral.

Since 2004, Roche has fulfilled government orders for 270 million
Tamiflu treatment courses in 96 countries, Schmitt said. The drug
manufacturer has donated about 10.65 million treatment courses to the
WHO for distribution and use in the poorest countries. The 1st
donation to the U.N. agency was made in 2004 and the 2nd in May
[2009], as H1N1 spread more widely. "A large amount of the 2nd
donation is newly produced. It is a product that will expire many
years from now," she said.

The WHO spokesman said the agency did not have any new estimate of
global production capacity for vaccines now being developed by drug
companies. The WHO has previously estimated that drug companies could
produce up to 94 million doses per week, but the amount will depend on
factors including whether one dose or 2 are needed, and how much of
the active agent will be needed per dose. In the United States,
Novavax Inc (NVAX.O) reported on Tuesday [18 Aug 2009] that a new kind
of flu vaccine worked against the H1N1 virus in ferrets, the closest
animal to humans when it comes to being infected with influenza.
Leading flu vaccine makers include Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA),
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Novartis (NOVN.VX), Baxter (BAX.N), CSL
(CSL.AX) and Solvay (SOLB.BR).

In Dar es Salaam, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said work on
producing a vaccine was proceeding now that manufacturers in developed
and developing countries had received the seed virus from the WHO's
collaborating centres. "We expect vaccines, the 1st batch of which
would be available in September, October [2009]," Chan told reporters.

[The continued profligate use of Tamiflu in the treatment of mild
infections may ultimately promote the expansion of Tamiflu-resistant
virus, since resistance is conferred by mutation at a single site in
the neuraminidase gene. Fortunately, there is no evidence so far to
suggest that Tamiflu resistance is spreading widely, and it is likely
that Tamiflu will remain effective until suitable vaccines become
available. - Mod.CP]
