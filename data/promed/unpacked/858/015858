A warning has been issued over a deadly strain [of a bacterium that causes meningococcal] meningitis -- which has seen an 88 percent rise in cases in the last year [2014-2015].

Meningococcal W -- known as 'Men W' -- was 1st identified in Brazil in 2005 but has become increasingly prevalent in the UK. It is the deadliest form of meningococcal disease with the highest death rate but can be treated in intensive care if caught early enough.

New figures reveal that between July 2013 and June 2014 just 98 cases were reported in the England and Wales -- but in the same period last year [July 2014-June 2015] this had soared by 88 percent to 184.

Men W now accounts for 15 per cent of all meningococcal disease in the UK -- and experts are warning that the alarming rise will continue unless there is widespread uptake of a new vaccine.

Christopher Head, the chief executive of Meningitis Research Foundation, said there is particular concern over the 'ST-11' strain of Men W in teenagers. "The rise in this ST-11 Men W disease is particularly alarming because it is striking mainly healthy people across all age groups, but with a marked spike amongst teenagers," she said. "The strain is also associated with more severe illness which often requires treatment in intensive care and has a higher associated death rate than other strains of meningococcal disease, 13 per cent compared to 5 to 10 percent for other strains."

Recent figures from Public Health England show in 2009, Men W only accounted for 1 to 2 percent of all meningococcal cases in the UK. But in 2013/14 it accounted for nearly 15 per cent of all cases.

Professor Adam Finn from the University of Bristol has also seen a sharp rise in the disease in the South West alone, with 12 cases reported last year. The Paediatrics professor said: "In most years we had seen only 1 or 2 [cases]. So the number of cases has gone up quite a lot. Now a dozen might not sound like that many, but nevertheless, if you multiply that by the county, you can quickly get to cases that are in the hundreds. So it is the trajectory of this, the rapid rise, that's caused the alarm, and we really want to get on top of this before those cases double again, or double again, and we start seeing dozens and dozens of cases."

To try and stem the spread of ST-11, a new vaccine has been introduced for 14-18-year-olds and under-25-year-olds who are going to university for the 1st time. The new starters at university and 17-18-year-olds are being treated 1st with Men ACWY vaccine as they are at a higher risk, with 14-years-old treated as the vaccine is restocked.

Christopher Head added: "Adolescents aged 14 to 18 are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group and offering Men ACWY vaccine to all of them should stop the bacteria from being passed on. This means that even unvaccinated people will be protected from catching the disease -- an effect known as herd protection. Although we welcome the implementation of the Men ACWY vaccine amongst 14-18-year-olds over the next couple of years, it will take time for herd protection to be established. So babies, who are particularly vulnerable to developing disease will remain unprotected. Fortunately, the Men B vaccine Bexsero, which will be routinely available for babies from September [2015], will protect against Men W ST-11."

[_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days, but can range between 2 and 10 days.

Several meningococcal vaccines are available. Immunity following use of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common.

There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W135), either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.

In the UK, babies have been routinely offered the meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (Men C) at 3 months of age as part of the National Health Service (NHS) childhood vaccination program since 1999. A new meningococcal B vaccine (Men B or Bexsero) is being 1st added to the childhood immunization program starting in September 2015 (https://www.meningitisnow.org/how-we-help/campaigns/beat-it-now/faqs-on-meningitis-b-vaccine/?gclid=CN6JjdSKk8gCFcQUHwodxysLfQ).

The vaccination schedule in the UK at present is as follows: At 2 months of age babies are given Men B vaccine; at 3 months of age, Men C; at 4 months, a 2nd dose of Men B; at 12-13 months, a 3rd dose of Men B and a 2nd dose of Men C in a combined vaccine with _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib); and at 13-18 years of age and 1st-time university students, Men ACWY (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx).

Since the Men C vaccine was introduced in 1999, the Men C disease has been virtually eliminated in the UK. Nowadays, there are just a handful of Men C cases each year, mainly in older, unvaccinated adults (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-c-vaccine.aspx). However, the near elimination of Men C as a consequence of the Men C conjugate vaccine program in the UK has been followed by the emergence of a "replacement" pathogen, meningococcus serogroup W.

Similarly, after widespread use of conjugate meningococcal A vaccine in the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A, the serogroup that had been historically the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in the African meningitis belt (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf), was eliminated, followed by its replacement with meningococcal serogroup C (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Niger (05): serogroup C, fatal, vaccine shortage 20150802.3552463). Similarly, serotype replacement has been observed following pneumococcal vaccination programs, which necessitated expansion of serotypes covered by the vaccine (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-vaccine strain emergence - USA (AK) 20070425.1348).

Because of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W as a cause of invasive meningococcal disease in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine Men ACWY for adolescents who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx). However, the statement in news article above that "the Men B vaccine Bexsero, which will be routinely available for babies from September [2015], will protect against Men W ST-11" requires further explanation. - Mod.ML
