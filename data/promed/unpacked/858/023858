The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture announced on 18 May 2015 the quarantine of a barn in Tionesta, in Forest County, after a horse residing there tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) on 13 May 2015.

A horse from the Forest County barn was used in the Tionesta Wounded Warrior Horseback Scavenger Hunt, where 94 horses --including horses from Ohio and West Virginia -- took part.

Another barn in Shippenville, in Clarion County, housing an exposed horse that showed clinical signs of EHV-1 was put under precautionary quarantine on 14 May 2015 until the pending laboratory results are confirmed. 2 additional horses from the Forest County barn have shown signs of illness after being exposed to the positive horse.

The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture is in the process of tracing the horses that participated in the scavenger hunt, and has notified animal health officials in Ohio and West Virginia.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy. In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1. Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

The virus is spread by direct horse-to-horse contact or through contact with objects contaminated with the virus. The barns and horses are quarantined for at least 21 days. The quarantine can be lifted after that 3-week period. Strict sanitary and biosecurity standards are then enforced.

A horse stable in Warren County has had several confirmed cases of what's called EHM. "EHM is the acronym for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, which is just a term for the neurologic or brain and spinal cord form of equine herpesvirus," according the Iowa Veterinary Medical Association executive director Randy Wheeler.

Dr Wheeler says the disease has been found in other states and so far there's just one outbreak here. He says the operation is under quarantine after losing 4 horses. "There are several others sick, but they are recovering with veterinary treatment and owner care," Wheeler says.

Wheeler says horses usually spread the disease when they touch noses. "But it can be spread through human transmission, such as contaminated clothes, on your hands, your boots, shared water buckets, feed, on our tack, grooming and of course, horse trailer debris," Wheeler says. "It is a virus, it usually takes 7 to 10 days to cause symptoms. But not all horses will come down with the disease."

Wheeler says there is a common thread among the animals that are infected. He says there was a horse show at the fairgrounds in late April [2014], but so far just this operation has been the only one infected. "So, if we don't hear of more and we take good biosecurity measures, we should mitigate the spread," Wheeler says. He says horse owners monitor their animals by taking their temperature and looking for unusual behavior. Usually the horses may cough or be off-balance, have nasal discharge, be lethargic. Wheeler says if you notice these signs in your horse, contact your veterinarian.

Wheeler says there is no vaccine for this form of the virus, but there are vaccines for other forms.

[The state of Iowa can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3373608,46087. Warren County in south central Iowa can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/iowa-county-map.gif. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.

The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This disease has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
