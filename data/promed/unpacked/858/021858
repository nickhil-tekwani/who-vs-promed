The cave near the western shore of Lake George in the town of Hague has
long been one of the biggest winter homes to little brown bats in North
America. A count of bats in the mid-1990s led to the conclusion that 185
000 of the tiny mammals hibernated there, and state wildlife officials
believe that number likely topped 200 000 a few years later. Last winter
[2008-09], when biologists from the state Department of Environmental
Conservation (DEC) visited the cave, they concluded there were somewhere
between 2000 and 3000 left, said Alan Hicks, a DEC wildlife biologist.

Another cave near Paradox Lake in Essex County has been similarly
devastated by a mysterious disease that kills the bats as they hibernate
during the winter.

"There's not a (bat) population in the Adirondacks that hasn't been
affected," said Hicks, who is heading the state's efforts to investigate.
"I'm not looking forward to this winter." The culprit is a mysterious
malady dubbed "white nose syndrome", which has devastated bat populations
across the north east the past 2 winters, to the point where some
hibernacula have lost 95 per cent of their bats.

Bats that become infected awaken during their hibernation, apparently
because of the discomfort caused by a non-native fungal infection that
leaves a white coating on their faces. They seem to die of starvation after
they burn through body weight and can't find food to replenish. "They seem
to exhaust their energy reserves prematurely," said Joseph Okoniewski, a
DEC biologist with the agency's pathology unit.

The caves of the south eastern Adirondacks and Capital District are at the
epicenter of the outbreak, a catastrophe that has spread as far south and
west as West Virginia over the past 18 months. It's been called the most
precipitous decline of a species on record, and answers about how to stop
it are few and far between.

"It's heartbreaking," said Mylea Bayless, a conservation biologist with Bat
Conservation International, a nonprofit advocacy group. "I don't think
people truly understand the impact this is going to have on our communities
and our environment." Bats do more than hang in our home attics and flit
above our heads at night. They are a crucial part of the food chain, eating
up to half their weight in bugs a night. One of their main foods in the
north east is mosquitoes, a pest that spreads numerous diseases to mammals.
"They eat a lot of bugs, and some of these bugs are a problem for us,"
Hicks said.

It was the winter of 2006 when cave explorers working their way through
Howe's Caverns, south west of Albany, noticed irregular activity among bats
there. The winged creatures should hibernate in the winter, but some were
found to be awake and covered with a white fuzz. The issue seemed isolated,
so scientists initially thought little of it. During the winter of 2007,
though, the problem returned, and more bats were found dead there. By the
winter of 2008, tens of thousands of bats in caves and mines around upstate
New York were dying when they should have been safely in hibernation, and
the malady had spread to Vermont. Last winter, the problem worsened.

Wildlife biologists from New York and Vermont spent countless hours this
summer [2009] surveying caves and mines where bats spend their summers, and
the drop in bat numbers has been sobering. Populations of little brown bats
around the Adirondacks are off by 95 per cent in some caves and mines,
Hicks said. Little browns are the small bats most people see at night,
skimming the surface of ponds and lakes eating bugs. One cave in Hague has
long been the largest wintering site on the continent for little browns,
and as of last winter [2008-09], just a couple of thousand were left.

During a survey last month [September 2009] at a cave in Dorset, Vermont,
just minutes from the New York border, one bat was caught in 3 hours.
During the same survey 2 years earlier at the same cave, 900 were caught in
3 hours, said Scott Darling, a Vermont wildlife biologist. "That cave was
kind of the poster child for us," Darling said. "The news we continue to
get is not promising."

In addition to little brown bats, endangered Indiana bats seem most
susceptible to white nose syndrome. For some reason, though, big brown bats
have not been affected at rates the others have, Hicks said. Their numbers
have dropped about 50 per cent or so from it.

Little is known about how the fungus, dubbed _Geomyces destructans_, made
its way to the US. It thrives in cold and damp caves and former mineral
mines in the Northeast have proved to be prime territory for it.

It has long been present in Europe and Asia, and one of the leading
theories is that a spelunker [one who makes a hobby of exploring and
studying caves. - Mod.SH] who explored caves abroad brought it to North
America. Howe Caverns is world-renowned, and sees 200 000 visitors a year,
Hicks said.

The fungus does not seem to kill bats in Europe, but Europe has far fewer
bats than North America. Some theorize that it caused similar havoc there
years ago without anyone noticing, and the bat population dwindled because
of it. Why the fungus has proved so problematic to only bats, and some
species of bats have been hit harder than others, are additional unanswered
questions. Okoniewski said fungal infections are typically "secondary"
pathogens, opportunistic invaders that cause problems to animals that are
battling a virus or whose immune system is otherwise compromised.

So many biologists initially theorized that something else was afflicting
the bats, such as a virus, and making them susceptible to the fungus. But
Okoniewski said research seems to show that the fungus has "a unique
ability to penetrate the tissues" of bats on its own. The fact the fungus
appears to be the cause of the devastation is a major issue for those
trying to figure out how to reverse the trend. Many mammals don't have much
immune resistance to them. "One of the biggest problems is resistance to
fungal infections is not a common thing," Hicks said.

Fungal infections are also difficult to treat and stop from spreading,
particularly among mammals like bats that huddle together to hibernate. And
while some theorized that the malady would only affect bats in cold-weather
climates, Hicks said it appears caves as far south as Mexico get cold
enough to allow the fungus to grow.

Bayless, from Bat Conservation International, said scientists are bracing
for its southern spread. "We don't know what's going to happen," Hicks
said. "But I think this winter [2009-10] we'll know whether this is going
to drive them all to zero." The hope is that the fungus will not have as
much impact on the remaining bats in the north east, since their density in
caves will be far lower than usual.

More than 70 researchers and scientists working to solve the mystery met in
western Pennsylvania in August [2009], and weeks later the US Fish and
Wildlife Service unveiled an 8-page plan to attack the disease. The plan
spells out testing, sampling and control efforts as well as ways to raise
awareness to the issue. Research is going on continually: Vermont and New
York researchers plan to work together this winter to try to repopulate a
cave in central Vermont whose bat population was wiped out. But researchers
know that, based on frequency of deaths, time is of the essence.

[The fungus seems to have acquired a name, of sorts, _Geomyces
destructans_, but this may or may not be recognized as an official name,
and it is possible the characteristics of the fungus are still being
defined before a final name is given to the fungus.

Much like the colony collapse disorder in bees, this is spreading and the
consequences are serious. Pictures of affected species, including the
little brown bat may be found at
