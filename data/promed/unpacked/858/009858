Livestock farmers in the West Midlands are breathing a sigh of relief after
a farm was declared clear of foot and mouth disease (FMD).
A 3 km (1.8 mile) temporary control zone had been imposed around Woodhouse
Farm, near Solihull, while tests for the disease were carried out on
animals from the site. But on Thursday night [20 Sep 2007] DEFRA (UK
Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) confirmed that
laboratory results showed no sign of FMD, and the control zone was lifted.
There have so far been 5 confirmed cases of the disease in Surrey since the
initial outbreak at the start of August [2007]. A number of sites outside
Surrey have also been investigated and several control zones set up, but
these have all proved to be false alarms.
The control zone around Woodhouse Farm was set up as a precautionary
measure on Wednesday [19 Sep 2007], hours after chief vet Debby Reynolds
urged farmers to undertake twice-daily inspections of their cattle in a bid
to eradicate [FMD]. But a Defra spokeswoman said results had shown no
evidence of the disease.
The news came as laboratory results on the latest incidence of [FMD] in
Surrey revealed the strain of the disease was the same as all the other
cases in the outbreak. Animals on the 5th premises [IP5] -- Klondyke Farm
-- had the same strain as the previous 4 infected farms.
The Environment Department also lifted some of the movement restrictions
outside the surveillance zone, which surrounds the most recent cases near
Egham, Surrey.
Licences are now available to allow pigs to be moved for welfare reasons,
and the movement of animals up to 3 km (1.8 miles) or cows for calving up
to 50 km (31 miles) between premises belonging to the same owner.
3 new cases near Egham have emerged in the last 2 weeks -- just days after
officials declared the UK free of the disease following the August [2007]
outbreak which has been blamed on the virus escaping from leaking pipes at
the nearby Pirbright laboratory site.
Some 1700 animals have been slaughtered since the outbreak, at what is
traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for livestock sales.
