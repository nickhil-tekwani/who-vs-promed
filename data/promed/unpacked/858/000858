40-year-old female resident of Valdivia was in stable condition on oxygen at

[Cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) occur frequently in Chile. The
Chilean Ministry of Health Epidemiology website contains tables giving the
geographic and demographic characteristics of cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome by year since reporting began in 1993. During 2002, 64 cases of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome were confirmed in Chile -- see:
http://epi.minsal.cl/epi/html/bolets/reportes/Hantavirus/Hantavirus26dic2002
.htm
Cases of HPS have been reported previously from Biobio in March 2001 and May
2002, and from Valdivia in November 1999 (see refs. below). The likely
causal agent is the hantavirus _Andes virus_, which is prevalent in Chile
and whose reservoir host is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat _Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_, which is found in rural areas throughout most of the
country. For a detailed description of an outbreak of Andes virus-associated
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Chile, see
