About 25 cases of leishmaniasis [cutaneous we presume] were reported in the district [Lakki Marwat] last month [Mar 2016], an official said on Saturday.

Speaking at a function at the Rural Health Centre, Ahmadkhel, Dr Hafeezullah, coordinator of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), said that leishmaniasis cases could increase in coming months if preventive measures were not adopted by local residents, especially those living in rural areas.

DHO [district health officer] Dr Abdul Ghaffar Wazir, district councillor Ameer Nawaz Khan, members of the village council, elders and villagers also attended the gathering. Dr Hafeezullah disclosed that at least 9 cases had been reported from the union council in Ahmadkhel. He said that the outbreak of the disease caused by sand flies' bite in remote and backward localities of UC Ahmadkhel with scattered population was a matter of great concern. "The health department has launched an awareness campaign to sensitise communities about using preventive measures so [as] to keep them safe from mosquito bites" he added. He said that the campaign would be made a success under public private partnership.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Pakistan and especially in the eastern provinces and tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, and ProMED-mail has repeatedly reported the situation (see previous postings listed below).

A recent, comprehensive global review of leishmaniasis, including the situation in Afghanistan, can be found in: Alvar J, VÃ©lez ID, Bern C, et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PloS One. 2012;7(5):e35671. Available at: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671.

The 2 types of leishmania causing cutaneous leishmaniasis in Pakistan are _Leishmania tropica_, which mainly spreads from human to human, and _L. major_ which is transmitted from a reservoir in small rodents. Genotyping of leishmania from patients will help elucidate the focus of the present outbreak, and the main control efforts should target the sandfly vector. - Mod.EP
