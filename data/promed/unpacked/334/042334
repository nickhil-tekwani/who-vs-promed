Fish virus partly responsible for carp die-off
----------------------------------------------
A fish virus new to Ontario has been identified as one cause of the
carp die-off that littered area lakes with 12 000 to 24 000 fish last
summer [2007].

John Cooper, Lake Erie management unit for the Ministry of Natural
Resources (MNR), said extensive testing by the University of Guelph
and the federal fish health labs confirmed finding a new fish virus
to Ontario -- the Koi herpesvirus. The MNR previously identified a
bacteria, columnaris, as the cause of the fish kill, but now say the
new virus also killed fish.

The Koi herpesvirus, 1st found in North America in 1999, was
discovered in 2 fish collected from the Scugog and Pigeon lakes last
year, Cooper said. It only affects carp, goldfish and koi, he said,
and is not a danger to humans, "because it can't live in a body as
warm as a human."

Carp infected with Koi Herpesvirus are safe to eat and handle, he
said. Last year's die-off also will not threaten carp counts for this
season, Cooper said.

"Carp are a prolific fish that can quickly bounce back from a
die-off," he said. There is no evidence the 2007 carp die-off was
caused by a contaminant spill, Cooper said.

Trying to determine what caused last summer's carp kill took
extensive testing, Cooper said, noting one of the difficulties was,
unlike humans, autopsies don't work on fish.

"Once they are dead the natural process may mask the cause," he said.
"We have to get the fish alive and transport to the lab as quickly as
possible."

The MNR released a new formalized protocol to better handle fish
kills in the future. In order to speed the research to determine
causes of die-offs, Cooper said the MNR will collect fish themselves
instead of taking samples from the public.

Side note
---------
Cause of a Koi herpesvirus disease outbreak:
- The Koi herpesvirus virus causes disease and death when water
temperatures are between 18 to 28 DEGC [64.4-82.4 DEGF]. Disease
outbreaks are rare when water temperatures are lower than 13 DEGC [55.4 DEGF].
- Fish are most susceptible when stressed as a result of fluctuating
high water temperatures, crowding, spawning, etc.
- The virus is highly contagious and has been linked to large
mortalities of carp and koi.
- The virus is most likely passed from fish to fish in close contact,
entering the body through the gills or possibly through the intestine.
- The virus lives in fish, in water for short periods of time
(possibly for at least 4 hours, probably less than a day), in feces,
and possibly in the mud bottoms of lakes and rivers.
- Fish infected with Koi herpesvirus may survive a disease outbreak
and become carriers of the virus, passing the virus to other fish.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a herpesvirus infection capable of
inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_) and varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp. - Mod.TG]
