The Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (IAR&T) has declared that an uncommon pest/disease is presently ravaging maize in the south west, which may likely lead to scarcity of maize in the region. The disease has rendered many hectares of maize plantations malnourished and in some instances, stunted and yellowish, without maize buds for eventual harvest. And many farmers are describing it "as an unprecedented phenomenon in recent years."

The institute, while calling on all stakeholders to aggressively address the looming danger, maintained that if not checked, the new discovery portends serious danger for production and consumption of maize in the nation as it forms a large percentage of livestock feeds. It however assured that IAR&T is already setting machinery in motion to control the menace.

[A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes, have been reported to affect maize crops in the region. The symptoms described above are not sufficient for identifying a likely pathogen, pest, or other cause of the problem, but a spread of maize lethal necrosis (see ProMED-mail post 20130123.1510727) from eastern Africa cannot be excluded. Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
