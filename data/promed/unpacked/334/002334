[PPR (peste des petits ruminants), called also pseudorinderpest, goat plague, pest of small ruminants, pest of sheep and goats, kata (a West-African vernacular name), stomatitis-pneumoenteritis syndrome, and pneumoenteritis complex, is a highly contagious disease of goats and sheep caused by a morbillivirus. PPR's clinical signs, as seen in small ruminants, resemble rinderpest in cattle but including respiratory signs (pneumonia). Heavy losses can be seen, especially in goats; all of the affected animals in some herds may die. The disease is included in OIE's list (formerly, it was a List A disease); it is not zoonotic. An effective and safe, live attenuated vaccine is available and has been applied in numerous affected countries with satisfactory results. Additional information on PPR is available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/peste_des_petits_ruminants.pdf.

The current PPR epizootic reportedly started on 5 Dec 2013, in northwestern China, spreading, within less than 4 months, throughout vast parts of the mega State along northern provinces in eastward direction. Just 3 days after reporting the 1st outbreak in the northeastern Liaoning province, bordering North Korea, the current report informs of an outbreak, with 65 percent mortality rate, in the southeastern province of Hunan. For the locations of all 10 outbreaks since 5 Dec 2013, see the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/oqx8okm.

China's PPR control policy is, according to the OIE reports, based upon stamping out without vaccination, combined with quarantine measures. Without vaccination, China's sheep and goat breeders may be experiencing grave concerns, facing a continued spread of this disastrous disease. China's PPR-susceptible animal population (2012 OIE data) is 143 680 000 sheep and 141 361 000 goats. - Mod.AS
