The Alabama Department of Public Health [ADPH] continues its
investigation of an _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak in Lee County. 13
children and 2 adults who either played in the Splash Park or swam in
the pool at the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatic Center between 4 and 22
Jun 2011 were identified with severe gastrointestinal illness.

So far, 5 children have been confirmed positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7
infection. 4 children were initially hospitalized and 2 remain
hospitalized. The Health Department has contacted the parents of
children of 7 day care centers that had children at the Splash Park
during the period of concern. Symptoms of _E. coli_ can appear up
until 10 days after exposure.

"Based on the information that we have now, it appears that the
common source of exposure was the Aquatic Center," said State health
officer Dr Donald Williamson. "Because of the risk for outbreak of
illness, it is essential that public pools and water parks follow
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for adequate
chlorine and pH levels."

Illnesses in recreational waters are caused by germs spread by
swallowing, breathing in mists or aerosols, or having contact with
contaminated water in swimming pools, water parks, hot tubs,
interactive fountains, water play areas, lakes, rivers, or oceans.
Infection may also occur by touching the environment in petting zoos
and other animal exhibits or by eating food prepared by people who did
not wash their hands well after using the toilet.

ADPH notified city officials of possible contamination on 20 Jun
2011. ADPH collected water samples for testing from the facilities at
the Aquatic Center. The ADPH Bureau of Clinical Laboratories ran the
initial tests, which were negative for bacteria. Negative results do
not guarantee that bacteria were not present. Additional water samples
have been collected and sent to the CDC for testing and results are
pending.

People with diarrhea caused by potential waterborne pathogens should
not use recreational water venues such as swimming pools, water
slides, and water parks for 2 weeks after symptoms resolve. Following
CDC guidelines, the City of Opelika has treated all facilities at the
Splash Park and Aquatic Center, and the facilities are open.

[Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ has been reported associated with
swimming pools and water parks in the past. It is not stated whether
there was an issue with adequate chlorination. The source of the
pathogen is not clear but it would seem that a one-time contamination
from an infected person would not be linked to cases occurring over an
almost 3 week period. - Mod.LL]
