In the 1st death from consumption of adulterated kuttu (buckwheat), a
50-year-old MCD [Municipal Corporation of Delhi] employee succumbed to
food poisoning in an east Delhi hospital on Wednesday morning [6 Apr
2011], less than 24 hours after taking ill. More than 300 people were
being treated in hospitals across Delhi and some NCR [national capital
region] areas, while 17 people had been arrested for selling the
spurious food.

Kuttu, which is used as a grain though it's not a cereal, is widely
consumed by those fasting during the 9-day [Hindu festival of]
Navratras, which started on Monday [4 Apr 2011].

"We have arrested 11 people including the owner of Nandu Masala Mill,
which was the maiden supplier to many wholesale retailers and
shopkeepers in east and northeast Delhi. He possibly also supplied to
Ghaziabad shops. We have also arrested 8 shopkeepers who were selling
adulterated buckwheat," said deputy commissioner of police (northeast)
Sanjay Kumar Jain.

The 1st victim of the adulteration, was admitted in Lal Bahadur
Shastri Hospital around 1.30 pm on Tuesday [5 Apr 2011] after he
complained of dizziness and nausea. This victim later suffered a
paralytic attack in hospital. "Prima facie, it appears that his
condition was precipitated due to buckwheat consumption," said
hospital medical superintendent Veer Singh.

[Buckwheat or _Fagopyrum esculentum_ is classified as a pseudocereal
as it is not really a cereal or a grass, although the cereal term is
in many locations most often associated with the name.

Buckwheat has been associated with photosensitization in animals.
However this article does not give us a lot of clinical signs:
dizziness and nausea, and possibly paresis. This is not likely an
effect of the buckwheat rather the adulterating product.

It would seem that if arrests are being made, there is some knowledge
of what the adulterant is. We look forward to a report that will
provide more information regarding the adulterant. - Mod.TG
