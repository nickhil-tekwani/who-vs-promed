Progress in measles control - Kenya: 2002-2007
-----------------------------------------------
In 2000, countries represented by the World Health Organization (WHO)
Regional Office for Africa established a goal to reduce, by the end of
2005, measles mortality to 50 per cent of the 506 000 deaths from measles
estimated in 1999 (1). Strategies adopted included strengthening routine
vaccination, providing a 2nd opportunity for measles vaccination through
supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), monitoring disease trends, and
improving measles case management. In Kenya, an east African country with a
population estimated at 33.4 million in 2005, the Kenya Expanded Programme
on Immunization (KEPI) in the Ministry of Health began implementing these
strategies in 2002 with a wide age range catch-up SIA and reduced the
number of reported measles cases by more than 99 per cent, from 11 304 in
2001 to 20 in 2004. [The WHO Regional Office for Africa recommends an
initial, nationwide catch-up SIA targeting all children aged 9 months--14
years and periodic nationwide follow-up SIAs targeting all children born
since the last SIA] A follow-up SIA, initially scheduled for July 2005, was
postponed to 2006 to include concurrent distribution of long-lasting
insecticide-treated bednets (LLINs).
This report documents progress made in reducing measles morbidity and
mortality in Kenya and describes the consequences of a large measles
outbreak, beginning in September 2005, on the integrated measles follow-up SIA.
Immunization activities
-----------------------
KEPI was established within the Kenya Ministry of Health in 1980, with the
goal of immunizing all children in the country against 6
vaccine-preventable diseases [tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,
poliomyelitis, and measles]. National coverage with one dose of measles
vaccine (provided at age 9 months) increased in the early 1990s to 84 per
cent of children aged 12 months but decreased to 72 per cent in 2002 [see
figure in original text]. To accelerate measles control, goals were
established in 2002 to achieve and maintain national average measles
vaccination coverage at 90 per cent, with every district expected to attain
coverage greater than 85 per cent. Since then, reported national measles
vaccination coverage increased to 77 per cent in 2006, and the proportion
of districts with coverage greater than 85 per cent increased from 10 per
cent in 2002 (8 of 77 districts) to 35 per cent in 2006 (27 of 78
districts) [In 2003, the number of districts in Kenya was increased from 77
to 78]. To provide a 2nd opportunity for measles vaccination, a nationwide
measles catch-up SIA was conducted in June 2002, targeting children aged 9
months-14 years; about 13 million children were vaccinated, 98 per cent of
the estimated target population. A multistage cluster survey provided a
similar estimate of national measles SIA coverage at 94 per cent, with 7 of
9 provinces achieving coverage greater than 90 per cent. The 2 exceptions
were North East Province at 84 per cent and Coast Province at 90 per cent.
Measles surveillance
--------------------
After the 2002 measles catch-up SIA, Kenya implemented a system of
case-based surveillance for measles within the existing surveillance
network for acute flaccid paralysis. In this system, for each suspected
measles patient who visits a health facility, a measles case report form is
completed, and a blood specimen is taken for measles immunoglobulin M
testing at the national measles laboratory. In an outbreak, defined as 5 or
more cases reported from the same health area in a month, specimens are
collected from 5 cases. If 3 or more test positive, the outbreak is
confirmed as measles, untested cases are confirmed by epidemiologic
linkage, and specimen collection stops after throat swabs are collected for
viral genotyping.
In 2003, a total of 1791 suspected measles cases were reported through this
case-based surveillance system, including 59 cases that were confirmed by
laboratory or epidemiologic linkage. In 2004, a total of 1968 suspected
cases were reported, including 20 that were confirmed; in 2005, a total of
1061 suspected cases were reported, including 151 that were confirmed.
During 2003-2005, more than 99 per cent of suspected cases were reported
with a blood specimen, and the proportion of districts reporting at least
one suspected measles case increased from 69 per cent in 2004 to 99 per
cent in 2005. [WHO Regional Office for Africa performance indicators for
quality measles surveillance include collection of blood specimens from
more than 80 per cent of persons with suspected measles (to assess
specificity) and reporting of at least one suspected measles case with a
patient blood specimen from more than 80 per cent of districts (to assess
sensitivity)].
Measles outbreak and follow-up SIA
----------------------------------
A follow-up measles SIA had been planned for July 2005, about 36 months
after the initial catch-up SIA in June 2002, an interval between SIAs
recommended by the African Regional Measles Technical Advisory Group (2).
However, to expedite meeting the 2005 World Health Assembly target of 80
per cent of children aged less than 5 years sleeping under an
insecticide-treated bednet, the Kenya Ministry of Health and the
Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee decided to integrate distribution of
LLINs with the measles follow-up SIA. Raising additional funds for
procurement and distribution of the LLINs required postponement of the SIA,
initially to July 2006.
In September 2005, a cluster of laboratory-confirmed measles cases was
reported from a predominantly Somali immigrant community in Nairobi. During
September 2005-May 2007, this outbreak grew to a total of 2544 confirmed
measles cases reported from 71 (91 per cent) of the 78 districts, with peak
monthly totals of 375 and 332 confirmed cases reported in April and August
2006, respectively [illustrated by a figure in the original text]. Viruses
were isolated from specimens collected from about 80 people and identified
as genotype B3, with one additional virus from Rift Valley Province
identified as D4.
Of the 2544 confirmed outbreak cases, 944 (37 per cent) were in people aged
9-59 months, 491 (19 per cent) were in people aged 5-14 years, and 658 (26
per cent) were in people aged more than 15 years. A history of measles
vaccination was provided by 466 (18 per cent) of the patients, including
220 (23 per cent) of the 944 children aged 9-59 months and 95 (26 per cent)
of the 366 children aged 5-9 years. Vaccination status was unknown for 1192
people (47 per cent) [see figure in original text]. During the outbreak, 24
measles deaths were documented; 17 of the decedents were children aged less
than 5 years, and 9 had a history of measles vaccination.
In response to this outbreak, the planned follow-up SIA was moved forward
from July to April 2006. Because adequate funds were not available to
support a nationwide measles campaign in April and the full shipment of
LLINs purchased for the SIA had not arrived, the SIA was divided into 2
phases. Phase I, conducted during 29 Apr-5 May 2006, covered the 16
districts most affected by measles outbreaks and most at risk for
poliovirus importation from neighboring Somalia and Ethiopia (3). All the
districts administered measles vaccination to children aged 9-59 months,
vitamin A to children aged 6-59 months, and monovalent type 1 oral polio
vaccine (mOPV1) to children aged 0-59 months. Each intervention reached
more children than expected, based on population estimates; 670 016
received measles vaccine (120 per cent of the 558 699 targeted), 785 180
received mOPV1 (119 per cent of the 663 949 targeted), and 717 829 received
vitamin A (120 per cent of the 597 794 targeted).
Phase II was conducted during 8-12 Jul 2006, in the 62 remaining districts.
Overall, 4 590 225 children received measles vaccine (110 per cent of the 4
180 330 targeted), and 4 716 471 received vitamin A (105 per cent of the 4
486 266 targeted). 4 districts with an estimated combined population of 181
434 (4 per cent of the total) did not achieve 90 per cent reported coverage
with measles vaccine. 6 districts also provided mOPV1 to 490 974 children
(99.6 per cent of the 492 813 targeted).
LLINs were distributed to children aged less than 5 years in one district
in April [2006] from preexisting stock and in 21 districts in July [2006]
after the shipment of LLINs had arrived, reaching 1741 005 children (104
per cent of the estimated target population of 1 761 582). In September
2006, an additional 2 million LLINs were distributed in the remaining 23
malaria-endemic districts in Kenya. These SIAs were conducted with the
support of the Measles Initiative and other partners.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Implementation of the WHO Regional Office for Africa strategies for measles
mortality reduction achieved in 2004 the goal of reducing deaths caused by
measles by half, both regionally and globally, from 1999 to 2005 (4). In
Kenya, accelerated measles-control activities resulted in a greater than 99
per cent decrease in measles cases to an incidence of 6 to 29 cases per 1
million population during the 36 months after the catch-up SIA of June
2002. Achieving high levels of vaccination coverage during that SIA, even
though routine coverage was less than 80 per cent, likely led to the rapid
reduction in measles.
In multiple countries, integrating high-priority health interventions with
vaccination campaigns has attracted political support, allowed for pooling
of resources, and increased community participation (5, 6, 7). Achieving
high coverage with insecticide-treated bednets is a key strategy for
reducing the burden of malaria. In Kenya, delaying the measles follow-up
SIA by one year enabled distribution of LLINs to more than 90 per cent of
children aged less than 5 years in the target districts. Kenya, therefore,
joins the ranks of countries that have rapidly increased coverage with
insecticide-treated bednets by integrating bednet distribution with measles
SIAs (5-7).
However, Kenya's experience also highlights a disadvantage of delaying a
follow-up SIA beyond the recommended interval. This delay likely resulted
in a nationwide measles outbreak in 2005 that ultimately produced about
2500 laboratory-confirmed cases and 24 deaths.
Surveillance data indicate that the heaviest burden of disease was in
children born after the 2002 catch-up SIA, who would have received a 2nd
opportunity for measles vaccination during the follow-up SIA. With less
than 80 per cent routine coverage since 1997 and the delay in the follow-up
SIA, population immunity was low enough in Kenya to sustain a large
outbreak after a measles importation.
Successful control of measles in Kenya will depend on continued improvement
of routine vaccination services; conducting regular, periodic, and
high-quality follow-up SIAs; improving measles case management; and
monitoring success by using case-based surveillance with laboratory
confirmation. The intervals between SIAs must be based not only on disease
epidemiology and SIA coverage but also on estimated routine coverage (2).
In addition, despite the documented advantages of integrating measles SIAs
with other life-saving interventions, in some countries, consideration
should be given to the risks of delaying measles SIAs to gain the benefits
from the other interventions.
