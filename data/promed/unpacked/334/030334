Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - Weekly update 64
-------------------------------
Tropical regions of South and Southeast Asia continue to experience
geographically regional or widespread influenza activity (represented
by countries such as India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia,
Sri Lanka, and Indonesia). Many countries in the region are reporting
increasing or sustained high levels of respiratory disease, and a few
(Thailand and Brunei Darussalam) have begun to report a declining
trend in the level of respiratory diseases.

In tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean (represented
by countries such as Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Panama, and Cuba), influenza activity continues to be geographically
regional or widespread; however, most are now reporting a declining
trend in the level of respiratory diseases.

Countries in the equatorial and tropical regions of South America
(represented by Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, and parts of Brazil)
continue to experience geographically regional or widespread influenza
activity, with many reporting an increasing trend in the level of
respiratory diseases.

Although many countries in temperate regions of the southern
hemisphere (Chile, Argentina, Australia, and New Zealand) have passed
the peak of their winter influenza epidemic, sustained influenza
activity continues to be reported in South Africa and in the Southern
and Western parts of Australia.

In temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, there are wide
geographical variations in the level of influenza activity being
reported. In Japan, influenza activity continues to increase past the
seasonal epidemic threshold, indicating an early beginning to the
annual influenza season. In Canada and the United States, influenza
activity remains low overall; however, regional increases are being
detected in the southeastern United States. In Europe and Central and
Western Asia, although little influenza activity is being reported, a
few countries are reporting geographically widespread influenza
activity (Austria and Israel) or an increasing trend in respiratory
diseases (Netherlands and Romania).

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus continues to be the predominant
circulating virus of influenza, both in the northern and southern
hemisphere. All pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analysed to date
have been antigenically and genetically similar to
A/California/7/2009-like pandemic H1N1 2009 virus. See below for
detailed laboratory surveillance update.

Laboratory surveillance update
-------------------
4 Sep 2009 - The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN)
continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses,
including seasonal viruses.

Since the beginning of the pandemic in 19 Apr 2009 to 15 Aug 2009, a
total of 80 countries reported to FluNet, the WHO influenza
virological database. The total number of specimens reported positive
for influenza viruses by National Influenza Centres (NICs) was 85 923.
Of these, 50 888 (59.2 percent) were pandemic (H1N1), 5259 (6.1
percent) were seasonal A (H1), 11 496 (13.4 percent) were A (H3), 14
816 (17.2 percent) were A (not subtyped) and 3464 (4.1 percent) were
influenza B.

26 countries reported to the FluNet on week 34. The total number of
specimens reported positive for influenza viruses by the NICs in these
countries was 6329. Of these, 3867 (61.1 percent) were pandemic
(H1N1), 215 (3.4 percent) were seasonal A (H1), 1416 (22.4 percent)
were A (H3), 730 (11.5 percent) were A (not subtyped) and 101 (1.6
percent) were influenza B. On average, the pandemic (H1N1) accounted
for 61 percent of all influenza detections. Pandemic (H1N1) influenza
virus continues to be the predominant circulating virus of influenza,
both in the northern and southern hemisphere.

Laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 as officially
reported to WHO by States Parties to the IHR (2005) as of 30 Aug 2009
---------------------------------
A map of affected countries and deaths as of 30 Aug 2009 is available
at:
<http://gamapserver.who.int/h1n1/cases-deaths/h1n1_casesdeaths.html>.
The countries and overseas territories/communities that have newly
reported their 1st pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed case(s) since the
last web update (No. 63) as of 30 Aug 2009 are Zimbabwe and Djibouti.

Region / Cumulative total as of 30 Aug 2009 - cases / deaths

WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) / 3872 / 11
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) / 116 046 / 2234
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) / 5031 / 21
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) / Over 46 000 / at least 104
WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia(SEARO) / 19 362 / 188
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) / 63 895 / 279
Total* / Over 254 206 / At least 2837

*Given that countries are no longer required to test and report
individual cases, the number of cases reported actually understates
the real number of cases.
