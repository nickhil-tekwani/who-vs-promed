Israel: OIE official follow up report on outbreak reported in Hazafon
["Northern district"]
------------------------------------------
Information received on 26 Feb 2007 from Dr Moshe Chaimovitz, director,
Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, Beit Dagan, Israel.
Two new outbreaks are reported:
1st, in Natur, Golan, Hazafon: 100 cases and 160 susceptible reported in
free-grazing beef cattle.
2nd, in Aramsha, Acco, Hazafon: 20 cases and 50 susceptible cattle and 40
cases with 400 susceptible goats. The cattle are free-grazing beef cattle.
Mortality in goats occurred in young kids.
Causal agent is identified as FMD virus, serotype O.
Control measures include:
movement control inside the country;
screening;
vaccination in response to the outbreak(s);
quarantine;

[According to the OIE notifications and to summarized information included
in circular a/2007/6 of the Israeli veterinary services [Hebrew, dated 25
Feb 2007], FMD serotype O has been detected, since the beginning of the
current epizootic on 28 Dec 2006, in 14 cattle units, which include a total
of approximately 5000 heads. 13 of the units were beef cattle operations
(grazing or feedlots), while one included young dairy calves. The total
number of reported, clinically affected cattle was 360 (attack rate 7.2 per
cent), most of them young, unvaccinated animals. 23 of the affected young
cattle died (CFR 6.4 per cent). No case has been detected in producing,
adult dairy cattle; this might be due to the enhanced biosecurity
traditionally applied in such holdings and to the fact that they had been
systematically vaccinated.
On the other hand, 2 affected (most probably unvaccinated) goat herds,
including 920 caprines, suffered severe losses: 300 clinical cases (attack
rate of 32.6 per cent), 229 mortalities (CFR 76.3 per cent). It should be
stressed that most mortalities were seen in young kids (in offspring).
For reasons which remain to be clarified, the incidence of FMD in Israel --
as recorded for decades -- is of a seasonal pattern, though the disease
does not recur every year. Surveillance in the past has shown that
wildlife, including wild boars, might be involved in the epidemiology of
the disease. For background, see the section "epidemiology" in the review
"Foot and Mouth Disease: The Israeli Approach," available on the website
<http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/agriculture/>.
Parallel to the outbreak in Northern Israel, there is an ongoing outbreak
in the West Bank (Palestinian Authority) involving the same serotype O
strain. Outbreaks have been reported in the Nablus and Hebron districts.
The last update to the OIE is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4908>.
It would be interesting to know whether the strain currently circulating in
northern Israel, Nablus and Hebron districts is similar to the O strain
that reportedly has been circulating in Jordan since 1 Nov 2006 and which
was confirmed at Pirbright on 19 Dec 2006 (see archive 20070118.0231). -
