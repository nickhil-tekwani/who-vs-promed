According to a report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination
of Humanitarian Assistance, there were 315 deaths from monkeypox in the
diamond mining town of Mbuji-Mayi in 1999.
I don't kow what the mortality rate is with monkeypox but it can't be very
high, which would mean a lot of people must have been infected to produce
315 deaths.

[The case fatality rate for monkeypox in children ranges from 1-14%, so
taking an average of 7% there may have been 2000 cases. From 1970-94 only
400 cases were reported from Africa, most of them from the DRC; most were
found during a 5-year period of active surveillance by WHO from 1981-86.
In 1996 there were 70 suspect cases with 6 deaths, and the virus was
isolated. Smallpox vaccine protects against monkeypox, but vaccination was
stopped in the DRC in 1982 and WHO does not recommend restarting it.
(Chin, J. (ed.) Control of Communicable Diseases Manual 2000, 17th edn.,
p.458). So the virus may be emerging. - Mod.JW
