The Onondaga County Health Department has confirmed 3 more cases of wild animals testing positive for rabies from 3 different towns.

Interim health commissioner Michelle Mignano says that a rabid raccoon was found in the Route 11A area in Nedrow, and 2 rabid bats were found -- one in the Town of Manlius and 1 in the Town of Lafayette. That brings the total number of confirmed rabies cases in Onondaga County this year [2014] to 10.

"We are seeing high numbers of animals testing positive for rabies this season [2014], further emphasizing the need to remain vigilant and to never touch or feed wildlife because they may be rabid," Mignano says. "Rabies is preventable by avoiding close contact to wildlife and domestic pets that you are unfamiliar with."

[In the USA, several wildlife variants of Lyssavirus exist, which circulate in bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.

While bat rabies is found throughout the USA, main terrestrial reservoirs differ depending on the geographical location. Raccoon rabies virus variant is present in the eastern United States (see map at http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2012-surveillance/reservoirs.html).

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs and cats in the area up to date and not to approach wildlife with unusual behavior.
