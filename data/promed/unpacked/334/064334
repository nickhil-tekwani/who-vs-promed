Bird flu returns to EU with confirmed case in Hungary
-----------------------------------------------
Hungarian authorities on Wednesday [24 Jan 2007] reported an outbreak
of bird flu in the southeast of the country, the 1st instance of the
virus in the EU since August 2006, the European Commission said.
"The European Commission has been informed by the Hungarian
authorities today [24 Jan 2007] of an outbreak of avian influenza in
Csongrad County, southeast Hungary," the European Union's executive
arm said in a statement.
The virus was detected after an abnormally high mortality rate was
reported in a flock of over 3000 geese, and tests carried out by
Hungary's national laboratory confirmed the virus to be the highly
pathogenic H5 strain.
Samples are to be sent to an EU laboratory in Weybridge, near London,
to determine whether it is the H5N1 virus, which is potentially fatal
to humans.
Acting on suspicion of the disease, the Hungarian authorities have
already culled the infected flock in order to prevent the spread of
the virus, the EU's executive arm said.
They were also said to be enforcing EU rules requiring a 3-km
(2-mile) protection zone and 10-km surveillance zone to be set up
around the infected farm.
It is the 1st incidence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in
the EU since August 2006, when one case occurred in a zoo in Dresden,
eastern Germany.
The disease situation will be reviewed at an EU expert meeting on
Friday [26 Jan 2007].
Earlier Wednesday [24 Jan 2007], Croatia announced it had banned
imports of poultry from neighboring Hungary amid bird flu fears.

Europe may face repeat of winter's bird flu: OIE interview
-----------------------------------------------
A flare up of bird flu in Asia and a suspected case in Hungary
highlights a failure to tackle the virus at the source and may herald
a repeat of the disease's sweep across Europe last winter, a health
expert said on Tuesday [23 Jan 2007].
The start of 2007 has brought fresh outbreaks of bird flu across
Asia. Five people have died of the H5N1 virus in Indonesia since 1
Jan 2007, while new cases in poultry have been reported in Japan,
Thailand and Viet Nam.
"In some parts of the world, we have not done what should have been
done, and that's to fight the disease in birds," Alex Thiermann, head
of the standard-setting committee at the World Animal Health
Organisation (OIE), told Reuters. "The disease reporting and the
rapidity of detection is better, but something we're not doing is to
break the cycle from wildlife to domestic birds," he said in a
telephone interview.
While H5N1 is essentially a poultry disease, it can be carried by
wildfowl and can be fatal to humans if they come into prolonged close
contact with diseased birds. In many countries like Indonesia,
millions of backyard fowl live in close proximity to humans, and
health education campaigns often have been patchy and rules difficult
to enforce.
"We're failing to address the problem at its most effective and
earliest step," Thiermann said. "We are not doing the right thing
with poultry." Thiermann said that so far the virus had remained
remarkably stable, given the usual unpredictability of influenza
viruses. "I fear us becoming too complacent. The virus has not
significantly changed in its behavior, but how much longer can that
last?," he asked. Thiermann said that while more information on what
exactly was the cause of the suspected bird flu in Hungary [now
confirmed; see previous item. - Mod.AS] , it was a worrying sign and
could mean the virus was on the move again. "If it is beginning to
show up again, is it the beginning of the cycle all the way from the
north to the south again? Or is it flaring up from pockets that were
already there?" he said. "I suggest the former, and if it's moving as
it did last year [2006], we know at least in part it's going to be
related to migratory waterfowl," he said. "And if the story is
repeating itself, it's because we didn't do the right thing where we
should have done."
However, he said governments had learnt a lot from last winter's
cases and generally Europe was well prepared to handle further
outbreaks, although there are weak spots, particularly in central and
eastern Europe. "If the virus were to come back to Europe, we should
not see a worse picture than we saw last year [2006]; I would be very
surprised if it goes beyond one or 2 establishments," he said. "The
problem is what happens if it comes back to Turkey or Africa. If we
get a new wave there, the picture could be as bad or even worse, he
added. "We need to emphasize to countries the importance of immediate
reporting. We may need to mobilize forces to help countries that have
not even detected it yet," he said. "And the next couple of weeks
will be interesting; will we begin to see the 2006 picture all over again?"
