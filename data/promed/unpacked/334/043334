Doctors have warned butchers and tannery workers that they may suffer
deadly viral haemorrhage fever if they do not take precautions. A tannery
here has been closed after one worker died and two others were infected by
the fever.
They said every precaution should be taken to ensure that tanneries operate
under the strictest hygienic conditions. Otherwise, those who work there
could fall victim to a fatal disease produced by a non-flying tick that
survives on animal skins and is easily passed on to tanners. Butchers who
slaughter and skin illegally imported sheep may be at serious risk, they say.
"The authorities should be very strict in monitoring the slaughter of
animals outside Fujairah abattoir because the butchers could be exposed to
deadly diseases which they may pass on to others." He [who? urged
officials to tighten monitoring at land borders to prevent illegal imports
of sheep and cattle. The seaports are already under control and all sheep
are examined on-site by Municipality veterinarians.

[Lord help us if there are flying ticks. I abbreviated this media report
(which does not indicate how the diagnosis was made) but I do not believe I
left out anything of importance. I did omit some nonsense. Also, the
report called the disease "Crimean Congo Haemorrhage Fever, or CCHF".
Neither is quite correct. The virus is named "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever virus" and it is to be abbreviated "C-CHF". Small matter relative to
the illnesses, which are treatable with ribavirin.
The report also mentioned that the greatest risk in the United Arab
Emirates was sheep (ostensibly infected or carrying C-CHF-infected ticks)
imported legally or brought in illegally from elsewhere, particularly from
Somalia, Iran and the Congo. This virus has been found from southern
Africa to Russia and might very well be enzootic in the United Arab
Emirates. It can move around in ticks on migrating birds. - Mod.CHC
