The following is a summary of information provided today (Wednesday 13
November) to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) by Dr Gardner
Murray, Australia's chief veterinary officer.
As previously reported, an outbreak of Newcastle disease (ND) due to
virulent virus of Australian origin occurred in a 7500 bird multi-aged
poultry layer (egg production) enterprise near Horsley Park, western
Sydney, New South Wales. Disease was first reported on 22 October and
destruction and disposal of birds on this property was completed on 27
October. Cleaning and disinfection on the property is continuing.
On 6 November, surveillance in the restricted area (RA) around this
property detected one bird with nervous signs in a group that displayed
respiratory signs in a 9000 bird, three shed, multi-aged layer farm about 2
km from the first infected farm. This property was near the boundary of the
RA and its birds had been vaccinated with live V4 ND vaccine on 27 October,
at which time the flock presented as healthy.
The property was placed in quarantine on 8 November, and on 9 November the
Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, confirmed the presence of
virulent ND virus of Australian origin. At this stage, the disease is
confined to one of the 3 sheds and mortalities across the farm remain low
and within normal production limits. Destruction and disposal of birds on
the second infected property are scheduled to be completed by 14 November
and the RA has been expanded to include a wider area around the property.
Surveillance on poultry farms around the infected properties continues and
compulsory ND vaccination continues to be implemented in the RA and
surrounding control area, accompanied by heightened active and passive
surveillance. Strict controls have been implemented to ensure that there is
minimal risk of disease spread from the new infected property. The response
is consistent with the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN)
for ND <http://www.aahc.com.au/ausvetplan/>. Further details on the
response to the incident in NSW are available on the NSW Agriculture
website <http://www.agric.nsw.gov.au/reader/15964)>.
The most recent outbreak of ND in Australia was reported to OIE on 12 May
2002 in a poultry layer farm near Meredith in Victoria. Slaughter of all
birds on the property was completed on 24 May 2002, followed by a cleaning
and disinfection program. Following negative surveillance results,
Victorian authorities lifted all quarantine restrictions related to this
outbreak on 2 September 2002. The rest of Australia remains free of ND.
