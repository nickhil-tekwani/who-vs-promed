Researchers at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary
Medicine at Virginia Tech have found strains of the hepatitis E virus
in farmed rabbits for the 1st time in the United States.

Hepatitis E was found in rabbits in China in 2009, but this is the 1st
time it has been found in rabbits in the US. The virus was first found
in animals by the senior author of the study, XJ Meng, professor of
biomedical sciences and pathobiology, in 1997 in pigs. It has since
been identified in other animals, including rats, deer, and wild
boars. Hepatitis E virus found in pigs can be transmitted from animal
to person, and the virus in rabbits has the potential of also being
transmitted from rabbit to person following a fecal to oral route.

[Hepatitis E has only been recognized as a disease since approximately
1980. While there are few cases, it is likely that more cases exist
than are actually diagnosed.

Hepatitis E has been considered a waterborne disease, and contaminated
water or food supplies have been implicated in major outbreaks.
Consumption of faecally contaminated drinking water has given rise to
epidemics, and the ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the
source of sporadic cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of
zoonotic spread of the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs,
cows, sheep, goats, and rodents are susceptible to infection. The risk
factors for HEV infection are related to poor sanitation in large
areas of the world, and HEV shedding in faeces. Person-to-person
transmission is uncommon. There has been no evidence for sexual
transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest rates of
infection occur in regions where low standards of sanitation promote
the transmission of the virus. Epidemics of hepatitis E have been
reported in Central and South-East Asia, North and West Africa, and in
Mexico, especially where fecal contamination of drinking water is
common. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E have also been reported
elsewhere and serological surveys suggest a global distribution of
strains of hepatitis E of low pathogenicity. In general, hepatitis E
is a self-limiting viral infection followed by recovery. Prolonged
viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and chronic infection does not
occur.

In hepatitis E found in pigs, the raw pork liver has been
demonstrated, at least experimentally to pass the virus to the
consumer of the pork. This very brief article indicates that rabbit
meat may have the same potential.

As with all hepatitis infections, the liver is the organ likely to
fail first in these infected rabbits. - Mod.TG]
