You [Mod.CHC queried the report from Indonesia that most of the DHF
[dengue hemorrhagic fever cases (and mortality) were in children and you
asked whether anyone knew of a situation in which transmission of all four
dengue viruses was so intense that persons reaching adulthood were at no
risk of [developing the disease.
This is precisely the epidemiology of dengue in many urban regions of SE
Asia, particularly in Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and perhaps
to a lesser degree, Indonesia.
I can speak most authoritatively regarding Thailand, and greater Bangkok in
particular. For most years in the past two decades, all four [dengue
virus types have been documented to cause severe disease in children.
Although in any year, there is usually a predominant type of virus isolated
from patients with DHF, the proportion attributable to the dominant type is
usually <50%, with the remainder comprised of varying proportions of the
other three serotypes. Every 2-3 years, the dominant type changes; most
frequently, DEN-2 virus has been the dominant type, but the largest annual
epidemic before 1997-8 was in 1987, caused by DEN-3 virus. What is seen in
Bangkok may differ from another large city in Thailand, but the major
trends are country-wide. The multiple host and virus factors that promote
the waxing and waning of a virus serotype are unknown, but surely include
cohort effects comprised of host experience (immunity including enhancing
antibodies) with dengue in years past.
Few cases of dengue disease are documented among adults (age >18 yrs); DHF
in adults occurs but is a true rarity. Although adults may become infected
with dengue viruses, the infections rarely are overt. I am aware of no data
on the frequency of inapparent infections in Thai adults. It is very
possible that they do occur and that we should consider Thai adults as
immune (protected against disease) but lacking "sterile" immunity.
There are no serologic tests that can accurately determine the proportion
of a population that has been infected sequentially with all four dengue
virus serotypes. Nevertheless, cord blood from [some mothers delivering
babies in Bangkok contains neutralizing antibodies to all four dengue virus
types and their offspring are protected against dengue [caused by any of
the types (at least against disease severe enough to prompt evaluation in
a hospital outpatient department). The protection lasts 6-9 months, until
maternal antibodies wane.

[We are indebted to Bruce for this marvelous and succinct summary. I am
now both enlightened and confused. In the recent Cuban epidemic, Gustavo
Kouri reported that "204/205 cases of DHF/DSS occurred in adults, only one
case was reported in a child. Ninety eight percent of the DHF cases had a
secondary immunological response. The 12 fatal cases were adults and 11 of
them showed a secondary type of infection." Given the disparity of these
observations, the general disagreement regarding apparent:inapparent
infection rates, and the paucity of data regarding temporal persistence if
IgM antibody to dengue viruses, I would welcome it if a knowledgeable
person or persons would provide some explanations and data. I know it is
not the responsibility of our subscribers to educate me but I hope someone
takes pity. Please send such messages directly to me
(<calisher@usa.healthnet.org>), rather than to ProMED-mail. Thanks. -
