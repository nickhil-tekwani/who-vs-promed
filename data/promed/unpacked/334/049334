The most extensive outbreak of Legionnaires' disease ever recorded
has struck a city in southern Spain, claiming 2 lives. More than 300
cases have been confirmed in the city of Murcia, and an additional 300
pneumonia patients are awaiting test results to determine whether they
have contracted the disease, health officials said.
Legionnaires' disease was discovered in the United States when 34
people died at an American Legion conference in Philadelphia in 1976.
The Spanish outbreak is larger in terms of the number of confirmed
cases. The disease is caused by the bacterium _Legionella
pneumophila_, which attacks the lungs and afflicts mostly the elderly
and those with depressed immune systems.
The bacterium, which is commonly found in water, is carried by water
vapor. While it has been found in hot tubs, shower heads, water
faucets, cooling towers and water heaters, it is largely associated
with air-conditioning units, which wed the necessary conditions of
bacteria, heat and water with dispersion.
On 7 Jul 2001, doctors at hospitals in Murcia, 250 miles southeast of
Madrid, noticed an unusually large number of patients with pneumonia.
They alerted health officials and started testing for Legionnaires'
disease. The health department determined that 80 percent of the cases
came from the same section of town and ordered the area's water supply
and air-conditioning units shut off and checked for the bacteria.
Traces of the bacterium were found in 14 cooling towers at 6
buildings, including one at the city's largest department store and
one at the headquarters of the regional government's health
department.
In the past 5 years, at least 26 people in Spain have died from
Legionnaires' disease. An average of 10 000 cases are reported
annually in the United States, but most are single, isolated cases.
Francisco Vargas, a Health Ministry official specializing in
environmental and occupational health, said high summer temperatures
help the disease spread. The country's relative inexperience with
air-conditioning systems and the need to clean them periodically to
prevent bacteria from accumulating are also contributing factors,
according to health officials.
Under Spain's 1978 constitution, regulatory powers controlling upkeep
of air-conditioning systems were moved from the central government to
regions. Some regions require inspection of cooling systems every
month and some every 6 months. Others have delegated the
responsibilities to city governments.

[The case fatality rate is very much lower than in the original _L.
pneumophila_ epidemic in Philadelphia, perhaps because the people
infected were in a younger age group in general, or because the
specific therapy is now known. We await further details. - Mod.JW
