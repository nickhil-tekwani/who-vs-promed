There is now an official cause of the salmonellosis outbreak in Canada and more cases of the illness have been reported. On 21 Dec 2021, the Public Health Agency of Canada released an updated notice on the outbreak to include that based on an investigation, the outbreak has been linked to Alasko brand frozen whole kernel corn. With the 5 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of salmonellosis, the total number of illnesses across Canada related to this outbreak is now 84.

As of 21 Dec 2021, there have been 36 confirmed cases in BC [British Columbia], 30 in Alberta, 4 in Saskatchewan, 12 in Manitoba, and 2 in Ontario. The illnesses reported in Ontario are related to travel to BC and Alberta. "The outbreak appears to be ongoing, as recent illnesses continue to be reported," the Public Health Agency of Canada said.

Initially, it was identified that many people reported eating fresh avocados before they became sick, but more information was needed to actually confirm the source of the outbreak.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued food recall warnings for Alasko brand frozen whole kernel corn. The recalled products were distributed in BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Quebec but could have been distributed nationally. There was also a recall for Fraser Valley Meats brand frozen whole kernel corn on 18 Dec 2021, also due to salmonella.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is warning that people should not eat, use, sell, or serve any recalled Alasko brand or Fraser Valley Meats brand frozen whole kernel corn. This advice applies to individuals, retailers, distributors, manufacturers, and food-service establishments including restaurants across Canada.

[ProMED has previously posted on the recall of frozen whole kernel corn as well as on a possible link of _S._ Enteritis infection to avocado ingestion; this post suggests that the postulated avocado link was not correct and the ongoing outbreak is all related to the frozen corn. The post does not specifically state that the serotype is Enteritidis but the link to avocado was for that serotype. - Mod.LL
