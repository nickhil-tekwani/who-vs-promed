[As always, the question remaining unanswered is: where did this new
outbreak come from? There really is no clue in this report or others
so far. The earlier incident in March 2007 was clearly in a different
kind of population of hobby birds (show ostriches) with only 670
susceptible birds on a single premise. This time, the disease is in
commercial birds totaling about a quarter of a million birds at 4
different sites, which are fairly widely separated. Thus, the
potential for spread is greater than last March.

The location of Al Kharj in Ar Riyad province can be seen at

The location of the other 3 sites can be seen at

<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=24.1,44.5,5>.

Finally, a minor note about the epidemiologic statistics in this
report. You cannot physically remove 444 percent of any population.
This represents an ill-conceived summary statistic, which was flawed
when missing information on the number of susceptible birds for the
denominator of the statistic was summed over the 4 farms. - Mod.PC]
