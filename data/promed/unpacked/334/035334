Virus killing Illinois deer identified;
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) no risk to humans
--------------------------------
An acute, infectious virus has killed white-tailed deer in 4 Illinois
counties and is suspected of causing the death of deer in 5 others,
according to officials with the Illinois Department of Natural
Resources.
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, an often-fatal virus that causes high
fever and severe internal bleeding, has been confirmed in Wayne,
Effingham, Fayette and Cumberland counties, and is considered the
probable cause of unexplained herd deaths in Pope, Macon, Sangamon,
Shelby and Vermilion counties.
"All of the confirmed cases have occurred in captive deer herds, but
wild deer are included among the suspected cases where the cause of
death hasn't been determined," State Veterinarian Dr. Colleen O'Keefe
said. "One farm in Effingham County lost 17 of its 22 deer to the
disease."
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease poses no risk to humans, O'Keefe said.
Other wild ruminants, including elk, mule deer, pronghorn antelope
and bighorn sheep are susceptible to the disease.
Domestic animals such as livestock may become infected, but rarely
exhibit signs of the disease or develop serious illness.
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease is spread by biting midges, or gnats.
The midges transmit the virus from infected to uninfected animals as
they feed. There currently is neither a vaccine nor an effective
treatment for the disease. "The only way to control the virus is to
control the insect population," O'Keefe said.
Officials believe the dry summer in Southern Illinois -- where the
cases are concentrated -- has contributed to the current outbreak. As
shallow ponds and creek beds dry up, deer and insects are
congregating around fewer bodies of drinking water, enabling the
virus to spread rapidly.
Signs develop about 7 days after exposure to the virus and include
loss of appetite, excessive salivation, muscle weakness, lameness,
depression and a rapid pulse and respiration rate. 8-36 hours after
onset of signs, animals enter a "shock-like" state, become prostrate
and die.
Farmers with ill deer should not assume the animals are infected with
epizootic hemorrhagic disease, even if they are exhibiting classic
signs. A veterinarian should be called to give the deer a check-up.
If the animal dies, the Illinois Department of Agriculture's animal
disease laboratories in Centralia or Galesburg will perform a
postmortem exam to determine the cause of death. The fee for the exam
ranges from $40 to $100 depending upon the level of testing that is
required.
Hunters who witness a deer exhibiting signs of epizootic hemorrhagic
disease are urged to call their local conservation office.

[EHD is an acute, infectious, often fatal viral disease of some wild
ruminants. This malady, characterized by extensive hemorrhages, has
been responsible for significant epizootics in deer in the northern
United States and southern Canada. A similar hemorrhagic disease
called bluetongue also occurs in wild ruminants. The 2 diseases are
antigenically different, although there are similar clinical signs.
The 1st occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in
1955, when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus
virginianus_) succumbed in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was
considered a new disease of deer, and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic
disease" was suggested to describe its main clinical and pathological
features.
Since these initial confirmed outbreaks of EHD, documented epizootics
have occurred in white-tailed deer in South Dakota, North Dakota,
Wyoming, and Alberta, Canada. Suspected EHD outbreaks have occurred
in Missouri, Washington, Nebraska, Iowa, and British Columbia. South
Dakota, Missouri, and Nebraska have experienced periodic outbreaks of
EHD, and the disease might be considered enzootic in these areas.
Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily
among white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O.
hemionus_) and pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have also
succumbed.
The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_
biting fly or gnat. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly
incriminated vector in North America. A common observation in
outbreaks involving large numbers of deer (as in Michigan, New
Jersey, and Alberta) is that they are single epizootics that do not
recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer (as experienced in
South Dakota and Nebraska) occur almost annually, and the disease
appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of
EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October)
and have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.
Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are similar. White-tailed deer
develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A consistent
characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially
lose their appetite and fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often
salivate excessively, develop rapid pulse and respiration, and
finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the
blood result in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa, hence the name
"bluetongue." Between 8 and 36 hours following the onset of
observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become
prostrate, and die.
The gross and histological lesions of EHD are characterized by
extensive hemorrhage, ranging from pin-point to massive in size, and
involve different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs
appear to be exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved
being the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract.
Extensive hemorrhaging is the result of interference with the
blood-clotting mechanism together with degeneration of blood vessel
walls.
Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant
effect upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers
drastically. Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild
ruminants. The EHD virus can infect domestic animals but rarely
causes disease. Presently there is no evidence that the virus
crosses into humans.
