Patient is no longer infected but will remain in isolation for now
------------------------------------------------------------------
A Ugandan man being treated for Ebola in Germany is no longer infected and is headed toward a full recovery, officials at the University Hospital Frankfurt said on Wednesday [5 Nov 2014]. The patient, a doctor who contracted the disease while working in Sierra Leone for a nongovernmental organization, arrived in the country for treatment on 3 Oct [2014] He was in critical condition and suffered multiple organ failures. The patient is now free of the virus and able to move without pain. He will remain in isolation for the time being.

"We've really only known for a few days that he is out of the woods -- 10 days ago we weren't 100 percent sure," Dr. Timo Wolf, the lead physician for his treatment, said at a press briefing....

The doctors said Frankfurt medical staff weren't in danger, using optimal protective clothing, including 3 pairs of gloves, and a buddy system to prevent oversights. The team used around 50 protective suits a day. "Training is the decisive thing," said Prof. Hans-Reinhard Brodt, director of the clinic's HIV center. The cost of the Frankfurt patient's treatment is already around EUR 1 million (USD 1.25 million), Chairman and Medical Director of the University Hospital, Prof. Juergen Schoelmerich said. While both the hospital and the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, have supported the treatment, the clinic is in discussions with the insurer of the NGO regarding payment.

In total, Germany has 7 special isolation wards with 47 beds available to treat patients, the federal health ministry said. The hospital will require 2-3 weeks to decontaminate the facilities and equipment used to treat the patient, but could accept additional patients within hours if required, Dr. Wolf said.... -- more

Texas' Ebola outbreak ends
--------------------------
As of midnight Friday [7 Nov 2014], it was 21 days since anyone got Ebola or was in contact with someone who got Ebola in Texas [USA]. "God willing, we are going to be Ebola-free Friday midnight," said Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, the elected official who oversaw the county's response to its 3-person outbreak, before the deadline passed.

It started when Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian citizen planning to settle in the United States, became sick and was at 1st mistakenly sent home from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. He returned 2 days later by ambulance and was diagnosed with Ebola. Officials had to track as many as 50 people who may have been in contact with Duncan. But the real scare came when 2 nurses, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, became infected while caring for him. Vinson had traveled to Ohio to make wedding plans and, even though she wasn't diagnosed until she came back to Dallas, her travels set off waves of anxiety.... -- more

[3] Europe: EU funds for vaccine research

EU scheme commits USD 350 million for research on Ebola vaccines, tests
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Europe Union and drugmakers pledged on Thursday [6 Nov 2014] to invest 280 million euros (USD 350 million) in Ebola research, with the lion's share going to the testing and manufacture of potential vaccines. The funding will go to projects backed by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private scheme jointly paid for by the European Commission and the pharmaceuticals industry.

Reuters reported on 22 Oct [2014] that an IMI investment of around 200 million euros was pending. Since then, further discussions have been held about the resources needed for various projects and the amount has been increased. The final document setting out the plans commits the European Commission to giving as much as 140 million euros [about USD 175 million], with companies providing an equivalent amount in staff time, goods and services. "The EU is determined to help find a solution to Ebola. We are putting our money where our mouth is and boosting EU research on Ebola with an additional 280 million euros," said Carlos Moedas, European Commissioner for research.

The move shows how momentum is building to get medical intervention, especially vaccines, to West Africa as soon as possible, to try to control the world's worst Ebola outbreak, which has killed nearly 5000 people, according to official data. Many experts believe the true death toll is a lot higher.

The EU is also beginning its biggest single operation of transporting supplies to West Africa, with a Dutch ship sailing on Thursday [6 Nov 2014] from the Netherlands, loaded with ambulances, mobile hospitals, laboratories and other equipment provided by 9 European countries. With a total budget of 3.3 billion euros [about USD 4.1 billion] for the period 2014 to 2024, Europe's IMI scheme is the world's biggest public-private partnership in life sciences.... In the case of Ebola, 5 urgent projects have been identified involving the 3 stages of vaccine clinical trials:

- vaccine manufacturing;
- vaccine transport and storage;
- regimens for vaccination deployment;
- and rapid diagnostic tests.

The aim is to head off some of the technical obstacles that public health officials, governments and drugmakers face as they try to develop the world's 1st Ebola vaccines in record time. The challenges include finding enough vaccine manufacturing and filling capacity, getting accelerated clinical trial results, winning rapid regulatory approvals and building a supply chain in Africa for products that must be stored at ultra-low temperatures.

For diagnostics, the goal is to develop a simple test for Ebola infection that can generate results within 3 hours and preferably in less than 30 minutes.

2 leading vaccine candidates from GlaxoSmithKline and NewLink Genetics are already in human safety trials. Another 5 should begin testing in the 1st quarter of next year [2015]. One from Johnson & Johnson will start trials in January [2015]. The 3 leading companies hope to make millions of doses over the course of 2015.

[4] USA: safety of lab equipment
Date: Thu 6 Nov 2014

Latest Ebola fear: Safety of lab equipment
------------------------------------------
When physicians at the Nebraska Medical Center got their 1st Ebola case in September [2014], they knew they'd rely heavily on sophisticated blood-test machines to monitor the man's condition. They didn't expect the virus might leave the machines incapacitated for longer than the patient.

Several leading manufacturers of high-tech diagnostic devices have alerted hospital laboratories that they will restrict service, support and warranties for equipment used to test blood and organ functions for Ebola patients. Fearing infections, some decline to have their technicians perform the tuning and maintenance the expensive devices often require. Others advise labs to quarantine the equipment after use on Ebola patients or even destroy it -- a policy that one company's own CEO calls "the dumbest" approach imaginable.

Hospital officials, including some involved in treating the few U.S. patients who have [caught] Ebola [virus disease], see many of the restrictions as irrational. They cite guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], which advises that devices used to test biological samples from Ebola patients can be disinfected and reused safely. They note that the same equipment has been used for years to test blood from patients with other infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis, and reused without problems.

"If this unfounded behavior continues, it could significantly impact the way hospitals care for these people," says Steven Hinrichs, chair of pathology and microbiology at the University of Nebraska and its affiliated hospital, which has treated 2 Ebola patients successfully. "These are good machines, we wanted to use them, but some (manufacturers) are saying you have to incinerate them if you do." ...

Concerns about the restrictive equipment policies were raised Thursday [6 Nov 2014] at a meeting of a CDC lab safety advisory committee, which includes officials from an array of hospitals. The agency's position is that "U.S. clinical laboratories can safely handle specimens from (Ebola) patients," but it reminds labs that "strict adherence" to safety protocols is especially important with those samples. Despite the CDC's reassurances, concerns about handling Ebola samples in lab environments are widespread. The nation's 4 big commercial diagnostic laboratories -- Quest Diagnostics, LabCorp, ARUP Laboratories and Mayo Medical Laboratories -- which do specialized tests on blood and tissue for thousands of hospitals and doctors across the country, announced that they will not accept blood or tissue samples from Ebola patients. Those policies aren't likely to have any immediate impact because the commercial labs aren't supposed to get Ebola samples at this point. The CDC and designated state public health labs handle all confirmatory tests for the virus. Any follow-up lab work on infected patients is done at the hospitals treating them....

"There's a generalized panic, and people in health care are not immune," says Amesh Adalja, a Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] physician on the Public Health Committee of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. "We deal with a lot of blood-borne pathogens in lab settings, and there are adequate safety procedures (for Ebola).... But people are more comfortable making a decision that allows them to not actually make decisions, so they just say, 'We're not going to deal with this."

At Emory University Hospital in Atlanta [Georgia], doctors had 3 days' notice before getting the 1st U.S. Ebola cases -- a [male] doctor and a woman, both Americans, infected doing relief work in Liberia. They decided to do blood testing in a small lab in the isolation unit where the patients were treated, reasoning that it would limit the need to move infectious material through the hospital for analysis in its main lab -- and cut the risk of having to close the main lab for cleanup from a spill.

Several weeks later -- after both patients were cured and released -- an e-mail was circulated by Abaxis, the manufacturer of a portable blood-testing device, the "Piccolo," that Emory's doctors used to monitor the patients' blood in the isolation lab. The e-mail advised that Abaxis had finalized a new service and warranty policy for the USD 14 000 device: "The policy calls for the Piccolo to be incinerated after its use for testing Ebola patients." The directive "put us in a bit of a quandary," says James Ritchie, director of Emory Medical Laboratories. By the time it came out, the lab already had decided on a method for cleaning the Piccolos, and Ritchie and his staff were confident that their approach was effective. Besides, he adds, the Ebola virus doesn't live long outside the body, so if the device were just locked away for a few weeks, any live virus would be gone.

Ritchie compares the Ebola concerns to the fears surrounding HIV when it emerged in the 1980s. As with HIV, "we've had incidents where people have said things like, 'If those samples are coming into the lab, we're not coming to work,'" he says. "The fear factor is really great right now. I think you have to really just keep talking it down."

Clinton Severson, CEO of Abaxis, says he was unaware of the incineration policy issued for Piccolos until after it already had been sent to hospitals. "Technically, that is the policy, because somebody wanted a policy and if nobody has been given any guidelines, I guess the safest thing to say is to blow it up," he says. "But when people recommended that to me, I said, 'That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.'" Severson says the company decided to leave the policy in place while it investigated alternatives, and it has validated a cleaning protocol that will ensure Piccolos used to analyze Ebola samples can be reused for the general hospital population. A policy that outlines those cleaning protocols will be issued in the coming weeks, he says.

[Meanwhile, what are hospitals supposed to do about their machines? Even if they could be irradiated to kill any contamination, wrapped in sterile packaging, donated to West Africa -- where they could be really useful -- and sent by a UN, military or NGO airline (no other airline would touch them), they could not be serviced there. The world has obviously learned nothing from the HIV/AIDS experience. - Mod.JW]

Treating Ebola: the Bluetooth method
------------------------------------
Keeping hands-off without abandoning the patient
------------------------------------------------
Before they set a toe into the concrete-walled isolation room, the doctors and nurses become fortresses unto themselves: face shields, of course, but respirators, too, plus 3 layers of gloves on each hand, duct-taped to their sleeves. Nurses watch over a webcam to keep them on protocol, and Bluetooth stethoscopes relay heart data directly to a remote location -- no ear canal exposure required.

Call it the no-touch approach to medicine. And it's the little-heralded reason that a hospital in Nebraska, of all places, has emerged as a leader in the stateside fight against Ebola. Already, it's brought 2 Ebola patients to recovery and prevented transmission to health care providers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] has held up the hospital as a model for others....

The challenge is to harness technology's protective power without jettisoning the bedside manner, a key to healing, Nebraska health care practitioners acknowledge. They're navigating the trade-offs with computer screens that display "almost life-size" images, said Nebraska Medicine lead nurse Kathleen Boulter. And although providers remain hidden beneath layers of latex and paper, their patients have surprised them with an ability to recognize them by their eyes. "A lot of emotion is expressed by our eyes," she said.

So far, the hospital has a 100 percent success rate on Ebola. Its 1st Ebola patient, 51-year-old missionary Dr. Rick Sacra, stayed for nearly 3 weeks before his release. On 22 Oct 2014, the hospital discharged its 2nd patient, NBC freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, 33, after a roughly 2-week stay, said Boulter.

So how does Nebraska Medicine work? It starts with a secured entrance. To limit traffic in and out of the isolation room -- and the risk of spreading disease -- it uses the Vidyo videoconferencing platform. The isolation room houses a webcam-equipped computer connected to the front desk, the biocontainment unit's conference rooms and providers' [medical staff] offices outside the unit. And inside the isolation room, providers can request a 2nd opinion or order supplies without ever leaving. "If something's going on, we know right away," Boulter said.

Traditional stethoscopes pose a huge contamination risk, medical professionals say, because they require practitioners to lodge earpieces into their ear canals. Technology, of course, has found a way around this. The 3M Littmann Electronic Stethoscope looks much like a regular stethoscope, but its Bluetooth capabilities allow Nebraska Medicine providers to take their ears out of the equation. Instead, a sensor goes onto the patient's chest. A USB dongle, connected to the computer in the isolation room, establishes a Bluetooth connection with a remote computer. Providers outside can listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds in real time. They can even tell health care workers inside the isolation room to reposition the sensor.

Another stethoscope used by Nebraska Medicine is the Thinklabs One Digital Stethoscope. Its high sound quality allows health care workers to wear earpieces over their surgical caps, eliminating ear-canal exposure. They slip them on just before entering the isolation room and plug them into a hockey puck-sized sensor -- equipped with a volume-control module -- that picks up sounds from the patient's chest. Providers chuck the earpieces into the hazardous waste bin when they doff their protective gear. [See comment below.]

Meanwhile, devices that monitor pulse and other vital signs upload measurements to the patient's electronic health record. And a wireless-capable X-ray allows nurses to send images directly to radiologists, skipping the step of transporting bulky film cassettes to the medical imaging department for processing....

And while other hospitals have embraced telehealth too, practitioners hope the healing touch is here to stay. "There are times when something as simple as holding a patient or family member's hand conveys calmness, caring, reduces fear.... I don't believe the effect of a human touch is something that can be replaced," Boulter said. Even the hospital's telehealth guru, Kyle Hall, agrees: "It's still about a human diagnosing the patient."

Japanese government will provide up to USD 100 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Ebola-hit West Africa
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Friday [7 Nov 2014] the Japanese government said it will provide up to USD 100 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Ebola-hit West Africa. The promised aid is in addition to the USD 40 million that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged at the U.N. General Assembly in September [2014]. Abe will talk about Japan's efforts against the deadly virus during a series of upcoming international conferences. Abe is scheduled to attend meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Group of 20 this month [November 2014]. "The spread of Ebola has been a threat to international peace and security," Suga said. "The situation remains severe, so we have made the decision to accelerate assistance."
