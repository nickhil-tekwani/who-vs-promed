Officials say that pet food contamination may have been intentional.
Imported ingredients used in recalled pet food may have been
intentionally spiked with an industrial chemical to boost their
apparent protein content, U.S. federal officials said.
That is one theory being pursued by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) as it investigates how the chemical melamine contaminated at
least 2 ingredients used to make more than 100 brands of dog and cat foods.
In California, state agriculture officials placed a hog farm under
quarantine after melamine was found in pig urine there. Additional
testing was under way to determine whether the chemical was present
in the meat produced by American Hog Farm in Ceres since 3 Apr
[2007], the California State Department of Food and Agriculture said.
So far, melamine has been found in both wheat gluten and rice protein
concentrate imported from China. Media reports from South Africa
suggest a 3rd pet food ingredient, corn gluten, used in that country
also was contaminated with melamine. That tainted ingredient has not
been found in the United States, the FDA said. FDA investigators,
meanwhile, are awaiting visas that would allow them to visit the
Chinese plants where the vegetable protein ingredients were produced.
"Melamine was found in all 3 of those; it would certainly lend
credibility to the theory that it may be intentional. That will be
one of the theories we will pursue when we get into the plants in
China," Stephen Sundlof, the FDA's chief veterinarian, told reporters Thursday.
Chinese authorities have told the FDA that the wheat gluten was an
industrial product not meant for pet food, Sundlof said. Still,
melamine can skew test results to make a product appear more
protein-rich than it is, he said. That raises the possibility the
contamination was deliberate.
"What we expect to do with our inspections in China will answer some
of those questions," said Michael Rogers, director of the division of
field investigations within the FDA's office of regulatory affairs.
Wilbur-Ellis Co., the U.S. importer of the tainted rice protein, said
Thursday it was recalling all the ingredient it had distributed to 5
U.S. pet food manufacturers. The California company in turn urged its
customers to recall any products that may be on store shelves.
So far, just 2 of those companies have done so: Natural Balance Pet
Foods and Blue Buffalo Co. Natural Balance announced a limited recall
Mon [16 Apr 2007] of its Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog
foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats and Venison and Green Pea
dry cat food. Blue Buffalo followed Thu [19 Apr 2007] by recalling
5044 bags of its Spa Select Kitten dry food. The company intercepted
most of the kitten food before it reached distribution centers,
company co-founder Billy Bishop said.
FDA officials would not release the names of the other 2
manufacturers that Wilbur-Ellis supplied, citing a continuing
investigation. The FDA and the Agriculture Department also were
investigating whether some pet food made by one of the 5 companies
supplied by Wilbur-Ellis was diverted for use as hog feed after it
was found unsuitable for pet consumption.
"We understand it did make it into some hog feed and we are following
up on that as well," Sundlof said.
The FDA could not provide updated numbers of pet deaths or injuries
due to the contaminated pet food. The agency has received more than
15 000 calls since the 1st recall was announced more than a month ago.

[Although the melamine contaminated gluten products may not have been
intended for food consumption, it has been. The product was sold as
gluten product for food consumption, a misbranding by someone.
It seems it had to be only a matter of time before the product found
its way into other animal feeds. Certainly the FDA will be testing
and there is likely to be more on the quarantined hogs. - Mod.TG]
