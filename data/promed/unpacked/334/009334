[1] Pakistan: vaccine refusal

The number of families chronically refusing polio vaccines to their children due to its connection with American CIA and Dr Shakeel Afridi have sharply increased, making health officials believe that the polio battle in Lakki Marwat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP] is about to be lost, if concrete steps are not taken to restore public trust in the conservative southern district.

This correspondent obtained official minutes of a meeting chaired by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP] chief secretary Ghulam Dastagir Akhtar last week [week of 11 Mar 2013] and a 'social map' showing that Lakki Marwat district is fast becoming a massive challenge for countering polio refusals in the country.

The government officials present in the meeting told 'The News' that Lakki Marwat has an important position in polio eradication due to its strategic location as it borders the Taliban-controlled South Waziristan Agency. "Due to the ban on polio immunisation in the adjoining South Waziristan and North Waziristan tribal regions by local Taliban, the only way to vaccinate children against polio is through transit routes in Lakki Marwat," said an official of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI).

Pleading anonymity, he noted that a sharp increase in the number of families refusing polio vaccine to their children was recorded there. He said up to 733 families only in a single union council refused polio drops to children after the National Research and Development Foundation (NRDF) developed differences with [UNICEF] as Lakki Marwat was being looked after by NRDF very effectively before that.

"We have recorded a huge number of 733 refusals in Marmandi Azim union council during the last polio campaign," he revealed, adding that the propaganda against polio campaign was fast growing in the Lakki Marwat district in general and other parts of KP in particular.

According to the official minutes of the meeting, the district EPI coordinator of Lakki Marwat has himself admitted that despite all efforts of the concerned officials in the district, they had totally failed to restore public trust in the polio vaccination.

"He said that, though, every effort has been made, the number of refusals was still on the rise in Lakki Marwat. Major reasons for refusals were said to be religious sentiments, conspiracies, and demand," he recalled.

The minutes also reveal that Shehnaz Wazir Ali, special assistant to the prime minister for social sectors, directed an officer of [UNICEF], Dr Shamsher to devise a better analysis of refusals to indicate the largest category and house to house isolation.

However, the [UNICEF] official told her that vacancies for the position of communication officers would be advertised soon to counter refusals in Lakki Marwat.

According to the minutes, Senator Rubina Khalid, sister of former KP health minister syed Zahir Ali Shah, intervened and reminded Dr Shamsher that [UNICEF] has made many promises in the past on Lakki Marwat, including a latest one 2 months ago but to no result. "Begum Shehnaz said that a letter to this effect would be sent to [UNICEF] country office," the minutes stated.

Similarly, officials of World Health Organisation (WHO) were also directed to extend support at their earliest to all of the 16 union councils in Lakki Marwat. She informed participants of the meeting that only 5 officials were short-listed for the district to provide support to the provincial government.

The 'Social Map', clearly shows that Lakki Marwat has recorded 235 refusals in Ghazni Khel, 181 in Lakki 2, 212 in Biasat Khel, 192 in PaharKhel, 158 in Mamakhel besides recording a large number of refusals in almost all the union councils of Lakki Marwat.

Deputy Commissioner Lakki Marwat Nisar Ahmad Khan, when approached, admitted growing refusals in the district and blamed misconception and propaganda by religious-cum militant groups for opposing polio drops in the district.

"There are some main reasons behind growing refusals here. 1st, there are some religious and militant groups who are terrorising parents and polio teams. 2nd, some madrassas and clerics published booklets and pamphlets and publicly opposed polio vaccines. There is some misconception based on religion but many people started doubting vaccines after a fake campaign was launched in Abbottabad in May 2011," he explained while referring to a fake vaccination drive conducted by Dr Shakeel Afridi. Nisar Ahmad Khan, however, said they would soon overcome refusals through persuasion and convincing campaign in the district.

[It is unfortunate that the polio eradication effort has fallen victim to political and fundamentalist religious causes. The real victims in this travesty are the children in these areas who are being left behind in the war against polio. Between the violence perpetrated against vaccinators in Pakistan (and Nigeria) as part of religious movements and the campaigning against the vaccination efforts, the success of the polio eradication effort is being jeopardized. While the case count appears low at this point in time, the impact of reduced vaccination coverages may well start appearing as the number of susceptible children in the areas increases, permitting unstopped transmission of the wild poliovirus (WPV) as well as set the stage with ideal conditions for continued circulation of vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV).

In the past month since the last polio update, there has been an increase in the number of confirmed WPV associated cases from 2 cases to 11 cases. All 11 cases to date in 2013 have occurred in known polio endemic countries -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.

On the positive note, the absence of WPV3 associated disease since the last confirmed case in April 2012 may well be heralding interruption of transmission of WPV3. If this continues, it will be the 2nd WPV type to have had its transmission interrupted worldwide -- the last reported case of WPV2 was in October 1999, in Alighar, Uttar Pradesh, India.
