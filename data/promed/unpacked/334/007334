[2] China: delta variant
Date: Fri 13 Aug 2021

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202108/1231417.shtml


China on Friday [13 Aug 2021] reported 47 new domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases and 52 imported cases, which is the 1st time the latter exceeds the former since the latest delta variant-related resurgence.

Despite strict domestic control measures and efforts in screening potential patients, observers interpreted the epidemic situation as still complicated and the pressure from overseas mounting, meaning it is not the time to discuss "open the door" strategy in Western sense.

The latest resurgence, which broke out in multiple spots, has involved 48 cities in 18 provinces and regions, and registered 1282 cases as of Friday [13 Aug 2021] authorities said at a Friday press conference.

Among the 48 cities, 36 haven't seen new infections in the past 5 days, and the risks of an extensive outbreak are low, He Qinghua, an official from National Health Commission, said at the press conference.

But the situation is still complicated, especially in Yangzhou where the situation "didn't improve significantly," Wang Guangfa, a respiratory expert at Peking University First Hospital, told the Global Times Friday [13 Aug 2021].

Six positive cases were found on Thursday's [12 Aug 2021] 7th-round massive nucleic acid testing in Yangzhou. Community transmissions could occur if new infections are discovered in the general public, not quarantined close contacts, Wang said.

The 52 imported cases reported on Friday [13 Aug 2021], a peak in recent days, also suggested the severe pandemic situation posed a great challenge to China's hard-won situation.

Experts noted the spread of the delta variant worldwide demonstrated it is too soon to loosen the guard against the coronavirus.

The US, which was engulfed by the delta variant, registered 138 595 new infections on Thursday [12 Aug 2021], bringing the total to 36.4 million. The US CDC said 91% of American counties were at high or substantial risk of community transmissions on Wednesday [11 Aug 2021]. The number was 20% a month ago.

Relaxing restrictions in such a situation is adding fuel to the fire, Wang said.

Japan, which just hosted the Olympics, reported a record 18 889 infections Thursday [12 Aug 2021]. Local experts called the situation in Tokyo "out of control," the Asahi reported.

Besides the most prevalent delta variant, a new lambda variant that is devastating South America also sounded the alarm.

Unlike the traditional concept of virus evolution, Wuhan-based virologist Yang Zhanqiu told the Global Times that the COVID-19 variants were independently developed in different places across the world and adapted to local environments.

The diverse environments gave those variants diverse characteristics, which are very problematic, "such as the increased immune evasion of the lambda variant," Yang said.

Unlike SARS that was quickly brought under control, since the coronavirus has spread worldwide and continues to mutate, it is uncertain what kind of COVID-19 variants may emerge, experts said, noting China's relatively successful epidemic control earned the country the chance to choose its control strategy, unlike some countries, which have no choice but to live with the virus.

Zeng Guang, a former chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, said that China has done well in epidemic control and has the conditions and capabilities to maintain a dynamic zero-case status, and such a status gave the country stability and confidence in normal life and business. Some countries do not have such capabilities and are not qualified to consider a dynamic zero-case route.

Costs for the massive testing and lockdowns are worth it if we consider the GDP of a normally running society, Zeng said.

But the expert noted China will not stick to the dynamic zero-case route all through, and China's current strategy is not its only strategy: "We will adjust according to the virus control requirements."

China will open the door when the time is ripe for doing so, Zeng noted.

["The delta variant outbreak spreading across more than half of China's provinces has put authorities on high alert, with stringent lockdowns, mass testing, and travel restrictions reimposed on tens of millions of residents.

"Prior to the current outbreak, life in China had largely returned to normal with cases all but eliminated barring small, isolated outbreaks. In many cities, people going about their daily lives no longer wore face masks, and photos of largely maskless crowds at tourist hotspots and music festivals repeatedly made international headlines.

"On Friday [13 Aug 2021], China's National Health Commission issued revised guidelines, requiring the public to wear face masks in not only indoor venues and public transport, but also in crowded outdoor areas."

"On Friday [13 Aug 2021], the National Health Commission announced that 770 million people in China had been fully vaccinated, accounting for 55% of its population of 1.4 billion. That puts it ahead of the US, where just over 50% of the population are fully vaccinated."

[3] Philippines: resurgence
Date: Sat 14 Aug 2021

The Philippines's already stretched healthcare system is under more strain as the country reports its 2nd-largest daily increase in COVID-19 infections since the pandemic, providing more evidence of how the virulent delta variant may be spreading.

Hundreds of hospitals in the country were again nearing full capacity as of Saturday [14 Aug 2021], with some facilities reporting they had run out of intensive care unit beds for COVID-19 patients, leaving healthcare workers, who are forced to work longer hours, exhausted.

Despite an existing lockdown in Metro Manila, some neighbourhoods were placed under an even stricter quarantine order on Saturday [14 Aug 2021] as cases continue to rise.

"Usually the nurse-to-patient ratio in wards is 1:5, but we are handling up to 12 patients," said Maria Caridad delos Reyes, a staff nurse at the Philippine General Hospital, whose 8-hour shift now sometimes extends to 16 hours. "We're supposed to have a break time, but because we are extremely busy, we miss our meals, especially now that we are attending to moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients," Delos Reyes told the Reuters news agency on Friday [13 Aug 2021].

The Lung Center of the Philippines in Metro Manila also reported that they are opening treatment stations using container vans placed in the hospital's parking lot to accommodate more COVID-19 patients.

Another hospital in the nearby province of Bulacan used its lobby as a triage area as their rooms are already at full capacity.

The health ministry recorded 13 177 new coronavirus infections on Friday [13 Aug 2021], the highest since a record daily tally of 15 310 on 2 Apr [2021], bringing total cases to 1.71 million, the 2nd-highest in Southeast Asia after Indonesia.

An increasing number of children have also been reported to have fallen sick due to the virus.

In Quezon City in Metro Manila, the government said 318 of the COVID-19 cases recorded between 1 and 7 Aug [2021] were children aged 17 and below, according to the Philippine Daily Inquirer on Sat.

The Manila capital region, an urban sprawl of 16 cities that is home to 13 million people, returned to a strict lockdown since 6 Aug [2021] to contain the spread of Delta, while the government tries to speed up its vaccination.

It would take 2-3 weeks before the effect of the lockdown is felt, health ministry spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire told a media briefing, as she urged the public to get vaccinated and follow health protocols.

There have been reports of a possible extension of the lockdown, which is currently scheduled only until 20 Aug [2021].

With about 11% of the country's 110 million people fully immunised, millions remain highly vulnerable to COVID-19, which has killed more than 29 800 in the Southeast Asian country.

According to the Herd Immunity PH vaccine tracker, it could take at least 7 more months, or until March 2022, for the government to reach its goal of immunising at least 70% of the country's adult population to reach herd immunity, months behind the target.

At a drive-through vaccination site in Manila, a 62-year-old cycle rickshaw driver, [RS], was thankful for getting a shot. "I hope this will help us with our lives. We haven't been able to move freely in so long, so this vaccination is a blessing," [RS] said.

According to the government's vaccination task force, almost 50% of Metro Manila's residents will be fully vaccinated by 20 Aug [2021], when the 2-week lockdown expires.

Vaccination implementer Vince Dizon told state TV that the target will be reached in the coming days. He also said that the government has hit or exceeded the 500 000 daily vaccinations nationwide.

The Philippines also announced on Friday [13 Aug 2021] it will extend a ban on travellers from India and 9 other countries to the end of August [2021] to try to contain Delta.
