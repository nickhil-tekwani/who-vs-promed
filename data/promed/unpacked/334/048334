[The number of deaths (102 in 4 months) reported in this outbreak
(see the ProMED-mail post: Measles - Papua New Guinea 20020504.4088)
is alarmingly high in relation to the numbers of cases observed
annually, which had declined progressively to below 1000 by 1997.
However, vaccine coverage has declined also from a peak of 84 percent
in 1994 during the same period and remains far below the level
required to interrupt transmission of the virus. - Mod.CP
[The WHO data for 1999 show the measles rate for Papua New Guinea as
greater than 100 cases per 100 000 population, on the list of
countries with the highest reported rates.
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-surveillance/graphics/htmls/meainc.htm>
The 2001 summary presents data in accordance with the Gideon data:
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-documents/GlobalSummary/GlobalSummary.pdf>
page R-296
The increase in mortality is of concern and one wonders if this
reflects a worsening overall health status of the childhood
population so that there is an increased mortality -- or just better
reporting.
As an aside, with malnutrition, mortality rates attributable to
measles can be in the 20 percent range. Hence, 200 deaths could
represent 1000 cases, not totally out of line with previous reports.
There were over 7000 cases reported in 2000, so a case load of 1000
this year may not be out of line with prior epidemic years. - Mod.MPP
