There is an outbreak of hepatitis A in Sofia, and GPs are alarmed. Statistics from the Regional Health Inspection Service show that the morbidity rate has increased dramatically during the past week; 58 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of hepatitis A.

Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus, and it can affect anyone, the Health Ministry stated, while pointing out that the last hepatitis A outbreak was recorded in 1999. Back then, a total of 7269 Bulgarians were [diagnosed] with the disease.

Good personal hygiene and proper sanitation can help prevent hepatitis A, Tatayana Chervenkova, a national consultant in contagious diseases, said. Hepatitis A virus is [easily] spread from person to person. For this reason, the virus is more easily transmitted in places with poor sanitary conditions or in places where people are not careful about washing their hands.

[Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. According to the World Health Organisation, every year there are an estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A worldwide. Hepatitis A virus is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne infection. Epidemics related to contaminated food or water can erupt explosively, and hepatitis A viruses can persist in the environment. Hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. The current report indicates that there has been a resurgence of hepatitis A virus infection in Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria. The number of cases remains low, and the outbreak should be containable by improvements in environmental conditions and attention to personal hygiene.

According to the Gideon Database, the incidence of hepatitis A virus infection in Bulgaria has been decreasing in recent years, but nonetheless, the rates in Bulgaria remain slightly higher than those in neighbouring countries. See ProMED-mail Hepatitis A - Bulgaria (02): background 20110826.2600. In extremes, hepatitis A can be controlled by the deployment of a cheap and effective vaccine. Travellers to Bulgaria should be aware of the current situation in Sofia and consider the possibility of vaccination.
