Monkeys have been found dead of suspected yellow fever (YF) near the
state line between Santa Catarina & Rio Grande do Sul in southern
Brazil.
The Regional Hospital of Chapeco has been designated regional YF
reference center, & a field lab will be set up in western Santa
Catarina between 27 & 31 Aug 2001 in association with the Evandro
Chagas Institute of Belem, Para, national reference center for YF.
During this week training about YF will be given to doctors, nurses &
workers in the Health & Environmental Surveillance agency, & the state
health department will give talks on YF to rural groups, associations,
trade unions & local government departments.

[This appears to be a natural extension of the area of southward
emergence of sylvan YF over the past 2 years. There is no mention of
any plans for vaccinating the local people. - Mod.JW
