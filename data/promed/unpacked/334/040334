According to information from 15 Feb 2007, 18 cases of opistorchiasis
were registered in Noyabrsk between 1 and 10 Feb 2007.
The chief physician of sanitary and epidemiological surveillance in
Yamal island has commented that controls in the food markets,
especially for imported fish, should be strengthened. The chief
physician has noted that this is a high number of cases, but did not
give any explanation for the high numbers. The authorities stress
that people should be careful eating raw fish and follow
recommendations on fish selection and fish cooking.
