The western blot analysis at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory
(NVSL) is positive with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE]. The
western blot is enough for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
to call this a positive case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The animal was a Santa Gertrudis cow that was 10 years old or older. This
animal was born prior to the feed ban being enacted [in 1997]. The animal was
treated by a veterinarian as a non-ambulatory animal. On a subsequent visit to
the premises, the animal was not improving and was euthanized and sampled by
the veterinarian.
2 rapid tests at a satellite lab proved to be inconclusive, and the sample was
sent to NVSL. It has tested positive by western blot at the NVSL.
The USDA will be developing the epidemiology of the animal, and more
information will be available later.
Dr. Clifford does not anticipate this animal affecting any trade with
Japan or with Korea.

Statement by USDA Chief Veterinary Officer John Clifford (DVM)
Regarding Positive BSE Test Results, 13 Mar 2006
--------------------------------------------------
"We received a positive result on a western blot confirmatory test
conducted at the USDA laboratories in Ames, Iowa on samples from an
animal that had tested "inconclusive" on a rapid screening test
performed on Fri 10 Mar 2006.
The samples were taken from a non-ambulatory animal on a farm in
Alabama. A local private veterinarian euthanized and sampled the
animal and sent the samples for further testing, which was conducted
at one of our contract diagnostic laboratories at the University of
Georgia. The animal was buried on the farm, and it did not enter the
animal or human food chains.
We are now working with Alabama animal health officials to conduct an
epidemiological investigation to gather any further information we
can on the herd of origin of this animal. The animal had only resided
on the most recent farm in Alabama for less than a year.
We will be working to locate animals from this cow's birth cohort
(animals born in the same herd within one year of the affected
animal) and any offspring. We will also work with Food and Drug
Administration officials to determine any feed history that may be
relevant to the investigation. Experience worldwide has shown us that
it is highly unusual to find BSE in more than one animal in a herd or
in an affected animal's offspring. Nevertheless, all animals of
interest will be tested for BSE.
Under USDA testing protocols, surveillance samples are sent to
contract laboratories for screening tests. If the sample is found to
be inconclusive on the screening test, it is then shipped to our
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa for an
additional rapid test and 2 confirmatory tests: the
immunohistochemistry (IHC) test, which is conducted by APHIS
scientists, and the western blot test, which is conducted by
scientists with USDA's Agricultural Research Service. USDA considers
an animal positive for BSE if either of the 2 confirmatory tests
returns a positive result.
In this instance, the inconclusive result from the contract lab in
Georgia was confirmed through a 2nd rapid test at NVSL. Now, the
western blot test has returned a positive result, and that is
sufficient for us to confirm this animal to be positive for BSE,
which is why we are making this announcement today [13 Mar 2006]. The
IHC results are still pending, and we will release those results as
soon as they are available, which we expect to be later this week.
I want to emphasize that human and animal health in the United States
are protected by a system of interlocking safeguards, and that we
remain very confident in the safety of U.S. beef. Again, this animal
did not enter the human food or animal feed chains.
While epidemiological work to determine the animal's precise age is
just getting underway and is ongoing, the attending veterinarian has
indicated that, based on dentition, it was an older animal, quite
possibly upwards of 10 years of age. This would indicate that this
animal would have been born prior to the implementation of the Food
and Drug Administration's 1997 feed ban. Older animals are more
likely to have been exposed to contaminated feed circulating before
the FDA's 1997 ban on ruminant-to-ruminant feeding practices, which
scientific research has indicated is the most likely route for BSE
transmission.
By any measure, the incidence of BSE in this country is extremely
low. Our enhanced surveillance program was designed as a one-time
snapshot to provide information about the level of prevalence of BSE
in the United States. We have conducted surveillance in the United
States since 1990, and, following the initial positive in December
2003, we developed an enhanced surveillance program. Since June 2004,
all sectors of the cattle industry have cooperated in this program by
submitting samples from more than 640 000 animals from the highest
risk populations and more than 20 000 from clinically normal, older
animals as part of our enhanced BSE surveillance program. To date,
including the animal in today's [13 Mar 2006] announcement, only 2 of
these highest risk animals have tested positive for the disease as
part of the enhanced surveillance program.
As we approach the conclusion of our enhanced surveillance program,
let me offer a few thoughts regarding surveillance going forward. I
can assure you that we will continue to base our maintenance
surveillance testing on international guidelines. Though the nature
and extent of maintenance surveillance has not yet been finalized,
the incidence of BSE in this country remains extremely low, our
interlocking safeguards are working to protect both human and animal
health, and we remain very confident in the safety of US beef.
As we move forward with the epidemiological investigation that has
been initiated today [13 Mar 2006] into this case of BSE, we will
continue to be very transparent in sharing information with the
public and with our trading partners around the world."

[Korea has threatened to ban US beef if this animal was found
positive, and it is positive. Dr. Clifford indicated there might be
some change of plan from Korea, but the details of the negotiations
are not public yet. Dr. Clifford indicated that this would have no
effect on trade with Japan. Presently, Japan is not accepting beef
from the USA because of a shipment of US beef that violated the
trading agreements. - Mod.TG]
