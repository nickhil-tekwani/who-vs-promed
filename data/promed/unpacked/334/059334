The CAF [Centro de Acci칩n Familiar, i.e., Family Action Center] of Las Flores is on alert for cases of leptospirosis.

The communication from the UPCN [Uni칩n del Personal Civil de la Naci칩n, i.e., Union for Civil Servants/Public Workers in Argentina] detailed that for a long time "the complaint has been before the Secretariat for the Rights of Children, Adolescents and Family, documenting the existence of rat excrement in rooms occupied by minors, the commissary and other resources." "Unfortunately, the lack of response and inaction caused 3 colleagues to contract leptospirosis, one of whom was a replacement staff," UPCN said.

Likewise, UPCN announced that it had contacted the authorities of the Provincial Directorate of Zoonoses. They reported that the institution quickly determined what precautions were necessary in the facilities and advised staff accordingly. However, they added that, "As of today, only one day of work has been done to cover the holes made by the rodents."

UNO Santa Fe [the newspaper] consulted with CAF workers about how this situation came about. [AS] is one of the 4 workers out of 6 who got sick. Two of the workers began experiencing symptoms in the 1st weeks of February [2022], and the others in the last few days.

According to what [AS] described, the space was filled with rats. They entered through construction in the building that was left unfinished almost 3 years ago. "There were holes, which they are just starting to cover now because of all this," said [AS]. The rats occupied the commissary space, the dining room, the workshop area and even the management offices. The rodents ate the bags of food that are usually distributed to the CAF [from the larger organization] and were intended for 30 families in the neighborhood.

"We started running into this at the end of January [2022] and beginning of February [2022]. Obviously, we clean every day, but the next day everything is just as dirty," [AS] described. Complaints were sent to the Secretariat for the Rights of Children, Adolescents and Family because CAF serves that population. As a result of this situation, all activities were suspended, including on-site work for 4 people. Now, they wait for the building to be cleared of rats.

Santa Fe (population of about 391 164 residents in 2010) is the capital city of the province of Santa Fe, in northeastern Argentina, near the junction of the Paran치 and Salado rivers. A map showing the location of Santa Fe can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Fe,+Santa+Fe+Province,+Argentina.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world. Although leptospirosis is more common in tropical areas, it is also found in temperate areas. It is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salt) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, and swine) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with _Leptospira_. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings, as apparently occurred in the Santa Fe, Argentina outbreak.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). However, laboratory diagnosis for leptospirosis may not be widely available at a local level.

Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis. - Mod.ML
