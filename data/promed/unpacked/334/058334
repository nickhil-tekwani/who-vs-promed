More than 300 head of cattle fell ill with brucellosis in North Kazakhstan region.

According to the information of the veterinary department, Esil and Kyzylzhar districts [North Kazakhstan region] suffered the most, where brucellosis was detected in 142 and 103 head of cattle since March [2021], respectively.

"According to the legislation, cattle that respond positively to brucellosis [test] must be handed over for stamping out within 15 days, together with their offspring, since they are sources of infection and can infect healthy animals. The veterinary service ensures the delivery of animals to the meat processing plant free of charge. The purchase price is determined by the slaughter company independently, depending on the category, age, and sex groups of animals," the department commented.

If pathological changes characteristic of brucellosis are observed in carcasses and internal organs [see comment], then livestock owners are reimbursed 30% of the average market value of livestock products handed over for processing. In the absence of changes, the meat is sent for sale without restrictions after 12 hours of maturation.

"Payment of compensation is carried out in the presence of a full package of documents established by law. To date, documents have been received from 4 owners for 25 heads of cattle in the amount of KZT 2.1 million [USD 4944]. The refund will be paid in October [2021]. The rest of the owners will be paid as the documents are received," the veterinary department said. The department added that, compared to last year [2020], there are 543 fewer animals with brucellosis in the region.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his submission.

The above report relates to "pathological changes characteristic of brucellosis, observed in carcasses and internal organs." Pathological changes are rather rare in livestock (in males, orchitis may occur). Exceptional symptoms of bovine brucellosis are arthritis and tendovaginitis. The diagnosis of brucellosis is based upon agent identification (culture, PCR) and detection of immune response (in serum and milk). For diagnosis, see OIE manual at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf.

According to an "Analysis of the epizootic situation on animal brucellosis in Kazakhstan in 2020" (SB Telmanova, Batyrbekov AN, conference proceedings, https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=45752452, published 2021, in Russian), the official annual number of brucellosis outbreaks in recent years was 18 in cattle and 96 in small ruminants (sheep and goats). It seems that the actual numbers are higher; in 2020, the official number of infected cattle was 54 326. In spite of control efforts, "the forecast for the future of brucellosis in livestock is generally unfavorable and will depend on the quality of diagnostic measures and the timely adoption of measures for the early destruction of sick animals; an outbreak of the disease continues in the southern and eastern regions among small ruminants, and in the eastern, western, and northern regions of Kazakhstan, among cattle."

The above indication of the need for "early destruction" and the comment in the last passage of the media report indicate that the bureaucracy of the compensation mechanism for culled animals is not optimal. Successful elimination of brucellosis infection in livestock (by _Brucella melitensis_ and _B. abortus_) depends -- on top of efficient field and lab activities -- upon early and realistic payments for culled animals. Farmers' cooperation is vital. - Mod.AS
