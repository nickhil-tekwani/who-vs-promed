There are different strains of TE and these clearly effectively
different diseases. I cannot find the reference to the typing by mouse
genotype that is used to differentiate the strains, but this also shows
scrapie and BSE to be different. In passing it also shows CJD to be
different too.

Hamsters developed scrapie 100-160 days after eating either scrapie-
infected hamsters or infected brain. The clinical signs and
neuropathology of scrapie transmitted by cannibalism were identical to
those observed after intracerebral or intraperitoneal inoculation of the
agent. Oral transmission of scrapie appears to be extremely inefficient.
Cannibalism requires a dose of the scrapie agent about 10^9 times
greater than that needed to produce the disease by intracerebral
injection for comparable periods of incubation.

[I add this because I can never normally find it. Note here the factor
of 1,000,000,000 times between oral and brain injected routes and also
note that this was for hamsters eating hamsters. I am sure I have come
across work that shows that TE's passaged through a target animal
becomes very much more infectious than when coming directly from another
species (another 100+ times?). The abstract does not mention if these
are wild hamsters or have been carefully selected to be susceptible to
scrapie.]

Chromatographic and hybridization studies with scrapie enriched
fractions of hamster brains revealed a scrapie-specific DNA molecule.
I-labelled DNA from 8 different scrapie-enriched hamster
brain fractions was hybridized to total DNA and RNA from normal and
scrapie hamster and mouse and to DNA from normal human brain and
brain tissue from patients dying with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Enrichment for infectivity was obtained by cellular partition, gel
filtration and gel electrophoresis. Reassociation of the probes with the
scrapie DNA did not have a higher value than with the normal. The level
of detection indicated that if scrapie agent was a DNA virus replicating
through DNA its specific infectivity would be lower than 687 molecules
per infective unit. These findings reduce the possibility that scrapie
is a DNA virus.

[Added to illustrate tbat prions are not viruses.]

This paper reviews the genetic control of neurodegenerative diseases
that affect animals (scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
transmissible mink encephalopathy and chronic wasting disease of deer
and elk) and humans. Studies on the influence of the host's genetic
background on the susceptibility and incubation time of these diseases
are discussed with data, not only on domestic animals and humans, but
also on mice, including transgenics. Consideration is also given to work
on recombinant DNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism
studies on the host gene for prion protein (Prn-P), and to properties
(host range, thermal stability, variability in lesions and strain differences)
of the disease agents. It concludes that the host plays a significant role
in determining the pattern of infection and incubation time for these
diseases. Incubation time appears to be a stable property of the agent-
host combination, and is not a stable property of the agent strain
alone. Studies on gene transfer in transgenic mice strongly suggest that
scrapie and the human diseases are probably all "genetic" diseases, and that
the transmissible factor is host encoded. The host gene for prion protein is
responsible for (1) the variation in the host response to the infecting
material, (2) the incubation time, (3) the pathology of the brain and
the deposition of amyloid, and (4) the host range of the resulting
transmissible agent. In addition to Prn-p, another gene, Pid-1, may be
involved in the control of incubation time, but its identity is obscure.

[To illustrate that TE's are typically genetically based.]

Reasons for suggesting that bovine spongiforms encephalopathy (BSE) in
Britain may not have been caused by processed protein feed containing
offal from scrapie-affected sheep are given. First, scrapie in sheep is
relatively uncommon and of low incidence and therefore insufficient
scrapie agent would have been available to produce the 24600
confirmed cases of BSE. Second, because farmers do not like to admit to
having scrapie many cases are disposed of on the farm. Third,
histopathological indications are that BSE is a naturally occurring
disease. Fourth, it has been shown that scrapie in sheep can appear do
novo following selective breeding for high susceptibility and it is
suggested that this may have occurred in cattle and could explain the
haphazard distribution of BSE.

[Note that scrapie can be initiated merely by a breeding programme
without exposure to prions at all.]

Transmission from 4 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to
mice resulted in neurological disease in 100% of recipient animals,
after incubation periods of between 265 and 700 days after injection. The
results from the 4 cases were very similar to one another. There were
major differences in the incubation period between the 4 inbred strains
of mice tested, and even between strains of the same Sinc genotype, and
the incubation periods of Sinc heterozygote mice were much longer than
those for any of the inbred strains. Transmission from a case of natural
scrapie differed in two important respects: there were no differences in
the incubation period between mouse strains of the same Sinc genotype,
and that of the heterozygotes was between those of the Sinc
homozygotic parental strains. The distribution of vacuolar degeneration
in the brains of mice infected with scrapie also differed from those
infected with the BSE isolates. Transmission was also achieved from
formol-fixed BSE brain. The results show that the same strain of agent
caused disease in the BSE cases, and that the relationship of BSE to
scrapie in sheep is unclear.

[I think they would now say 'unconnected'.]

Extracts of brain and peripheral tissues were tested for the presence of
disease specific PrP (PrP) fraction using SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting; anti-PrP antisera raised against a synthetic sheep PrP
peptide or mouse PrP were used as the primary antibody and
binding was detected with a gold labelled goat anti-rabbit second
antibody and enhanced with silver staining. 14 brains from suspected
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cases were examined, 12 were
subsequently confirmed to have BSE; readily detectable amounts of
PrP were found in brain extracts from all 12 BSE cases but not
in the other 2 brains. PrP was also detected in brain extracts of 3
naturally and 3 experimentally scrapie infected sheep. No PrP
was found in cattle and sheep controls. Positive results against sheep
tissue extracts (including brain lymph nodes and spleen) were obtained
using an antiserum raised against a sheep specific peptide sequence but
this antiserum did not detect PrP in cow brain. PrP was not
convincingly demonstrated when an antiserum raised to mouse
PrP was tested. No PrP was detected in any peripheral
bovine tissue using these antisera. Thus immunodetection of PrP in
sheep and cow brain could be used as an adjunct to histopathological
diagnosis especially if techniques were improved.

Data demonstrating species-specific epitopes in bovine, ovine and
murine prion protein (PrP) that are based on amino acid substitutions at
positions 108 and 110 are presented. Rabbit antisera to synthetic
peptides representing amino acid sequence 108 to 123 or PrP of cattle,
sheep and mice reacted strongly with modified PrP of the homologous
host but not, or only poorly, with PrP of heterogeneous origin. Cross-
reactivity was observed, however, with antisera to bovine and ovine
peptide sequences 102 to 117, thus stressing the importance of the
location of the amino acid substitution in synthetic peptides used for
immunization. Based on these data, BSE PrP and ovine and murine
scrapie PrP can be distinguished from each other, and these differences
might help elucidate the species barrier effect.

[Can be distinguished = are different types.]

Slow virus diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are
characterized by the formation and accumulation of the amyloid protein
PrP in the brain of affected individuals. Thus, the development of
antisera which immunostain PrP can be useful for the diagnosis of BSE. A
number of polyclonal antisera prepared against the proteinase K
resistant portion of PrP (PrP27-30) purified from brains of 263K
scrapie-infected hamsters, and ME7 scrapie-infected mice were screened.
Polyclonal antibodies were prepared against peptides corresponding to 4
different regions of the bovine PrP purified from brainstems and
cortices of 5 clinically suspected cases of BSE. Antisera showed that the
band pattern of bovine PrP27-30 (PrP) differs from that of PrP27-30
purified from brains of hamsters with experimental scrapie (PrP)
and from brains of patients dying of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(PrP). The amount of PrP in affected brains was at least
10-fold less than that found in CJD brains and 10000-fold less than in
scrapie-infected hamsters.

[Yet more evidence for them being different]

[I think that's enough for now.]

====================
Oz:

It's a pity really (as far as UK farmers are concerned) that BSE cannot
be shown to have come from scrapie, but there you go the evidence is
pretty clear. It is also pretty clear that the initiation of clinical
disease in any given species can occur spontaneously by genetic
misfortune. It is also clear that the addition of prions to the brain
can accelerate the onset of the disease, at least in suceptible
individuals. Nobody ever mentions all the strains of mice, hamsters and
so on that have been tried and failed to succumb to intracerebrally
introduced BSE prion. It is also very clear that infection by ingestion
is very difficult indeed, by many orders of magnitude. As far as BSE and
humans is concerned this is illustrated by the lack of cases in those
individuals who have been heavily exposed to infected meat, and meat
products for over a decade and a half. It is also illustrated by the
lack of disease linked to scrapie in the UK for the last 200 years.

The odd cases that have been suggested for scrapie transferred to humans
were never properly examined and are pure conjecture. I believe that
rabies involves several large injections into the body cavity and if
this were done in areas with rudimentary facilities cross infection
could be expected even without the known difficulty of deactivating
prions by normal sterilisation routes. Unlike scrapie (and probably BSE)
CJD is very infectious to humans and CJD infected tissues should be
treated with great care.

[Please excuse the selective quotes: they are from the Gajdusek paper I
cited earlier, and I have tried to be as accurate as possible in conveying
the sense of the original. Note that I posted my comments saying that this
is the ONLY credible published association between scrapie and CJD of which
I am aware.]

Eva Mitrova recorded an unusually high incidence of CJD in the rural Lucenec
area of south central Slovakia (the Slovak Republic) with cases in adjacent
Hungary. During the past decade, she has recorded "an epidemic of CJD which
developed during the 1980's" in the most sparsely populated rural
sheep-raising area of Slovakia (Orava). The numbers were 30 cases in a
population of 15,000, an incidence rate of over 1,000 per million, although
"CJD had not been known in Orava before the 1970's".

[There are problems in ennumerating the base and case populations in
studying a concentration of disease such as this, but it is clearly a high
incidence. There is also no means of confirming the low incidence prior to
the epidemic, but I take it on trust (from my more anthropological
colleagues) that the rural community was capable of recognising the novelty
of the outbreak. I can find no reference to changes in the historical
prevalence of scrapie or changes in exposure that "explain" the outbreak.]

The "epidemic" had interesting features such as "members of the same family
who were 20 to 30yr different in age became sick at nearly the same time.
This suggested a common source of infection... We suspected an accident of
massive contamination of the population with sheep scrapie." Gajdusek
continues "We are now looking for a cofactor that turns on the expression of
the mutation or a factor that in the past inhibited the post-translational
configuration change of the precursor to amyloid."

The six points you make are correct, although with point 6 Gajdusek writes
"Thus, the new question is not what has caused the Orava outbreak - it is
the codon 200 glutamic acid to lysine point mutation - but rather what has
prevented its expression in previous generations so that it has accumulated
as a frequent silent nonpathogenic polymorphism, only expressing itself as a
pathogenic mutation in these people in the past 15 yr."

The local population therefore appears to have been susceptible to CJD with
greater frequency than elsewhere (as per your point 6), but only challenged
with some (unknown) triggering agent in recent years. What is most important
about this epidemic, V-CJD and possibly BSE is that the size of the epidemic
is strictly limited by the genetics of the exposed populations. This
limitation obviously a) has implications for predicting the effect of any
putative exposure and b) should modify the epidemiological approach to
estimating past exposure from an epidemic.
