In order not to perpetuate false information about happenings in Los
Angeles, please let me set the record straight. Someone was quoted out of
context in a TV interview and the error was picked up by every radio, print
and TV station about 500 deaths due to influenza. This is incorrect.
If you are already familiar with the "P&I Index" [pneumonia & influenza,
please skip ahead a bit. Historically, death rates rise in times of
influenza outbreaks (I believe it was Farr who first noted the association
in London in the mid 1850s). For many years CDC has examined nationally the
proportion of deaths each week of the influenza season -- 10/1 to 4/30 --
that have an underlying cause of pneumonia or influenza. Since influenza is
usually a clinical diagnosis, few cases are actually confirmed. However in
the midst of an outbreak one can expect to see a rise in the death rate
starting 2-4 weeks after influenza arrives. Please see MMWR 1997;46(RR-9):
Prevention and control of influenza, for more on P&I.
For 12/97 a preliminary total of 11.7% (~580/4900) of deaths in LA County
listed pneumonia as a contributing or underlying cause. What was left out
of the report was that the corresponding proportion for 12/96 was 12.3%
(617/5000). In other words, thus far we have not >observed an increase in
deaths associated with pneumonia. While the >1996-97 influenza season in
Southern California was relatively mild, the full impact of the current
season remains to be evaluated. We are continuing to hand-tally death
certificates through January '98.
Influenza markers shot up very suddenly in mid to late December, with
numerous doctors and hospitals reporting capacity crowds; simultaneously
there was a large increase in isolates of influenza A from a regional
laboratory. There appears to be two distinct syndromes: one is clearly
influenza; the other does not have high fever or myalgia, but consists
mainly of low fever and chronic dry cough lasting weeks. By Christmas, MD
offices and clinics were packed, and emergency departments were seeking
waivers from ambulance admissions in record numbers, not only in Los
Angeles County but in surrounding Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino
Counties too. The regional Emergency Medical Services Agency is presently
analyzing that situation.
Anecdotally, outpatient services remain very busy. In conjunction with the
State Dept. of Health Services my office is now evaluating a number of
issues related to URI and influenza in the Los Angeles region.
The legionellosis outbreak reported in ProMED-mail a month ago is
completely unrelated to the influenza-like illness; a case-control study
was just concluded and is being analyzed. To date, environmental sampling
has not identified a common source for the 9 cases, but special tests are
still in progress. Only 1 of the 9 cases died. Thank you for the chance to
set the record straight.

[We are very grateful to Dr. Dassey for providing ProMED-mail the
definitive information we have been seeking. In the absence of such good
communications we go to secondary sources, which sometimes are unreliable
and usually are superficial. If you are in a position to send ProMED-mail
definitive and insightful information about any emerging or reemerging
disease, please do so. It will keep us from posting "junk" (which we make
every effort to avoid anyway) and make ProMED-mail an even better source. -
