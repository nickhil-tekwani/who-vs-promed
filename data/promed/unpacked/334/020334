Doctors fear measles outbreak in Auckland
-----------------------------------------
People are being warned to be vigilant about the spread of measles, after 2
apparently unconnected cases in 2 families were confirmed in the Auckland
region. Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) is expecting more
measles cases after these cases were reported, and is urging people to take
measles seriously.

Dr Brad Novak, medical officer of health at Auckland Regional Public Health
Service, said measles can spread easily through the air, especially from
coughing and sneezing -- and is highly infectious. It commonly causes ear
infections and pneumonia, and may lead to other serious complications. It
can, in some cases, be fatal, Dr Novak said.

He advised parents to check their children's immunisation record and get
their children immunised. "Immunisation is free and it's the only effective
way to protect against the disease. The measles, mumps, and rubella triple
vaccine (MMR) is given in 2 doses, normally at 15 months and 4 years of
age, giving over 95 per cent protection. "Parents should check that their
children's immunisations are up-to-date. Check your child's Plunket (Well
Child) book, or check with your child's GP or practice nurse," Dr Novak
said. [The Well Child/Tamariki Ora Health Book (the Plunket book) is a
small booklet given to New Zealand mothers on the birth of a child. It has
been used by nurses as a tool to record growth and development from birth
to 5 years since the 1920s. - Mod.CP]

He urged people who were not up-to-date with immunisations to contact their
general practitioner (GP) or practice nurse and arrange to catch up as soon
as possible. "This is a timely reminder to people not sure about their
children's, or their own, immunity to measles to talk to their GP or
practice nurse about it now," he said.

Dr Novak said symptoms to watch out for included a red rash that started on
the face and moved to the rest of the body. Children with measles were
often quite sick with runny nose, cough, sore eyes or fever as well as the
rash. The rash came on after a few days and lasts up to one week.

Anyone who suspected they or someone in their family may have measles
should call their GP or practice nurse for advice, rather than heading
straight in to see a doctor. This could help them to prevent the spread of
the disease to others in the waiting room. People were advised to seek
medical help if they were concerned about a family member who was unwell or
if their condition was getting worse.

[In early April 2010 an outbreak of measles was reported in the North
Island of New Zealand confined to members of a community who on account of
of their philosophical convictions have declined vaccination and been at
risk of measles virus infection. The source of their infection, presumably
somewhere in the general community, had not been established.

The 1st sign of measles is usually a high fever, which begins about 10 to
12 days after exposure to the virus, and lasts 4 to 7 days. A runny nose, a
cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the cheeks can
develop in the initial stage. After several days, a rash erupts, usually on
the face and upper neck. Over about 3 days, the rash spreads, eventually
reaching the hands and feet. The rash lasts for 5 to 6 days, and then
fades. On average, the rash occurs 14 days after exposure to the virus
(within a range of 7 to 18 days).

Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children,
especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have
been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases. Most measles-related deaths
are caused by complications associated with the disease. Complications are
more common in children under the age of 5, or adults over the age of 20.
The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an
infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea and related
dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as
pneumonia.

Auckland is located at the north tip of the North Island of New Zealand.
