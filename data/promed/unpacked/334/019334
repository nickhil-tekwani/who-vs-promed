Avian Influenza Situation in Turkey - WHO update 2
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 9 Jan 2006, Laboratory tests conducted in Turkey have
confirmed detection of the H5 subtype of avian influenza virus in
samples from an additional 10 patients. 5 of these cases were
announced by the Ministry of Health yesterday [8 Jan 2006], and an
additional 5 were announced today [9 Jan 2006]. Most patients are
children, and all have been hospitalized for treatment and evaluation.
Of the 5 patients announced on Sunday [8 Jan 2006], 3 are from Ankara
Province and include 2 brothers, aged 5 and 2 years, and a
65-year-old man. All 3 patients are hospitalized in Ankara. The
additional 2 cases, a 9-year-old girl and her 3-year-old brother, are
from the Dogubeyazit district in Agri Province, and are hospitalized
in the city of Van.
The 5 cases announced today [9 Jan 2006] are from Kastamonu, Corum,
and Samsun provinces, bordering the Black Sea in the north-central
part of the country, and from Van Province.
This brings the total number of cases in Turkey, confirmed by
laboratory tests there, to 14. Of these patients, 2 have died. WHO
will add these numbers to its cumulative total following further
verification by an external H5 reference laboratory.
The quality of laboratory testing at Turkey's National Influenza
Center in Ankara is high. Results from tests conducted there last
week [1st week January 2006] were fully confirmed by a WHO
collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom. WHO considers it
likely that test results on the newly announced cases will be
confirmed by the UK laboratory, where samples are being sent for
further analysis. H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype known
to infect humans. In the event of a confirmed H5N1 outbreak in birds,
it is expected that human cases of avian influenza will be caused by
the same virus strain.
The initial WHO team, accompanied by the Turkish Minister of Health,
arrived in Van Province yesterday [8 Jan 2006] evening. The team is
now investigating the epidemiological situation, assessing risk
factors and control measures, and discussing with local authorities
the possible need for additional equipment and supplies. The team
will also be assessing patients at the Van hospital, where some 38
people are currently being treated and evaluated for possible H5N1 infection.
The initial investigation has found no evidence that the virus has
increased its transmissibility or is spreading from person to person.
Most persons under investigation are children, often from the same
family, and almost all have a documented link to dead or diseased poultry.
Outbreaks in poultry are now known to be occurring in several parts
of the country. In recent days, the Ministry of Agriculture has
confirmed H5N1 outbreaks in birds in 10 of the country's 81
provinces. Extensive culling is under way, and several other possible
outbreaks are under investigation.
With the agreement of the Ministry of Health, 2 epidemiologists and 2
experts in laboratory diagnosis will join the initial WHO team in the
next few days. Given the present high level of awareness of the
disease and its presence in poultry in several parts of the country,
the number of people concerned about possible exposure is expected to
increase. This additional support should expedite understanding of
the epidemiological situation and increase the capacity to rapidly
confirm or rule out persons under investigation for possible infection.

Turkey: WHO Accepts 14 Human Cases as Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday [9 Jan 2006] that
it was now treating all 14 of the [human] cases of avian influenza
announced by Turkish authorities as confirmed. "We are treating the 5
reported yesterday [8 Jan 2006] and the 5 reported today as cases,"
said WHO spokeswoman Christine McNab.
The WHO, which had previously put the confirmed cases in the outbreak
at 4, raised the total after Ankara gave details of laboratory tests
carried out on the other 10, she said. Samples from the 10 would be
sent to London for further examination, which is in line with the WHO
practice of seeking corroboration from a laboratory outside an
affected country. "The WHO is treating the 10 additional reported
cases as preliminary positive," said McNab.
6 of the 14 cases were from Agri and one from Van, in the east of the
country, 3 were in Ankara and 4 from other areas, mainly northern
provinces bordering the Black Sea, she said.

Human Avian Influenza Virus Cases Spread in Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
Many more suspected human cases of avian influenza are appearing in
Turkey, prompting worries that the outbreak in birds may be more
widespread than thought. The new human cases are also spreading
across the country, edging further westwards towards Europe.
The Turkish Ministry of Health has said there are now 14 human cases
of avian influenza. Many more patients have been hospitalized and are
being tested for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu. Some 30 patients
are being treated in a hospital in the eastern province of Van, where
the 1st bird flu deaths occurred in a brother and sister in early
January 2006. Another sister from the same family is also thought to
have died of bird flu, but this has not yet been confirmed by laboratory tests.
100 people are awaiting test results for avian influenza virus
infection, including 10 in Istanbul. Only 4 human cases have been
confirmed in the lab, said the World Health Organization on Saturday
[7 Jan 2006]. At that point, outbreaks had been confirmed in birds in
6 provinces in eastern and southeastern Turkey. But by Sunday [8 Jan
2006] evening, this had spread to 10 of Turkey's 81 provinces. There
are now outbreaks in the north and center of the country.
The sudden outbreak of many cases among humans in Turkey might
suggest the virus had in fact been circulating in birds for some
time, suggests a WHO expert. Reports of H5N1 in turkeys in Turkey 1st
emerged in October 2005. Given the known number of bird outbreaks,
the 14 human cases since then appear disproportionately high, notes
Klaus Stohr, coordinator of WHO's influenza program. In east Asia,
where there have been many bird outbreaks, there have been 142 human
cases of H5N1 since 2003.
The disproportionate levels of human and animal cases in Turkey
points to 2 possibilities, Stohr said. Either the virus in Turkey is
a new strain that is more easily picked up by humans, or it is the
same strain but has been circulating for some time undetected. He
says it is less likely that the virus has mutated to a more virulent
form, as there was no increase in cases among the contacts of the 1st
children who died of the disease in Van province. "If we were dealing
with a virus of a different characteristic, with higher
transmissibility between humans, we would have 1st seen more cases
among healthcare workers, among the playmates of these children, more
cases in the village, than what we are seeing now."
He said it was more likely the disease was more widespread than
thought in birds and that surveillance had not picked this up.
However, he stressed that there was "currently too little data" to
rule out a mutation in the virus. A team from WHO arrived in eastern
Turkey on Monday [9 Jan 2006] to investigate.
All the cases of bird flu in humans so far have followed close
contact with diseased poultry, says WHO. "Contact between people and
poultry has likely increased during the present cold weather, when
the custom among many rural households is to bring poultry into their
homes," says WHO. "Tests have shown that the virus can survive in
bird feces for at least 35 days at low temperatures (below 4 C)."

WHO States No Signs of Human-to-human Bird Flu in Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
There are no signs that the avian influenza virus spreading in Turkey
is being passed among humans, the World Health Organization (WHO)
said on Monday [9 Jan 2006]. The WHO has confirmed 4 human bird flu
cases in Turkey, including the deaths of 2 siblings last week [1st
week January 2006] from Dogubayazit in the eastern part of the
country. "At the moment, there is no element in this village
indicating human-to-human transmission. It's typically similar to
what we have seen so far (in East Asia)," Guenael Roider, head of the
WHO's Turkey mission, told Reuters Television. He was part of a team
investigating the avian influenza in the east of Turkey.
Turkish authorities say 14 people have tested positive for the deadly
bird flu virus, including 3 siblings from Dogubayazit who have died.
The WHO said other cases had not so far been verified by laboratory tests.

Turkey: 4th sibling Free of Disease
-------------------------------------
A 6-year-old boy whose brother and 2 sisters died of avian influenza
virus infection last week [1st week January 2006] was discharged from
hospital on Monday [9 Jan 2006] after being confirmed free of the
disease, Turkish television reported. The boy was taken to the
hospital along with his siblings after the deadly disease struck
their home in a remote part of eastern Turkey. Though ill, he was
found not to have the deadly virus.
His brother, 14, died on 1 Jan 2006, and his sisters, 15 and 11, died
a few days later. The 6-year-old boy is the only surviving child of
the Kocyigit family.

[Greater clarity and consistency is gradually emerging in
identification and enumeration of the human cases of avian influenza
virus infection in Turkey. Hopefully, within the next few days,
consistency will emerge. So far, children have predominated among
fatal cases of the disease, and there has been no apparent
transmission of virus between family members, although siblings have
been infected. Healthcare and agricultural workers have not featured
as victims of infection. These features suggest that the
transmissibility of the H5N1 avian influenza virus remains unchanged. - Mod.CP]
