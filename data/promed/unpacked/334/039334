Nearly one lakh [100 000] 'laying birds' in the poultry sheds of
Navapur in Nandurbar district in Maharashtra just across Gujarat are
suspected to have died of Newcastle Disease (NCD), also called
Ranikhet Disease, during the last few weeks.
Navapur Poultry Farmers Association President Ghulam Vera told UNI
over the phone: "The disease is common among laying birds during this
time of the year, which [can be] aggravated due to a sudden change of
weather, but it was more alarming this year." "However," he said,
"there is no cause for panic, as the disease is not transmitted to
humans and it has subsided. Experts from Pune-based Venkateshwaran
hatchery have come here and brought it under control."
"There are nearly 12-14 lakh [1.2 - 1.4 million] laying birds in
60-odd poultry sheds around Navapur. The casualty rate is around 8-12
per cent in different sheds. These sheds supply eggs to Nashik,
Jalgaon, Bhusawal, Surat (Gujarat), Indore (MP), Mumbai and
Hyderabad. These birds are used only to lay eggs," he said.
When contacted by UNI here over phone, district veterinary doctor Dr
S S Dhokar confirmed the deaths due to the outbreak of Newcastle
disease, but added that there is no reason for panic.
He said that experts from Pune-based Poultry Diseases Diagnosis &
Research Institute have visited the affected poultry farms here and
confirmed the deaths due to Newcastle, and has asked for the supply
of vaccines to control the disease.
"Yet," he said, "samples of the affected birds have been sent to
Bhopal [where they have the ability] to confirm bird flu, and the
report is awaited soon. As against average life span of 80 weeks, the
disease generally affects the old stock, 72-week and older birds,
[which have] low immunity. The birds' necks bend as they gradually
die. The mortality rate was higher than normal this year, but in no
way can it be called epidemic, as it has been brought under control"
he explained.
