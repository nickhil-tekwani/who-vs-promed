South China's Guangdong Province reported its 3rd human H7N9 case in 4 days on Wednesday [18 Dec 2013], raising the total H7N9 cases in the province to 5 since August [2013]. The new patient is a 62 year old resident of Yangjiang City, said the provincial health authority. He is in a critical condition.

A 39 year old man in Dongguan City and a 65 year old woman in Yangjiang were confirmed to have been infected by the H7N9 strain on Sunday [15 Dec 2013] and Monday [16 Dec 2013], respectively. So far, Guangdong has confirmed 5 human H7N9 cases since 10 Aug [2013], with 2 in Dongguan, 2 in Yangjiang and 1 in Huizhou City. Its 1st case, a 51 year old woman in Huizhou, recovered in September after being treated in a hospital for more than one month.

The province dispatched 5 inspection teams to 21 cities and a district on Wednesday [18 Dec 2013] to strengthen H7N9 prevention and control efforts.

The Chinese mainland has reported 143 human infections attributed to the deadly bird flu virus since it emerged in March [2013]. Earlier this month [December 2013], Hong Kong also confirmed its 1st 2 H7N9 cases, including an Indonesian national and a mainland resident.

Also on Wednesday [18 Dec 2013], health authorities in east China's Jiangxi Province confirmed a human case of H10N8, a new strain of bird flu known to affect humans. A 73-year-old woman who died of respiratory failure on 6 Dec [2013] was later confirmed to have been carrying the H10N8 virus by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the provincial health department. The statement did not mention whether her death was connected to the bird flu virus.

[The number of human cases of H7N9 avian influenza virus infection in South China is continuing to rise, following a period of quiescence during the summer months. Middle-aged to elderly patients predominate, and there has been as yet little sign of commencement of the expected winter epidemic of seasonal influenza. It is likely that the appearance of H7N9 avian influenza cases reflects a relaxation of controls in the sale of domestic poultry imposed during the summer months. - Mod.CP
