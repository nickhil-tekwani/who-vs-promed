----------------------------------------------------
A posting about a "massive honey bee die-off in Montecito" dated 30 Jan 2013 reported that the Santa Barbara Bee Keeper's Association (SBBA) responded to concerns of a backyard beekeeper when she noticed hundreds of dead and dying bees outside her backyard beehives.

SBBA submitted 4 samples for a pesticide analysis. Several pesticides were detected but, as SBBA pointed out, this does not prove that pesticides were behind the die-offs, although it does point to them as one of many possible factors. The article went on to say that the SBBA believes pesticides are an important contributor to pollinator declines worldwide and to colony collapse disorder (CCD) and urged caution and restraint when using pesticides.

I am surprised that ProMED-mail, a scientific ListServ, would carry an article such as this. There are many scientific errors in the article, not the least of which are jumping directly from a correlation (measured pesticides) to assuming a cause (bee death) and then attributing it to a supposed worldwide phenomenon. In fact, the description of the bee deaths in this instance clearly showed that the cause was not CCD (dead bees are not found around the hive with CCD), and it is questionable whether deaths from only 16 hives can be considered "massive" losses.

Furthermore, there is not a "worldwide" decline in honey bees. Honey bees have been increasing in Canada, for example, and the decline in honey bee hives in the US from the 1940s until a couple of years ago was due, in part, to the economics of honey production, transitioning from a honey-based economy to a commercial pollinator economy by beekeepers. Additional causal factors are poor over-wintering husbandry practices and the introduction of the varroa mite, fungus, and various viruses to the US beekeeping industry (see vanEngelsdorp and Meixner, 2010, J. Invert. Pathol.103: S80-S95). While pesticides may affect bees if present in high enough concentrations, it is irresponsible to move directly from a reported finding of pesticides in 4 samples from one location (with no information about exposure concentrations relative to known effect levels in bees) to an advocacy position claiming global effects of these chemicals on all pollinators.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Fairbrother for her comments and clarification. Dr Fairbrother has many years of experience in eco-toxicology, wildlife toxicology, contaminated site assessment, and regulatory science.

Dr Fairbrother rightly points out that the pattern of bee deaths in this instance are not indicative of CCD.

The common specific signs of CCD are (1) the rapid loss of adult worker bees from affected colonies as evidenced by weak or dead colonies with excess brood populations relative to adult bee populations; (2) a noticeable lack of dead worker bees both within and surrounding the affected hives; and (3) the delayed invasion of hive pests (for example, small hive beetles and wax moths) and kleptoparasitism from neighboring honey bee colonies.

This is a strong argument against a relationship between the Montecito episode and CCD. Nevertheless, pesticides cannot be ruled out as the cause of the bee die-offs in Montecito. I do not think that the representatives of SBBA were claiming that they had discovered that pesticides were the cause of CCD. Instead, I believe they were aware of this relationship and suspected CCD as the cause of the bee mortality they were reporting.

In addition, although perhaps not related to this incident, a link between CCD and pesticides has been suggested by sound scientific studies (see, for example, Science 2012; 335: 1555 and Neurochemistry International 2013; 62: 122-136). - Mod.PMB
