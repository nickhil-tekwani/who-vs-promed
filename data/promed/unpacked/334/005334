[3] False positive tests
Date: Fri 9 Sep 2022

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Testing for _Monkeypox virus_, using Food and Drug Administration 510(k)-cleared non-variola _Orthopoxvirus_ real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and laboratory developed real-time PCR tests, is critical for diagnosis of suspected cases.

What is added by this report?
Three persons with atypical rashes, uncharacteristic illnesses, and absence of risk factors or an epidemiologic link to a known monkeypox case received false-positive real-time PCR test results; late cycle threshold values were all ≥34.

What are the implications for public health practice?
When testing specimens from patients with atypical signs and symptoms or without epidemiologic links or risk factors or where these are unknown, laboratories should reextract and retest specimens with real-time PCR Ct values that are high (≥34) to avoid unnecessary medical treatment and expenditure of public health resources.

[4] USA: 2 neurological cases
Date: Tue 13 Sep 2022

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7138e1.htm


ref: Pastula DM, Copeland MJ, Hannan MC, et al. Two cases of monkeypox-associated encephalomyelitis -- Colorado and the District of Columbia, July-August 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep early release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
_Monkeypox virus_ (MPXV) typically causes a febrile illness with lymphadenopathy and a diffuse vesiculopustular rash; neurologic complications are rare. The current monkeypox outbreak differs clinically and epidemiologically from previous outbreaks, and little is known about potential associated neurologic complications.

What is added by this report?
There are 2 US cases of encephalomyelitis associated with acute MPXV infection that were identified during summer 2022. Whether the underlying pathophysiology resulted from direct viral neuroinvasion or a parainfectious autoimmune process is currently unknown.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Suspected cases of neurologic complications of monkeypox should be reported to state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments to improve understanding of the range of clinical manifestations of MPXV infections during the current outbreak and treatment options.

Discussion
----------
Patients A and B had confirmed systemic MPXV infections with encephalomyelitis appearing within 5 and 9 days, respectively, of illness onset. The underlying pathology behind this is unclear but might represent either MPXV invasion of the CNS or a parainfectious autoimmune process triggered by systemic MPXV infection. Both patients had some clinical and radiographic features of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), typically a monophasic parainfectious autoimmune demyelinating disease of the CNS that primarily affects children but can also occur in adults.

In this report, neither patient was found to have MPXV nucleic acid in the CSF, which would have proven MPXV neuroinvasion. However, absence of detectable nucleic acid in the CSF is not uncommon among CNS viral infections. A CSF _Orthopoxvirus_ immunoglobulin (Ig) M test for detection of virus-specific IgM antibodies, which could suggest viral neuroinvasion, was not performed because this test was not Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified at the time of this report. Results of tests to look for the autoimmune CNS conditions NMOSD and MOGAD were negative. In patient A, neither the rash nor the neurologic condition was thought to be consistent with an active syphilis infection, and the cervical spinal canal stenosis did not fully explain his clinical condition.
