Abstract
--------
A possible malaria control approach involves the dissemination in mosquitoes of inherited symbiotic microbes to block plasmodium transmission. However, in the _Anopheles gambiae_ complex, the primary African vectors of malaria, there are limited reports of inherited symbionts that impair transmission.

We show that a vertically transmitted microsporidian symbiont (_Microsporidia_ MB) in the _An. gambiae_ complex can impair plasmodium transmission. _Microsporidia_ MB is present at moderate prevalence in geographically dispersed populations of _An. arabiensis_ in Kenya, localized to the mosquito midgut and ovaries, and is not associated with significant reductions in adult host fecundity or survival.

Field-collected _Microsporidia_ MB infected _An. arabiensis_ tested negative for _P. falciparum_ gametocytes and, on experimental infection with _P. falciparum_, sporozoites aren't detected in _Microsporidia_ MB infected mosquitoes. As a microbe that impairs plasmodium transmission that is non-virulent and vertically transmitted, _Microsporidia_ MB could be investigated as a strategy to limit malaria transmission.

[The study above by Jeremy K Herren et al showed that _An. arabiensis_, infected with _Microsporidia_ MB failed to develop gametocytes. This means that the transmission of malaria is blocked. If this infection could be propagated in the majority of anopheles mosquitoes it could theoretically impair transmission between human hosts.

Microsporidia are ubiquitous and can be found in many hosts including most mammals. In humans, microsporidia are known to cause diarrhoea in immunocompromised patients. - Mod.EP]
