As of Wed 1 Jun 2011, 4 cases of cholera had been registered in
Mariupol (Donetsk region) and another person suspected of having the
disease was hospitalized, according to a statement posted on the
website of the Donetsk regional sanitary and epidemiological service.

The report notes that all patients were hospitalized and are
receiving the necessary medical treatment, and their condition is
satisfactory.

In addition, a special commission is working in the town, monitoring
the circulation of the causative agents of cholera in environmental
objects. In particular, it is selecting and studying drinking water,
water from open reservoirs, wastewater, food, fish, and examining
patients with symptoms of intestinal disorders and cholera.

"Non-O1 group _Vibrio_ was found in one sample of fish (sprat) taken
at the central market, which cannot cause cholera, but can cause acute
intestinal infections. Investigations are continuing," reads the
statement.

The service also recalled that the use of aquatic resources and
recreational fishing in the waters of the Azov Sea basin adjacent to
the administrative borders of Donetsk region had been suspended from 1
Jun 2011.

A 5th case of cholera has been confirmed in Mariupol city of Donetsk
region in the Eastern Ukraine, the press service of the Ukrainian
Health Ministry said Thu 2 Jun 2011.

According to the statement, a patient with an acute enteric infection
was hospitalized on 30 May 2011. He was diagnosed with cholera on 2
Jun 2011. According to doctors, the patient received the necessary
medical care and there is no threat to his health.

A total of 13 people were hospitalized with suspected cholera in
Mariupol from 29 May 2011; 4 city residents were diagnosed with the
disease as a result of eating fish and drinking water from the Sea of
Azov. Ukraine has temporarily prohibited fishing in the Sea of Azov
due to the cases.

On 1 Jun 2011, the Russian Consumer Protection Service in Rostov
Region in the South tightened border controls with Ukraine following
an outbreak of cholera in the neighboring Donetsk region.

[This outbreak has occurred in a country that has had cholera
intermittently in the past. Although a non-O1 _Vibrio cholerae_ was
isolated from a fish, serotype O1 has been found in the country
previously. Most notably, the 1994-1995 epidemic was well documented
in the early days of ProMED-mail.

Clark and colleagues described that outbreak (Clark CG, Kravetz AN,
Alekseenko VV, et al: Microbiological and epidemiological
investigation of cholera epidemic in Ukraine during 1994 and 1995.
Epidemiol Infect. 1998; 121(1): 1-13). The abstract is shown below:

The Ukraine cholera epidemic of 1994 and 1995 was caused by _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1, serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. This epidemic was
centered in the area around Respublika Krim (Crimea) and Mykolajiv,
and spread to include parts of southern Ukraine. Cases of cholera
occurred between September and November of 1994 and between June and
October of 1995. The 32 fatalities among 1370 recorded cases (case
fatality ratio, 2.3 percent) occurred throughout the course of the
epidemic. _V. cholerae_ from patients with cholera produced cholera
toxin and were resistant to multiple antibiotics, though no resistance
plasmids were found. Conjugation experiments suggested that resistance
to multiple antibiotics may be present on a self-transmissible genetic
element. Environmental sources of _V. cholerae_ O1 El Tor included
sewage, sea, and surface water, and fresh water and marine fish. All
but one of the environmental _V. cholerae_ isolated during the
epidemic were very similar to selected isolates from patients at the
same time, supporting the role of these environmental sources in the
spread of disease. - Mod.LL]
