Hantaviruses have taken 2 lives in Los Santos province in less than 15
days. The latest one, a 34-year-old patient is from the Canas de
Tonosi community [in the] province.

Duylio Taylor, regional health director of Los Santos, said that this
patient went to the Tonosi rural hospital with fever and bodily pain
at 2 in the morning on 25 Dec [2008], and minutes later was moved to
the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas hospital. The physician said that due
to his delicate condition they were going to take him to the capital
city, but he died en route to Panama City.

Taylor said that the clinical diagnosis and laboratory tests carried
out on the patient were positive for a hantavirus, but the Gorgas
Commemorative Laboratory will reconfirm, or not, this diagnosis. The
autopsy was done this past Friday, 26 Dec [2008]. If this latest case
is confirmed, the illnesses due to hantaviruses [in Panama in 2008]
will be increased to 6, 3 of whom have died.

He said that in Canas de Tonosi, where the patient worked, there exist
all the [favorable] conditions to think that he got ill as a result of
a hantavirus [infection].

Ministry of Health officials classified the provinces of Cocle, Los
Santos, and Herrera as endemic with respect to the presence of
hantaviruses.

Epidemiological surveillance studies have revealed that in Panama the
appearance of hantavirus infections is associated with the El Nino and
La Nina environmental phenomena [through their effect on the food
supply of the rodent host. - Mod.JW].

[This report does not indicate which hantaviruses were the etiological
agents involved in these cases, but they were most likely Choclo
virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20081027.3389,
hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio
Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys
fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda
(cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human
pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr James Mills for providing a current list of
worldwide hantaviruses and their reservoir hosts.
