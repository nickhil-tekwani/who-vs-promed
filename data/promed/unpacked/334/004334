[2] Outbreak summaries
- Fri 4 Jan 2019. DRC Ebola outbreak total rises to 613 infections
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/01/drc-ebola-outbreak-total-rises-613-infections
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The Democratic of the Congo (DRC) has 5 more Ebola cases, according to updates from the country's health ministry and the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online dashboard. And in the wake of election protest disruptions, all normal response operations have been restored as of [Tue 1 Jan 2019], the WHO said today [Fri 4 Jan 2019].

In another Ebola development, a man in Sweden who got sick after traveling to Burundi was isolated and hospitalized in Uppsala with suspected Ebola, but tests today [4 Jan 2019] came back negative. Though part of Burundi borders the DRC, no cases have been reported from that country.

Death count reaches 370
---------
In a delayed update for [Thu 3 Jan 2019], the DRC's health ministry today reported one more case, a patient from Komanda in Ituri province. Also, the online dashboard from the WHO's African regional office reflects 4 additional cases, which would raise the outbreak total to 613 cases, including 565 confirmed and 54 suspected cases. Health officials are still investigating 54 suspected infections.

In addition, the [Thu 3 Jan 2019] DRC update reported 2 more deaths, 1 in Beni and the other in Butembo, lifting the outbreak's fatality count to 370.

The number of people vaccinated has reached 54 522, according to yesterday's [Thu 3 Jan 2019] statement.

Regarding vaccination, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said in a Stat interview upon his return from a New Year's visit to the outbreak region that the DRC's Ebola count would be much higher without use of Merck's experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine. He told Stat that he based his assessment on the fact that infections haven't grown exponentially, though he said the WHO should explore the projected impact of the vaccine on the outbreak through modeling studies.

Nosocomial illnesses, hard-hit groups
------------------
In a weekly update yesterday [Thu 3 Jan 2019], the WHO said outbreak response efforts continue, despite recent disruptions in Beni and Butembo connected to the 30 Dec 2018 national election. It said that, to ensure the safety of staff, operations were scaled back for a few hours on election day but have been fully restored.

The agency warned, however, that, after stepped-up field activities in December [2018] that led to a drop in cases in Beni, the outbreak's main hot spot, progress could be lost if prolonged security problems stymie efforts to contain the spread of Ebola.

The report also had more detailed information about healthcare-acquired infections and illness patterns. It said that, as of [Wed 2 Jan 2019], 86 nosocomial infections have been reported, mainly in Beni, Butembo, Katwa, and Mabalako. No new illnesses in healthcare workers have been reported, keeping that total at 55, including 18 deaths.

Of all cases reported in the outbreak, 22% had a history of exposure to a hospital within 3 weeks of getting sick, the WHO said.

The caseload has been highest in female patients ages 15-49 who are eligible for vaccination -- meaning they aren't pregnant -- followed by women age 50 and older. Females make up 61% of confirmed and probable cases, and there have been 29 illnesses in pregnant women, 14 of them in Beni. Fifteen of the infected women were breastfeeding.

Another feature of the DRC's outbreak has been a higher-than-expected number of illnesses in children. In today's update [Fri 4 Jan 2019], the WHO said 16% of cases (96) have been in children younger than 5 years, mostly from Beni, and that 7% (41) involved babies younger than age one.

Contact tracing has been a challenge in light of continuing community resistance and insecurity, resulting in a number of new cases that hadn't been previously identified as contacts. Of all patients, 66% had known contact with an earlier case-patient, 37% had attended a funeral, and 34% had both types of exposure.

Swedish traveler tests negative
-------------------
Meanwhile, media reports earlier today [Fri 4 Jan 2019] from Sweden said a man with a suspected Ebola infection was hospitalized at University Hospital in Uppsala. He developed bloody vomiting after a trip to Burundi in central Africa but was not known to have visited areas where the virus is circulating. In an update this afternoon [Fri 4 Jan 2019], a government statement from Uppsala region said the man had been in Burundi for a number of weeks. It said his tests were also negative for yellow fever, dengue, Marburg, and Rift Valley fever viruses.

The man's symptoms are improving, and tests for other infectious diseases are underway. He is no longer in isolation, and the hospital will reopen its emergency department.

[According to the WHO, 22% of cases had a history of exposure to a hospital within 3 weeks of getting sick. This is a serious problem that can be addressed by training healthcare workers and implementing the practice of barrier nursing and proper use of personal protective wear. It is also noted that the caseload is highest in female patients ages 15-49 -- that is, women of childbearing age -- but the vaccine is not being given to pregnant women.

Fifteen infected women were breastfeeding. It would be good to know if the infants were checked for infection. CDC advises that breast milk of a lactating woman sick with Ebola virus can have Ebola virus in it, just as any other body fluids. See CDC's publication "Recommendations for Breastfeeding/Infant Feeding in the Context of Ebola Virus Disease." But they also state that "breastfeeding is often the best choice for feeding an infant, particularly in settings where resources are limited. However, when safe alternatives to breastfeeding and infant care exist, a mother with confirmed or suspected Ebola virus infection should not have close contact with her infant (including breastfeeding) to reduce the risk of transmitting Ebola virus to her child."

An additional vulnerable group is children who are experiencing higher-than-expected number of illnesses. - Mod.LK]

The response by WHO and partners to the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continues despite disruptions to key services due to security incidents taking place in Beni and Butembo during the recent election on 30 Dec 2018. In order to ensure the safety of all staff deployed, as a precautionary measure, operations were scaled back for a few hours on election day. All normal operations have been fully restored as of [Tue 1 Jan 2019]. After an intensification of field activities in early December [2018], notable improvements can be observed in many areas, notably a decrease in cases in Beni. However, hard-earned progress could still be lost to rebound levels of transmission resulting from prolonged periods of insecurity hampering containment efforts.

- Sat 5 Jan 2019. Ebola response activities cautiously resumed in Beni
[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, online translation, abridged, edited]
https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=adb67a63-f1927b2a-adb48356-0cc47aa8d394-77c6695db017d675&u=http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5298

On the ground, ambulances and other vehicles of the riposte are again in circulation. Also, the agents of various commissions are now at work, even those of the psychosocial commission. Some ransacked bases have been relocated from one place to another. Note that in some areas, this recovery is still [tentative].

"It is in this context that the dignified and secure burials were carried out by the Red Cross of the DRC," confirmed Roger Mutanava, president of the Red Cross in the city and territory of Beni. At the same time, the vaccination operation was uneventful in Oicha, but the vaccination team went back and forth due to the security situation in the Beni region.

In addition, Dr. Justus Nsio, which brought together grassroots leaders, leaders of some civil society organizations, and community leaders from the city of Beni, announced community-based surveillance as a new Ebola response strategy that will be implemented. The community-based surveillance approach will involve sensitizing all households and identifying all households for referral to free care.

All foreigners must also be identified because the outbreaks of contamination have expanded beyond Beni. And the health infrastructures that were actively involved in the response to Ebola will soon be redeveloped and equipped. This is the promise of health minister Oly Ilunga who stayed in Beni. He recalls that the fight against Ebola is effective only with the awareness of the entire population. "Everyone has to take ownership of the fight," Oly Ilunga said.
