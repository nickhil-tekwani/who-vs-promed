Anthrax found on Swedish farm
-----------------------------
A case of anthrax has been discovered at a cattle farm outside
Orebro, in central Sweden. The diagnosis was set on Sunday [24 Jul
2011] by the National Veterinary Institute (Statens
veterinarmedicinska anstalt - SVA). The Swedish Board of Agriculture
(Jordbruksverket) has now taken measures to avoid the infection
spreading.

One cow has been found carrying the infection. But over the past week
several animals have died on the affected farm. "We suspect that
several have died of the same cause. But we've only tested one animal.
The farm has a total of roughly 80 animals, and between 10 to 20 of
them died recently," said Gunilla Hallgren, veterinary at SVA, to the
news agency TT.

"We think this is an old infection that has resurfaced following some
digging in the cow field. We've received some unconfirmed information
that there were anthrax graves there. But the infection doesn't spread
through the air," said Hallgren. "Only dying or dead animals are
contagious, and these animals are never in the food supply chain."

SVA states that the disease occurs practically worldwide. The latest
Swedish case was found in 2008 -- prior to that, no case had been
discovered since 1981. There is no threat to public safety. According
to SVA, there's no risk that the infection will spread to other farms.
Humans can be infected if they have close contact with animals who are
dying of the disease, or have died.

[Not one's normal definition of contagious. But spread to other
animals in a herd or flock can occur if other animals taste the
bacteraemic blood extravasated from an infected carcass. Humans become
infected when skinning and butchering said animals, or from contact
with -- manual or from eating -- contaminated meat. Occasionally human
skin infections follow from exposure to dried contaminated hides.

Disturbance of old anthrax graves is a common cause of the
reappearance of this disease decades after its apparent eradication.
But informed speculation is one thing, confirmation is another. Unless
you find bones on the soil surface -- a good marker of a disturbed
grave -- look for a depression, say 2 m [6.5 ft] long by 1-2 m [3-6.5
ft] wide, that collects rainwater. This is typical of a grave. Sample
the soil there. But remember the spore count may be very low unless
you luck into a nice clump of a few million spores. Usually it is in
the 10s to low 100s/gram soil at best. - Mod MHJ
