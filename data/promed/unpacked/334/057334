A viral epidemic has hit poultry farms in a number of Libyan cities and led to the deaths of tens of thousands of birds, prompting breeders to ask the government to intervene quickly to curb this epidemic.

The epidemic has been diagnosed as Newcastle disease [NCD]. Veterinarians have attributed the cause of the rapid spread of this virus and the increased poultry deaths to a wave of strong winds occurring in Libya. They also point out that there is a lack of awareness among breeders that has led to the outbreak of the disease.

[According to Libya's most recent available annual report to the OIE (2010), NCD is not notifiable, it is monitored in domestic poultry, and routine vaccination is applied. In many Middle-Eastern countries the virus activity in commercial flocks is usually covered up by the routine vaccinations.

Confirmation of the suspected epizootic and additional information, preferably reported to the OIE, are anticipated.

NCD virus may cause conjunctivitis in exposed humans. - Mod.AS
