The posting on leptospirosis in Palau is incorrect in stating that the
indirect hemagglutination assay detects leptospiral IgM. It actually
detects both IgG and IgM, as do other agglutination tests. ELISA-based
specific IgM assays could confirm the diagnosis sooner, as they become
positive earlier in the course of illness than IHA.

Thank you for the clarification regarding leptospirosis serology. Indeed
both IgG and IgM class antibodies are detectable by the hemagglutination
assay.
We may be limited in Palau from performing the leptospirosis ELISA because
of lack of instrumentation (specifically, a spectrophotometer). Information
regarding a rapid assay for leptospirosal IgM that would be suitable under
these circumstances would be greatly appreciated.
