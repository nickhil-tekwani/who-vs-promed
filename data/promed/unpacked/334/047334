Eastern equine encephalitis cases are increasing in South Carolina. The mosquitoborne disease, which can cause twitching, paralysis, depression, and death, has turned up in 25 horses across the state so far this year [2013], according to Dr Boyd Parr, state veterinarian and director of Clemson University Livestock Poultry Health. 7 new cases have been reported in the last week.

"These diagnoses are a vivid reminder of the threat that mosquitoborne diseases represent to horses in our state," Parr said. "Maintaining protection by vaccinating horses is very important this year." Infected mosquitoes that feed on both birds and mammals can transmit the disease to horses and humans. 9 of every 10 horses infected with the virus die of the disease. Any livestock (including horses) that display neurologic signs (stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression, or apprehension) must be reported to the state veterinarian at 803-788-2260 within 48 hours, according to the state law.

The Upstate [western South Carolina] has, thus far, avoided any cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) or West Nile virus (WNV); in fact, there have been no reported West Nile cases in the state this year [2013]. State officials watch each disease closely, as they can be transmitted to humans. There were 14 confirmed cases of encephalitis and 7 of West Nile in the state last year.

Total confirmed encephalitis cases as of 9 Aug 2013 were Horry County (10), Charleston County (3), Sumter County (3), Marion County (2), and one each in Barnwell, Berkeley, Clarendon, Colleton, Lee, and Williamsburg counties [adds up to 24, not 25. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]. Weekly updates are posted at Clemson Livestock Poultry Health's Facebook page.

Eastern equine encephalitis is preventable by vaccinating horses. State officials advise horse owners to make sure both encephalitis and West Nile vaccinations are up-to-date.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health [DPH] has announced a 2nd case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse stabled in western Massachusetts.

According to the DPH, the horse was stabled in Belchertown [Hampshire County], which is the 2nd EEE infected horse this year [2013].

The horse is located near the Amherst [Hampshire County] border and because of last week's [week of 1 Aug 2013] positive mosquitoes, the EEE threat level has been raised to "high" in Amherst, and in Hadley and South Hadley [Hampshire County] the threat level is at "moderate," said the DPH. The towns of Hatfield, Northampton [Hampshire County], and Whately [Franklin County] have been raised to "low."

DPH urges communities designated as "high" and "critical" to cancel evening outdoor events for the remainder of the mosquito season.

"There is clearly a focus of EEE activity around the Amherst, Belchertown border and we want everyone to take precautions to avoid getting bitten," said DPH State Public Health veterinarian Dr Catherine Brown. "People should be using insect repellent and covering up exposed skin already because of both EEE and West Nile virus. Residents in the highest risk areas should also reschedule evening outdoor activities to avoid dusk and nighttime, when mosquitoes are at their most active."

There have been no human cases of West Nile virus or EEE so far this year [2013]. The Massachusetts DPH has provided below some precautions you should take:

Avoid mosquito bites
--------------------
- Apply insect repellent when outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)], or IR3535 according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants under 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 per cent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under 3 years of age.

- Be aware of peak mosquito hours. The hours from dusk to dawn are peak biting times for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during evening or early morning.

- Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites. Wearing long-sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Mosquito-proof your home
------------------------
- Drain standing water. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or discarding items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and change water in birdbaths frequently.

- Install or repair screens. Keep mosquitoes outside by having tightly fitting screens on all of your windows and doors.

Protect your animals
--------------------
Animal owners should reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools -- especially after heavy rains. Water troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats and should be flushed out at least once a week during the summer months to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Owners should also speak with their veterinarian about mosquito repellents approved for use in animals and vaccinations to prevent WNV and EEE.

If an animal is diagnosed with WNV or EEE, owners are required to report to DAR [Department of Agricultural Resources], Division of Animal Health by calling 617-626-1795 and to the Department of Public Health (DPH) by calling 617-983-6800.

More information, including all WNV and EEE positive results from 2013, can be found on the Arbovirus Surveillance Information web page at http://www.mass.gov/dph/mosquito or by calling the DPH Epidemiology Program at 617-983-6800.

DPH has produced a series of 30-second videos on how to prevent mosquito and tick bites and the illnesses that can result. All videos can be found at http://www.mass.gov/MosquitoesAndTicks.

The overwhelming message is, vaccinate your animals. Protect your environment from forming mosquito breeding grounds. It takes a bit of looking for the constantly present puddle that can be a haven for mosquito larvae, but ridding your area of those is critically important.

Take care to use mosquito repellent for yourself and the appropriate repellent for your animals. - Mod.TG]
