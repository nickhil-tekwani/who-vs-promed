Cambodia's malaria cases jump 22.5 percent in 2003
---------------------------------------------
Cambodia's malaria cases jumped by 22.5 percent in 2003 to 132 571
cases, due partly to improvements in reporting but also due to a lack
of funding, health officials say. The latest figures from the
National Centre for Malaria Control showed that better information
was being distributed across the country, encouraging people to seek
treatment, program coordinator Neang Sophan Dara from the centre said.
"In my opinion, it's because now we have a better reporting system,
that's why we are collecting more information," he told AFP. "We have
more education, we have teams disseminating information to the
provinces and campaigns on TV saying if you have malaria, please go
to your health centre," he added.
However, he also said some activities were held up in 2003 due to a
lack of funding, which has been improved by the release of USD 900
000 from the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to be
spent by the end of June 2004. The fund is an international mechanism
created in 2002 to increase resources to fight 3 of the world's most
devastating diseases and to direct those resources to areas of
greatest need.
"We had a gap in funding in 2003, so this may have led malaria cases
to increase. Funding from the Global Fund didn't come through in
2003," Neang Sophan Dara said, adding that the money came through in
January 2004 and spending began in March.
Malaria is a debilitating disease of the liver and red blood cells
endemic in many tropical countries and is variously estimated to kill
between 1.5 million and 2.7 million people a year, 90 percent of them
in Africa.

[Malaria is one of Cambodia's foremost public health problems. In an
estimated population of 11.7 million, approximately 500 000
individuals live in forested areas with intense malaria transmission.
Prevalence rates range from 15-40 percent in villages near or in
forested areas to 0-3 percent in the plains and rice field areas. The
resistance situation is difficult, with multiresistance to several
drugs including chloroquine and mefloquine, and the Ministry of
Health adopted in 2000 a single national treatment policy for
falciparum malaria. This recommends a combination of artesunate and
mefloquine. The policy also involves the strong promotion of rapid
diagnostic tests so that the relatively expensive combination
treatment is given only to those who need it. A map of the
distribution of malaria in Cambodia can be found at:
