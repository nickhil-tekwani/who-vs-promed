Laboratory results have confirmed tularemia in an adult resident in the Greater Sudbury area. This is the 1st human case of tularemia in the Sudbury and District Health Unit's service area since 2003, said a press release. It is believed that the individual became infected through contact with wild game.

Tularemia is a disease of animals and humans caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. It is naturally occurring in Ontario wildlife populations, especially in rabbits, hares, voles, muskrats, beavers, and squirrels and in ticks and small domestic animals.

Humans can become infected through several routes, including:
- bites or licks of an infected animal
- handling or cleaning the carcass of an infected animal, especially the skin or meat
- eating inadequately cooked wild game
- inhalation or exposure beneath the skin to contaminated soil
- drinking contaminated water
- bites of an infected tick or deer fly

Hunters are at higher risk of exposure because of the handling of wild game carcasses. Transmission of tularemia from person to person has not been reported.

[The manifestations of _Francisella tularensis_ infection in this case are not stated nor is the animal suspected to be the reservoir.

Tularemia is caused by _F. tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States, an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.

_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation, as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as acanthamoeba), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.

Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In 1 case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of 1 to 14 days.

The clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza (inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity), and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. - Mod.LL
