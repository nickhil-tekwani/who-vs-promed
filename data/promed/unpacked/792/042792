AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (120): INDONESIA (BALI)

From: Sari Setiogi <SetiogiS@who.or.id>

I would like to clarify the Agence France Presse (AFP) report posted
on ProMED-mail this morning [13 Aug 2007] [see: Avian influenza,
human (119): Indonesia (Bali) 20070813.2643].
The only confirmed case is the 29-year old female. The cause of death
of her 5-year-old daughter may never be determined, as her body was
cremated before any sample could be collected.
My guess is the AFP reporter misunderstood Mr. Khrisnamurthi at
today's [13 Aug 2007] press conference. What he said was that the
samples [from the 29-year-old female] were confirmed positive by both
NIHRD (Ministry of Health laboratory) as well as the Eijkman
Institute (please also note spelling correction).
Thus, Indonesia has, to date, 103 H5N1 confirmed cases, of which 83
have been fatal.
For more details and the press release from today's [13 Aug 2007]
press conference, which was held by the Indonesia National Committee
for Avian Influenza Control and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness
(Komnas FBPI), please refer to
