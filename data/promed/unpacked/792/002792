Dead lioness carrying anthrax buried in Hyderabad
-------------------------------------------------
Veterinary officials buried the 27 year old lioness named Raani in an 8
foot [2.4 metre] long trench after detecting anthrax [bacilli] in the
animal's body, the director of the Zoological Garden, Hyderabad, Manzoor
Bhurt, said on Wednesday [21 Apr 2010].

The authorities concerned decided to abandon the postmortem examination of
Raani and buried her body expeditiously after the lioness died on Monday,
Manzoor Bhurt said. Discovery of deadly anthrax [bacteria] in the blood
sample of the lioness poses a threat that the same virus may be present in
other animals of the Raani Bagh Zoological Garden.

Earlier, the lioness, who developed acute wounds in legs due to nail
infection, had failed to respond to medicines prescribed by the veterinary
specialists of Karachi. After death, the body of Raani was sent to Central
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Tando Jam, for postmortem.

[Unfortunately, Andra Pradesh is a constant player in the OIE data on
India. Just taking the most recent years, OIE reported 39 outbreaks [of
anthrax] in 2005, 46 (2006), 54 (2007), and 26 (2008), all involving cattle
and sheep. Feeding locally-obtained dead animals to feed to carnivores in
zoological gardens occurs regularly around the world, and careless
purchases result in deaths. And it would seem that this lioness was in a
very poor condition.
