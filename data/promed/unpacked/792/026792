Hand, Foot And Mouth Disease Now A Notifiable Disease in Johor Bahru
-------------------------------------------
Malaysia: It is now mandatory for government and private hospitals in Johor
Bahru to report cases of hand, foot and mouth (HFM) disease to the state
Health Department. This puts the disease on a similar level with other
contagious diseases, including dengue, food poisoning, measles, malaria and
HIV, which come under the "notifiable disease" category.
As of last Friday [15 Sep 2000, there had been 158 cases of the HFM disease
recorded between January and August, reports The Star newspaper. Senior
assistant health director (epidemiology) Dr Nooraini Baba, said the
department needs the reports to compile an official data[base on the cases
and to determine whether there is an outbreak. Dr Nooraini added while the
disease
is endemic, parents could prevent their children from contracting the virus
by maintaining a high level of cleanliness in their homes and personal
hygiene. She advised parents not to take children to crowded places such as
supermarkets, public swimming pools, nurseries and day-care centres with
recent cases of the disease.
In a related development, Singapore now has another 43 new cases of HFM
disease found in seven new child-care centres. The Environment Ministry says
this brings the total number of cases to 165 in 29 child-care centres in the
recent outbreak. Fifty-eight children have since recovered and have been
certified fit by doctors to return to their respective child-care
centres. One of the latest child-care centres to be investigated for an
outbreak of the disease is the YWMA Kindergarten in Old Jurong Road.

Cause of the Outbreak of Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease Outbreak in Singapore
--------------------------------------------
The Singapore Health Authorities may not agree with the comments of
Moderator CP in the post entitled "Hand, foot & mouth disease - Singapore
(02)" that the commonly found viruses in the 'region' are enterovirus 71 and
Coxsackie A16. Their 1998 data shows otherwise, in fact an adenovirus was
found.

[The following is an extract from the official report of the Singapore
Ministry of Health supplied to me Dr. Yao concerning a fatal case of Hand,
Foot & Mouth Disease associated with encephalitis and myocarditis in a
two-year old Singaporean Chinese boy which occurred in 1998. The report is
dated 20 Jul 1998 and the full text can be accessed at
.
"Up to 26 Jun 1998, adenovirus was isolated from the specimens obtained from
the boy. No enterovirus {including Enterovirus 71) or other viruses were
detected. Adenovirus commonly causes acute infections of the respiratory
system (lungs) and conjunctivae (eyes). However, it can cause severe
complications like encephalitis. The boy was a sporadic case of hand, foot
and mouth disease complicated by severe adenovirus infection resulting in
death. So far this year, the number of cases of hand, foot and mouth disease
notified is 713, with Enterovirus as the causative agent. Enterovirus 71 was
isolated in one case. All cases were mild and had recovered fully. The rise
in the number of notifications is the result of increased public awareness
of the disease and increased reporting by medical practitioners. The common
symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease are fever, ulcers in the mouth and
rash on the hands and feet. Young children are most susceptible. Hand, foot
and mouth disease is spread through the faecal-oral and respiratory routes.
Transmission of enterovirus infections is increased by poor hygiene and
overcrowded living conditions. To reduce the risk of transmission, family
members of a child with hand, foot and mouth disease should practise a high
standard of hygiene. The affected child should also be kept at home ill
he/she is well. The majority of hand, foot and mouth cases are mild and the
children usually recover fully from the disease. Occasionally, severe
complications of the heart or nervous system occur." The report also
contains a detailed description of the epidemiological characteristics of
adenoviruses, justifying to some extent the role of adenoviruses in hand,
foot and mouth disease.
There is certainly a deficit of information regarding the causation of hand,
foot and moth disease in Malaysia and Singapore, and it is to be hoped that
there will be some hard information forthcoming soon. - Mod.CP
