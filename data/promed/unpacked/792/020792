Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Townsville, QLD, Queensland
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 Jun 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: apiary
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Bees (hives) / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_) hive located at the Port of Townsville as part of routine surveillance and national control program. Whole hive destroyed, dead bees and comb collected and submitted for testing.

Epidemiology:

Epidemiological comments: Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_) hive detected in the Port of Townsville, destroyed on 27 Jun 2016. Dead bees and comb submitted for testing on the same day to the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Operational Science Program, in Brisbane. Varroa species was detected. _Varroa jacobsoni_ was confirmed morphologically by CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), Black Mountain, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, on 30 Jun 2016. Molecular analysis is currently being undertaken. Genetic studies of the hive will be carried out to determine the possible origin of the bees. Further surveillance work, since 27 Jun 2016, has not resulted in further detections of Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_). Along with surveillance, communication and awareness activities within the community and industry are being undertaken.

[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.2.7, Varroosis of honey bees (Infestation of Honey bees with Varroa spp.), from which the following commentary is quoted http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.07_VARROOSIS.pdf:

"The mite _Varroa destructor_ (formerly _Varroa jacobsoni_) is a parasite of adult bees and their brood. It penetrates the intersegmental skin between the abdominal sclera of adult bees to ingest haemolymph. It can sometimes be found between the head and thorax. The number of parasites steadily increases with increasing brood activity and the growth of the bee population, especially late in the season when clinical signs of infestation can 1st be recognised. The life span of the mite depends on temperature and humidity, but in practice it can be said to last from some days to a few months."

_Apis cerana_ is a natural host to 2 major honey bee pests, _Varroa destructor_ and _Nosema ceranae_. See pictures of _Apis cerana_ at http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/Apis_cerana.htm. - Mod.CRD
