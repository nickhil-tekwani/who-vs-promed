A Nuneaton hospital has been forced to close to new patients because of an
infection outbreak. Bramcote Hospital, which rehabilitates elderly
patients, is believed to have been infected with the bug "C.Diff", or
_Clostridium difficile_. It is now no longer accepting new admissions
until the outbreak is under control.
Three patients were initially diagnosed as suffering from the bug last week
and after an investigation a further 2 cases of diarrhea have now been
identified.The bacteria can cause diarrhoea, fever, loss of appetite,
nausea and abdominal pain, and in serious cases can even lead to death. It
can be spread on the hands of people who come into contact with infected
people or with contaminated surfaces such as floors, bedpans or
toilets. It mainly affects older people, particularly those who have been
taking antibiotics for long periods or who have had lengthy stays in hospital.
The Health Protection Agency is now working with North Warwickshire Primary
Care Trust and the hospital to advise on the treatment of the affected
people and on the prevention and control of the infection.
A Primary Care Trust spokeswoman said: "Strict infection control measures
have been instigated at the hospital in order to limit the spread of the
bacterial organism to other patients and staff. In addition visitors are
being encouraged to co-operate with the hospital in using antibacterial
hand gel when visiting their ill relatives. As a further precaution it has
been decided to close the hospital to further patient admissions until all
existing cases have been declared to be free from the infection and
thorough environmental cleaning and other control measures have been put in
place."
