In Para, Brazil, there has been a cluster of Chagas disease cases that officials believe may be related to the consumption of tainted acai berries. This could be because of carelessness in the conditions [during the] preparation of the product. The disease is typically contracted by consuming food or beverages contaminated by infected triatomine bugs, also known as "kissing" bugs.

Illness typically develops by one week after exposure and can last for up to 60 days. Although most infected people never develop symptoms, they remain infected throughout their lives, and around 20% to 30% of patients will develop chronic manifestations of Chagas disease, usually affecting the heart, after a prolonged period without any clinical disease.

To date, 18 people have been sickened and one death has been caused by the outbreak. Travellers who sleep indoors or in air-conditioned or screened hotel rooms are at low risk for exposure to infected kissing bugs, as they tend to be found in poor quality dwellings and are mainly active at night. However, the disease has become more common and can be transmitted through food and freshly pressed juice contaminated with the faeces of insects attracted to ripening fruit.

A recent American Heart Association scientific statement warned of Chagas disease, stating that during the past 40 years, the disease has spread to areas where it has not traditionally been seen, including the USA. The statement aims to summarise the most up-to-date information on diagnosis, screening, and treatment of triatomine infection and "...to increase global awareness among physicians who manage patients with Chagas disease outside of traditionally endemic environments," said Dr. Maria Carmo Pereira Nunes, co-chair of the committee that produced the statement. "This document will help healthcare providers and health systems outside of Latin America recognise, diagnose and treat Chagas disease and prevent further disease transmission."

[The outbreak in Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 2005, brought attention to the risk of foodborne infections with Chagas disease. The Santa Catarina outbreak was probably caused by sugar cane juice contaminated with the triatomine bugs. The largest known outbreak was in 2007 in Caracas, Venezuela, with approximately 130 cases resulting from contaminated guava juice (see list of ProMED postings below). Thus, the present report -- this time linked to acai berries -- reminds us that foodborne transmission in endemic areas is a risk. - Mod.EP
