A Halifax man in his 90s has tested positive for the eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus, the state's 3rd human case this year [2020].

The state Department of Public Health announced on Wednesday afternoon [19 Aug 2020] that a Plymouth County man in his 90s [had] contracted the rare but serious and potentially fatal mosquitoborne disease and presented with meningoencephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain caused by an infection.

As a result of the human case, Halifax's eastern equine encephalitis risk level was raised to critical, while the surrounding towns of East Bridgewater and Hanson were raised to high. The town's board of health [BOH] has banned all outdoor activities from dusk to dawn at public properties, including beaches and playgrounds. "The BOH further advises all residents and visitors to refrain from outside activities in their yards from dusk to dawn," the board of health said in a statement.

No mosquitoes had previously tested positive for the eastern equine encephalitis virus in Halifax. A _Culiseta melanura_ mosquito [common vector of EEE virus] that was collected in town on 10 Aug [2020] did test positive for the West Nile virus.

Halifax joins Middleboro, Carver, and Wilbraham as the other communities with a critical risk level, 9 are at high risk and 18 are at moderate risk for the eastern equine encephalitis virus.

A Middleboro boy under the age of 18 was the 1st person in Massachusetts to test positive for the EEE virus this year [2020], about 2 weeks ago. A Hampden County woman in her 60s was the 2nd, state health officials announced on Saturday [15 Aug 2020].

"All residents are reminded to use mosquito repellent any time they are outside, and those in high and critical risk communities are advised to schedule their outdoor activity to avoid the dusk to dawn hours to reduce exposure to the mosquitoes most likely to spread EEE," the Department of Public Health said in a statement. The Department of Public Health said it continues to work with local health departments and the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources to coordinate mosquito surveillance and appropriate public health response activities. Additional aerial spraying is planned for Plymouth County this week.

Last year [2019] was the 1st year of an anticipated cycle of the EEE virus, which resulted in 3 deaths and 12 human infections. Experts say the cycle could last a few years.

The EEE virus has been detected in 64 mosquitoes so far this year [2020], with over 70 per cent of them in species of mosquitoes that are capable of spreading the virus to people.

[EEE virus transmission continues to be active in Massachusetts this year (2020). As noted earlier, the 1st human case of EEE appeared about 3 weeks after the virus was found in mosquitoes for the 1st time this year (2020). There are now 2 human cases in Plymouth county. There is a human case in Hampden county, as well. Last year (2019) was an unusually active year for EEE virus transmission in the eastern USA, with cases in humans and horses, including in Massachusetts. As mentioned in many previous ProMED-mail posts, horse owners in the eastern and upper midwestern USA states should vaccinate their animals now if they have not done so already. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure to take.
