I have puzzled over this recent pneumonic case of anthrax hospitalised
in Minnesota. The region from Montana east to Minnesota does not have
imported hair or wool mills, and aerosol exposure from handling
carcasses is not a risk in this disease, so how was the patient
exposed? It occurs to me that exposure through the sniffing or
snorting of contaminated illegal drug such as cocaine or heroin, or
even maybe from smoking the latter drug, should be considered. If this
were the case this would involve a _batch_ of contaminated cocaine or
heroin: the potential would exist for other cases, and emergency
clinics in the northern tier of US states should be on the lookout for
similar pneumonic cases, or even nasal anthrax. As drug users tend to
be slow in seeking medical help, some might arrive on the point of
death.

If this hypothesis turned out to be correct, it would then be
necessary to identify what had been added to these illegal drugs and
why, which would make it doubly important for the legal authorities to
acquire samples for bacterial and chemical analysis.

The Scottish medical authorities' experience with injected
contaminated heroin in 2009-2010 may be applicable to the US. I am
assuming that they have truly diagnosed anthrax due to _Bacillus
anthracis_ and not an anthrax-like infection due to a toxic _B.
cereus_. See: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21827220.
