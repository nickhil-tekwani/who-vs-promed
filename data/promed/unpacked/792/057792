A Lee County resident is receiving treatment for exposure to rabies after the family's pet Chihuahua contacted the disease and bit its owner, Lee County rabies officer Buddy Bruce, DVM, reported.

"Two raccoons and a dog in Auburn have tested positive for rabies," Bruce said in a press release. "One raccoon was on Talheim Drive; the other was found on Thistle Lane. The rabid dog, a family pet, was from the 600 block of Lee Road 191. The 2 raccoons exposed several family pets (dogs) in both cases. Human exposure to rabies occurred as well."

Bruce continued, "The rabid dog (Chihuahua) bit its owner before the presumed diagnosis of rabies was made by their veterinarian. All exposed humans are receiving appropriate post-exposure prophylactic treatment for rabies. Exposed pets have all had their rabies vaccination status verified and updated as required."

Bruce urged residents to contact animal control in Auburn, Opelika or Lee County if they see any wild animals out during the daytime or behaving strangely. "Do not approach these animals," he said. "If you see one, call the appropriate authorities to handle the situation. Please be cognizant of any wild animals on your property. Please, check and make sure all your cats, dogs and ferrets are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations.

Lee County Rabies officer Dr Buddy Bruce says more cases of rabies have been popping up in Lee County, the most recent infection being a Lee County resident. Two raccoons tested positive in Auburn on Thursday [21 May 2015] and a chihuahua tested positive Friday [22 May 2015].

The Chihuahua was a household pet that went outside to play but came back inside with rabies. Not long after, the dog bit its owner sending them to the [veterinary] hospital. "It was acting very strangely and came in the house, and the owner noticed it was acting strangely, and it did bite the owner. They took it to the veterinarian who recognized the symptoms consistent with rabies," Bruce said. "We recommended the person go to the hospital, East Alabama Medical Center, for post-exposure prophylactic treatment for rabies."

Bruce says the whole situation could have been avoided if the pet's owner had followed state law and vaccinated the Chihuahua. "This Chihuahua apparently was not up-to-date or never had received a vaccination from the records I've seen, and, therefore, it went out and contracted rabies, from where we don't know, and then came back and exposed the human in the house," said Bruce.

Besides vaccination, knowing the common carriers and symptoms of a rabies infection to look out for can help protect you and your pets. "Animals out in the daytime acting strangely, wild animals, raccoons, nocturnal animals that are out in the day, that's not typical," Bruce said. "If you go outside and you've got a stray animal in the yard, a wild animal, wildlife that will not leave -- they're not scared of you -- then typically, there's something wrong."

It's also important during the summer months, with kids home from school and being outside more, to make sure that if they do leave the house that they keep away from stray animals. "Before you let your children in the yard to play, make sure an adult goes out and looks around. Make sure there's not a wild animal in the vicinity, in the yard, on the edge of the woods. We've actually had a few cases in Lee County recently where raccoons were found and possums found in the yard," Bruce said.

So far this year [2015], more than 30 cases of rabies have been discovered around the state of Alabama. Bruce encourages anyone who sees an animal showing signs of a rabies infection to call animal control.

[For a map of Alabama showing Lee County on the middle of the eastern border of the state, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/alabama_90.jpg, and for Auburn, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/AL/Auburn.html. Frankly it is a small university town, though with a big football team.

The 2 raccoons were found over 2 km apart, north of Hwy 85. The Chihuahua was 1.5 km south of the Thistle lane raccoon and on the south side of Hwy 85. Although the disease takes a few weeks to reveal itself, they were probably separately infected from probably 2 different sources, logically other raccoons.

Being bitten by a rabid possum would leave one rather tattered, and the 1st the owners knew indirectly that their dog had been bitten by a rabid animal was when it displayed abnormal aggressive behaviour. Logically, all domestic pets in Alabama should be vaccinated against rabies, and I would include horses in this protection. - Mod.MHJ
