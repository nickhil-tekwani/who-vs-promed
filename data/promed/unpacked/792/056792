Re: Undiagnosed die-off, ducks - China, Thailand
------------------------------------------------
[Following our earlier RFI, we have been informed that the recent
observations on disease and death affecting breeding duck flocks in
China and Thailand, are in fact caused by an emerging BYD flavivirus
infection, reported on 3 Apr 2011, ProMED archive 20110403.1037. The
following abstract of an article in press adds background information.

Abstract
--------
During investigations into an outbreak of egg production decline,
retarded growth, and even death among ducks in Southeast China, a
novel Tembusu virus strain named _Tembusu virus Fengxian 2010
(FX2010)_ was isolated. This virus replicated in embryonated chicken
eggs and caused embryo death. In cross-neutralization tests, antiserum
to the partial E protein of Tembusu virus Mm1775 strain neutralized
FX2010, whereas antiserum to Japanese encephalitis virus did not.
FX2010 is an enveloped RNA virus of approximately 45Â­50 nm in
diameter.

Sequence analysis of its E and NS5 genes showed that both genes share
up to 99.6 percent nucleotide sequence identity with Baiyangdian
virus, and up to 88 percent nucleotide sequence identity with their
counterparts in Tembusu virus. FX2010 was transmitted without
mosquito, and caused systemic infection and lesions in experimentally
infected ducks. These results indicate that FX2010 and BYD virus are
newly emerged Tembusu virus strains that cause an infectious disease
in ducks.

[The following passage is copied from the discussion paragraph (for
the numerous included references, see the original paper):

"Only a limited number of flaviviruses have been reported to cause
duck infectious diseases, although many flaviviruses, whose
pathogenicity for animals is unknown, have been isolated from
mosquitoes, ticks, and bats. Tembusu virus was isolated from
mosquitoes in Kuala Lumpur in 1955. Since then, Tembusu virus has been
isolated from the _Culex_ species of mosquitoes in Malaysia and
Thailand. Encephalitis and retarded growth of chicks caused by a
Tembusu virus was first reported in Malaysia. In addition, high levels
of serum-neutralizing antibody against Tembusu virus have been
reported in humans in Malaysia, although a disease associated with
Tembusu virus infection has not yet been reported. It remains unknown
whether FX2010-like Tembusu virus can infect humans [sic; it says just
above "high levels of serum-neutralizing antibody against Tembusu
virus have been reported in humans in Malaysia"], although the virus
has spread widely in Southeast China. However, given that the areas
where FX2010-like Tembusu virus is circulating are among the most
densely populated areas in the world, this virus may pose a threat to
human health in the future. We recommend that human serological
surveillance be conducted in FX2010-like Tembusu virus-circulating
areas as soon as possible."

The abstract of an earlier paper on this emerging duck disease, titled
'Duck Egg-Drop Syndrome Caused by BYD Virus, a New Tembusu-Related
Flavivirus,' was included and discussed in ProMED archive 20110403.1037. The virus isolated was named Baiyangdian (BYD) virus
(BYDV) after the name of the region where the virus was 1st isolated.

Any updated information on the current distribution of BYD and on
measures applied to prevent its transboundary spread by international
trade of breeding material, will be appreciated. Vigilance pertaining
to its possible (hopefully, to be excluded) zoonotic potential is
prescribed. - Mod.AS]
