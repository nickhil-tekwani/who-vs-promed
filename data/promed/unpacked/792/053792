Case of Human Conjunctivitis due to Low Pathogenicity H7N3 Avian
Influenza in the UK
-----------------------------------------------
Last week, veterinary authorities in the UK reported that there had
been some cases of A/H7 avian influenza (AI) in birds in a commercial
chicken farm in Eastern England - see:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/latest/2006/animal-0426.htm>.
Avian influenzas of the A/H7 type can be either highly pathogenic
(Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza - HPAI) or of low pathogenicity
for birds (so called LPAI). Low pathogenicity viruses are less
dangerous than HPAIs to birds and some birds infected with LPAIs do
not even become ill. There is now a preliminary report from the
European Union Veterinary Influenza Reference Laboratory that the
virus in the chickens is of type A/H7N3, and that it is of low pathogenicity.
Both low pathogenicity and high pathogenicity H7N3 avian influenza
viruses acquired from birds have occasionally infected humans in the
past in Europe and elsewhere in the world. This sometimes has
resulted in mild illness (usually eye infections with flu-like
symptoms) or simply asymptomatic infection in people handling
infected birds (1,2).
On Friday (28 Apr 2006), the UK authorities (the Health Protection
Agency) reported that a man working with the chickens in the affected
farm had developed conjunctivitis, that this had been confirmed to be
H7N3, and that it was being treated with antivirals. The UK
authorities also reported that they had intensive surveillance in
place and were offering antivirals to all exposed persons.
Information on the incident is available at <http://www.hpa.org.uk/>,
specifically at
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/news/articles/press_releases/2006/060428_avian_flu_h7.htm>.
On Saturday [29 Apr 2006], the UK Veterinary authorities made public
that cases of A/H7N3 had also been found in chickens in another pair
of farms in the protection zone around the original farm
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2006/060429a.htm>. Consequently, the
public health authorities (the Health Protection Agency) have widened
their surveillance activities to include those farms and other places
the chickens will have gone (e.g. local slaughterhouses). A few
suspect cases of conjunctivitis and other respiratory illnesses are
coming through this system, but to date, all these have proved to be
negative for A/H3N7, though some were put on oseltamivir as a
precaution before the test result came through.
ECDC Commentary
---------------
The human case came to light because, as a precaution, and in
addition to the veterinary measures taken to stop further infection
of birds, the UK public health authorities (led by the HPA) also
started monitoring the health of the people working on the farm where
the outbreak occurred and engaged in the culling processes. They also
made sure the workers and those engaged in culling were taking all
the necessary precautions, and they considered whether to start any
on medication.
The UK authorities have pointed out that this is not the 1st case of
conjunctivitis due to an avian influenza in the UK, as in the 1990s,
another person caught conjunctivitis attributed to an LPAI (also
H7N3) from the waste products of domestic poultry (they were cleaning
out a poultry shed) (3).
The reason for the UK authorities' particularly precautionary action
at an early stage (when they only knew they were dealing with an A/H7
strain) was the experience with a different and highly pathogenic
avian influenza virus, A/H7N7, that affected chickens in the
Netherlands, Belgium and a small part of Germany in 2003 (4-6). As
well as killing many chickens, that virus infected some people
working with the chickens. Some of them even passed the infection
onto their immediate close family, though there was no further person
to person spread. All these Dutch cases experienced only mild to
moderate symptoms (conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness) but
with one important exception in that one infection in a previously
healthy veterinarian had a fatal outcome (6). However, such severe
illness has never been reported with a low pathogenicity avian
influenza virus or with A/H7N3 (HPAI or LPAI). Similarly, person to
person spread of LPAIs has never been reported.
LPAIs are quite common in poultry (chickens and ducks) and mostly are
only of interest to veterinarians, to whom they are of concern
because they sometimes change to become highly pathogenic viruses.
This case emphasizes the importance of people taking basic hygienic
precautions if they are in close contact with any poultry or poultry
waste products (feces). The precautions for avoiding low pathogen
city infections are available on the ECDC website and are the same as
for avoiding HPAIs <http://www.ecdc.eu.int/avian_influenza/Health_Advice.php>.
Finally, it must be emphasized that the virus involved here is a low
pathogenicity virus and not the highly pathogenic avian influenza
A/H5N1, often referred to as "bird flu".

The Involvement of H7N7 virus in the Death of a Veterinarian in 2003
-----------------------------------------------
In the Moderator's commentary to the findings on H7N7 in The
Netherlands, it is stated that the death of the veterinarian was not
connected to H7N7 infection. That is incorrect: high levels of virus
were detected in BAL and in the lungs of this person, and there was
no underlying illness explaining the severe course of disease. In
addition, the virus isolated from this case had accumulated a
significant amount of mutations, including some that are associated
with increased virulence in an animal model (Fouchier et al., 2004;
Koopmans et al, 2004).
Finally, I would like to point out that we detected H7N7 infections
(with conjunctivitis) in 3 household contacts of poultry workers who
had no direct contact with poultry. Based on an in-depth interview,
in these cases, it was concluded that they most likely were secondary
transmissions.
We would appreciate it if you could correct the previous statement.

[Drs Koopmans and Meijer (and also Dr. Yeva Johnson of the San
Francisco Dept of Public Health) have drawn attention to my erroneous
statement regarding the cause of the death of the Dutch veterinarian
in the 2003 H7H7 outbreak in the Netherlands. This comment conveyed
my personal recollection, and for lack of time, I failed to verify
the correctness of my statement, for which I apologize.
To set the record straight, I am reproducing a paragraph from the
paper in PNAS (Fouchier RA, Schneeberger PM, Rozendaal FW, Broekman
JM, Kemink SAG, Munster V, et al. Avian influenza A (H7N7) virus
associated with human conjunctivitis and a fatal case of acute
respiratory distress syndrome. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004;
101(5):1356-61), which gives a detailed account of the investigation
into the cause of death of this unfortunate veterinarian.
The relevant paragraph reads: "A 57-year-old veterinarian who visited
a poultry farm affected by HPAI H7N7 infection in Teeffelen, The
Netherlands, died on April 17, 2003, as the result of pneumonia
followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome and related
complications in a hospital in Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands.
On April 4, the veterinarian suffered from high fever and severe
headache. When he 1st visited his family doctor for persisting fever
and headache 4 days later, no signs of respiratory disease or
conjunctivitis were observed, and the man, therefore, did not receive
medication. Because of his farm visit on April 2, throat and eye
swabs were collected on April 9. RT-PCR tests performed in two
laboratories were negative. On April 11, the man was admitted to
hospital, and interstitial opacities in the lower right lobe were
detected. Treatment with oxygen and i.v. antibiotics (750 mg of
cefuroxime three times daily and 1000 mg of erythromycin four times
daily) was started. He was moved to the intensive care unit 2 days
later with deteriorating conditions and was put on mechanical
ventilation. X-thorax, performed on April 13 when his condition
worsened, revealed a bilateral pneumonia, and a bronchoalveolar
lavage was performed for diagnostic purposes. Throat swab samples
collected on April 11 and April 13 indicated the presence of herpes
simplex virus 1, for which he was treated with acyclovir. On April
14, his renal function decreased and dialysis was started. On April
17, his pulmonary condition worsened further and he died of
respiratory insufficiency. Laboratory testing for specific diseases
(Q fever, brucellosis, psittacosis, Legionnaire's disease,
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and tuberculosis) and pathogens
[pneumococci, mycoplasms, Chlamydia, respiratory syncytial virus,
influenza B virus, human metapneumovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes
simplex virus 2, HIV, Puumala hantavirus, and severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus] were all negative.
The bronchoalveolar lavage revealed the presence of H7 AIV by using
real-time PCR assays. PCR analysis and virus isolation from
postmortem specimens of the right and left lung confirmed the
presence of H7 AIV (A/Netherlands/219/03). A serum sample collected
on April 17 displayed very weak, inconclusive reactivity with H7 AIV
in hemagglutination inhibition assays. It is unclear why the
respiratory sample collected from the veterinarian on April 9
remained negative when RT-PCR and virus isolation were performed."
Notwithstanding the final qualification, it is clear that H7N7 virus
infection was responsible for the death of the veterinarian. I regret
my error and thank the correspondents for bringing this to my
attention and enabling me to make this correction. - Mod.CP]
