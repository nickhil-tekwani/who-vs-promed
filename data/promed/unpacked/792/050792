Peruvian National Institute of Health (INS): quarantine lifted
--------------------------------------------------------------
Members of the Chang An 168's crew and the Peruvian personnel in
contact with them are in good health, and local health authorities
therefore lifted the quarantine on [22 Apr 2008].

According to the ship's captain, the only symptom in the 2 fatal cases
on board of the ship was fever, 5 and 2 hours (respectively) prior to
death, but the language barrier has precluded a more detailed
investigation. [Poor excuse: there is a Chinese restaurant in every
major city worldwide! - Mod.JW]

Immunofluorescence showed evidence of adenovirus infection in the 2
cases and in 6 other crewmembers. No evidence of other respiratory
viruses has been found. Cultures for adenovirus are being processed
at this time, but there is still no evidence of a "mutant" strain.
Tests for leptospirosis were negative in all crewmembers. Upon
contact with Peruvian health personnel, 15 of the fishermen had mild
respiratory symptoms, but none had fever. No evidence of adenovirus
or respiratory symptoms has been found on a crewmember that provided
mouth-to-mouth breathing to one of the victims.

Autopsies on the fatal cases showed evidence of pneumonia and
cerebral edema. Histopathology revealed evidence of a toxic process,
although samples from the corpses were negative to 12 toxins
evaluated.

The ship set sail from Yan Tai on 19 Aug 2007 and has remained at sea
since. The Chang An 168 remained quarantined since 15 Mar 2008, when
it delivered its cargo to the (mother ship) Dong Fen in international
waters.

studies can contact Dr Patricia Garcia, Chief of the Peruvian

[Although this may be a suspected toxin, it is difficult to judge just
what it might be. There are 2 previous articles discussing adenovirus
and flu, but aside from a mention of fever of undetermined origin
(FUO) and what may have been excessive pain, there is not a lot of
basis to speculate on a toxic cause. The evidence is confusing and
hopefully something more definitive will be identified. - Mod.TG]
