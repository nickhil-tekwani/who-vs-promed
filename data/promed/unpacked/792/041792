The African swine fever (ASF) virus has now spread to other districts, infecting both domestic pigs and their cousins, the wild bearded pigs [see comment]. In a statement here [in Kota Kinabalu] yesterday (Sun 7 Mar 2021), deputy chief minister Datuk Seri Panglima Dr Jeffrey Kitingan said the virus was detected among domestic pigs in Kota Marudu and Pitas as well as wild bearded pigs in Lahad Datu, Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Beluran, and Telupid [Sabah province]. "This includes the case of a dead wild bearded pig at a resort in the Kinabatangan district which went viral on social media last week [week of 1 Mar 2021]," he said.

Fortunately, he said commercial pig farms in Tawau, Sandakan, Tenom, Papar, Tuaran, and Penampang that supply most of Sabah's pork products are still free of the ASF virus. "We must ensure these areas remain ASF-free so that the pork production for local consumption is not affected. Even though ASF does not infect humans, it is capable of causing great economic damage as well as disrupting the well-being of our society. Therefore, it is crucial for us to control and eliminate this disease," he said.

Kitingan who is also the agriculture and fisheries minister, said the government will declare affected districts as ASF outbreak areas in accordance with the Animal Enactment 2015. This declaration, which would be made by the respective district and municipal administrators, would allow the DVS [Department of Veterinary Services] to carry out effective control measures through the District Disaster Management Committee. Pigs in areas where the ASF virus was found would be destroyed and disposed of and the areas disinfected, starting from the epicentre where the virus was first detected.

The Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD) will also help to coordinate efforts to control the spread of the ASF virus from the wild bearded pigs to commercial pigs by suspending hunting licences and prohibiting the selling of 'sinalau bakas' as previously stated.

"We will set up the ASF Disease Crisis Management Committee, chaired by the DVS director. This committee will include the SWD, security forces, Local Government and Housing Ministry representatives, State Attorney-General Office representatives, and other related agencies. They will help to formulate the necessary policies to control and subsequently eradicate the ASF in Sabah as soon as possible," said Kitingan.

So far, he said a total of 110 pigs from nine villages in the ASF infection zone have been destroyed and disposed of. DVS has carried out its awareness campaigns in 54 out of 182 villages in Pitas.

As of Saturday [6 Mar 2021], a total of 347 samples were collected from various districts to detect the presence of the ASF virus throughout Sabah.

[Malaysia's first ASF outbreak reportedly started on 8 Feb 2021. The immediate notification to the OIE, submitted 26 Feb 2021, addressed 5 locations in Sabah, a Malaysian state occupying the northern part of the island of Borneo which is shared between Malaysia and Indonesia. The report included the following epidemiological comments (see 20210227.8216574):

"The 1st reported case involved wild boar mortality. Following the death of wild boar in Kinabatangan (which tested negative with conventional PCR by Sabah Department of Veterinary Services Laboratory), the disease investigation was extended to the neighboring district, where the 1st case of mortality involving backyard pigs in Pitas was reported. After the laboratory confirmation, the surveillance is intensified and extended to other districts encompassing the 50-km (about 31 mi) radius from the index case. Sabah Wildlife Department reported on the wild boar mortality in Beluran district, where samples were taken and found positive for African swine fever. Surveillance then expanded outside the containment zone to cover the whole Sabah State. Currently, surveillance is conducted and intensified in the whole country."

According to the current media report, the virus has been spreading further in Sabah in wild boar and domestic pigs.

The wild bearded pig (_Sus barbatus_) is a vulnerable animal species included in IUCN red list; see https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/41772/123793370. There are 2 subspecies, _Sus barbatus barbatus_ from Peninsular (West) Malaysia, Borneo, and Sibutu Island (west of the Sulu Archipelago), which is the one currently known to be ASF-affected, and _Sus barbatus oi_ from Sumatra, Bangka, and Palang Bintang in the Riau Archipelago.

ASF continues its spread in Asia and Europe. In Asia, since the disease was first officially reported by China in August 2018, it has spread to Mongolia, Viet Nam, Cambodia, North Korea, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, South Korea, East Timor, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, India, and now Malaysia. In Europe, its massive spread westwards has already reached Eastern Germany.

No vaccine against ASF is yet available; the virus is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
