Central Nervous System (CNS) Disorder in Grey Kangaroo
--------------------------------------------------------
During the course of 3 months, 6 grey kangaroos in a group of (originally)
19 animals in a Swedish zoo have died/been euthanized after up to a week of
illness. Another 2 animals are seriously ill. Previous to death the animals
were lethargic and showed CNS symptoms, beginning with head shaking and
difficulty chewing, progressing to reluctance to move around, with the
animals crouching in a corner with the nose in the ground.
Post-mortem examination revealed a non-purulent meningoencephalitis with no
signs of tissue necrosis, which looks as if caused by a viral infection.
Attempts to isolate a virus have been futile so far. Immunohistochemical
tests for toxoplasmosis were negative, and no signs of a protozoal
infection could be seen on microscopic examination. No lesions could be
found anywhere but the brain.
During the last decade, 4 zebras have died in the zoo, the last one this
month, also with CNS symptoms. These animals had similar lesions
(non-purulent meningoencephalitis) on post-mortem but no infectious agent
could be isolated. Serum samples were tested for some equine viruses, to no
avail. Most of our serological tests are only validated for sera from
domestic animals and would probably not work on kangaroo sera (we have no
kangaroo specific antibodies).
The zoo holds a great variety of animals, including cattle, ponies, camels,
guanacos, sheep, monkeys, raccoons, birds, and they have occasional
(accidental) visits by Swedish wildlife (squirrels, badgers, foxes, sea
birds, deer).
Any suggestions on probable causes and how to diagnose them in kangaroos
would be greatly appreciated.
