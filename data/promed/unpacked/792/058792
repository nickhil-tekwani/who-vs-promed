--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution of COVID-19. We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those pre-symptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptoms onset as a forward time. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available data. The estimated median incubation period is 7.76 days (95% CI: 7.02-8.53), the 90th percentile is 14.28 days (95% CI: 13.64-14.90). By taking the possibility that a small portion of patients may contract the disease on their way out of Wuhan, the estimated probability that incubation period is longer than 14 days is between 5% to 10%.

[This is a very interesting approach to address questions of the incubation period. The final assessment estimates a 1 day extension from our accepted 14 days to possibly just below 15 days. A limitation of this study is the presumption that there was no risk of contagion after departure from Wuhan except for intrafamilial spread when family members traveled together. The study mentions" Individuals in our selected cohort were those who got infected in the early days of the outbreak. They were likely the 1st- or 2nd-generation cases. Our results do not apply to higher generation cases if the virus mutates." Information on possible silent spread of the virus outside of Wuhan during the study time frame was not provided, but given the stealth nature of the virus which we now recognize, the possibility of silent spread in locations traveled to may have led to later exposure dates, and the presumption these were 1st and 2nd generation cases may not be accurate.- Mod.MPP]

At least 97 000 children in the United States tested positive for the coronavirus the last 2 weeks of July [2020] alone, according to a new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. The report says that at least 338 000 children have been infected since the pandemic began, meaning more than a quarter have been infected in just those 2 weeks.

The report comes as parents and education leaders grapple with the challenges of resuming schooling as the virus continues to surge in parts of the country. More than 7 out of 10 infections were from states in the South and West, according to the report, which relied on data from 49 states along with Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and Guam. The count could be higher because the report did not include complete data from Texas and information from parts of New York State outside of New York City.

Missouri, Oklahoma, Alaska, Nevada, Idaho, and Montana were among the states with the highest percent increase of child infections during that period, according to the report. New York City, New Jersey, and other states in the Northeast, where the virus peaked in March [2020] and April [2020], had the lowest percent increase of child infections, according to the report. In total, 338 982 children have been infected, according to the report.

Not every locality where data was collected categorized children in the same age range. Most places cited in the report considered children to be people no older than 17 or 19. In Alabama, though, the age limit was 24; in Florida and Utah, the age limit was 14.

The report noted that children rarely get severely sick from Covid-19, but another report, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, highlighted how the threat from a new COVID-19-related condition, called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children or MIS-C, has disproportionately affected people of color. The CDC said that from early March [2020] through late July [2020], it received reports of 570 young people -- ranging from infants to age 20 -- who met the definition of MIS-C. Most of those patients were previously healthy, the report said. About 40 percent were Hispanic or latino; 33 percent were black and 13 percent were white, the report said. 10 died and nearly 2/3 were admitted to intensive care units, it said. Symptoms include a fever, rash, pinkeye, stomach distress, confusion, bluish lips, muscle weakness, racing heart rate, and cardiac shock.

A reopened high school in Georgia that drew national attention over images of its crowded hallways has had at least 9 coronavirus cases reported in the last week and is switching to online-only instruction for at least the next 2 days while the school is disinfected and officials assess the situation. "At this time, we know there were 6 students and 3 staff members who were in school for at least some time last week who have since reported to us that they have tested positive," Gabe Carmona, the principal of North Paulding High School in Dallas, Georgia, said in a letter to parents and guardians of the school's students on Saturday [8 Aug 2020].

The superintendent of the Paulding County School District, Brian Otott, sent them another letter Sunday [9 Aug 2020] advising them about the switch to online instruction for Monday [10 Aug 2020] and Tuesday [11 Aug 2020], at the least. Both letters encouraged parents to check their children's temperature twice daily and to monitor them for symptoms. Neither letter made any mention of social distancing or wearing masks, which the school has said are encouraged but not mandatory.

Photos circulated widely online last week [week of 3 Aug 2020] showed North Paulding students crowded in a school hallway with few in masks. [A] 15-year-old student who posted one of the images, was initially suspended for doing so but the suspension was rescinded. After the photo spread over social media, Mr Otott said masks were not required at the school, which has about 2000 students, because "there is no practical way to enforce a mandate to wear them."

But Dr Gary Voccio, the health director for Paulding County and 9 other counties in Northwest Georgia, said that masks were crucial to containing the spread of the virus. "Of course you have to change classrooms, and it's going to be very difficult to physically distance when that occurs," Dr Voccio said in a video posted on Facebook. "But the masks, again, are the important part of this problem. And we will have significant cases within the schools, I'm sure."

At least 66 new coronavirus deaths and 4032 new cases were reported in Georgia on Saturday, according to a New York Times database.

[Opening up schools without ensuring non-pharmaceutical prevention methods such as social distancing and the use of face masks endangers the students, the teachers and other staff, as well as the adult members of the households these students come from. It feels like a déjà vu experience with states in the middle of increasing transmission surges, lifting restrictions before reducing the transmission load. Sigh... - Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update [note: weekend reporting artifact]:

- The Americas region reported 57.3% of the global newly reported cases and 67.4% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 10.4 million cases. The USA reported 38.9% of cases (61 028), followed by Brazil 32.0% (50 230), Colombia 6.0% (9486), Peru 5.4% (8466), Argentina 4.8% (7482), Mexico 4.3% (6717), and Chile 1.4% (2198).

- The European region reported 6.1% of the global newly reported cases and 5.3% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 31.0% (5189) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by (Spain 0 % (0), (Kazakhstan 0% (0), France 0% (0), Israel 0% (0)), Romania 8.1% (1350), Ukraine 7.2% (1199), Turkey 7.0% (1172), Poland 5.0% (843), the UK 4.5% (758), Uzbekistan 4.4% (738), Germany 3.3% (555), and Netherlands 2.9% (486). Countries not reporting any new cases include: Spain, France, Kazakhstan, Sweden, Israel, Belgium, and others.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.2% of the global newly reported cases and 5.2% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 28.9% (3325) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 18.5% (2125), Saudi Arabia 12.8% (1469), Morocco 11.7% (1345), Pakistan 5.5% (634), Kuwait 4.1% (472), Palestinian Authority 3.7% (426), Bahrain 2.8% (322), Oman 2.5% (290), and Lebanon 2.4% (272). Cases are continuing to increase in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 4.6% of the global newly reported cases and 5.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 61.8% (7712) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ethiopia 6.4% (801), Zambia 5.9% (739), Kenya 5.6% (699), Algeria 4.3% (538), Nigeria 3.6% (453), Ghana 3.5% (436), and Madagascar 1.7% (214). While South Africa is the dominant country in the region, it has halved its daily case count in the past week.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.3% of the global newly reported cases and 0.89% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 66.7% (4131) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 21.7% (1343), Australia 6.9% (426), Singapore 2.1% (132), China 1.5% (94), South Korea 0.58% (36), and Viet Nam 0.37% (23). Japan and Australia continue with elevated transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 25.5% of the global newly reported cases and 15.5% of global deaths. India reported 92.3% (64 399) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 3.7% (2611), and Indonesia 3.3% (2277). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same, even with weekend reporting artifact. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries that have resurgences of cases associated with lifting of restrictions.

[Note: there is weekend artifact in daily reported cases as key surge countries have not reported any cases today [9 Aug 2020]. Spain and France are notable as are reduced reports from some states in Brazil and the USA.

Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (8 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The global cumulative count has crossed the 20 million mark, having crossed the 19 million mark on 6 Aug 2020.

The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (62 117), followed by USA (49 721), and Brazil (22 213) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (63.1%). There were 5612 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, South Africa, Russia, Argentina, Mexico, and Philippines -- the same 10 countries as yesterday (8 Aug 2020). The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3028 to 62 117. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, Bangladesh, Chile, Iran, Indonesia, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia Japan, Morocco, and Ukraine; their range of reported new cases is 1199 to 2726.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease of 1.5%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 1.6%. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether this is a reporting artifact. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind!).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; albeit, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases and deaths (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate is 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with cases increasing daily, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
