Public health officials in Norway are investigating an outbreak of salmonellosis with up to 20 patients. Folkehelseinstituttet (the Norwegian Institute of Public Health) reported the outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis has seen 10 people need hospital treatment. A dozen people have been diagnosed with the outbreak strain, and there are 8 suspected cases. Samples were taken from the end of January [2021] through the end of February [2021].

Patients are geographically spread across Norway: 9 live in Viken, 3 in Oslo, and 2 in Innlandet, while Vestfold og Telemark, Agder, Rogaland, Vestland, More og Romsdal, and Nordland each have 1 patient. Those sick are aged 11-91 years old, and 60% are women. Folkehelseinstituttet suspects the source of infection is a widely distributed food, but the exact vehicle is not yet known.

Outbreak investigations have been started with the relevant local units, the Veterinary Institute and Mattilsynet (the Norwegian Food Safety Authority). Patients are being interviewed, and Mattilsynet is taking samples from food products in the homes of those who are infected.

Hilde Marie Lund, from Folkehelseinstituttet, said it was too early to say if it was a limited outbreak or there will be an increase in people affected. She added that the large proportion of patients admitted to hospital may be related to the overall relatively high age of those affected, but this is being investigated further.

The outbreak strain has the same sequence type (ST) as the one causing _S._ Enteritidis infections linked to poultry products from Poland that has affected 9 countries, which is ST-11; however, the Norwegian outbreak strain does not cluster with strains within this outbreak, meaning they are not related. Norway also has no patients in the outbreak traced to frozen breaded poultry items. Every year, between 900 and 1300 cases of salmonellosis are reported to Folkehelseinstituttet, with most people infected abroad.
