Wild poliovirus in Cameroon -- 21 Nov 2013
------------------------------------------
Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been confirmed in Cameroon, the 1st wild poliovirus in the country since 2009. Wild poliovirus was isolated from 2 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from West Region. The patients developed paralysis on [1 Oct 2013] and [19 Oct 2013]. Genetic sequencing indicates that these viruses are linked to wild poliovirus last detected in Chad in 2011.

An emergency outbreak response plan is being finalized, including at least 3 national immunization days (NIDs), the 1st of which was conducted on [25-27 Oct 2013]. Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) will be implemented in December 2013, followed by 2 subsequent national immunization days in January and February 2014. Routine immunization rates are reported to be about 85.3 per cent for oral polio vaccine (OPV3 [3 doses of OPV vaccine]). A response in neighbouring countries is also being planned, notably in Chad and Central African Republic.

Considering that this strain was last detected in the region in 2011, plans are also being developed to strengthen surveillance activities starting with a detailed analysis of sub-national surveillance sensitivity across the region to more clearly ascertain any gaps.

In 2013, Cameroon also reported 4 cases due to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in the Far North region. The patients developed paralysis between [9 May and 12 Aug 2013]. The viruses are linked to circulation in Chad, which was also detected in Nigeria and Niger. In response, several large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) had been conducted during the months of August and September [2013], followed by the full national immunization days in October 2013.

This event confirms the risk of ongoing international spread of a pathogen (wild poliovirus) slated for eradication. Given the history of international spread of polio from northern Nigeria across West and Central Africa and subnational surveillance gaps, WHO assesses the risk of further international spread across the region as high.

It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

Data in WHO as of 20 Nov 2012 for 2012 data and 19 Nov 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- Mass polio vaccination campaigns are taking place across the Middle East, targeting 22 million children in 7 countries. Countries in the region have called for support in negotiating and establishing access to unvaccinated children. WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccinating all Syrian children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.

- In southern Afghanistan, the traditional endemic region in the country, no WPV cases have been reported for one year.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 9 (all WPV1). All WPV1 cases in 2013 are reported from Eastern Region, close to the Pakistan border. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [27 Sep 2013] from Chapa Dara district, Kunar province.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) are planned for late November and mid-December [2013].

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV cases were reported this week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 51 (all WPV1). The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [8 Oct 2013] from Kano.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013], from Borno).
- Subnational Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) were conducted in key high-risk states this week.

Pakistan
--------
- Four new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. Two of the cases are from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), one from Punjab and one from Sindh. The total number of WPV1 cases for Pakistan in 2013 is now 63. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2013] (from Punjab).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 35. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis [15 Oct 2013] (from North Waziristan, FATA).
- The situation in North Waziristan is increasingly alarming. It is the area with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in all of Asia. Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in these areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighboring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.

Chad, Cameroon and Central African Republic
-------------------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi). A nationwide immunization campaign was conducted [25-27 Oct 2013]. NIDs are planned for late November [2013].
- In Cameroon, no new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases remains 2. The most recent case in Cameroon had onset of paralysis on [1 Oct 2013] (WPV1 from Ouest).
- An outbreak response to the Cameroon cases is currently under way. In 2013, 5 large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have already been conducted in Cameroon (in April, May, July, August and October [2013]), as the country was considered at high-risk of re-infection due to its proximity with Nigeria. The most recent NIDs were conducted on [25-27 Oct 2013]. NIDs are starting this week and are planned for late December 2013], targeting children under 10 years of age in Ouest region.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week in Cameroon. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Aug 2013] (from Kolfata, Extreme-Nord).
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at serious risk of re-infection due to proximity with Chad and Cameroon, ongoing insecurity and humanitarian crises, and destruction of health infrastructure. To minimize the risk and consequences of potential re-infection, SNIDs were conducted on [30 Sep 2013] to [2 Oct 2013] and CHD [11-13 Nov 2013]. Further SNIDs are planned for December [2013] with dates and districts to be decided.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- Three new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week (from Somalia), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa to 203 (183 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 6 from Ethiopia). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [9 Oct 2013] (from Lower Shabelle, Somalia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. As a result of concerted outbreak response efforts, the impact of the response is beginning to be seen, as the number of newly reported cases from Banadir, Somalia (the epicentre of the outbreak) has declined. All efforts continue to be made to reach all children everywhere.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- Although no case of paralytic polio has been reported, environmental surveillance suggests that WPV1 transmission, 1st detected in February 2013, continues in southern and parts of central Israel. WPV1-positive samples were detected also in West Bank (2 sites) and the Gaza Strip (1 site).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age has been ongoing since August [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has recently decided to re-introduce OPV into the national immunization schedule.
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted in early November [2013], with a 2nd round planned for early December [2013].

Middle East
-----------
- In Syria, no new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases remains 13. Wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999.
- A comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. On [24 Oct 2013], an already-planned large-scale supplementary immunization activity was launched in Syria to vaccinate 1.6 million children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella, in both government-controlled and contested areas.
- Implementation of a supplementary immunization campaign in Deir Al Zour province commenced promptly when the 1st 'hot' acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases were reported.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- Multi-country synchronized immunization campaigns were conducted in West Africa [25-28 Oct 2013]. Additional subnational campaigns are planned in the region to start [22 Nov 2013].

[The WHO GAR outbreak report on the 2 WPV associated cases provides more information on these cases than was available in previous updates. The identification of a wild poliovirus (WPV) in late October 2013 that is genetically linked to WPVs that were last identified in Chad in 2011, which had been related to WPVs circulating in Nigeria and Niger, strongly suggests weaknesses in the acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance activities in the region, as the WPV responsible for the 2 cases in Cameroon have been circulating under the "radarscope" in the region for about 2 years.

The discussion about the occurrence of polio cases due to infection with circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the Far North region highlights the need to conduct supplementary immunization activities nationwide, rather than restrict to the region where the current WPVs have been identified -- the West region. And given the genetic relationship of the currently identified WPV to WPVs circulating in Chad, Nigeria and Niger, the need to evaluate the surveillance activities as well as add supplementary immunization activities in the sub-region is apparent.

In the past week there has been an increase in numbers of confirmed cases of WPV infection from 334 to 341 -- with 4 new cases in endemic countries (all reported in Pakistan) and 3 new cases in non-endemic countries (all reported in Somalia).

For a map showing the geographic locations of WPV cases reported in 2013, see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx. Noteworthy is that in 2013 there are 5 countries reporting importation-related WPV transmission within their countries (Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Syria and Cameroon), whereas in 2012 (available at the same URL) there were only 2 countries (Cameroon and Niger). - Mod.MPP]
