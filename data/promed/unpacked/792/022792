Five positive cases of eastern equine encephalomyelitis have been reported in 5 East Texas counties between Houston and the Louisiana state line, according to the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC).

The infected horses are located in Jasper, Jefferson, Liberty, Newton and Orange counties.

EEE is a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects all equine species. Infected horses may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders. Signs may include unsteadiness, erratic behavior and a marked loss of coordination. The death rate for animals infected with EEE is 75-100 percent.

All horses need an EEE and western equine encephalomyelitis vaccine at least annually, according to the American Association of Equine Practitioners. Pregnant mares and foals may require additional vaccinations. The best time to vaccinate is one month before mosquitoes become active. In the South and West, it is necessary to administer a booster shot every 4 months to ensure extra protection all year-round.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) is a viral disease that affects horses and causes illness in humans. It has not been seen in the United States for many years, however, a recent outbreak of VEE occurred in Mexico, according to AAEP. The mortality rate for VEE is 40-80 percent.

"Vaccines are available for neurologic diseases such as EEE and WEE. As part of routine equine health care, we strongly recommend that equine owners consult with their local veterinarian to discuss an appropriate vaccination program to protect their horses against mosquito-borne diseases such as these," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC assistant executive director. Humans can get the disease known as "sleeping sickness" from an infected mosquito, but horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission of the disease is very rare.

[There are combination vaccines that include eastern, western, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and some combination vaccines include West Nile virus.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease of all equine species such as horses, asses, and zebras. After infection, equines may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders.

Clinical signs in EEE-infected equines may include one or more of the following signs: fever; depression; anorexia (loss of appetite, not eating); weakness; central nervous system disorders (lack of coordination, chewing movements, head pressing, "sawhorse" stance, circling, paddling motion of the limbs, and convulsions); irritability and aggressiveness towards handlers; blindness; excitability; abnormal sensitivity to light and sound; in some cases, horses infected with EEE may show no clinical signs before dying.

The virus that causes EEE is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes that bite an infected animal [or bird] and then bite and feed on another animal or human. The speed with which the disease spreads depends on the density of mosquito populations.

There are fly and mosquito sprays for horses that are helpful in repelling the mosquitoes. However, the most effective prevention is vaccination. Vaccination usually comes in a combination vaccine for other viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and western equine encephalitis (WEE). Vaccination is usually required to be repeated in 2-4 weeks for effective immunity. EEE immunity wanes rapidly, and animals should be revaccinated approximately every 4-6 months depending upon location.

It should be emphasized that humans may contract this disease but only from mosquitoes. Equine owners cannot get the disease from their equine companions.

There is a very effective vaccine against eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) for horses. It should be given annually, and in high-risk areas, the eastern and Gulf Coast areas, it should be given every 4-6 months for maximum protection. It is always sad when animal dies needlessly. Vaccinate your animals. The vaccine should be given at least twice a year or, preferably, 3 or more times.

Birds are the reservoir hosts, and the black-tailed mosquito _Culiseta melanura_ is the vector in swamps. Other species may be bridge vectors, carrying the virus out of swamp areas into adjoining localities, and transmitting the virus to humans and equine animals. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in survivors (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis). It is prudent to follow the recommendations above to avoid mosquito bites.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. EEE is a rare illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United States each year. Most cases occur in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Most persons infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma. EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States, with approximately 33 percent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors. There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms. You can reduce your risk of being infected with EEEV by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active. If you think you or a family member may have EEE, it is important to consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis. - Mod.TG
