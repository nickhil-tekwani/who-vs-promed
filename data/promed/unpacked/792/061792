[The reported severe joint pains make the infection sound more like chikungunya virus, which is also circulating in many parts of Colombia. No mention is made of whether these cases are laboratory confirmed or were diagnosed clinically. Laboratory confirmation is essential, because the symptoms of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses are similar enough that diagnosis on clinical grounds is difficult, and these viruses are all co-circulating in the several Colombian departments.
