Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] strikes fear in breeders: correction of facts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I, Dr Azahar Idris, Director State Veterinary Services Pahang,
Malaysia would like to make corrections in your report taken from New
Straits Times, Mon 2 March 2009 [ProMED-mail Foot & mouth disease -
Malaysia (Peninsular) 20090303.0864].

The paper has never interviewed me on the matter and so I have never
confirmed anything that they reported. I have talked to their
reporter and he admitted that he misquoted my statement in another
newspaper, Utusan Malaysia, dated 27 Feb 2009.

I would like to stress that there was no death of cattle in Kampung
Sungai Penang. Actually the figure given was the number of cattle
clinically infected with FMD. The necessary disease control measures
have been taken to prevent spread of the disease. They include
stopping of animal movement in and out of the infected area,
disinfection of the area, strategic vaccination of animals in
surrounding areas, and increasing awareness programmes among cattle
farmers.

The disease is now under control.
