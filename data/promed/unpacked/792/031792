So far over 931 cholera cases and 11 deaths are reported in Dasenech area, according to the state broadcaster - ETV. The people affected by the waterborne disease live around Lake Turkana bordering Kenya. It is indicated that the people are now getting medical treatment. Currently the number of new cases is declining because the health workers in the area are now tracing and treating the people found suffering from cholera, according to Mr Tensay Hailu, Coordinator of Bobowa Health Center found in Dasenech.

It is reported that up to 70 daily cholera cases were reported in Dasenech area. But now the daily confirmed new cases has dropped to 15. The decline in new cases is attributed to the health workers in the area who are fast tracking and disinfecting the people affected by the disease.

[3] Cholera - Kenya (Marsabit County)

Over 23 Kenyans have lost their lives since the outbreak of cholera in Marsabit County in mid-March 2020. Members of the local fishing communities residing on Abalakwa Island in Lake Turkana and Illeret village have called upon the national government to come to their rescue.

Humanitarian organizations in the area report that over 300 Kenyans have been infected with the deadly disease as residents claim no meaningful help has been forthcoming from the national government despite numerous appeals. Grieving residents have been appealing for help in retrieving the bodies of their loved ones who succumbed to the disease, citing difficulty in accessing the island which is controlled by Ethiopian families.

A feature by NTV on [Wed 13 May 2020] reported that some of the bodies of the deceased had been tossed into the lake. "According to what they have told us. We are expecting more. We have failed because it could have been our 1st priority since the island is on the Kenyan side, but we have not gone there, and have a report of the island," a humanitarian in the region stated.

JL, a resident of Ileret village lost his sister and 2 children who were on the island to the disease. "The government should intervene since we have an ambassador from Ethiopia in Kenya, and we have our own in Ethiopia. So negotiation between them could be easy and could help us retrieve the bodies," he urged.

Containment of the disease in the region has become difficult as the residents lack clean water sources and are forced to consume contaminated water from the lake. "We don't have borehole water here. Water can be scarce and people have to drink water from the lake. This is what causes the severe diarrhea and vomiting," a resident asserted.

On [29 Apr 2020], Marsabit County Health Executive Jamma Wolde revealed that 134 people had been taken to hospital at the time for treatment after contracting cholera. The cholera outbreak comes at a time the country is grappling with containing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic as the bulk of government resources are diverted to the fight against the virus.

[4] Cholera - Yemen

There have been approximately 113 000 suspected cases of cholera in war-torn Yemen since January [2020], according to the World Health Organization (WHO). A total of 56 cases were confirmed by laboratory research and 29 deaths were registered from cholera.

The WHO supported 138 centers in the fight against diarrhea and 58 centers for thirst treatment, it said. It pointed out that diarrhea and thirst are among the most obvious symptoms of cholera.

Yemen has been beset by violence and chaos since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital of Sana'a. The crisis escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led military coalition launched a devastating air campaign aimed at rolling back Houthi territorial gains.

Since then, tens of thousands of Yemenis, including civilians, are believed to have been killed in the conflict, while another 14 million are at risk of starvation, according to the UN.
