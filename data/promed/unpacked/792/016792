UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) External Situation Report
------------------------
Key Points
---------
Preliminary data indicate a total of 31 newly confirmed cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone during the week ending 7 Jun [2015].

Key Political and Economic Developments
------------
NSTR [Nothing Significant To Report]

Response Efforts and Health
---------------
2. In total, 27 237 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola have been reported in the 3 most affected countries. There have been 11 158 reported deaths [as of 7 Jun 2015].

3. Preliminary data indicate that there were a total of 31 newly confirmed cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone during the week to 7 Jun [2015], compared to a total of 25 during the previous week.

4. 16 of the newly confirmed cases in the week ending 7 Jun [2015] were in Guinea (compared to 13 the previous week); 8 cases were in the prefecture of Forecariah, 3 were in Kindia, there were 2 cases each in Dubreka and Conakry [the capital] and there was a single case in Boke. In Forecariah, the cases were spread across 3 different sub-prefectures, whilst in Dubreka and Boke, the sub-prefectures of Tanene and Kamsar respectively, again accounted for the majority of cases. All of the cases in Kindia were reported from Commune Urbaine sub-prefecture. The cases in Conakry (Matoto) were the 1st in the capital since the week beginning 20 Apr [2015].

5. 15 newly confirmed cases were reported in Sierra Leone in the week to 7 Jun 2015 (compared to 12 the previous week) - this is the largest weekly total since mid-Mar [2015]. All cases emanated from just 2 districts: Port Loko & Kambia. There were 10 cases in Port Loko (8 from Kaffu Bullom chiefdom and 2 from BKM) and there were 5 in Kambia (4 in Tonko Limba chiefdom and 1 in Magbema). The capital, Freetown, has not had a newly confirmed case so far in June [2015]. According to the National Ebola Response Centre (NERC), there were 5 newly confirmed cases in Sierra Leone on 8 Jun [2015], the highest number in a single day for many weeks: 3 cases were reported from Kambia and 2 from Port Loko. An additional case (from Kambia) was reported yesterday {9 June 2015].

6. In Guinea, there were no alerts received on the 1st day of the Dubreka sensitisation and early Ebola case search campaign on 7 Jun [2015]. The National Coordination deliberated whether this could be a sign of resistance from the local population, noting that Ebola response teams reported that the communities did not seem very cooperative on the opening day. Furthermore, some persons had allegedly fled the area to avoid being targeted during the campaign.

[3] USA: Regional Ebola treatment centers
Date: Fri 12 June 2015
Source: HHS.gov [edited]
http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2015pres/06/20150612b.html


HHS selects 9 regional Ebola and other special pathogen treatment centers
---------------
New network expands US ability to respond to outbreaks of severe, highly infectious diseases. To further strengthen the nation's infectious disease response capability, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has selected 9 health departments and associated partner hospitals to become special regional treatment centers for patients with Ebola or other severe, highly infectious diseases.

HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has awarded approx. USD 20 million through its Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) to enhance the regional treatment centers' capabilities to care for patients with Ebola or other highly infectious diseases. ASPR will provide an additional USD 9 million to these recipients in the subsequent 4 years to sustain their readiness.

"This approach recognizes that being ready to treat severe, highly infectious diseases, including Ebola, is vital to our nation's health security," said Dr. Nicole Lurie, HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response. "This added regional capability increases our domestic preparedness posture to protect the public's health."

Each awardee will receive approximately USD 3.25 million over the full 5-year project period. This funding is part of USD 339.5 million in emergency funding Congress appropriated to enhance state and local public health and health care system preparedness following cases of Ebola in the United States stemming from the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

The facilities announced today will be continuously ready and available to care for a patient with Ebola or another severe, highly infectious disease, whether the patient is medically evacuated from overseas or is diagnosed within the United States.

The 9 awardees and their partner hospitals are:
- Massachusetts Department of Public Health in partnership with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts
- New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in partnership with New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation/HHC Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City
- Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in partnership with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland
- Georgia Department of Public Health in partnership with Emory University Hospital and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta/Egleston Children's Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia
- Minnesota Department of Health in partnership with the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota
- Texas Department of State Health Services in partnership with the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston in Galveston, Texas
- Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services in partnership with Nebraska Medicine - Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska
- Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in partnership with Denver Health Medical Center in Denver, Colorado
- Washington State Department of Health in partnership with Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children's Hospital in Spokane, Washington

The regional facilities are part of a national network of 55 Ebola treatment centers, but will have enhanced capabilities to treat a patient with confirmed Ebola or other highly infectious disease. Even with the establishment of the 9 regional facilities, the other 46 Ebola treatment centers and their associated health departments will remain ready and may be called upon to handle 1 or more simultaneous clusters of patients.

The facilities selected to serve as regional Ebola treatment centers will be required to:
- Accept patients within 8 hours of being notified,
- Have the capacity to treat at least 2 Ebola patients at the same time,
- Have respiratory infectious disease isolation capacity or negative pressure rooms for at least 10 patients,
- Conduct quarterly trainings and exercises,
- Receive an annual readiness assessment from the soon-to-be-established National Ebola Training and Education Center, composed of experts from health care facilities that have safely and successfully cared for patients with Ebola in the USA, and funded by ASPR and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to ensure clinical staff is adequately prepared and trained to safely treat patients with Ebola and other infectious diseases,
- Be able to treat pediatric patients with Ebola or other infectious diseases or partner with a neighboring facility to do so, and,
- Be able to safely handle Ebola-contaminated or other highly contaminated infectious waste.

Proposals from these facilities were reviewed by a panel of experts from professional associations, academia, and federal agencies and were selected based upon extensive criteria published in the funding opportunity announcement released in February [2015].
To be eligible for consideration as an Ebola and other special pathogen treatment center, facilities also had to be assessed by a Rapid Ebola Preparedness team led by the CDC prior to 20 Feb 2015.

The Department is working with state health officials and hospital executives in HHS Region IX, which includes Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada and the Pacific island territories and freely associated states, to identify a partner hospital awardee. HHS is the principal federal department for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. ASPR leads HHS in preparing the nation to respond to and recover from adverse health effects of emergencies, supporting communities' ability to withstand adversity, strengthening health and response systems, and enhancing national health security.

[4] Rise in new cases
Date: Fri 12 Jun 2015
Source: Washington Post [edited]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/06/12/rise-in-new-cases-shows-ebola-has-not-released-its-deadly-grip


Liberia has long since celebrated a momentous milestone, being declared Ebola-free, with no new cases in months. But for the 2nd week in a row, the number of new cases is up in both Sierra Leone and Guinea.

There was a time in May [2015] when the number of new cases in those 2 countries was tantalizingly close to 0. Then, suddenly, came an alarming spike in the 2 countries, which were ravaged by the virus during the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.

Now, week after week, up to a few dozen new people are appearing on the World Health Organization's weekly report on the situation in West Africa. And public health officials are racing to find out what's driving these pockets of Ebola transmission.

Sierra Leone's chief medical officer, Brima Kargbo, diagnosed part of the problem as an inability to convince some people to not seek treatment from local healers.

"The challenge that we have is that we continue to see people escaping from quarantined homes and moving from Kambia to Port Loko and from Port Loko to the Western areas," Kargbo told Voice of America. In recent days, Kargbo said, "we have seen an increasing number of cases in Port Loko and Kambia because people escaped from quarantined homes and they were taken to an herbalist." He added: "This is how the disease started spreading [originally]."

Since the outbreak began in 18 months ago, 27 275 people have been infected with Ebola and 11 163 have died in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia [as of 10 Jun 2015 - WHO above].

Ebola numbers
------------
The United Nations' Ebola chief David Nabarro said this month [June 2015] that he expects health officials in Sierra Leone might be able to get to 0 in a matter of weeks. But in Guinea, he told the Associated Press, the challenges are greater, with surprise cases surfacing beyond the known chains of transmission. "Getting on top of this is difficult," Nabarro told the AP. "It's like looking for needles in haystacks -- very hard to find the people who are ill and get them under treatment quickly before they perhaps infect others."

Essentially, bringing Ebola to a complete halt is simple public health: Find out who is sick and who those people have been in contact with and monitor all of those people for the full incubation period. It's a formula Liberia successfully deployed -- eventually in 100 percent of its cases. But in practice, it's harder than it sounds.

In Guinea, the rising number of cases reflects newly discovered sick people or bodies of people who likely died of Ebola. In many cases, no one knows how they got sick, or who they contracted the virus from and how many other people they may have sickened.

That's a huge problem, said Daniel R. Lucey, a senior scholar with the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. "Someone found dead of Ebola means they've been sick and contagious for certainly quite a few days or quite a few weeks," Lucey -- who treated Ebola patients in West Africa at the height of the epidemic -- told The Washington Post from Conakry, Guinea, this week. "What the data are telling us, especially from Guinea, is that for as many weeks as I can remember, Guinea has had patients who have been found dead in the community and they turn out to have had Ebola," he said. "Patients who are alive and are diagnosed with Ebola ... they're not on any contact tracing lists. As long as that continues, there are chains of transmission of Ebola virus that we don't know about."

In Guinea in particular, cases are popping up in widely dispersed geographical areas -- some of which are difficult to reach. But more importantly, there's a desperate need for interventions in these communities to be tailored to cultural and social norms. Public health professionals and community members need to work diligently to establish, maintain and re-establish trust among Guineans if there have any hope of bringing Ebola under control, Lucey said.

Key evidence of a need for more culturally responsive intervention is the continuing practice of unsafe burials. The WHO reported 19 unsafe burials in Guinea in the week that ended 7 Jun 2015. And though none were reported in Sierra Leone, the WHO noted that there is "clear evidence that they are still taking place in some areas."

In Liberia, where Ebola was completely eradicated, the government finally stopped the deadly disease in part, for a period of time at the height of the epidemic, by requiring all bodies to be burned. In virtually every cultural practice, forced cremation is controversial. "Cremation is not our culture," Tolbert Nyensuwah, head of Liberia's Ebola task force, told the Guardian in January 2015. "It was due to necessity that we had to cremate people, but it worked very well."

Soon, there will be another problem that could make stopping the virus even harder: Weather, which will make it even more difficult to travel to far-flung communities to investigate new Ebola cases. "The rainy season is here, but it's going to be more rainy next month," Lucey said from Guinea's capital. "So it gets harder to do contact tracing. It will make it substantially more difficult to get to zero."

Could Ebola come roaring back? It's possible, though it's more likely that the virus will seep into the bones of the 2 countries, becoming endemic. But the U.N.'s Nabarro said he was certain Ebola would be eradicated -- eventually. "It can be done," he said. "I'm utterly confident it will be done. I just can't tell you how long it will take."

[Due to the steady increase in new Ebola cases, on Fri [12 Jun 2015], President Koroma declared a 21-day curfew (with other restrictions), with immediate effect, for Ebola hot spots in an attempt to keep people from leaving parts of Kambia and Port Loko districts. The chiefdom-level curfew will restrict movements from 6 pm to 6 am. Those who violate the curfew will be detained and prosecuted. Night patrols will be used in an attempt to stop people escaping by vehicles. Authorities believe running away on foot will only get them so far [a short way] before they are apprehended. According to authorities, Ebola continues to spread in these 2 districts due to people leaving quarantined homes and exposing others to the disease. More than 12 contacts have escaped curfew. In addition, Sierra Leone's parliament is extending the state of public health emergency for another 90 days. There have also been breaches of anti-Ebola regulations in the capital. A member of parliament, Alie Badara Munu, was arrested for participating in a traditional [i.e. unsafe] burial in May 2015]

She was also referencing the May 2015 meeting of the World Health Organization (WHO)... MSF's head of Guinea's Ebola response efforts, Jerome Mouton, indicated there is a state of "semi-denial" about the reality of the Ebola virus outbreak, similar to a year ago, with another major flare-up being possible.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/world/chinese-ebola-drug-brings-american-objections.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0
[The Chinese drug, MIL77, was used for the recent Ebola infection case in Italy and for a British Army nurse in March 2015, with "miraculous" effects. The issue: MIL77 is a "near copy" of Zmapp which is a product of a collaboration between the United States and Canada]
[While a limited supply of American ZMapp was quickly exhausted, a small private Chinese company, Beijing Mabworks, raced ahead in the fall of 2014, helping to produce about 100 doses of MIL77 in animal cells rather than tobacco plants. This is good news for desperate patients, but it also has led to patent infringement concerns by American officials. Also at issue is disagreements over when unapproved Ebola therapies should be offered to patients only in carefully controlled studies, and when they should be made available for compassionate reasons... According to Feng Li, chief executive of Mabworks, his company was motivated to fight a global emergency, and so he entered into a licensing agreement with ZMapp's intellectual property rights holder... Robin Robinson, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, said "They have not done all the testing that we would normally do for safety before these products would go into humans."... Zmapp is undergoing clinical trial testing in the USA and Sierra Leone.]
