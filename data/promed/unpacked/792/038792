I miscounted off the computer the number of confirmed cases listed by Commonground in my comment in ProMED-mail posting (26) in the human thread (see below). There were only 14, including 5 deaths, when the list was made. I should have taken the time to print the list out and check. That will be corrected in the website archives. Abject apologies.
