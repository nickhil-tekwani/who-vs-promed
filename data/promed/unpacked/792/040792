A new variant of the dangerous Hendra virus has been confirmed in a horse during routine surveillance in New South Wales, Australia.

Researchers recently discovered the new variant in historical samples, and a new test is now available nationally to identify it.

Researchers with the science agency CSIRO and the University of Sydney investigated laboratory samples from horses previously suspected of having Hendra virus but had all tested negative.

"They found evidence of a novel virus, later confirmed as a new variant and have now developed a diagnostic tool specific to detect it," said David Littleproud, the Minister for Agriculture and Northern Australia.

"The research and now this detection highlights the geographic distribution of Hendra virus-carrying bats is likely much greater than once thought."

Science and Technology Minister Melissa Price said the new test would significantly reduce infection risks for veterinarians and frontline equine workers.

"Horses possibly testing negative under previous tests can now be confirmed as positive Hendra cases, which allows the risk to be managed through use of personal protection equipment and appropriate biosecurity practices."

She said horse owners will need to continue prudent risk management to minimise the potential for contact between flying-foxes [bata], which carry the virus, and horses, she said.

She also urged owners to vaccinate their horses against Hendra virus.

The horse that was confirmed to have the new variant was from West Wallsend, near Newcastle. It represents the 1st (non-historical) detection of the variant in a horse in the state, and is the southern-most Hendra detection to date.

Since 1994, 7 Australians have contracted the Hendra virus. Four have died, including racehorse trainer Vic Rail and 2 veterinarians.

Authorities have confirmed a Hendra virus case has been detected in a horse near Newcastle.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries said it conducted testing confirming the variant strain in an unvaccinated 7-year-old Clydesdale from West Wallsend.

"The detection of the virus was confirmed through testing at NSW Department of Primary Industries' (DPI) Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute laboratory and at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness," the authority said.

"DPI has routinely tested all Hendra submissions over the past 6 months for the variant Hendra strain following a retrospective detection by researchers in a Queensland horse."

A private vet tended to the horse after reports it was showing neurological signs of the virus.

The animal has been euthanized, and no other horses on the same property have shown indications of poor health.

A Hunter Local Land Services district veterinarian has issued an individual biosecurity direction, controlling the movement of animals and people from the specific property for 21 days.

Public health officers are undertaking risk assessments of people who had contact with the horse.

A 2019 Scone case was the furthest south the virus has crept in NSW, with most recorded on the state's north coast.

Vaccinating horses is the most effective way to halt its spread.

Two horses have died as a result of hendra infecting 23 properties since 2006.

No human deaths have been recorded in NSW.

Signs in horses are non-specific in early stages.

DPI recommends isolating horses if owners have concerns they (the horses) may be infected, and to seek veterinary advice.

A new strain of the deadly Hendra virus has killed a horse in the New South Wales Hunter region.

Key points:
*The unvaccinated horse was euthanized and the property locked down
*The case near Newcastle is the most southern detection in Australia
*There have been 24 horse deaths in NSW as a result of Hendra virus
*The Department of Primary Industries confirmed the virus was detected in a 7-year-old unvaccinated Clydesdale from West Wallsend.

A private vet diagnosed the case on Tuesday (5 Oct 2021) and it was confirmed at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness yesterday.

The horse was euthanized and no other horses on the property showed signs of ill health, the DPI said.

"DPI has routinely tested all Hendra submissions over the past 6 months for the variant Hendra strain following a retrospective detection by researchers in a Queensland horse," it said.

The property was locked down and Hunter Local Land Services issued a biosecurity direction to control the movement of animals and people for 21 days.

The West Wallsend horse was the 2nd in Australia confirmed to have died from the new variant, which is, like the original virus, transmitted to horses from flying foxes.

The 1st was a horse in Gympie in Queensland in 2015 but researchers only made the link earlier this year.

Equine Veterinarians Australia president Steve Dennis said the new strain had been linked to a mass flying fox death in Adelaide's botanical gardens and was "as lethal as the original".

"And is likely to be as dangerous to people as well," he said.

Dr Dennis believed a number of horse deaths could be linked to the new strain, but without tests vets would never know how many.

"Sometimes the horse might be found dead and they just get buried, and I think it's probably happened for a lot of Hendra cases and possibly variant cases as well."

But he said flying foxes "should not be demonised" because of the transmission.

"They are critical species to our ecosystems."

The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) said the case was a concern but not a surprise.

"This is the furthest south a positive case has been diagnosed, but it's not necessarily surprising since grey-headed flying foxes are confirmed to host the HeV variant," it said.

The other horses and human contacts on the Wallsend property were being monitored, it added.

"Their health status will be monitored daily; public health officers from NSW Health are undertaking risk assessments of any people who have had contact with the infected horse.

"All veterinarians and staff are reminded of the signs and symptoms of Hendra can be vague and variable depending on the stage of the disease."

The association urged anyone around sick horses to wear personal protective equipment.

Government officials said most Hendra cases in New South Wales had been on the North Coast; a case at Scone in 2019 being the most southern case until now.

The DPI said vaccination of horses was the most effective way to help manage Hendra virus disease.

"A vaccine is a really good, strong tool for us to be able to try to prevent the severity of the disease or even death in this particular case," DPI chief veterinarian Sarah Britton said.

There have been 24 horse deaths in NSW as a result of Hendra virus on 23 properties since the 1st case in 2006, the department said.

"There have been no human deaths from Hendra virus in NSW.

"Signs of infection are non-specific in the early stages and anyone who is concerned about possible Hendra infection should isolate the horse and seek veterinary advice."

[From the NSW Hendra virus page (source at end of this update):

(Updated 08 Apr 2020)
"Hendra virus is a virus mainly infecting large fruit bats (flying foxes) which can be passed on to horses. The infection has occasionally been passed onto people who have been in close contact with an infected horse.

"What is Hendra virus?
* Hendra virus is a virus that infects large fruit bats (flying foxes).
* Occasionally the virus can spread from flying foxes to horses and horses can then pass the infection on to humans. A small number of people who had very close contact with infected horses have developed Hendra virus infection.
* Hendra virus infection has been confirmed in 2 dogs on properties where horses had been infected with the Hendra virus. Neither dog was showing signs of illness.
* There is no evidence of Hendra virus occurring naturally in any other species. [naturally in the flying fox]
* Hendra virus was discovered following an outbreak of illness in a large racing stable in the suburb of Hendra, Brisbane in 1994.

"What are Hendra virus signs in horses?
* Hendra virus can cause a range of signs in horses. Usually there is a rapid onset of illness, fever, increased heart rate and rapid deterioration with respiratory and/or neurological (nervous system) signs. For more information on Hendra virus infection in horses, refer to the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/)

"Hendra virus symptoms in people
* Symptoms typically develop between 5 and 21 days after contact with an infectious horse.
* Fever, cough, sore throat, headache and tiredness are common initial symptoms. Meningitis or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) can develop, causing headache, high fever, and drowsiness, and sometimes convulsions and coma.
* Hendra virus infection can be fatal.

"How is it spread?
* It is thought horses may contract Hendra virus infection from eating food recently contaminated by flying fox urine, saliva or birth products.
* The spread of Hendra virus between horses is possible whenever horses have close contact with body fluids from an infected horse.
* All confirmed human cases to date became infected following high level exposures to body fluids of an infected horse, such as doing necropsies on horses without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, or being extensively sprayed with respiratory secretions.
* There is no evidence of human to human, bat to human, bat to dog, or dog to human transmission.

"Who is at risk?
People who have had close contact (particularly high level exposures as described above) with an infected horse, without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, are most at risk.

"How is it prevented?
Preventing horse infection:
* Protect horse feed from contamination by flying fox fluids.
* Contact your local veterinarian if you notice unusual disease symptoms, abnormal behaviour or unexpected deaths in your horses. If you cannot contact your veterinarian, contact your animal health authority or the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888 (24-hour hotline).
* Isolate sick horses from other horses.
* A vaccine for horses is available from veterinarians and is strongly encouraged as the single most effective way to reduce the risk of exposure to Hendra virus.

"Preventing human infection:
* While the greatest risk is with sick horses, infected horses can shed Hendra virus for a few days before they show any sign of illness so it is always important to use good hygiene practices when around horses.
* Don't kiss horses on the muzzle (especially if the horse is sick).
* Cover any cuts or abrasions on exposed skin before handling horses and wash your hands well with soap and water, especially after handling your horse's mouth or nose (e.g. fitting or removing a bridle) and before eating, smoking or touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
* If body fluids or manure from a horse gets on unprotected skin the area should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible.
* If a horse becomes unwell and Hendra virus infection may be a possibility, as few people as possible should care for the horse until the infection is ruled out.
* Appropriate personal protective equipment which prevents contamination of the skin, eyes, nose and mouth by the horse's body fluids should be worn if close contact with the sick horse is considered essential.
*Although there is no evidence of Hendra virus spreading from an infected person to another person or animal, health care workers will take a cautious approach and wear personal protective equipment when caring for people suspected or confirmed to be infected.
* If you have been exposed to Hendra virus, you should not donate blood or any other tissue until you are cleared of infection. Confirmed cases should never donate blood or any other tissue, even if they fully recover.
* No human vaccine is currently available.

"How is it diagnosed?
People with suspected Hendra virus infection will usually have blood and urine tests. Depending on their symptoms they may also have nose/throat swabs and/or other tests. People with high level exposures to horse body fluids may have blood samples collected over 6 weeks to check if they have developed antibodies to the infection. Testing for Hendra virus infection is generally not recommended for people who have had lower-level exposure.

"How is it treated?
There is no specific treatment for Hendra virus infection and cases are treated supportively in hospital or in intensive care. Antiviral medications have not been found to be effective in treating Hendra virus infection. People who have had high exposures to the body fluids of an infected horse may be offered experimental treatment with a type of antibody possibly preventing infection.

"What is the public health response?
* When a horse is diagnosed with Hendra virus infection, the local public health unit will work closely with the state/territory animal health agency, horse and property owners, and veterinarians to identify people who may have been exposed.
* Public health unit staff will identify people who may be at risk and contact them to assess their exposure.
* People who may be at risk of infection will be given information about Hendra virus and asked to monitor their health. Where necessary, arrangements will be made for blood tests to be taken."
