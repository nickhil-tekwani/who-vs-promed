Alabama agriculture officials are urging horse owners to vaccinate for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile virus (WNV) after 3 horses tested positive for the former.

According to Alabama Department of Agriculture & Industries Commissioner John McMillan, the horses that contracted EEE came from Houston, Mobile, and Geneva counties.

Almost 90 percent of the infected horses die, compared to a 30 percent mortality rate from WNV. EEE causes a horse's brain and spinal cord to become inflamed. State veterinarians recommend horse owners vaccinate against both twice a year.

"Unfortunately, mosquito-borne viruses like EEE and WNV are prevalent in Alabama's warm and wet climate. Vaccinating is important to protect horses and ourselves," stated Alabama Department of Agriculture & Industries Commissioner John McMillan. "I want to encourage horse owners to take precautionary measures and vaccinate their horses."

Contact your veterinarian immediately if you suspect EEE is causing your horse to exhibit any of these general symptoms:
*Head pressing
*Convulsions
*Lack of response to facial stimulation
*Fever above 103 F [39 C]
*Ataxia
*Paralysis
*Anorexia
*Depression
*Stupor

Other signs include:
*Irregular gait
*Teeth grinding
*Circling
*Staggering

Horses with EEE may not show all of the signs.

The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has confirmed a 3rd positive case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) for 2018. The 5-year-old mare located in Onslow County was euthanized. She was reported as having been recently vaccinated.

This is the 2nd case of EEE confirmed in Onslow County in 2018.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 26 Jul 2018 that the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has confirmed 7 cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in horses in that state this month [July 2018].

The EDCC said:

- A 6-month old unvaccinated Tennessee Walking Horse colt in Okeechobee County became clinical on 11 Jun 2018 and was euthanized on 12 Jun 2018. He tested positive for EEE on 2 Jul 2018.

- A 4-year old unvaccinated Miniature Horse mare in Osceola County became clinical on 2 Jul 2018 and was euthanized the same day due to a poor prognosis. She tested positive on 3 Jul 2018.

- A 9-year old Friesian mare in Jackson County became clinical on 2 Jul 2018, tested positive on 10 Jul 2018, and has fully recovered.

- A 2-year old unvaccinated Quarter Horse colt in Union County became clinical on 3 Jul 2018 and was euthanized on 5 Jul 2018 due to a poor prognosis. He tested positive on 17 July 2018.

- An unvaccinated yearling Paso Fino filly in Polk County became clinical on 9 Jul 2018 and was euthanized on 11 Jul 2018. Her positive test result came back on 17 Jul 2018.

- A 3-year old Quarter Horse mare in Suwannee County became clinical and was euthanized on 14 Jul 2018. The positive result was returned on 18 Jul 2018.

- A yearling Warmblood filly in Clay County became clinical and was euthanized on 19 Jul 2018. She tested positive on 20 Jul 2018.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses surviving might have long-lasting impairments and neurological problems.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective EEE prevention tool. Horses having been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually, one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[A very effective vaccine exists. What a pity these animals suffer such horrible fates when it could be avoided by a vaccination! EEE is carried by mosquitoes. In addition to a vaccine, there are mosquito repellants specific for horses. These can and should be used.

Elimination of mosquito breeding locations is also helpful in reducing mosquitoes and the incidence of EEE. - Mod.TG
