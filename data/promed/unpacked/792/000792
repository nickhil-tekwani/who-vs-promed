Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 14
-----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 23 May 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an
additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The
case occurred in a 32-year-old man. He developed symptoms on 15 May 2006
and died on 22 May 2006.
The case is part of a family cluster in the Kubu Sembelang village, Karo
District, of North Sumatra. The man is the 7th member of an extended family
to become infected with the H5N1 virus and the 6th to die. An additional
person, who was the 1st member of the family to fall ill, died of
respiratory disease on 4 May 2006. No specimens were taken prior to her
burial, and the cause of her death cannot be determined. However, as her
clinical course was compatible with H5N1 infection, epidemiologists at the
outbreak site include this woman as the initial case in the cluster.
The newly confirmed case is a brother of the initial case. Specimens were
taken on 21 May 2006 and flown the same day to Jakarta. Tests run overnight
confirmed his infection. His 10-year-old son died of H5N1 infection on 13
May 2006. The father was closely involved in caring for his son, and this
contact is considered a possible source of infection.
Although the investigation is continuing, preliminary findings indicate
that 3 of the confirmed cases spent the night of 29 Apr 2006 in a small
room together with the initial case at a time when she was symptomatic and
coughing frequently. These cases include the woman's 2 sons and a 2nd
brother, aged 25 years, who is the sole surviving case among infected
members of this family. Other infected family members lived in adjacent homes.
All confirmed cases in the cluster can be directly linked to close and
prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness. Although
human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, the search for a possible
alternative source of exposure is continuing.
Both the Ministry of Health and WHO are concerned about the situation in
Kubu Sembelang and have intensified investigation and response activities.
Priority is now being given to the search for additional cases of
influenza-like illness in other family members, close contacts, and the
general community. To date, the investigation has found no evidence of
spread within the general community and no evidence that efficient
human-to-human transmission has occurred.
Analysis of viruses
-------------------
Full genetic sequencing of 2 viruses isolated from cases in this cluster
has been completed by WHO H5 reference laboratories in Hong Kong and the
USA. Sequencing of all 8 gene segments found no evidence of genetic
reassortment with human or pig influenza viruses and no evidence of
significant mutations. The viruses showed no mutations associated with
resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu).
The human viruses from this cluster are genetically similar to viruses
isolated from poultry in North Sumatra during a previous outbreak.

[The evidence currently obtained from analysis of this "cluster" of human
cases now tends to suggest that some person-to-person transmission of
infection may have occurred among close family members living under
conditions of close contact during a critical phase of the infection.
Failure to detect any significant genetic differences among viruses
isolated from this cluster of cases, however, suggests that there has been
no progression of the H5N1 virus to a form that more easily infects humans,
nor any reassortment of genome sub-units with mammalian influenza viruses.

[2] Iran - avian influenza human cases denied

Iranian Health Minister Denies Human Avian Influenza Cases
-----------------------------------------------
Iran's Health Minister on Tue [23 May 2006] denied that tests on 2 dead
pneumonia patients had shown they had the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus and
insisted the results were negative. Health Minister Kamran Lankarani told
Reuters on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Geneva: "Fortunately, these 2 cases were negative for
avian influenza. There [have been] no confirmed cases [so far]."
On Mon 22 May 2006, an Iranian medical official in the country said tests
on the bodies of a brother and sister who died after falling ill with
pneumonia-like symptoms in the northwestern city of Kermanshah showed they
had [contracted] the deadly H5N1 strain. Samples have been sent to
international laboratories for further tests, and if the initial results
are confirmed, these would be the 1st human avian influenza deaths in Iran.
But in Cairo, the WHO's regional adviser for emerging diseases, Hassan
al-Bushra, said the agency had also been told that the results in Iran were
negative for bird flu. "The (Iranian) Director General of the Centre of
Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Medical Education has verbally
informed the WHO office in Iran that there have been no H5N1 positive human
cases reported so far," he said. He said so far WHO's regional office had
not received any samples from Iran for testing.
The virus has killed people in neighboring Turkey, Iraq and Azerbaijan in
recent months, while Afghanistan has had outbreaks in poultry. Iran found
the virus in wild swans in February 2006.
The Iranian siblings, a brother aged 41 and sister, 26, were among 5 family
members who fell ill. "They had all returned from a trip to the town of
Marivan when they fell ill with symptoms of staphylococcal pneumonia," an
Iranian medical official told Reuters in Tehran, adding that the brother
and sister had tested positive locally for H5N1.
Lankarani [the Iranian Health Minister] said Iran had tightened its
surveillance since cases were detected in neighboring states. "This was
alarming and a signal to us, so we strengthened surveillance," he said.

[The situation is confused. The existence of positive results by local
testing is now refuted and the fate (or existence) of clinical material
sent abroad for confirmation of the local diagnostic tests is obscure.
Further clarification would be appreciated. The present situation seems to
be that there is no unequivocal evidence that the deaths of the 2 patients
were caused by avian influenza virus infection.
As of 23 May 2006, according to the WHO table of the Cumulative Number of
Laboratory Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1), the total
number of cases is now 218, of whom 124 have died. Eight of the 10
countries reporting human avian influenza cases have reported cases during
2006.
