Foot and mouth disease [FMD] has broken out in Mumbwa, central
Zambia, the Times of Zambia reported on Sunday [3 Aug 2008].

The local authorities have appealed to health departments to send
veterinary officers to the area to vaccinate the animals before the
disease decimates the entire cattle population, according to the
Times of Zambia.

The local authorities also urged companies supplying animal drugs and
vaccines to go to rural areas, as farmers were not able to travel to
towns due to long distances.

Zambia suffers a great loss annually in agriculture due to FMD.

[The current FMD outbreak in Zambia started on 7 Feb 2008 and was
initially reported to the OIE on 11 Mar 2008. Zambia submitted its
follow-up report No. 1 on 10 Jun 2008; a summary of the country's FMD
situation, including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6887>.
The report said that samples were sent for virus isolation and
characterization. The laboratory involved was not named: Is it
Onderstepoort?! Results will be appreciated.


An FMD outbreak has been notified today (4 Aug 2008) to the OIE from
Namibia, a country sharing Zambia's southern border. The outbreak
affected cattle in an area close to a national park where there are
African Buffaloes; the serotype is not yet identified. See the
immediate notification, including map, at
