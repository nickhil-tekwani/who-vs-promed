Headlines
- The 28th meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO director-general on 4 May 2021 with Committee members and advisers attending via video conference, supported by the WHO secretariat. The meeting statement is now available at https://www.who.int/news/item/21-05-2021-statement-following-the-twenty-eighth-ihr-emergency-committee-for-polio.

- Understanding gender-related barriers to immunization is essential to achieve polio eradication. But what is gender? What is the difference between gender and sex? How do sex and gender influence health, including immunization? This newly released Q&A examines the links between gender and health, highlighting WHO's ongoing work to address gender-related barriers to healthcare, advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity, and achieve health for all.

[This is the 3rd consecutive week with no WPV1 isolates globally, neither in AFP cases nor from environmental samples. It is possible that after 2 years (2019 and 2021) of high circulation, there is a herd immunity among the population slowing down transmission. Time will tell as a new population of potential susceptibles are born and may create new pockets; or possibly transmission has been interrupted. Time will tell.

What is continuing as a disturbing situation, is that the primary problem is now circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus-associated cases (cVDPV). In Africa primarily associated with CVDPV2 (except in Madagascar), and elsewhere some cVDPV2 but also cVDPV1. It is curious that cVDPV1 seems to be seen more in Asia and the Western Pacific, and curious that Madagascar has cVDPV1, with a population felt to come from Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa (Pierron D, Heiske M, Razafindrazaka H, Rakoto I, Rabetokotany N, et al.: Genomic landscape of human diversity across Madagascar.

Have we globally reached the point where the cure is worse than the disease? - Mod.MPP]

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation has in a press release on Monday, 24 May 2021, informed the public that this year's [2021] "national polio vaccination" campaign will start on Friday, 28 May [2021].

The campaign will be 2 rounds and will run for 4 days each, and it's targeting over 1.4 million children between the ages of 0 to 5 across Sierra Leone. This will be a house-to-house campaign, wherein teams of health workers will go to different households to meet eligible beneficiaries which will, in turn, protect them from the poliovirus.

In 2010 Sierra Leone was declared polio-free, but it's recently facing an outbreak derived from poliovirus [vaccine-derived] type 2 (cVDPV2). As of 28 Apr [2021], a total of 22 confirmed cases of type 2 poliovirus have been recorded in the country. The dates for the 2nd round of the vaccination will be made available to the general public.

WHO reprimands Kenya for hiding polio outbreak. Six cases of mutated polio virus detected; solution is urgent vaccination of children.

In summary
- The World Health Organisation faulted Kenya for not declaring a national outbreak immediately as required by the International Health Regulations.
- The WHO noted they were all circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses type 2, which is common in under-vaccinated communities in Somalia.

Kenya has been reprimanded for keeping secret a polio outbreak in December 2020 and January this year [2021].

Six cases of mutated poliovirus [presumably cVDPV] were detected in Kenya during that time. Three cases were newly arrived children from Somalia at the Dadaab refugee camp. Their stool was tested and found to have the mutated poliovirus. A mutated virus was also found in a separate sewage sample from Garissa, while 2 samples of sewage collected in Mombasa were found to have a similar virus.

The World Health Organisation faulted Kenya for not declaring a national outbreak immediately as required by the International Health Regulations.

The WHO noted that the last of these cases was confirmed on [25 Jan 2021]. "The committee noted that Kenya and Tajikistan had not declared the new outbreaks as national emergency and requested the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to have discussions with these countries about the importance of making such a declaration, notwithstanding the reported vigorous country responses," the WHO's IHR Committee for Polio says in a statement.

However, a Ministry of Health official told the Star the immediate reporting is for wild poliovirus, which has already been eradicated in Africa.

"We are in the process of reporting the current cases officially, but it's a lengthy process. The samples also had to go through confirmatory tests," he said.

All the cases are importations from Somalia, where vaccination rates are extremely low. The WHO noted they were all circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses type 2, which is common in under-vaccinated communities in Somalia.

The solution is widespread vaccination to break any possible transmission. "If even one child tests positive for polio, 200 000 [?? One AFP per 200 infected individuals is the average cited statistic. - Mod.MPP] other children are considered by the WHO to be at risk of contracting the virus," Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said.

Last week, Kagwe launched a polio vaccination drive targeting more than 3.4 million children in 13 counties. The campaign will end on Wednesday [?26 May 2021]. It aims to vaccinate 249 391 children in Garissa, 323 620 in Mombasa, 255 885 in Mandera, 51 206 in Isiolo, 180 714 in Wajir, 175 425 in Kitui, 85 020 in Tana River, 25 104 in Lamu, 233 770 in Machakos, 330 465 in Kiambu, 327 338 in Kilifi, 234 197 in Kajiado, and 965 243 in Nairobi.

The 2nd round of the vaccination will start from [19-23 Jun 2021].

Head of surveillance and epidemic response at the ministry Dr Emmanuel Okunga, said the recent cases were detected because of Kenya's efficient surveillance system. "We test children coming into Kenya; they are healthy children, but we take their stool samples and test for polioviruses, so in this case we detected poliovirus in 3 children who came from Somalia, and they had come to Garissa," he said at the launch last week. "We also have surveillance system where we picked sewage samples, and because of that, we were able to detect 3 poliovirus in Mombasa and also Garissa. So these are the reasons for which we have to conduct a response."

The last case of mutated polio virus was from a sewage sample collected in Nairobi's Eastleigh estate in 2018.

The Ministry of Health followed by vaccinating 800 000 children in the city. Kenya last reported the wild polio case in 2013 when an outbreak in Somalia led to an importation of 14 cases to the country. The WHO certified Africa free of the wild poliovirus on [25 Aug 2020].

[4] Statement following the 28th IHR Emergency Committee for Polio
Date: Fri 21 May 2021
Source: Statement following the 28th IHR Emergency Committee for Polio [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/news/item/21-05-2021-statement-following-the-twenty-eighth-ihr-emergency-committee-for-polio


Statement following the 28th IHR Emergency Committee for Polio
-----------------------------------
The 28th meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO director-general on 4 May 2021 with Committee members and advisers attending via video conference, supported by the WHO secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV). The following IHR States Parties provided an update at the video conference on the current situation in their respective countries: Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, Senegal, South Sudan, and Tajikistan.

Wild poliovirus
The Committee noted that the higher incidence of global WPV1 cases seen until about mid-2020 came to a plateau during the 2nd half of 2020. The number of WPV1 cases and proportion of WPV1-positive environmental samples have decreased during the 1st quarter of 2021. Compared to 42 WPV1 cases as of 21 April 2020, 2 WPV1 cases have been reported from Pakistan and Afghanistan during the same period in 2021. On environmental surveillance, 14% of the samples collected in 2021 (until [21 Apr 2021]) were positive for WPV1 compared to 49% in 2020 for the same period. WPV1 transmission persists in the 2 cross-border polio reservoirs, the northern corridor comprising of Peshawar-Khyber region of Pakistan and East Region of Afghanistan and the southern corridor comprising of Quetta Block of Pakistan and South Region of Afghanistan. Transmission is also continuing in Karachi, one of the most persistent polio reservoirs in Pakistan. It is important to note that the current transmission level is particularly low in the northern cross-border corridor with no cases reported in 2021 so far and only 8% positive environmental samples (all from Peshawar, Pakistan) during the 1st quarter of 2021. The decline in WPV1 transmission intensity can possibly be attributed to several factors, including the intense transmission in 2019-2020 leading to some natural population immunity, the ongoing low transmission season for polio, and to some extent intensified efforts in Pakistan and accessible areas of Afghanistan. The COVID-19-related border closures and lockdowns coupled with social distancing and handwashing may also have had a role in slowing down the transmission. However, unless the issues of inaccessibility of under-immunized children in southern Afghanistan and barriers to reach missed children in the core reservoirs of Pakistan are addressed, the transmission levels are likely to resurge.

The Committee noted that the current situation provides a good opportunity over the next 6 months to curb the WPV1 transmission by implementing high-quality vaccination activities (supplementary and routine) and fast-track progress towards the global WPV1 eradication. The ongoing inaccessibility for vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan (particularly the South Region) and the vaccination quality gaps in key reservoirs of Pakistan (Karachi and Quetta Block, in particular) constitute significant risk for the programme's success in this epidemiological block.

The Committee noted that, based on results from sequencing of WPV1, there were further instances of international spread of viruses from Pakistan to Afghanistan. The ongoing frequency of WPV1 international spread between the 2 countries and the ongoing vulnerability of other countries where routine immunization and polio-prevention activities have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic mean that the risk of international spread remains significant.

Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV)
The Committee noted with concern that since its last meeting in February 2021, cVDPV2 spread to Senegal and Kenya has been confirmed, and a new cVDPV1 outbreak has been reported in Madagascar. Despite an overall decreasing trend in the number of cVDPV2 cases in 2021 so far, a significant number of countries (11) remain infected in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions during the 1st quarter of the year. Moreover, the most recent quarterly routine analysis (October to December 2020) performed by the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) indicates cVDPV2 exportation from:

Central African Republic to Chad
Central African Republic to DR Congo
Chad to Central African Republic
Sudan to Republic of South Sudan
Ghana to Guinea
Cote d'Ivoire to Mali
Niger to Nigeria
Guinea to Sierra Leone
Somalia to Kenya
Guinea to Liberia
Central African Republic to Congo
Togo to Benin
Liberia to Cote d'Ivoire
Guinea to Senegal
Afghanistan to Pakistan
Pakistan to Afghanistan

This routine analysis by the GPLN assists the polio programme to identify and track the wild and vaccine-derived polioviruses and their patterns of spread and thereby provide opportunities to limit or prevent the circulation. The Committee noted that Kenya and Tajikistan had not declared the new outbreaks as national emergency and requested the GPEI to have discussions with these countries about the importance of making such a declaration, notwithstanding the reported vigorous country responses.

In addition to above, the 2 recent cVDPV2 outbreaks in Kenya and Senegal were also the result of international spread; the cVDPV2 detected in Kenya links to the transmission in Somalia, while the one in Senegal is linked to the ongoing cVDPV2 transmission in other areas of West Africa. This is the 1st-ever cVDPV2 outbreak detected in Senegal.

During the 1st quarter of 2021, a total of 72 cVDPV2 cases have been reported from 34 provinces in 11 countries, compared to 154 cVDPV2 cases from 58 provinces in 19 countries during the 1st quarter of 2020. The Committee appreciated the intensified efforts to stop the cVDPV2 transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but noted with utmost concern the ongoing cross-border cVDPV2 transmission between the 2 countries as well as the spread of the outbreak to the inaccessible areas of southern Afghanistan, where local bans have prevented vaccination campaigns. The Committee noted that, as per the reported data from the country programme, more than one million children remained inaccessible in southern Afghanistan during the vaccination campaigns in 2020 and 1st quarter of 2021 (https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Afghanistan_NEAP_2021.pdf).

The Committee noted that a total of 13 cVDPV2 emergences have been detected during the 1st quarter of 2021. This compares with 36 emergences detected during the year 2020 and 44 in 2019. This reduction may reflect refinement and modification of cVDPV2 outbreaks management aimed at lessening the risk of seeding new emergences.

The Committee noted that the novel OPV2 (nOPV2), after receiving the interim recommendation for use under WHO's Emergency Use Listing procedure (EUL), has been introduced and delivered in 2 countries (Nigeria and Liberia) with an additional 4 countries to implement nOPV2 campaigns by the end of May [2021]. The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) has endorsed, in principle, nOPV2 to become the vaccine of choice for response to cVDPV2 outbreaks after review of the initial use period is completed and all requirements for use are met. Further, SAGE endorsed the prioritization framework for type 2 vaccines for cVDPV2 outbreak response and agreed with the phases of the framework [Phase A: Pre-EUL recommendation, preparing for nOPV2 use; Phase B: Initial nOPV2 use under interim EUL recommendation (current phase); Phase C: Wider use of nOPV2 under interim EUL recommendation; Phase D: nOPV2 licensed and pre-qualified]. SAGE will review the findings from the initial use period to issue further recommendations on its wider use once the data on safety and stability have been gathered.

The Committee noted that there are currently 60 million doses of nOPV2 in the stockpile, and it is expected to have an additional 252 million nOPV2 doses by end of the year [2021] to support its wider use. In addition, trivalent OPV (tOPV) remains available on the advice of the OPV2 Advisory Group and approval by the WHO director-general for use in countries which have concurrent type 1 and type 2 poliovirus infections co-circulating and is being used in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. There are about 2.5 million doses of tOPV currently available in the stockpile, and orders are in place for about 140 million additional doses by December 2021. Monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2) also remains available to be utilized to respond to the cVDPV2 outbreaks on the advice of the OPV2 Advisory Group and the approval of the WHO director-general. Currently, 149 [million] mOPV2 doses are available in the stockpile, and orders are in place for additional 175 million doses until December 2021.

The Committee noted that the cVDPV1 outbreaks in Madagascar and Yemen have occurred in areas and population groups of known risk, largely due to persistent sub-optimal routine immunization coverage. The Committee recommended to maintain Malaysia in the list of infected countries (despite more than 13 months since the last cVDPV detection), given the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the implementation of outbreak response.

COVID-19
The Committee noted with concern that many of the polio-affected countries are currently experiencing a 2nd wave of COVID-19 with substantial numbers of COVID-19 cases, notably Iran, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In fact, all the current polio-infected countries are currently classified to have "community transmission," except Sudan and Tajikistan.

Based on the updated GPEI guidance, the polio vaccination campaigns have mostly been resumed by virtue of good coordination among the polio eradication and COVID-19 management structures and coordination entities. The planning and implementation of polio-vaccination campaigns is based on carefully performed risk-benefit analysis, utilizing the WHO's decision-making framework and GPEI's operational guidance, with major consideration for the safety of frontline workers and the communities they serve. As the waves of COVID-19 are expected to fluctuate considerably from country to country and across the WHO Regions, the Committee stressed the need to continue making necessary adjustments according to the COVID-19 situation for the foreseeable future.

The surveillance sensitivity and quality are approaching close to the pre-COVID-19 levels, after an initial significant impact of COVID-19 during the 2nd and 3rd quarter of 2020. The Committee noted with concern that ongoing specimen and laboratory challenges are resulting in slow shipment, handling, and reporting of samples for polio testing in some countries.

The Committee noted that the polio-funded staff and assets continue to support the pandemic response in more than 50 countries. In view of the overwhelming public health imperative to end the COVID-19 pandemic, the Polio Oversight Board has committed to the polio programme's continued support for the next phase of COVID-19 response, COVID-19 vaccine introduction and delivery, through existing assets, infrastructure, and expertise in key geographies.

Conclusion
The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The Committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy duration of the polio PHEIC, but concludes that the current situation is extraordinary, with clear ongoing substantial risk of international spread and utmost need for coordinated international response. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:
