Maize redness: addition to the EPPO Alert List
----------------------------------------------
Unusual symptoms of reddening and poor cob development were first observed on maize (_Zea mays_) in 1957 in the Banat district of Serbia. The disease, called 'maize redness', was subsequently reported from neighbouring countries, and more recently from Italy and Hungary. In Serbia, epidemic phases were observed in the late 1950s - early 1960s, and in the late 1990s - early 2000s. During these epidemic phases, disease incidence could reach 90 percent in some maize fields and yield reductions varying from 40 to 90 percent were observed.

In the mid-2000s, studies showed that a stolbur phytoplasma was consistently associated with diseased maize plants and that _Reptalus panzeri_ (Homoptera: Cixiidae) was the main insect vector [see ProMED-mail post 20070607.1844]. It is acknowledged that many aspects of this disease still remain to be clarified, such as its aetiology and the relationships with other diseases caused by stolbur phytoplasmas, its epidemiology (natural plant reservoirs, vectors) and its biology. The geographical distribution of _R. panzeri_ remains to be further studied but it is considered to be widespread in Europe.

As maize is an important crop in Europe, the EPPO Panel on Phytosanitary Measures suggested adding maize redness to the EPPO Alert List.

[Maize redness is caused by a stolbur phytoplasma (16SrXII; type member _Ca._ Phytoplasma solani, potato stolbur phytoplasma) of the subgroup 16SrXII-A. Symptoms include red discolouration on midribs, leaves, and stalk, abnormal ear development with shriveled grains, wilting of leaves, followed by overall necrosis and eventual death of plants. Characteristically, stunting of plants is not observed, in contrast to maize bushy stunt (phytoplasma) and corn stunt (spiroplasma) diseases. Economic losses are due to reduced grain filling and cob weight.

Maize redness is transmitted by the planthopper vector _Reptalus panzeri_. Disease outbreaks seem to occur in cycles favoured by hot dry summers, which stimulate vector migration into crops. Pathogen spread may also occur with plant material carrying infected vector insects, and a low percentage of seed transmission has been suggested, but further work is needed. Overwintering nymphs of _R. panzeri_ have been found on the roots of wheat and a perennial weed (_Sorghum halepense_), and these plants may play a role in disease epidemiology, especially if maize/wheat crop rotation is practised. Different maize hybrids appear to show varying levels of sensitivity to the disease and/or the vector. Disease management for phytoplasmas may include vector control, use of clean planting material and resistant varieties.

Phytoplasmas of the stolbur group have been reported to cause diseases in a range of dicotyledonous crops (for example, bois noir, a serious disease of grapevine), but only very few monocot hosts including maize and sugarcane (ProMED-mail post 20080303.0869).
