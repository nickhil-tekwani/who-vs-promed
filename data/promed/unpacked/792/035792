[The weekly update unfortunately demonstrates continued circulation of the WPV1 in Pakistan, and the cVDPVs in Africa (Angola and DR Congo reported cVDPV2 cases, and Somalia and Burkina Faso reported positive environmental samples, a sign that the virus is circulating in the country). It is noteworthy that it is the 1st identification of cVDPV2 in Burkina Faso, adding it to the countries affected by the outbreak in Jigawa, Nigeria. Also noteworthy is the identification of a cVDPV2 in Kinshasa, DR Congo, that is genetically related to the virus circulating in Angola.

In keeping with what I've presented in prior weekly global updates, I am including map links. For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

To visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 2+ years below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 25 countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained.

[2] Pakistan: Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 4 new cases

Four more polio cases emerge in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
---------------------------------------------------------
At least 4 new polio cases have been reported across Pakistan on Thursday [6 Feb 2020], sources privy to the healthcare quarters claimed on Saturday [8 Feb 2020]; 12 polio cases have thus far been recorded in the ongoing year [2020]. According to the sources, the cases have been reported from the provinces of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).

Government quarters have claimed that [there will be fewer] polio cases in 2020 [than in 2019]. Sources also went on to reveal that a countrywide polio prevention drive will be initiated in the ongoing month [February 2020]. The polio drive will kick off on [10 Feb 2020] in Karachi and [17 Feb 2020] in the rest of the country.

Earlier on [5 Feb 2020], A Rotary International delegation called on prime minister Imran Khan, where they were briefed on the government's efforts aimed at tackling poliovirus in the country. The delegation led by the organization's president was briefed over the countrywide immunization campaigns to tackle the virus. It was briefed that over 250 000 polio workers were engaged during the process, and more than 40 million children are administered polio drops in it.

The Rotary delegation lauded the efforts of the government.

[Another media report gave specifics on the 2 newly confirmed cases in Sindh province: a 36 month old girl with weakness in upper left and lower left limbs in in Badin, with date of onset 1 Jan 2020. The 2nd child is a 42 month old girl with weakness in her right lower limb in Kambar, with date of onset 1 Jan 2020 (https://www.brecorder.com/2020/02/09/569124/eoc-for-polio-in-sindh-confirms-two-new-polio-cases/).

Polio vaccination campaigns in the country resumed in December 2019 after an 8-month lapse following a major fake news barrage against the polio vaccination activities that occurred in April [2019]. It is possible these children were already incubating the wild poliovirus at the time of the campaign, although specific information on their vaccination histories is lacking.
