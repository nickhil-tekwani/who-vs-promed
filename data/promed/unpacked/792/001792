The Plant Health Directorate said it found a number of citrus trees infected with the Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV). The infected trees, originating from Sicily, were discovered in various garden centres following sampling and testing. [They] carried out the destruction of the infected consignments. Trees originating from the same consignments in which infected trees were detected will be tested. The general public is being asked to notify the Directorate of any purchase of citrus trees in the last 6 months.

Monitoring for both CTV and its vector has been conducted since 1999, with around 800 samples collected each year. The most recent outbreak dates back to 2012 in Gozo. Citrus trees were felled and the pest eradicated. In 2013, the virus was detected again in trees brought from abroad in a local nursery. In 2004, Malta was declared a protected zone for this disease. Any citrus trees for planting have to originate from authorised nurseries and be certified as free from the virus and vectors.

[_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus _Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive citrus viruses and has destroyed millions of trees worldwide. Besides citrus species (family of Rutacea), it affects hosts in only few other families. It appears to be spreading wherever citrus is grown. Different strains of CTV may vary in severity. Symptoms also depend on the citrus variety and the scion-rootstock combination. The virus is spread by several aphid species (including species of _Toxoptera_ and _Aphis_) in a non-persistent manner and can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. CTV has been included on the quarantine alert lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Strains are generally grouped into seedling yellows, quick decline, stem pitting and a mild type. Strains may occur singly or in combination. Introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk even in CTV-affected areas. Disease management for CTV includes clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum and vector control.

Sicily is an extremely high risk source for citrus material and it seems a puzzling choice for nursery imports. Its 1st significant CTV outbreak was reported in 2003 (ProMED-mail post 20030312.0609), followed by recurring outbreaks (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20130329.1610397, 20150807.3563988). Control measures have been unsuccessful, leading to a high CTV incidence in Sicilian citrus. Despite the high risk origin of the material, it appears from the report above, that certification in Malta is not reliable.
