New Ebola outbreak suggests the virus might lurk for years inside people
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This time last month [February 2021], national authorities in the African nation of Guinea declared they were dealing with an outbreak of Ebola deep in its rural southern region of Nzerekore.

With the outbreak currently consisting of 14 confirmed cases and 4 suspected, the World Health Organization is employing a range of protective and tracing measures to contain the virus's spread.

Suspicions over the source of the cluster have so far focused on a 51-year-old nurse who died at the end of January [2021], having sought help from both medical facilities and a traditional healer after a bout of high fever, vomiting, weakness, and diarrhea.

After first being diagnosed with typhoid and later malaria, it now appears her illness was caused by the far more deadly Zaire ebolavirus, a pathogen so deadly that at least 5 of the cases in the latest outbreak have already succumbed to its effects.

It's a tragic outcome for the woman and her family, who made up 6 of the 1st 7 known cases identified -- the last being the healer she turned to for help.

Yet the consequences of the virus's unmitigated spread could be far worse. From late 2013 until 2016, the pathogen raged across the nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in an outbreak that saw roughly 40 percent of the 28 610 infected die.

Smaller outbreaks have arisen since in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but researchers now have reason to doubt that this most recent emergence is connected to any of those outbreaks, and may even have been lurking inside a carrier in Guinea for the past 5 years or more.

A genomic analysis of samples of the virus taken from 4 of the patients was carried out by the Guinea Center for Research and Training in Infectious Diseases (CERFIG) and the National Hemorrhagic Fever Laboratory, revealing they belonged to the West African epidemic's highly virulent Makona strain.

This conclusion was backed up by a 2nd analysis on 3 samples conducted by the WHO reference laboratory at Senegal's Pasteur Institute, which compared the genes of these most recent virus specimens with 1063 genomes from the 2013-2016 West Africa outbreak.

Taken together, the results tell a rather shocking, if rather speculative story, suggesting the nurse's husband may have quietly hosted the virus in his body years longer than anybody would have previously thought possible.

In general, it takes roughly a week or so for the Zaire ebolavirus to start causing problems in the human body, which commences with targeting a variety of immune cells to open the way to a rapid spread.

White cells called macrophages eventually catch up with the onslaught, gobbling up the cells in all-out war. The consequences lead to capillaries leaking and clots settling into vessels, putting whole organ systems at risk of collapse.

It's during this period that infected secretions of bodily fluids can most easily pass the virus on.

Studies on the infectiousness of Ebola tend to use the presence of these 'wet symptoms' as a way of defining an average infectious period, which is typically around 5 to 15 days.

Yet there are signs the virus might hang around inside the body for far longer, with its RNA detectable in urine after a month, sweat after about 40 days, and in semen more than a year.

Even if these examples reflect a talent for lying dormant months after recovery, a whole 5 years is a shocking stretch.

Nonetheless, the virus particles analyzed in this new outbreak have a great deal in common with the West Africa epidemic, and evidence suggests it was most likely not picked up from a local animal reservoir.

It's not impossible that the virus might have bounced from one human host to another during the past five years, but researchers from the Pasteur Institute aren't viewing it as probable either.

"This number of substitutions is far less than what would be expected during sustained human-to-human transmission," the team notes in its report.

Even as a rare case, the finding challenges thoughts on how such outbreaks might start, and how to effectively communicate health and safety measures in affected communities.

Victims of Ebola already face heavy stigma in many African cultures, not just from others in their community but significantly in their own impression of self-worth.

While the message that Ebola in some instances remains transmissible many years after infection could help save lives, it's a statement that could also come with a heavy price.

[This is a tricky message to send, on one hand, that stigmas placed on survivors of Ebola are wrong and demoralizing, but on the other hand, be sure to practice safe sex to prevent potential transmission of virus persisting in the survivor. It is for this reason that education and clear strong messaging are essential.

Release -- 4 EBOV genomes from Guinea 2021 outbreak [edited]

https://virological.org/t/release-4-ebov-genomes-from-guinea-2021-outbreak/642
[Byline: Philippe Lemey, ARTIC Network]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
National authorities in Guinea declared a new Ebolavirus (EBOV) disease outbreak in Nzerekore region on 14 Feb 2021. To identify the EBOV strain responsible for this outbreak, 5 samples were sequenced at PFHVG using MinION (Oxford Nanopore) according to the ARTIC network protocol (https://artic.network). A consensus ranging from 47%-88% was obtained for 4 samples while only 7.5% consensus genome was recovered from one sample (not included in the analyses below).

The 4 sequences were identified as the Makona variant (Zaire ebolavirus) that was responsible for the 2013-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa. Phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrates that the 4 sequences cluster together within the Makona diversity (Fig. 1), indicating that the current outbreak is the result of human transmission rather than a new introduction from the animal reservoir. Remarkably, the branch ancestral to this cluster represents only 12 substitutions, much less than would be expected for genomes sampled in 2021 based on the EBOV evolutionary rate during the 2013-2016 EBOV outbreak (Fig. 1). This indicates a long period of latency (5 to 7 years) prior to this year's [2021] resurgence. This extends previous findings of a flare-up in 2016 in Guinea originating from a survivor with virus persistence in seminal fluid for more than 500 days (Diallo et al., 2016).

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) - Ebola Situation Report 39 -- 12 Mar 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fast facts
----------
- New cases of Ebola resurfaced in the northeast of the DRC on [7 Feb 2021], less than a year after the 10th Ebola outbreak claimed the lives of 2287 of the 3324 patients confirmed in this region.

This new outbreak comes less than 3 months after the end of the 11th outbreak, which spread to 13 of Equateur province's 18 health zones, and claimed the lives of 55 of the 130 cases confirmed.

- 4 of the 11 cases confirmed so far in this new Ebola outbreak have passed away.

- 1083 people have been vaccinated against Ebola since this new outbreak started.

International Medical Corps' response
-------------------------------------
- During the 11th outbreak, International Medical Corps' Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) managed more than 900 patients at Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) in Bikoro, Mbandaka, and Buburu, including 29 confirmed cases.

- On [30 Jun 2020], when the Mangina ETC in the northeast was decommissioned at the end of the 10th outbreak, the facility had cared for 3859 suspected and 422 confirmed Ebola patients.

- Eight confirmed cases and 16 suspect cases have been managed in the ETC set up and run by our rapid response team in Katwa, as part of the response to the current outbreak.

["International Medical Corps has been at the frontline of response to the new outbreak of Ebola in the DRC.

"On [Wed 3 Mar 2021], International Medical Corps discharged the 1st cured patients from the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) that we set up and manage in the town of Katwa, the current epicenter of the new outbreak, in the northeast. This latest outbreak, confirmed as the 12th in the country's history, comes only 3 months after the 11th outbreak, in Equateur province, was declared over in November 2020. It also arrived less than a year after the end of the 10th outbreak, also in the northeast and the worst in the DRC's history.

"The 1st confirmed cases of the outbreak passed away before they could seek medical care; the 2 patients who were cured and discharged were health staff who became infected while caring for other Ebola patients, due to insufficient infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. So far, 4 of the 11 confirmed cases in the current outbreak have died. It's worth noting that most had not received the Ebola vaccine. As in previous outbreaks, 2 of every 3 confirmed cases are women, which could be attributed to their traditional role in providing care, particularly to the ill, in the DRC

"International Medical Corps' Rapid Response Team (RRT) deployed to Katwa 24 hours after the outbreak was confirmed, and has managed 8 of the 11 cases confirmed so far, using a temporary structure converted into an ETC with the support of USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. Among challenges encountered thus far are gaps in patient transport; poor IPC practices at health facilities; community resistance, particularly toward the Ebola vaccine (which some believe is the COVID-19 vaccine being distributed under the guise of an Ebola vaccine); and inadequate partner presence to support the response. The latter is partly a result of competing needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. International Medical Corps is distributing a survey to help the DRC government better understand factors that contribute to Ebola vaccine hesitance, as well as vaccine hesitancy in general, in this region of the DRC."

"Gaps for which support is needed
---------------------------------
"Support is needed: to ensure that International Medical Corps can provide post-Ebola outbreak assistance in Equateur province beyond the 90-day period of heightened surveillance, including strengthening IPC; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); health information management systems; and surveillance. International Medical Corps also wishes to facilitate access to primary healthcare services and referrals, and to provide holistic support to Ebola survivors who could serve as a source of new outbreaks, due to the persistence of the virus in some of their body fluids."
(Excerpted from https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/IntlMedCorps-Ebola_in_DRC_Situation%20Report%20%2339.pdf)

A lesson learned from the rekindling of virus transmission after an extended period of time when no overt activity was detected is that intensive surveillance for Ebola, as well as COVID, must continue well after an outbreak appears to be over. The health infrastructure must be maintained, including keeping trained healthcare professionals on staff and training new staff, and supplies must be present or in a location that makes them easily accessible. Monitoring survivors should be considered but is likely to be difficult and present problems for these individuals. Nonetheless, education should include discussion of long term infection that may allow virus to be sexually transmitted well after apparent recovery. - Mod.LK]

[4] Dormant virus

Dormant virus reawakening may have triggered Ebola outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------
The current outbreak of Ebola in Guinea was probably triggered by someone who was infected 5-7 years ago and has unwittingly harboured the virus in their body this entire time, research suggests. The discovery, which is based on a comparison of viral genome sequences from patients infected in the current outbreak and the 2014-16 West African Ebola epidemic, suggests the virus may be able to survive in the bodies of survivors for 4-5 times longer than previously thought. It also creates fresh challenges for Ebola-affected communities and the health systems that serve them, such as how best to protect people's health without further stigmatising survivors.

Possibly, the virus has been lying dormant in someone who survived the previous epidemic, until something triggered it to reawaken, prompting this fresh wave of infections.

The latest outbreak has been traced back to a nurse who presented at a health centre in Goueke, southern Guinea, on [18 Jan 2021] with a headache, physical weakness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and fever, and who later died of their infection. There have been at least 8 other deaths related to the outbreak so far.

The assumption was that the nurse had picked up the virus from a wild animal, such as a bat. To confirm this -- and to rule out any connection to the previous epidemic, the epicentre of which was just 200 kilometres away -- an international team of researchers led by the Guinea Infectious Disease Research and Training Center performed whole genome sequencing on viral samples isolated from 4 patients affected by the current outbreak, comparing them to reference sequences from the 2014-16 epidemic. Usually, patterns in the genetic sequences of viruses tend to change as they're passed from host to host, so you would expect viruses that were circulating 5-7 years ago to look quite different from the ones that are circulating now, but the sequenced viruses were remarkably similar. This strongly suggests that the virus currently circulating in southern Guinea is closely related to strains that were behind the previous epidemic.

It's possible, the researchers say, that the virus has been lying dormant in someone who survived the previous epidemic until something triggered it to reawaken prompting this fresh wave of infections. Ebola virus is known to linger in certain body tissues that the immune system pays less attention to, including the eyeballs and testes, in some survivors. There is also evidence of sexual transmission of the virus via semen. But until now, the longest period the virus had been documented to persist in survivors was 500 days.

Although scientists can't rule out the possibility that the virus survived for a shorter period, and has since been passed, undetected, from person to person in a handful of individuals, the high death rate and infectiousness of the Ebola virus make this scenario less likely.

"The human origin of the current Ebola virus disease outbreak and the associated shift in our perception of Ebola virus emergence, call for careful attention to survivors," write the researchers on virological.org, where they published their findings.

Achieving this without increasing the intense stigmatisation Ebola survivors already face could present a major challenge. Boosting awareness of the fact that not everyone with Ebola shows symptoms, meaning that anyone in an affected region could be a survivor, is one potential strategy. Increased awareness about the possibility of sexual transmission of Ebola through unprotected sex could also help.
Then there are vaccines. High vaccine uptake by the contacts of Ebola patients and the contacts of these contacts could help ringfence those at the highest risk of disease, not only providing them with short-term protection but potentially preventing future outbreaks as well.

"Guinea 2021 EBOV outbreak
-------------------------
"On [14 Feb 2021], an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak was declared in Guinea. As of [7 Mar 2021], 18 EVD cases have been identified, including 9 deaths. These are the 1st reported cases of EVD since the 2013-2016 outbreak that resulted in over 28 000 cases and ~11 000 deaths mainly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

"Three samples were sent by the Ministry of Health Guinea to the regional WHO reference laboratory at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Senegal for sequencing. Samples were processed with a hybrid-capture based approach using a probe panel that included Ebola virus (EBOV) specific targets. One coding complete genome (99.6%) and one draft genome (98.7%) were obtained.

"The new EBOV genomes were initially aligned to single representatives from previous EVD outbreaks, and a phylogenetic tree was inferred (Figure 1). The 2 genomes grouped with the 2014 Makona variant, which caused the 2013-2016 West Africa EVD outbreak.

"We then aligned the 2 2021 Guinea EBOV genomes with a representative 1063 genomes from the 2013-2016 West Africa outbreak (Figure 2). The 2021 Guinean genomes share 10 substitutions that accumulated during the West Africa EVD outbreak (compared to KJ660346), including an A82V mutation in the glycoprotein, which arose when the virus spread to Sierra Leone and is considered a marker for human adaptation. These shared mutations make it unlikely that the new cases are a result of a new spillover from the animal reservoir but instead are directly linked to human cases in the 2013-2016 West Africa EVD outbreak.

"The new genomes are most closely related to 5 identical Ebola virus Makona variant genomes sampled in August 2014 from the same region but are diverged by 12 (Ebov-0002) and 13 (Ebov-0003) substitutions (compared to KR534588). This number of substitutions is far less than what would be expected during sustained human-to-human transmission.

"The estimated evolutionary rate of 0.0012 substitutions per site per year translates to 22-23 substitutions per year and we would expect over 110 substitutions in the 5 years separating the outbreaks if it had been evolving at that rate. Root-to-tip analysis (Figure 3) also infers a lower-than-expected sequence divergence compared to genomes from the 2013-2016 West Africa EVD outbreak (95% prediction interval). A slowed evolutionary rate is a hallmark of persistent infections [5-8] 14. Therefore, the index case of the 2021 Guinea cluster was likely infected from a persistent source, such as via sexual transmission from an EVD survivor. These results are still preliminary, and more sequencing and analyses are underway."

Keita AK, Dux A, Diallo H, et al. Resurgence of Ebola virus in Guinea after 5 years calls for careful attention to survivors without creating further stigmatization.
https://virological.org/t/guinea-2021-ebov-genomes/651
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Seven years after the declaration of the 1st Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Guinea, the country is facing a new Ebola outbreak in a town located only 200 km [about 124 mi] from the epicenter of the previous epidemic. In order to discriminate whether this new outbreak was caused by a new zoonotic transmission event or by resurgence of the viral strain that circulated in the previous West African outbreak whole genome sequencing was attempted at CERFIG in Conakry, Guinea, on viral extracts from samples that were positive for EBOV (Zaire ebolavirus) NP and GP on the GeneXpert molecular diagnostic platform (Xpert Ebola Assay).

"For this, we generated Illumina libraries which were enriched in filoviral sequences by hybridization capture before their sequencing on an Illumina iSeq platform. We used the resulting reads to generate consensus sequences, applying a conservative 20X, 90% agreement base calling threshold. This allowed us to determine 4 genomic sequences 30 covering ≥99.9% of the EBOV reference genome at a depth of 223-763X (unique reads). 3 of the genomes were strictly identical and the 4th only exhibited a single nucleotide substitution to the others.

We aligned these genomes and a selection of representatives from earlier outbreaks using MAFFT and then used IQ-TREE to estimate a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree from this alignment. In the resulting tree, the new Guinean EBOV genomes nest within the clade formed by sequences from the first epidemic, within which they also form a well-supported sub-clade with genomes from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone from the previous outbreak (2013-2016) (Figure 1 -- available at the source URL above). This pattern shows clearly that the new outbreak is the result of the resurgence of a strain that previously circulated in the West African outbreak from 2013-2016. The unexpectedly short branch leading to the 2021 Guinean EBOV genomes suggests a marked substitution rate slowdown, which might be due to latency in a survivor.

The human origin of the current EVD outbreak and the associated shift in our perception of EBOV emergence, call for careful attention to survivors. The possibility of resurgence of Ebola, up to 5 years or more after EVD, opens new challenges for survivors, their families, and their communities but also for the health system that has to create ways to work with communities, known and unknown survivors, without creating further stigmatization."
