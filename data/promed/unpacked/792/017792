[Ref: D Valiunas et al. First report of a new phytoplasma subgroup,
16SrIII-T, associated with decline disease affecting sweet and sour cherry
trees in Lithuania. Plant Dis 2009; 93(5): 550; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-93-5-0550B]
--------------------------------------------------------
During July 2007, sweet (_Prunus avium_) and sour cherry (_P. cerasus_)
trees exhibiting disease symptoms suggestive of possible phytoplasma
infection were observed in a large orchard in the Kaunas Region of
Lithuania. Samples of leaf tissue were collected from 13 sweet cherry trees
that were affected by a decline disease (designated cherry decline, ChD)
characterized by symptoms that included leaf reddening and premature leaf
drop and 2 sour cherry trees exhibiting proliferation of branches and
nonseasonal flowering.

To assess the diseased trees for phytoplasma infection, 16S ribosomal (r)
DNA sequences amplified from all 15 trees [by polymerase chain reaction]
were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses.
The collective profiles indicated that DNAs were derived from 2 different
phytoplasmas.

One of them, designated ChD phytoplasma, was found in 11 sweet cherry trees
and 2 sour cherry trees and tentatively classified as a member of a new
subgroup designated 16SrIII-T (X-disease phytoplasma group). It was
observed that the ChD phytoplasma caused different symptoms in sweet and
sour cherry. The ChD phytoplasma 16S rDNA shared 98.4 and 98.6 per cent
sequence identity with the 16S rDNAs from stone fruit-infecting
phytoplasmas associated with western X-disease and Canada X-disease,
respectively, indicating that the 3 strains are closely related.
Interestingly, the ChD phytoplasma 16S rDNA shared 99.8 per cent sequence
identity with 16S rDNA from operon rrnB from a phytoplasma previously found
to be associated with dandelion virescence (DanVir) disease in Lithuania.
The operon rrnA shared 99.3 per cent sequence identity. The high similarity
of the ChD 16S rRNA gene sequence to that of DanVir rrnB suggests the
possibility that ChD and DanVir may belong to a single phytoplasma species
and that dandelion is possibly an alternate host of ChD phytoplasma.

The other phytoplasma, found in 2 sweet cherry trees, was classified in
subgroup 16SrI-B (group of _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris and related
strains) and was designated cherry proliferation phytoplasma. Thus, in
Europe, cherry may be affected by diseases associated with phytoplasmas
belonging to groups 16SrI, 16SrIII, 16SrX [apple proliferation group], and
16SrXII [stolbur group].

The infections by diverse phytoplasma strains and species underscore the
need for production of phytoplasma-free planting stock and for intensified
research to reduce ecological and economic impacts of these phytoplasmas.

[Phytoplasmas are bacterial intracellular parasites, which cannot be
cultured in vitro. Spread usually occurs by grafting, dodder (parasitic
vines), and insect vectors, mostly phloem-feeding leafhoppers. While
symptoms may include yellowing, stunting, and/or proliferations, molecular
diagnosis is often needed to detect infection. Phytoplasma diseases are
known to affect many crops, for example coconut palm, grapevine, papaya,
rice, potato, citrus, pome, and stone fruit.

Phytoplasma species are defined by a level of at least 97.5 per cent
homology of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences, but even at this level additional
species have been defined to distinguish between organisms significantly
different in biological and genetic properties. The taxonomy of these
pathogens is still being refined, and new species and groups are characterised.

Disease management of phytoplasmas is difficult and generally includes
vector control, removal of infected plants and other sources of inoculum,
as well as the use of certified clean planting and grafting material. Such
measures require reliable molecular diagnostic methods and coordinated
efforts on a regional scale, especially when dealing with a long-lived tree
crop. The study above provides a basis for such an approach for European
cherry trees.
