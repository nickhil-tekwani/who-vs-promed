Workers at the Adams County Animal Shelter are warning residents to
keep their cats inside after a potentially deadly outbreak.

Four felines were brought to the shelter on 15 Jul 2010 showing
strange signs. Two were found in different parts of Thornton, and the
other 2 were from Adams County.

Millie Beck, Adams County Shelter Manager, said it looked like the
cats had an upper respiratory infection, but it progressed faster.
"At this time, we don't know what we're dealing with," said Beck.

It took less than 24 hours for a runny nose to turn into spots or
ulcers covering their tongues. Then, their mouths swelled up.

The animals were given medicine, but that didn't help. The 4 cats
were barely breathing and had to be euthanized.

"There's a chance it could be a toxin, but it could be a virus," said
Dr. Wade Smith of the Community Pet Hospital in Thornton. He believes
it could be something like the calicivirus, which can spread quickly
and carry a big toll.

"They can't smell very well, and they don't eat. Then their mouths
get so sore, they can't drink water very well either," said Wade. He
warns that the virus itself won't kill a cat but the effects will.
Cats become dehydrated and eventually die.

Shelter officials are not sure if the cats had the virus. They sent
one of the cats to Colorado State University's Diagnostic Lab and
expect to get the results within the next 2 days.

If it turns out to be calicivirus, most household pets are vaccinated
against it. But pet owners are urged to take their cats to the vet if
any of the symptoms arise.

In the meantime, Wade says it's good to keep cats indoors.

[Calicivirus has also been found in cats with lymphocytic-plasmacytic
gingivitis and stomatitis. The superficial lesions heal rapidly, and
the infected cat regains appetite 2-3 days after onset. The clinical
course usually is 7-10 days. An acute febrile response, inappetence,
and depression are common signs. Serous rhinitis and conjunctivitis
also can occur.

Often calicivirus is a part of a feline respiratory disease complex
(FRDC). FRDC usually involves both calicivirus and feline viral
rhinotracheitis (FVR).

The onset of FVR is marked by fever, frequent sneezing,
conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and often salivation. Excitement or
movement may induce sneezing. The fever may reach 105 F (40.5 C) but
subsides and tends to fluctuate from normal to 103 F (39 C).
Initially, a serous nasal and ocular discharge occurs; it soon
becomes mucopurulent and copious, at which time depression and
anorexia are evident. Severely debilitated cats may develop
ulcerative stomatitis, and ulcerative keratitis occurs in some. Signs
may persist for 5-10 days in milder cases and up to 6 weeks in severe
cases.

Treatment is largely symptomatic and supportive, but broad-spectrum
antibiotics are useful against secondary bacterial invaders.

While these cats may have been vaccinated against this disease or
disease complex, I would think these are younger unvaccinated cats.
