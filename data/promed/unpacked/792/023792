The death toll is mounting in the rural town of Belobaka in the district of Mahajanga II, after people consumed a dish made with sea turtle meat, which was poisonous.

"Eight children died after mass food poisoning. Four were killed in the fokontany Antsahanitia; one died on the road [on the way to the hospital], and 3 others died in the Androva University Hospital," recounted journalist Luc Fabien Raoeliariseheno in the Boeny region yesterday [13 May 2014]. These deaths were mainly due to delays in obtaining care, causing advanced dehydration in the children.

Breastfeeding also resulted in the transfer of the toxin between the mother and an already ill child. 50 people have been admitted to the health centers following consumption of the toxic sea turtle meat. Cases are also likely to increase, as the inhabitants of Betsako, commonly known as Belobaka, have also bought sea turtle meat. Some local sources also claimed that meat from the sea turtle has been seen in the village of Mahavoky Avaratra.

The search for turtle meat was well launched in the markets by Monday [12 May 2014] in the district of Mahajanga I and II. There is a general lack of awareness of poor people to the danger.

The same situation has already occurred in Toliara and Antalaha, according Christmas Rakotonirina Etienne, Regional Director of Fisheries in the region Boeny.

[If this turtle is the Hawksbill (_ Eretmochelys imbricata_), then what it consumed may be the cause of toxicity.

Hawksbills are omnivorous, consuming sea grasses, sea urchins, barnacles, small animals and their favorite food, sponges. In the Caribbean, as hawksbills grow, they begin exclusively feeding on only a few types of sponges, and they can eat an average of 1200 lbs (544 kg) of sponges a year. Sponges -- composed of tiny glasslike needles -- apparently cause the turtle no harm. However, in the Indo-Pacific, hawksbills continue eating a varied diet that includes sponges, other invertebrates, and algae.

Interestingly, some of the sponges and small animals that hawksbills consume are toxic. The hawksbill's body fat absorbs the toxins without making the turtle ill, but their meat is potentially poisonous to humans. This discourages, but does not stop, the harvesting of hawksbills for meat.

Other turtles are also known to have toxic meat based upon what they have consumed. The following paper details many types of turtles and their locations and substances that have been found in turtle meat: http://eprints.cmfri.org.in/1075/1/Bulletin_35-9.pdf.

Turtle meat may contain a number of toxic agents from the toxins produced by algae and sponges, but it may also contain a variety of heavy metals. Many of these toxic agents may pass from the mother to the child through the milk, or even in utero.

International bodies have banned the harvesting and consumption of turtle meat for years, but the ban has had little effect in some countries. Unfortunately, if those people had respected the ban, they might still be alive.
