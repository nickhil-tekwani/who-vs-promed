Sunflower necrosis disease from India is caused by an ilarvirus related to
tobacco streak virus. KS Ravi (Division of Molecular Virology, Mahyco Life
Sciences Research Center, Jalna, India), A Buttgereitt (DSMZ, Plant Virus
Division, Braunschweig, Germany), AS Kitkaru, S Deshmukh (as KS Ravi), DE
Lesemann (Federal Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry, BBA,
Braunschweig, Germany), S Winter (<S.Winter@bba.de>, as A Buttgereitt).
Accepted for publication 31 May 2001.
A serious disease of sunflower (_Helianthus annuus_ L.) with putative virus
etiology was found occurring in all major sunflower-growing regions in
India. Symptoms of this sunflower necrosis disease (SND) comprised
chlorotic and necrotic ringspots and leaf distortion... ...A general leaf
and stem necrosis extending to midveins, petioles, and flower bracts...
...eventually results in stunting and dieback, especially when plants
become infected in early stages of development.
In electron microscopy ilarvirus-like particles were detected in crude sap
of SND-affected sunflower and _Chenopodium quinoa_ plants inoculated with
leaf extracts prepared from SND-affected sunflower plants. ... Several
other herbaceous virus indicator plants -- groundnut, cowpea, and cotton --
which are significant crops in India, became infected. Back transmission to
healthy sunflower seedlings with leaf extracts of systemically infected
indicator plants resulted in identical symptoms of SND, [thus confirming
the ilar-like virus as the causative agent of ... SND.
An antiserum (DSMZ AS-0615, Braunschweig, Germany) raised against purified
virus preparations reacted well in DAS-ELISA and proved reliable for field
diagnosis of sunflower necrosis virus, SNV. In a comparative serological
study comprising plants infected with other ilarviruses, a reaction was
demonstrated only with tobacco streak virus (TSV). This serological
relationship was confirmed by western blot analysis and IEM decoration
assays using SNV and TSV antisera in reciprocal tests.
In RT-PCR, using oligonucleotide primers deduced from conserved sequences
within TSV RNA 3 and flanking the entire coat protein region, a dsDNA
fragment of about 1000 bp was amplified from SNV infected sunflowers.
Sequence analysis of cloned SNV PCR fragments revealed nucleotide
identities of about 90 per cent [homology? - Mod.SH with TSV RNA 3 (EMBL
accession number: X00435) and a coat protein amino acid homology between
SNV and TSV of more than 90 per cent. The variability of nucleotide
sequences retrieved from 3 sunflower isolates obtained from different
locations was less than 3 per cent.
Our experimental data unequivocally prove that the virus causing... ...SND
in many sunflower varieties... ...[in different growing regions in India
is a strain of tobacco streak virus. It is now important to establish
whether TSV is associated with diseases of other significant crops -- for
example, groundnut -- in India.

[Tobacco streak ilarvirus was first reported in tobacco in 1936. It is
transmitted by seed in several crops, but I do not know if it is
transmitted by seed in sunflower. It is also transmitted by _Frankliniella
occidentalis_ (western flower thrips) and by _Thrips tabaci_ (thrips or
onion thrips) possibly by virus from the surface of infested pollen
entering through feeding wounds on leaves. Another route of transmission is
via infected pollen to the pollinated plant.
Sunflower necrosis disease was first reported in 1997 in Karnataka state
and is increasing in incidence in that state as well as Andhra Pradesh,
Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu, the main sunflower-growing states of India. It
has become a limiting factor in sunflower production, affecting up to 80
per cent of some open-pollinated and hybrid crops in 1999.
If any of our Indian colleagues have new information about this disease,
please let me know.
