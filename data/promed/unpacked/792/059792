HFM cases decreasing, says health official
[Abstract
PETALING JAYA: Total admission figures for the hand-foot-mouth (HFM)
disease have been decreasing steadily, with no new patients in Sabah and no
new deaths recorded as of Sunday. A further decline in figures is expected
as 76 of the 82 patients admitted in Peninsular Malaysia between Saturday
and Sunday have been discharged. There have been no new admissions in Sabah.
[For Sarawak data, see end. Sabah and Sarawak are on the island of Borneo.

A health official said that the latest figures brought the total number of
admissions in the peninsula to 2,327, of which 2,159 had been discharged.
168 people were still hospitalised in the peninsula for the HFM disease.
The national cumulative admission figure stands at 3,334 while the number
of discharged patients is 3,126, he said.

There have been no new deaths recorded and the toll still stands at 31.
In Kuala Terengganu, state Environment, Health and Consumer Affairs
Committee chairman Wong Foon Meng said 136 cases of HFM disease were
reported at government hospitals between June 6 and July 6, and 15 patients
were still hospitalised. He said the committee distributed 22,000 pamphlets
on the Coxsackie virus to schools, kindergartens, government departments
and the public to educate them on the importance of personal hygiene in
combating HFM, and planned to print 100,000 more.
[The Sarawak government website http://www.jaring.my/jkns/outbreak/vao.htm
updated to 9 July 1997 says that 33 cases are still hospitalised there
