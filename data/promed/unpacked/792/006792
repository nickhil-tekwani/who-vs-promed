The largest daily toll so far is today with 25 outbreaks, bringing the
total to 164, which includes 1 in Northern Ireland. Others include: Kent
and Gloucestershire infected for [the first time; other outbreaks were in
Powys, Devon (4), Cumbria (8), Worcestershire, Derbyshire, Dumfries and
Galloway (2), Tyne and Wear, Co. Durham (2) and Herefordshire.
The Gloucestershire outbreak is in the Forest of Dean where sheep roam
freely over large areas.
As the tourist season gets underway, there is concern about the effects
on the tourist industry.
[The Minister of Agriculture reiterated today the disease is under control
and
that vaccination is not an option.

Vets 'should have pistols to shoot diseased stock'
--------------------------------------------------
Vets should be equipped with pistols to shoot farm animals as soon as
they diagnose Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), to limit the risk of the
disease spreading, a leading authority during the 1960s outbreak said
yesterday.
Ken Tyrell, a former Ministry of Agriculture veterinarian, said in the
past vets were able to dispatch the diseased animal almost immediately.
He said, "Vets know when an animal has got the disease and should be
able to bump it off straight away after a brief discussion with a
colleague at the ministry. In the 1960s we had single-shot Webley Scot
pistols and it worked very well. We waited for laboratory confirmation
in only a few very doubtful cases."
Mr Tyrell, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, who worked for the ministry for
35 years, said delays between the vet's initial diagnosis, then tests
and confirmation by MAFF vets and finally slaughter, increased the
possibility of the disease spreading farther afield.
Tyrell said, "The virus is at its most powerful in those animals that
have the full-blown disease. It is very contagious and the longer they
are left, the higher the risk of the virus spreading elsewhere."

[We have been reading less forthright statements in the UK press over the
past few days. Informal queries have confirmed questions are being raised
on slaughter delays, as well as for disposing of the carcasses. The latter
is a distressing phenomenon at the best of times and thus any delay,
however unavoidable, will be questioned especially by those not fully
informed or cognizant of the organizational problems. This subject was
raised in Parliament on 9 Mar 2001 where it was alleged carcass disposal
was taking 5 days and laboratory results up to 7 days. The full Hansard
text for 9 Mar 2001 has yet to be posted:
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/home.htm>
but one can check the PigHealth archive page:
<http://www.pighealth.com/fmdoutbreaks2.htm>
During the 1967-68 epidemic it was clear in retrospect, we only turned
the corner when it was possible to slaughter the majority of affected
herds/flocks on the same day as diagnosis. In those days the inspecting
veterinary officer, having checked the herd, would telephone Tolworth,
MAFF HQ, and tell the officer there what signs and lesions he had found;
a continual complaint was waiting 3-4 hours to get through.
If convinced, the Tolworth officer would give him verbal permission to
slaughter the herd immediately as dead animals cease to produce virus for
aerosols. As soon as the animals had been valued, slaughtering would
commence; on a few occasions, valuation was
done with the local auctioneer standing on the covered grave. Sampling was
infrequent. The sampling that did occur was conducted for virus monitoring
purposes by Pirbright staff.
We would appreciate having hard information on the time between the
identification of animals with typical lesions and slaughter. If there have
been delays, it would partially explain the recent increased numbers of
cases. - Mods.MHJ/TG

Farmers flout rules as foot and mouth spreads
---------------------------------------------
Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) may be spreading out of control because of
the movement of potentially infected animals to slaughter. This theory
has emerged as the number of cases across the country continued to climb
this weekend after scientists had predicted a fall.
Farmers have been criticized for abusing the relaxed regulations which
allow animals from supposedly non-infected areas to be transported to
abattoirs to be killed and sold for meat for human consumption.

Jim Scudamore, the chief vet, said he was alarmed farmers were taking
animals which had not been licensed for slaughter. "There are worrying
reports of abuse of this system, including farmers turning up at
abattoirs which have not been expecting the consignment or with more
animals than had been licensed," he said. "There is a risk such movements
could compromise the disease security of the one-way slaughter chain."

There is a further risk to areas not having had cases so far might be
harboring animals incubating the disease, which they then spread when
taken for slaughter.
Scudamore has admitted the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF) has been unable to trace an unknown number of potentially infected
sheep sold at a market in Longtown, Cumbria, from where most cases have
been sourced. They had been sold at 2 markets outside the site's main
sales ring and without the usual paperwork before the government's ban on
the movement of livestock. Scudamore urged farmers who may have bought
the sheep on 15 and 22 Feb 2001 to come forward.
