Meningitis in Africa Epidemic situation, January - March 1997:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Three countries (Togo, Ghana and Burkina Faso) have reached the epidemic
threshold since the beginning of the 1997 meningitis season in early
November 1996.
Togo was the first country to report an increased number of meningitis
cases in the Savanes Region neighbouring Burkina Faso. The first
cases were reported in late December 1996 and the epidemic threshold was
reached on 5 January 1997 in Tone District. Mass immunization activities
have covered 159 000 persons (100% of the population) in the Tandjouare
and Oti areas neighbouring Tone District. In other areas, efforts are
being made to convince the population still reluctant towards
vaccination.
Burkina Faso: The epidemic threshold has been reached in 5 districts
since the second week of 1997. The weekly reported number of cases
continued to increase; the epidemic has extended to more than 10
districts and continues to spread. Intensive vaccination campaigns are
under way, as well as social mobilization to convince more people to be
vaccinated in the affected areas.
Ghana: Cases have been reported from northern Ghana since the beginning
of November 1996. The threshold was reached during the last week of
January. Since then, the epidemic has continued to spread. The weekly
attack rates are over 15 per 100 000 population in 6 districts in the
Upper East and Northern Regions. The population at greatest risk is
estimated at more than 1.7 million. The national crisis committee
monitors the epidemic situation and determines the needs. Intensive
vaccination campaigns are in progress. Other countries [in the region]
have reported sporadic cases. National health authorities have been re-
quested to reinforce disease surveillance and initiate vaccination
activities as soon as the epidemic threshold is reached.
(Based on: A report from the WHO Regional Office for Africa.)
WER Editorial Note: An international Appeal has been launched by WHO
jointly with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies, Medecins sans Frontieres and UNICEF to raise funds for the
control of meningitis in Africa in the 1997 epidemic season. The funds
are being used to purchase vaccine, treatment drugs and autodestruct
injection material. Requests for vaccine are evaluated according to
criteria set by an International Coordinating Group, to ensure that
optimal use is made of the vaccine currently available.
