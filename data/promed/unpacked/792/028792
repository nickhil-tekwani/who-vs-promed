The few paragraphs on the subject of European bat rabies posted by
ProMED-mail on 22 Oct 1998 resulted in so many questions and comments
that I wondered if I might be permitted a "second bite of the cherry"
in order to answer the questions and add more information?
Despite the enormous numbers of bats known to inhabit the countries
of the Far East, bat rabies is reported there only rarely. In 1974 an
Indian pointsman [railwayman? in the Srikakulam District of Andhra
Pradesh died of rabies three months after being bitten on the wrist
by a bat, and one of two bats examined for rabies from Khonken
Province, Thailand in 1986 was rabies positive. Although one or two
negative surveys for bat rabies have been reported, it is clear that
in Asia the subject provokes little interest and bat rabies is not of
serious public health significance.
Fossil remains of vampire bats indicate a far greater geographic
range than the present approximately lat. 300N to 350S in the
Americas. The range of vampire bat rabies is about 50 [degrees less,
both north and south, than the range of the species. At risk are an
estimated 70 million cattle and the annual cost of rabies is
approximately US$50 million - unchanged over many years.
An excellent summary of the subject may be found in Danny A Brass
(1994) Rabies in Bats - Natural History and Public Health
Implications. Livia Press, Ridgefield, Connecticut.
Once rabies had been shown to be present in North American bat
species in 1953, the disease was soon confirmed in representatives of
almost all indigenous bat species and from all continental States.
The advent of monoclonal antibody and molecular techniques made it
possible to show that infected bats were on occasion a source of
rabies in terrestrial animals, although they do not play an important
role in terrestrial animal enzootics.

However, such techniques have also shown that the serotype/genotype 1
viruses of these bats have, since 1980, been responsible for 21 of
the 36 cases of human rabies reported in the USA.
In Europe, the majority of reported bat rabies cases have come from
_Eptesicus serotinus_ (serotine) bats and these bats are believed to
be the reservoir species of European bat lyssavirus (EBL) 1 virus
(now classified as genotype 5), with possible spill-over to a few
other species. A second group of viruses (EBL 2, now classified as
genotype 6) have been isolated from _Myotis dasycneme_ and _M.
daubentoni_ bat species. Both EBL 1 and EBL 2 viruses have been
associated with human death from rabies; the virus isolated from a
bat biologist who died of rabies in Finland is identical to that
isolated from _M. daubentoni_ bats of Switzerland.
The recent finding of an EBL 1 virus in sheep is the first record of
European bat virus transmission to a terrestrial animal other than
man.
A new piece of the bat-rabies jigsaw puzzle emerged in 1996 when
lyssaviruses were diagnosed as infections of two species of
Australian flying fox [bats and a human case occurred in a person
with contact with bats. The virus isolates are genetically distinct
from other lyssaviruses and currently an important and extensive
research programme is underway.
