An outbreak of Japanese encephalitis has killed 99 people, all of them
children, in the past two months in India's southern state of Andhra
Pradesh, health officials said on Monday.
The state's director of health, K.S.V. Prasada Rao, said 463 cases of the
brain disease had been reported in the state during this period, from 337
villages scattered across 10 districts.
No cases had been reported from the state capital, Hyderabad.
Officials said they were striving to contain the spread of the disease,
which is transmitted by mosquitoes.
"As many as 119 medical teams and 230 paramedical teams are working in the
field. The situation is being closely monitored in all the 337 affected
villages," said Rao.
State Health Minister S. Aruna said the situation was under control.
Insecticides were being sprayed in the affected villages and Japanese
encephalitis vaccines had been sent to Kurnool, Anantapur and Prakasam
districts, the worst-hit areas.
Government data showed there were 984 cases of Japanese encephalitis,
including 247 deaths, in Andhra Pradesh in all of 1997 and 524 cases,
including 201 deaths, in 1998.
