Queensland health authorities are investigating an outbreak of food poisoning that may have contributed to a woman's death and sickened 220 other people. A 77-year-old woman has died after falling ill from salmonellosis at Melbourne Cup functions earlier in November 2013. Dr Susan Vlack from Brisbane's metro north public health unit says salmonellosis did not cause the woman's death but may have been a contributing factor.

The outbreak has been linked to Brisbane firm Piccalilli Catering, which provided food for up to 40 different Melbourne Cup events on 5 Nov 2013. Up to 700 people may have been exposed.

Piccalilli Catering co-owner Helen Grace has expressed her deep regret at what has occurred. "We are deeply upset and distressed by this outcome," she said in a statement.

Ms Grace says their catering on Melbourne Cup day included fresh mayonnaise made by the company's chefs with eggs purchased from a usually reputable supplier. "We had no reason to believe they were not up to the very high standards we demand of our suppliers," she said. "Suffice to say we will not source produce from this supplier in the future."

Dr Vlack says they are concerned that people who are infected will spread the illness into the wider community.

"There [are] not too many people who have been very sick," she said. "We have had 7 people we have identified as being hospitalised and probably about 2 of those are reasonably sick. Salmonella occurs particularly in meats such as chicken, pork, beef and in egg products. Those products are often part of a catered meal, so sometimes in small amounts in different dishes. If you're sick, check with the doctor for fever and diarrhoea."

Dr Vlack says letters have been sent to all companies and private function coordinators who used the caterer, advising them of the situation. She says they have been advised to report back on anyone who is experiencing sickness, particularly if they are health workers or staff handling food.

[The scope of the outbreak so far is not clear, nor is it known if individuals in other states or countries have been affected. Neither the source nor the serotype is known, but if raw eggs were used in making the mayonnaise, that is a possibility.

The outbreak appears to be related to a series of catered events held in Brisbane related to the Melbourne Cup. The Melbourne Cup (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup) is Australia's major thoroughbred horse race. Marketed as "the race that stops a nation," it is a 3200 metre race for 3-year-olds and over. It is the richest "2-mile" handicap in the world, and one of the richest turf races. Conducted by the Victoria Racing Club on the Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, Victoria, the event starts at 3:00 pm (daylight savings time) on the 1st Tuesday in November. - Mod.LL
