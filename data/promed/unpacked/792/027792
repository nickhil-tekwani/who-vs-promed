Dengue has been reported for many years but severe dengue haemorrhagic
fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) seem to have emerged only in
the past 50 years. The viruses that cause dengue are common in tropical
areas and DHF/DSS carries a case fatality rate of between 2% and 4%. There
are four antigenically related dengue virus serotypes (DEN1-4), any one of
which may cause disease. DHF/DSS is generally believed to be caused by
secondary infection with a dengue virus of a different serotype to that
which caused the primary infection. Infection with DEN-2 originating in
south east Asia in people previously infected with other serotypes has been
particularly associated with severe disease. A prospective cohort study of
dengue in Iquitos, Peru showed that 78 (60.5%) of 129 students (aged 7 to
20 years) [who previously had been infected with dengue 1 virus (from 1990
to 1994) were infected with dengue 2 virus during a major outbreak in 1995;
none had suffered DHF or DSS. Extrapolating from this cohort to the general
population aged 5 to 14 years the authors estimated that 49 266 of 81 479
children ages 5-14 years (based on 1993 census) who were living in Iquitos
(the study site) may have had a secondary (dengue 2 virus) infection in
1995.
Based on the results of previous studies, between 887 and 10 247 cases of
DHF or DSS could have occurred in this age group and the expected case
fatality rate would be in the range of 1-5%. No DHF/DSS occurred and all
cases were very mild. The Iquitos dengue 2 virus genotype is similar to
genotypes of dengue viruses from other parts of the Americas and different
from genotypes of dengue 2 viruses from Asia.

[I am personally grateful to Doug Watts for having clarified was a very
confusing and misleading report. These results suggest, once again, that
both Leon Rosen and Scott Halstead and Phil Russell were right: It may take
a secondary infection with a second dengue serotype but there is also the
necessity for just the right secondary serotype, else DHF does not often
occur. Rapid evolution of dengue genotypes and other factors stand in the
way of the development of an adeqauate vaccine again this important
disease/these important viruses. - Mod.CHC]
