The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), in a cooperative effort with the
U.S. Dept. of Agriculture's (USDA) Veterinary Services, is offering to test
goats free in selected counties to find out if the animals are carrying a
disease that can cause serious illness in humans.
"Just weeks ago in Starr County, we found a sheep and goat herd infected
with _Brucella melitensis_, a bacterial disease not seen in the US in
nearly 30 years," said Dr. James Lenarduzzi, director of the TAHC's South
Texas area. "It's very important to human health that we learn if other
herds could be carrying the disease."
"The infected animals can be dangerous because they can spread the disease,
which in humans, is called 'Malta Fever,' or 'undulant fever.' Victims
develop flu-like symptoms, night sweats, aches, pains, headache and a fever
that comes and goes. Anyone who may have been associated with infected
goats or goat products and is suffering these symptoms should see a doctor
and report possible exposure to the disease. Antibiotics are needed for
treatment to avoid serious complications," he said.
"Because the disease in Mexico is widespread, we are targeting Texas
counties where the risk is greatest. In l998, more than 6500 persons in
Mexico suffered from undulant fever, with many cases caused by infected
goats," said Dr. Lenarduzzi. "The Texas Department of Health said 16 Texas
cases were reported in 1998; 14 of the patients had consumed dairy products
from goats, and 9 of the group also had traveled internationally."
Until animals are tested, owners are advised to stop consuming
unpasteurized goat milk, unpasteurized cheese, or handling raw goat meat
products. Cooked meat is safe to eat, as heat kills the _Brucella
melitensis_ bacteria. Because infected nannies can spread infection when
giving birth, ranchers should wear gloves when assisting pregnant goats.
When slaughtering untested goats, ranchers should wear a face mask, glasses
and rubber gloves, to avoid breathing in or becoming exposed to bacteria
that can become airborne during the slaughtering process. Clothing worn
during the task should be laundered.
