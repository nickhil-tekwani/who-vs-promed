[2016] was one of the worst years for fusarium head blight [FHB] in western Canadian spring wheat. "The harvest is potentially the worst on record for FHB damage and DON (deoxynivalenol, a mycotoxin) levels in many crop districts," National Millers Association's Gordon Harrison said. "Damage is 1.5 to 5 times more than in recent years."

"A significant portion of the durum wheat may be unmarketable as milling grade," he said. Canada's top bread-making wheat also has high levels of DON. Downgrading could cost farmers USD one billion in lost revenue.

FHB is wider spread than ever before, and the trend line is rising. In some areas, 60 per cent [of bread grain] is not usable. Farmers can manage FHB with an integrated approach [including] wheats that are more FHB tolerant [and] better fungicides. Breeders and scientists are searching hard for new forms of FHB resistance.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called ear blight, scab) of small grain cereal crops (wheat, barley, rye, oats, maize) is caused by several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_. FHB causes yield losses of up to 45 percent and reduces the grade of harvested grain. The fungi can also cause foot rot and seedling blight and form a complex of diseases on seeds, seedlings and adult plants. Current names of the fungi include _Gibberella zeae_ (previously _Fusarium graminearum_), _Fusarium poae_, _Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_ (previously _Fusarium_ or _Microdochium nivale_) and _Microdochium majus_. The pathogens are favoured by humid conditions.

Depending on fungal strains involved and environmental factors during plant growth and grain storage, infection may also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins (such as DON mentioned above). The total crop may be lost because of toxin levels. The fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues, spores are spread by wind, water, mechanical means and with infected plant material (including seeds). For seedling blights, the main pathogen source is contaminated seed. Disease management includes fungicides as crop sprays or seed treatments, long crop rotations with non-hosts and planting of cereal varieties with reduced susceptibility. Use of certified clean seeds is essential.

New fungal strains are emerging worldwide, and continued breeding for new resistant varieties is needed to stay ahead of pathogen evolution. Re-emergence of some fusarium diseases thought to be driven mainly by changes to climate and agronomic practices has been reported from the UK (ProMED-mail post 20100726.2497). In Canada, the emergence of a new FHB strain with increased mycotoxin levels has been reported in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20091210.4211).
