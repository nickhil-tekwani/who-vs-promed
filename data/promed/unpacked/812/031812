A lamb and a heifer in the petting zoo at Kibbutz Neve Eitan, near
Beit She'an, tested positive Thursday [28 Apr 2011] for rabies,
according to a report from the health office in Afula. It's the 2nd
such case among lambs at the petting zoo in the last week.

The Health Ministry asks anyone who may have come in contact with the
animals or who has animals that may have come in contact with those
animals or strays in the area to contact the Afula health office or
their nearest health office as soon as possible.

[We are informed that the affected holding is not a "petting zoo" in
the sense of an establishment open to the public at large, but rather
a holding with hobby-animals belonging to the local community of
Kibbuts Neve Eitan. According to prevailing procedures and guidelines
of the Ministry of Health, suspected human contacts of the rabid
animals have been sought by means of an epidemiological investigation
performed by the District Health Office. About 20 contacts are
currently undergoing post-exposure prophylaxis by immunisation.

Since 1 Jan 2011, 19 lab-confirmed cases of rabies in animals, in 17
locations, all within Hazafon (North) province, have been reported in
Israel. They involved 5 dogs, 5 jackals, 2 badgers, 3 cattle, 2 sheep
and 2 horses. The number of rabid animals diagnosed during the same
period in 2010 was also 19, all, similarly, in the Northern province.

Israel's rabies situation has undergone a drastic change since 2004,
after decades of being sylvatic, the vectors being foxes, and
following the introduction of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of foxes.
This has been addressed earlier by ProMED-mail (see archived 20100224.0616, 20100830.3090 and other postings in the "see also"
section).

Implementing ORV in a single country within a rabies-stricken region
lacking efficient control systems is prone to difficulties. This was
predicted by experts during the 1990's, indicating also the vital need
for coordinated regional effort.

The issue has been recently reviewed in detail by Israeli scientists;
the review (see ref. 1), accompanied by statistics, maps and tables,
is freely accessible at
http://www.isrvma.org/UserFiles/vet_eng_lowRes.pdf.

The authors concluded:
1. The reservoir of rabies virus in wild animals was eliminated by
administration of the oral vaccine.
2. A new strain of rabies (V7), which originated from Turkey and of
which the dog is the reservoir, has penetrated into the north of
Israel from neighboring countries.
3. In spite of the large number of dogs infected with rabies over the
last 5 years, only one fox was found to be infected with the new dog
strain.
4. Dog rabies is of great concern to public health.
5. Control of stray dogs from the community is essential for
continued control of rabies, along with universal rabies vaccination
of dogs by owners.
