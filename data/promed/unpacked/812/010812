Origins of the New H1N1 Flu Virus
---------------------------------
By sequencing the genomes of more than 50 samples
of the new A (H1N1) influenza virus, researchers
have found that it is distantly related to its
nearest relatives, indicating that its genes have
been circulating undetected for an extended
period. The findings suggest that in the future
pig populations will need to be closely monitored
for emerging influenza viruses.

Rebecca Garten and colleagues sequenced the full
or partial genomes of 2009 A (H1N1) viruses
isolated in Mexico and the United States. They
determined the origins of the virus' 8 gene
segments and found that the combination of these
gene segments has not previously been reported
among swine or human influenza viruses. All of
the segments originated in avian hosts and then
began circulating in pigs at various times in
history, from 1918 through to 1998. 6 of the 8
segments originated from triple reassortant swine
viruses -- which include genetic material from
human, avian and swine viruses' as the result of
these virus' tendency to swap pieces of their
genomes with each other -- that have been
circulating in North America and Asia since
approximately 1998. The other 2 segments are
derived from Eurasian swine viruses.

The sequences for the gene segments did not
reveal the signatures of high transmissibility or
virulence that have been found in other influenza
A viruses, suggesting that other, yet-unknown
sequences are responsible for the new virus'
ability to replicate and spread in humans.

The researchers also took a closer look at the
new A (H1N1) virus's hemagglutinin protein, which
is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to
and infect its host cell. Test-tube experiments
that examined how ferret antibodies reacted
against this protein suggest that the new strain
has antigenic properties that are similar to
those of other swine A(H1N1) viruses but distinct
from seasonal human flu. Researchers will need to
continue to look for changes in the hemagglutinin
protein in the new virus, which may affect the
selection of vaccine candidates, the authors say.

Title
-----
Antigenic and Genetic Characteristics of
Swine-Origin 2009 A (H1N1) Influenza Viruses Circulating in Humans

Abstract
--------
Since its identification in April 2009 an A
(H1N1) virus containing a unique combination of
gene segments from both North American and
Eurasian swine lineages has continued to
circulate in humans. The lack of similarity
between the 2009 A (H1N1) virus and its nearest
relatives indicates that its gene segments have
been circulating undetected for an extended
period. Its low genetic diversity suggests the
introduction into humans was a single event or
multiple events of similar viruses. Molecular
markers predictive of adaptation to humans are
not currently present in 2009 A(H1N1) viruses,
suggesting previously unrecognized molecular
determinants could be responsible for the transmission among humans.

Current isolates of the novel 2009 H1N1 strain
are antigenically homogeneous, but distinct from
current strains of seasonal influenza virus.

Genetic study: Novel H1N1 likely originated in pigs
---------------------------------------------------
Officials from the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) today [22 May 2009] unveiled
the 1st comprehensive analysis of the novel H1N1
influenza virus, shedding some light on its
source, which appears to be pigs in an area where surveillance gaps exist.

The study of the antigenic and genetic
characteristics of the new flu virus appeared
today [Fri 22 May 2009] in an early online
edition of Science (see parts [1] and [2) above).
Nearly 60 researchers from across the globe
assisted with the study. They analyzed full and
partial genomes of 76 novel H1N1 samples, 17 from
Mexico and 59 from 12 US states.

Nancy Cox, MD, director of the CDC's influenza
division, told reporters at a CDC media briefing
today, "With any new pathogen, it's important to
understand the origin to stop reemergence." Each
of the 8 genetic components of the new virus most
closely resembles influenza viruses found in
pigs, which suggests novel H1N1likely originated
in pigs, she said, adding that researchers can't
tell if humans contracted the virus directly from
swine or if an intermediary host played a role.
"The study reinforces that swine are an important
reservoir," she said. "The result shows the
global need for more systematic surveillance in pigs."

Based on the current data, researchers don't have
a hypothesis on what an intermediary host could
have been for the new virus. "What we can say is
that the closest gene progenitors were
circulating in swine," Cox said. The researchers
reported that several scenarios exist for how and
where the reassortment event happened that
produced the novel H1N1 virus. However, they
wrote that divergence from previously sequenced
strains, suggested by long branch lengths on the
new virus's phylogenetic tree, indicates lack of
surveillance for a number of years in the
original novel flu host. The high degree of
genetic uniformity among the viral samples
analyzed so far suggests that cross-species
introduction to humans was a single event or
multiple events involving very similar viruses,
the group reported. Researchers still haven't
identified what factors are giving the new virus
the ability to replicate and transmit in humans
but have yet to find the adaptation or
transmissibility markers seen in other viruses
such as the 1918 H1N1 virus or H5N1.

During the analysis of the novel H1N1 samples,
the research group also characterized the
antigenic properties. Cox said they found that
the viruses were very homogenous, showing much
less variability, or drift, than seasonal
influenza viruses. "That makes our job in coming
up with a reference vaccine virus much easier," she said.

Cox said that influenza viruses in swine have
been shown to mutate at a slower rate, perhaps
because the animals don't live very long and
don't have many subsequent infections. However,
she warned that now that the virus is circulating
in humans, the virus might start mutating
similarly to seasonal influenza viruses.

Anne Schuchat, MD, interim deputy director of
CDC's science and public health program, said the
findings of the study underscore the need for
animal and human health experts to communicate
more closely and conduct joint investigations.
Cox said animal health officials in the United
States conduct some swine surveillance, but in
other parts of the world the activity is much
more limited. "That's where we see the greatest gaps," she said.

Marie Gramer, DVM, PhD, a swine flu expert at the
University of Minnesota, told CIDRAP News that
formal surveillance for swine influenza isn't
conducted due to a lack of coordinated funding
and effort. Gramer pointed to some tensions
between human and animal health communities that
some veterinary experts believe have been fanned
by steady messaging from the CDC and World Health
Organization that pigs and poultry are the source
of all pandemics, an impression she says has hurt
the animal agriculture industry. She said it
isn't realistic to expect the animal agriculture
industry, reeling from the financial effects of
influenza suspicions, to fund and research
surveillance for all of its animal health issues.
"Influenza viruses are shared between people and
animals," Gramer said. "Surveillance should be done jointly, not separately."

[These findings reinforce conclusions derived
from previous more limited analyses and confirm
that the recently emerged novel 2009 strain of
avian influenza A (H1N1) virus is not closely
related to previously isolated human A (H1N1)
influenza viruses, suggesting that its genes have
been circulating undetected for an extended
period. The relative genetic homogeneity of the
2009 strain isolates suggest that its appearance
in the human population can be traced to a unique
event, but the data do not yet shed much light on
its precise origin or any probable intermediate
hosts. Antigenically the 2009 viruses isolates
are homogeneous and distinct from currently
circulating seasonal H1N1 strains. This means
that a new H1N1 vaccine will be required to
control a developing pandemic. However, the
antigenic homogeneity of the isolates will
simplify the choice of a vaccine candidate and
the rapid development and deployment of an
appropriate new H1N1 vaccine. - Mod.CP]
