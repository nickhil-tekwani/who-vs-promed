Outbreak location 1: Neipu Township, Pingtung County, Chinese Taipei
Started: 23 Feb 2022
Ended: 11 Mar 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Crested serpent-eagle (_Spilornis cheela_): Accipitridae-Accipitriformes / 7 / 6 / 6 / 0 / 0 / 0
Harris's hawk (_Parabuteo unicinctus_ Accipitridae-Accipitriformes / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: 2 of the 7 rescued crested serpent-eagles died suddenly and unexpectedly at a wildlife conservation shelter (known as Pingtung Rescue Center) in Pingtung County on [23 Feb 2022]. Then 2 more died per day on the 24th and 26th. Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 subtype (clade 2.3.4.4b) was detected and confirmed on [4 Mar 2022]. All the eagles in the raptor shelter were screened for avian influenza virus, including one crested serpent-eagle, 2 _Nisaetus nipalensis_, one _Accipiter trivirgatus_, one _Falco tinnunculus_, one _Milvus migrans_, and one _Parabuteo unicinctus_. The _Parabuteo unicinctus_ resulted positive, the others eagles were negative. The infected _Parabuteo unicinctus_ has been actively treated by the Animal Rescue Team and is currently recovering well. The shelter area has been kept in quarantine and cleaned/disinfected thoroughly. No added infected cases were found in the neighboring region within a 3 km [approx.. 1.8 mi] radius. Note: The date of last occurrence for H5N2 was at the start of this event [9 Nov 2021].

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: screening
Wild control measures applied: Ante and post-mortem inspections, control of wildlife reservoirs, disinfection, screening, surveillance outside the restricted zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / Result

[The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. This is the case for birds of prey and scavengers, which are exposed to the virus mainly when feeding on other infected birds. - Mod.PMB
