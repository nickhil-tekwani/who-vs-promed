Anti-rabies vaccine claims its 1st victim
-----------------------------------------
[The 52 year-old woman], one of the 2 Delhi residents who had taken
ill after being administered an anti-rabies vaccine at the Charak
Palika Hospital, finally lost the battle for life, after remaining on
a life support system for 5 days at Safdarjung Hospital. She died on
Friday afternoon [23 Sep 2011]. Another victim, [a 45 year-old male]
is still battling for life at Max Hospital in Saket. The south campus
police, which had registered a case under Section 337 (causing hurt by
act endangering life or personal safety of others), on Saturday [24
Sep 2011] converted it to Section 304A (causing death by negligence).
A senior investigating officer said, they have requested the deputy
director (home), Delhi Government, for constituting a panel of doctors
to conduct [a] post mortem.

Confirming the death, Chhaya Sharma, deputy commissioner of police
(south) said about the further course of action, "We have converted
the case from Section 337 to 304A of the IPC [Indian Penal Code]. We
have also informed the medical association about the matter."

The family members of the deceased are in a state of shock and have
demanded action against people who are at fault. The NDMC [New Delhi
Municipal Council] has already ordered a probe into the matter and
their report is awaited.

[Unfortunately one of the 2 reported individuals with a severe
reaction (reported as anaphylactic in newswires) following receipt of
rabies vaccine in New Delhi, died. In another newswire, there was
mention that the patient died of "multiorgan failure" (see
http://www.indianexpress.com/news/patient-dies-after-rabies-vaccine-another-critical/851691/).

We are awaiting further information on the results of the
investigations into what transpired at the time of vaccination of the
2 individuals who were reported to have had anaphylactic reactions
after receiving the rabies vaccinations. To date, there is no
information on the investigations on the remaining vaccine in the vial
of vaccine used for their vaccinations. Serious reactions to rabies
vaccination are very rare.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information from
knowledgeable sources on the results of the pending investigations. -
