Health chiefs have issued an urgent warning to GPs and hospitals after the death of a 7th child from strep A, with parents also urged to be extra vigilant. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) sent what it termed an "urgent public health message" to doctors after the death of a 12-year-old London schoolboy, the 7th victim of the bug.

The boy, understood to be a Year 8 pupil at fee-paying Colfe's School in Lewisham, south-east London, is the 1st secondary school pupil to die in the current outbreak.

Meanwhile, [a four-year-old] from Bolton remains on a ventilator at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool after contracting the disease. Her dad said, "She is still in intensive care, but she is showing signs of improvement."

Generally, group A strep bacteria cause relatively minor illnesses, ranging from the skin condition impetigo, scarlet fever, and a sore throat. But in extreme instances, they can cause invasive group A streptococcal disease, which can prove fatal.

[A boy] of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, died last month [November 2022] after he developed strep A and subsequently suffered a cardiac arrest. [A 5-year-old] from County Down was diagnosed as suffering from strep A last month [November 2022]. Another 6-year-old girl, a pupil of Ashford Church of England Primary School in Surrey, is also believed to have died from the infection.

A UKHSA statement said there were 851 cases of group A strep reported last week, compared to an average of 186 for the preceding years, almost 4 times as many as would normally be expected. Dr Colin Brown, Deputy Director, UKHSA, said, "We are seeing a higher number of cases of group A strep this year than usual. The bacteria usually causes a mild infection, producing sore throats or scarlet fever that can be easily treated with antibiotics.

"In very rare circumstances, this bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious illness called invasive group A strep (iGAS). This is still uncommon; however, it is important that parents are on the look-out for symptoms and see a doctor as quickly as possible so that their child can be treated, and we can stop the infection from becoming serious. Make sure you talk to a health professional if your child is showing signs of deteriorating after a bout of scarlet fever, a sore throat, or a respiratory infection."

"In most cases it will be a mild case of strep, but it is highly infectious, which is why I think the important message to get across this morning is parents should look out for the symptoms, so fever, headache, skin rash."

The UKSA is urging anyone who suspects their child has scarlet fever to contact NHS 111 or their GP, because early treatment of scarlet fever with antibiotics is important to reduce the risk of such complications as pneumonia or a bloodstream infection. Youngsters with scarlet fever should be kept at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to prevent spreading the infection to others.

[For a discussion of group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, please see my moderator comments in ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A - UK: (England) invasive, children, fatal 20221126.8706918 and Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - UK: (England) seasonal increased cases 20220424.8702816.

The M surface protein is the major somatic virulence factor of GAS, which have been divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html). The news report does not specify the M (emm) protein type that is involved in the current outbreak in the UK; however, upper respiratory GAS isolates having a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) increased significantly in England over the time period of 2014 to 2016, so that by 2016 it represented 84% of all emm1 strains isolated (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/). The new strain's emergence coincided with a rise invasive GAS infections in the UK. The invasive GAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous version of emm type 1 isolates.

More information on this outbreak in the UK would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
