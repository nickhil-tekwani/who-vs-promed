Wild poliovirus type 1 -- Islamic Republic of Iran, 24 May 2019
------------------------------
On 9 May 2019, the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) notified WHO of the detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from an environmental sewage sample collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Konarak district, Sistan-Baluchistan province, Islamic Republic of Iran. The virus was detected in an environmental sample only, and to date, no associated cases of paralysis have been detected.

The subsequent scheduled sewage sample collected from the same site on 4 May 2019 (2 weeks after the positive sample) tested negative for poliovirus.

The affected province borders both Baluchistan province in Pakistan and part of Southern Region in Afghanistan. Genetic sequencing confirmed that the virus isolated is most closely linked to WPV1 currently circulating in Karachi region (Sindh province) in Pakistan.

The last laboratory-confirmed indigenous wild polio case from the Islamic Republic of Iran was reported in 1997. From 1998 to 2000, cases of wild poliovirus were imported from Pakistan and Afghanistan. No polio cases have been confirmed since 2001. Routine immunization against polio has been mandatory since 1984. Highly organized and well-implemented national immunization days were held during the period from 1994 to 1998. Since 1999, supplementary immunization activities in high-risk areas and populations, including the province of Sistan-Baluchistan, are conducted annually.

Public health response
-----------------------
The Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. The findings reconfirmed that immunization and surveillance systems in the Islamic Republic of Iran are strong.

WHO risk assessment
----------------------
WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV-1 from the Islamic Republic of Iran to be low. The risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage for OPV3 (3 doses of oral polio vaccine), estimated at 99%, and strong disease surveillance.

However, this event reinforces the importance of implementing the Temporary Recommendations of the International Health Regulations (IHR) committee regarding the international spread of poliovirus by the Member States infected with WPV1, which include Afghanistan and Pakistan.

WHO advice
------------
Polio is a highly infectious disease and can cause permanent paralysis or death. The poliovirus can spread easily and over large distances. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travellers and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas should be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

The 20th meeting of the Emergency Committee under IHR regarding the international spread of poliovirus, held in February 2019, concluded that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months.

To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, States infected with WPV1, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) with potential risk of international spread, and states infected with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) with potential risk of international spread should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.

[Again the takeaway message from this is the continuing threat of re-seeding other countries with the WPV1 as long as it continues in circulation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Fortunately, vaccination coverages are high in Iran.

Summary
----------
- What is already known about this topic?
Wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission has not been interrupted in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Rare circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks can occur in areas with low oral poliovirus vaccination coverage.

- What is added by this report?
No WPV cases have been detected in Nigeria since 2016. WPV transmission has continued in Afghanistan and Pakistan in all previously identified reservoirs. The number and extent of cVDPV outbreaks increased in 2018. Countries with endemic polio have revised emergency action plans to innovate and intensify strategies to reach and vaccinate every child in underimmunized populations.

- What are the implications for public health practice?
Successful implementation of locally relevant strategies in all areas will be essential to interrupting WPV transmission.

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) began in 1988, transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) has been interrupted in all countries except Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. WPV type 2 (WPV2) was declared eradicated in 2015; WPV type 3 has not been detected since 2012 (1). After the certification of the eradication of WPV2, a global switch from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV, containing vaccine virus types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV, containing types 1 and 3) was completed in April 2016. Nigeria last reported WPV type 1 (WPV1) cases in 2016. This report describes global progress toward poliomyelitis eradication during [1 Jan 2017-31 Mar 2019], and updates previous reports (1, 2). Afghanistan and Pakistan reported their lowest annual number of WPV cases (n = 22) in 2017; however, 33 WPV1 cases were reported in 2018. During January-March 2019 (as of [3 May 2019]), 12 WPV1 cases had been reported worldwide, 4 more than the 8 reported during the corresponding period in 2018. The occurrence of polio cases caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) is rare and occurs where oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) coverage has been low and vaccine virus reverts to neurovirulence (3). A total of 8 countries (Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], Indonesia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, and Syria) reported 210 cVDPV cases during 2017-2019 (as of [3 May 2019]). Reaching children during supplemental immunization activities (SIAs), accessing mobile populations at high risk, and variations in surveillance performance represent ongoing challenges. Innovative efforts to vaccinate every child and strengthen coordination efforts between Afghanistan and Pakistan will help achieve eradication. For cVDPV outbreak responses to promptly stop transmission, intensified programmatic improvements are needed to make the responses more effective and limit the risk for generating future outbreaks.

Poliovirus vaccination
------------------------
Estimated global coverage with 3 doses of poliovirus vaccines (Pol3, mostly OPV) through routine immunization services among infants aged [greater than] 1 year was 88% in 2017 (the most recent year for which data are available).* However, national coverage estimates often mask low coverage and poor SIA quality in a substantial number of subnational areas. In the countries with endemic WPV transmission, estimated national Pol3 coverage in 2017 was 60% in Afghanistan, 40% in Nigeria, and 75% in Pakistan (4-6).

In 2017, a total of 172 SIAs were conducted in 5 World Health Organization (WHO) regions, during which nearly 1.8 billion total OPV and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) doses were allocated for use; 161 SIAs were conducted in 2018, with approximately 1.7 billion bOPV and IPV doses. Inaccessible areas and the inability to reach all children in fully accessible areas continue to pose barriers to achieving higher coverage.

Since the global withdrawal of all type 2-containing OPV vaccines, countries experiencing confirmed cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks have requested authorization from the WHO Director-General to release monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) vaccine for use. In 2017, 59 million mOPV2 doses (3.2% of total OPV) were used for outbreak response; 107 million mOPV2 doses (6.5%) were used in 2018.

Poliovirus surveillance
-------------------------
The primary means for detecting WPV and cVDPV transmission is through surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children aged [less than] 15 years, with laboratory testing of stool specimens by WHO-accredited laboratories within the Global Polio Laboratory Network (7, 8). The performance of AFP surveillance is assessed through 2 principal indicators. The 1st indicator is achieving an annual nonpolio AFP detection rate of [greater than or equal to] 1 case per 100 000 population aged [less than] 15 years in countries in the WHO regions certified as polio-free, or [greater than or equal to] 2 in all other countries; this rate is considered sufficiently sensitive to detect a case of polio. The 2nd indicator is the collection of adequate stool specimens (i.e., 2 stool specimens collected [greater than] 24 hours apart, within 14 days of paralysis onset, with arrival at the laboratory in good condition [cool and without leakage or desiccation]) from [greater than or equal to] 80% of reported AFP patients.

Among countries reporting WPV or cVDPV cases in 2017, Afghanistan and Pakistan met both surveillance performance indicators nationally; DRC and Syria did not. Among the 9 countries reporting WPV or cVDPV cases in 2018, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Somalia met both surveillance performance indicators nationally; DRC and Papua New Guinea did not. Even when performance indicators are met nationally, surveillance gaps at the subnational level pose an impediment to reliable surveillance data that are necessary to ascertain the absence of poliovirus transmission. In many countries at high risk, AFP surveillance is supplemented by environmental surveillance (the testing of sewage samples).

Poliovirus cases and isolations
-----------------------------------
Countries reporting WPV cases and isolations: In 2017, 22 WPV1 cases were reported, including 14 (64%) in Afghanistan and 8 (36%) in Pakistan. In 2018, 33 WPV1 cases were detected, including 21 (64%) in Afghanistan and 12 (36%) in Pakistan. No WPV cases have been identified in countries other than Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan since 2015; Nigeria last reported WPV1 cases in September 2016. During [1 Jan 2019-31 Mar 2019], 12 WPV1 cases were confirmed; 6 were detected in Afghanistan and 6 in Pakistan ([see Figure, showing number of cases of wild poliovirus, by country and month of onset -- worldwide, January 2016-March 2019**, at source URL]).

Afghanistan reported 21 WPV1 cases in 14 districts in 2018, representing a 50% increase over the 14 cases reported in 2017 and a 55% increase in the number of affected districts. During January-March 2019, 6 WPV1 cases were detected: 1 in each of 2 districts of Kandahar Province, 2 districts of Helmand Province, and 2 districts of Uruzgan Province, compared with a total of 7 WPV1 cases reported in 5 districts of 3 provinces (Kandahar, Kunar, and Nangarhar) during the same period in 2018.

Pakistan confirmed 12 WPV1 cases in 6 districts in 2018, a 50% increase over the 8 cases reported in 2017 and a 14% decrease from the 7 districts that confirmed cases in 2017. During January-March 2019, 6 WPV1 cases were detected: 1 in each of 6 districts located in 3 provinces (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh), compared with only 1 case in Balochistan Province during the corresponding period in 2018.

Environmental surveillance is accounting for an increasing proportion of poliovirus detections worldwide. In Afghanistan, WPV1 was detected in 42 (13%) of 316 sewage samples collected at regular intervals in 2017 and 83 (24%) of 339 samples in 2018. In Pakistan, WPV1 was detected in 107 (17%) of 630 samples in 2017 and 141 (21%) of 677 samples in 2018 ([see Table 1, showing number of samples containing wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) detected through environmental surveillance -- Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan, 1 Jan 2017-31 Mar 2019**, at source URL]). Genomic sequencing of poliovirus isolates from both environmental samples and confirmed AFP cases indicates multiple chains of transmission; 5 genetic clusters (groups of isolates sharing [95% or more] of genetic relatedness) persisted during the reporting period in the core reservoirs along shared transnational population movement corridors between Afghanistan and Pakistan (4, 5).

Countries reporting cVDPV cases and isolations: During January 2017-March 2019, cVDPV transmission was confirmed in 9 countries. Also, 2 countries (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea) reported separate cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) circulation, with 27 AFP cases and 7 positive environmental samples. A total of 7 countries (DRC, Kenya, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, and Syria) detected 9 emergences of cVDPV2 with isolates from 176 AFP cases and 97 environmental samples. Nigeria reported no cVDPV isolates in 2017; however, in 2018, 2 cVDPV2 outbreaks were confirmed. One, centered in Sokoto, was detected through environmental surveillance; the other was initially detected in Jigawa State with subsequent detections in 6 other states and bordering Niger. An additional outbreak detected through environmental surveillance was confirmed in Bauchi State in March 2019. During 2018-2019 to date, 41 cVDPV2 cases have been detected in Nigeria and 10 in Niger. Since 2017, 5 independent cVDPV2 outbreaks, with 43 cases, have been reported in DRC. cVDPV2 transmission was detected from 5 AFP patients and 3 environmental surveillance sites in Somalia, and a genetically linked isolate was detected from an environmental surveillance site in Nairobi, Kenya. cVDPV type 3 transmission involving 6 AFP patients*** and 11 environmental samples was detected in Somalia ([see Table 2, showing number of poliovirus cases, by country -- worldwide, 1 Jan 2017-31 Mar 2019** available at source URL]) (9).

Discussion
------------
No WPV1 cases have been detected in the WHO Africa Region in approximately 30 months. Continuing improvements in vaccinating children and surveillance in northeast Nigeria and other Lake Chad Basin countries suggest that WPV transmission might have been interrupted in the Africa Region. Additional analyses to assess surveillance sensitivity are needed to allow the Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication to certify interruption.

For the 1st time since 2014, the number of annual WPV case reports in Afghanistan and Pakistan rose in 2018, in spite of targeted efforts to increase immunization in security-compromised districts, reduce vaccine refusal, and reach highly mobile populations. Genomic sequence analysis of isolates from AFP patients and environmental samples demonstrates not only persistent local transmission in reservoirs in both countries, but also ongoing transmission along 2 common corridors because of transnational population movements (4, 5). Efforts are underway to enhance continuous immunization at border points in both countries. A ban on house-to-house vaccination in Kandahar Province since mid-2018 has negatively affected SIA effectiveness, and both countries' programs continue to miss vaccinating a substantial number of eligible children in areas accessible to vaccinators. A need exists to comprehensively address local weaknesses in SIA implementation to increase population immunity and interrupt transmission.

Genetic characterization of the index isolates in nearly all cVDPV outbreaks suggested transmission for many years, indicating imprecise AFP surveillance systems. Indonesia and Papua New Guinea had last reported polio cases more than a decade ago; in both countries, there has been low routine immunization coverage before the emergence and spread of independent cVDPV1 (10). The multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks in DRC and Nigeria reflect the risk for cVDPV2 transmission where the number of SIAs had been insufficient or the quality of SIAs had been inadequate to increase type 2 immunity before the 2016 global switch from tOPV to bOPV (9). The SIAs in response to many of the cVDPV2 outbreaks have not been sufficiently timely or of sufficiently high quality to promptly interrupt transmission or to prevent the seeding of additional cVDPV emergences.

The persistence of WPV transmission and the number of cVDPV outbreaks underscore the need for country programs to more adequately assess and address the challenges to vaccinating all children. GPEI program goals for interruption of poliovirus transmission have been refocused through the development of the Polio Endgame Strategy 2019-2023.**** Adopting locally relevant, innovative approaches will increase effective implementation of the core strategies. In Afghanistan, goals include overcoming inaccessibility by renegotiating access to communities and engaging with local and religious leaders until house-to-house vaccination is reinstated. In Pakistan, increasing SIA quality will be addressed by more effectively engaging with communities to reduce the number of OPV refusals and to increase demand for immunization services, while also focusing on underperforming local areas. Unfortunately, rumors about the safety of OPV severely decreased the effectiveness of a recent SIA in Pakistan. A reassessment of risk communication and community engagement is ongoing, and a revised approach will be implemented in the most affected districts starting with the SIAs in June [2019].

Periodic annual increases in the number of polio cases in the past have always been followed by a recommitment to interventions that work and innovative activities to access underimmunized populations. This commitment has enabled GPEI to reduce the number of countries with endemic poliovirus transmission to 3 since 2012 and the number of WPV cases to fewer than 100 every year since 2015. The critical objective is to reduce the number of areas with active transmission in Afghanistan and Pakistan simultaneously or within a short period. Revised emergency action plans for each country provide the roadmaps to further intensify and improve program operations and will need to be fully implemented in every locality to ensure the successful eradication of polio.

[As we've seen in recent months, transmission of the WPV1 in Pakistan has increased from previous years. What is also alluded to above but not gone into in depth is the increasing vaccine refusal that is occurring in Pakistan in areas that had previously accepted vaccine, and the impact of social media with dissemination of the anti-vaccination messages.

While things are looking positive for possible interruption of WPV1 transmission in Africa, caution needs to be exerted here, as there was a 5-year hiatus of no WPV cases reported in Nigeria followed by a few cases being identified in northern Nigeria.

With respect to cVDPVs, the past few years have shown significant increases in cases (albeit 2019 seems to have decreased identification of cVDPVs. Will this decrease trend continue or will we learn about more outbreaks as the year progresses? Campaign fatigue may have set in, in many countries where routine vaccinations are suboptimal and coverage during campaigns has dropped as well. An obvious concern is the use of the mOPV2 in locations where there are cVDPV2 outbreaks, which may create a revolving door for repeated cVDPV2 outbreaks if vaccination coverages drop to suboptimal levels after the response campaigns.
