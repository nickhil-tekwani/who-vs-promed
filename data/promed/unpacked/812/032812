1st report of cassava mosaic disease and cassava mosaic geminiviruses in Gabon

Cassava mosaic disease (CMD), arguably Africa's greatest plant protection
problem, has occurred in Central/West Africa for more than 70 years. There
is, however, no published record of the occurrence of CMD or cassava mosaic
geminiviruses (CMS) that cause it from the central African country of Gabon.
However, the severe Uganda variant of East African cassava mosaic virus
(EACMV-UG), associated with the African CMD pandemic, has been recorded
from the Republic of Congo (Neuenschwander et al., 2002), bordering Gabon
to the west.
Cassava fields were examined at 55 sites throughout Gabon in April and July
2003, in order to identify the CMGs associated with CMD and to determine
whether the pandemic-associated EACMV-UG was present. At each site, 30
plants were examined and assessments made of CMD incidence, symptom
severity, and the abundance of the whitefly vector, _Bemisia tabaci_
(Genn.). At least 2 virus-diseased leaf samples were collected from each
field for subsequent virus diagnosis.
DNA was extracted from these samples on the day of collection (Dellaporta
et al. 1983). Virus diagnoses were subsequently made from DNA samples using
both specific primer PCR (Zhou et al., 1997) and RFLP analysis involving
restriction digestion by EcoRV and MluI of near full-length DNA-A fragments
amplified using abutting primer PCR with universal geminivirus primers
(Briddon & Markham, 1994).
ACMV was the most widely distributed CMG species, occurring at 53 of 55
sites. EACMV was identified from one site south of Tchibanga in southern
Gabon. EACMV-UG was detected in samples collected from 12 sites, all from
the eastern Provinces of Haute-Ogooue and Ogoou-Ivindo. Of the 17 samples
infected with EACMV-UG, 16 were mixed infections with ACMV. Symptom
severity of plants infected by EACMV-UG (4.1) was significantly greater
(chi square = 44.4, df = 3, P < 0.001) than those infected by ACMV alone (2.8).
Moreover, 4 of the 5 virus-sampled plants having current season
whitefly-borne CMD were dual ACMV+EACMV-UG infections.
These data comprise the first published record of CMGs in Gabon. The
results also describe an early stage of spread of the EACMV-UG associated
CMD pandemic into eastern Gabon, which now represents the pandemic's
westernmost front.

[The occurrence of CMD in Gabon was not unexpected. ACMV, but not EACMV-UG,
is present in the middle of the country, representing about half of the
area of the country. Severe CMD (ACMV and EACMV-UG) is present in the
southeast corner of Gabon. In east/central Gabon, ACMV predominates but
EACMV-UG is frequently detected. It is interesting to note that mixed
infections involving EACMV-UG and ACMV predominate, and this is associated
with increased severity of CMD. Based on previous experience, the presumed
direction of spread of the CMD pandemic associated with EACMV-UG is toward
the northwest, in the direction of Equilateral Guinea. Effective disease
management utilizes CMD-free planting stock and CMD-resistant cultivars.
