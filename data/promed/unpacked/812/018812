CDC has posted revised malaria prophylaxis recommendations for the
Dominican Republic on its travelers health webpage
www.cdc.gov/travel
This is the text of the notice:
CDC [previously recommended malaria prophylaxis for travelers to rural
areas in the Dominican Republic but not for travel to resorts.
There has been a recent observed increase in malaria cases in the Dominican
Republic, including a localized outbreak in the Altagracia Province
(principally in the Bavaro Beach area) in the southeastern part of the
country, which has included some cases in tourists who have stayed in
resorts in this area. The risk to tourists appears to be quite low, but as a
precautionary measure we are expanding our recommendations to include
chloroquine prophylaxis for travelers to resorts in the Altagracia Province,
particularly those that travel to the Bavaro Beach area.
The Ministry of Health in the Dominican Republic has implemented malaria
control measures including intensified surveillance, prompt case management,
and intensive mosquito control activities in response to the increase in
malaria activity in the province. CDC will continue to monitor the situation
and provide updates on these recommendations.
