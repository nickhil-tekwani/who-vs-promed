The Taiwan Department of Health (DOH) on 21 Jul 2011 reported its 1st
imported case of tularemia since 2007.

The patient, a 67 year old United States citizen from San Francisco,
California, showed symptoms of fever before flying to Taiwan on 26 Jun
2011. The man was confirmed to have the disease on Mon 18 Jul 2011,
after being admitted to a Taipei hospital for fever, pneumonia, and a
build-up of fluid in his lungs, Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
deputy director Shih Wen-yi said in a press release. However, he was
expected to be released from the hospital soon.

Tularemia is a zoonotic disease, meaning it is transmitted from
animals to humans and cannot be transmitted from human to human. The
disease is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, which is
found in various types of fowl, fish, rodents, and mammals, which can
be spread through bites, inhalation, or direct contact.

[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case,
tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent and the pneumonic form is
likely to be the one associated with intentional spread. The
circumstances of exposure in this case are not stated.

Tularemia is caused by _F. tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram
negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of
animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents
(muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood
rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States an outbreak
involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.

_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and
vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental
conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as,
_Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may
represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.

Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental
exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with
infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion
of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective
aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog
as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are
several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected
domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms
needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal
illness, but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical
incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.

The clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of
exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause
pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in
ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is
usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized
body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat.
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills,
progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize
the continuing illness. - Mod.LL]
