An outbreak of avian influenza is suspected on a turkey farm in Ostfold after routine surveillance detected antibodies. No clinical symptoms have been detected, however.

Laboratory tests conducted by the Veterinary Institute over the weekend have been, so far, unable to confirm the active infection of influenza in the turkey flock where the antibodies were detected. There is, therefore, a need for new samples and new analysis.

[Confirmation or otherwise is requested.

According to Norway's annual OIE report for 2015, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has never been reported in Norway. General and targeted surveillance is applied. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in poultry was last reported in June 2009.

According to OIE's WAHID archive, an immediate notification, reporting sub-clinical LPAI in a non-commercial flock with 39 hens and 11 geese, was submitted on 5 Dec 2008; one bird was found PCR positive, all 50 destroyed. The event was declared resolved on 29 Dec 2008 (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_imm_0000007587_20081205_183638.pdf). General and targeted surveillance is applied. - Mod.AS
