Health officials in Mobile say there's been an alarming recent rise in the number of whooping cough cases in the area. Whooping cough, the common name for pertussis, is highly contagious. Those infected experience uncontrollable violent coughing that can make it hard to breathe.

Local media reports say the Mobile County Health Department has recorded 18 cases, 10 of which have been confirmed, between 25 May 2014 and 11 Jun 2014. Multiple other possible cases were being investigated. There were just 8 confirmed and probable cases in the county in 2013.

The number of whooping cough cases in California is now at an epidemic level, state health officials said Fri 13 Jun 2014. More than 800 whooping cough cases were reported over the past 2 weeks, suggesting that the infection, which is also known as pertussis, is spreading rapidly, according to a statement by the California Department of Public Health.

As of 10 Jun 2014, there were 3458 reported cases -- more than in all of 2013. There have been 2 reported infant deaths.

The infection is cyclical and peaks every 3 to 5 years, officials said. The previous whooping cough peak was in 2010, when an epidemic struck 9159 people and killed 10 infants in the state. Infants are most susceptible to the disease so parents are encouraged to vaccinate their children as early as possible. Pregnant women are also encouraged to get vaccinated.

The disease has also raised national concerns. Although California is the only state to declare an epidemic, there has been a 24 percent increase of reported pertussis cases nationally from this time in 2013, according to the CDC.

The outbreak of pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough, started in April 2014 with 2 confirmed cases involving Bellefontaine Elementary School students. During May 2014, the district's number of confirmed pertussis cases jumped to 10. "At first, they were in one part of Bellefontaine City Schools, and now it has spread to different grades," Hoddinott said.

The school system sent out a letter and texts to parents alerting them about the outbreak. Hoddinott said it is not unusual for Bellefontaine to see 10 confirmed cases in a year, but the concern came because they were all so closely related. "There are probably more cases that have not been diagnosed, but those (10 confirmed cases) are the ones who are sickest and have gone through a doctor and were tested," he said.

Phone calls to Champaign Health District officials for an update were not returned.

[Issues remain regarding the efficacy of protection of the acellular vaccine. A manuscript in PNAS evaluated this in a nonhuman model: Warfel JM, Zimmerman LI, Merkel TJ: Acellular pertussis vaccines protect against disease but fail to prevent infection and transmission in a nonhuman primate model. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2013; 111(2): 787-92.

"Significance
-------------
Pertussis has reemerged as an important public health concern since current acellular pertussis vaccines (aP) replaced older whole-cell vaccines (wP). In this study, we show nonhuman primates vaccinated with aP were protected from severe symptoms but not infection and readily transmitted _Bordetella pertussis_ to contacts. Vaccination with wP and previous infection induced a more rapid clearance compared with naive and aP-vaccinated animals. While all groups possessed robust antibody responses, key differences in T-cell memory suggest that aP vaccination induces a suboptimal immune response that is unable to prevent infection. These data provide a plausible explanation for pertussis resurgence and suggest that attaining herd immunity will require the development of improved vaccination strategies that prevent _B. pertussis_ colonization and transmission.

Abstract
--------
Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the bacterial pathogen _Bordetella pertussis_. Pertussis rates in the United States have been rising and reached a 50-year high of 42 000 cases in 2012. Although pertussis resurgence is not completely understood, we hypothesize that current acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines fail to prevent colonization and transmission. To test our hypothesis, infant baboons were vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with aP or whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines and challenged with _B. pertussis_ at 7 months. Infection was followed by quantifying colonization in nasopharyngeal washes and monitoring leukocytosis and symptoms. Baboons vaccinated with aP were protected from severe pertussis-associated symptoms but not from colonization, did not clear the infection faster than naive animals, and readily transmitted _B. pertussis_ to unvaccinated contacts. Vaccination with wP induced a more rapid clearance compared with naive and aP-vaccinated animals. By comparison, previously infected animals were not colonized upon secondary infection. Although all vaccinated and previously infected animals had robust serum antibody responses, we found key differences in T-cell immunity. Previously infected animals and wP-vaccinated animals possess strong _B. pertussis_- specific T helper 17 (Th17) memory and Th1 memory, whereas aP vaccination induced a Th1/Th2 response instead. The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines."

More evidence continues to accumulate regarding issues revolving around the protective efficacy of the current acellular pertussis vaccines and the need for an improvement in the current product. - Mod.LL]
