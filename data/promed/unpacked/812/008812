[The number of reported infections from chikungunya virus in Ahmedabad has increased from 39 as of July 2013 to the 350 cases reported above. Chikungunya virus is endemic in India and causes sporadic outbreaks in various parts of the country. Not surprisingly, Ahmedabad is having a mixed outbreak of chikungunya and dengue virus infections since both viruses are transmitted by the same vector mosquito. If the chikungunya virus vector mosquitoes, _Aedes aegypti_, are relatively abundant as is likely, the occurrence of additional cases can be expected unless the vector control efforts are effective. Although the fatality rate is low to nil, morbidity can be high with persistent arthralgia that can last weeks to months. There is no commercially available chikungunya virus vaccine.
