NOROVIRUS, NEW STRAINS - USA, EUROPE

New norovirus strains
--------------------
We would like to clarify and expand on the newspaper article posted
on ProMED describing the circulation of a new norovirus strain in the
USA [see ProMED-mail post archived as: Norovirus - USA (multistate):
new strain 20070310.0849].
The new strain (GII.4 Minerva) referred to in this posting has been
identified in 60 per cent of the outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis
between Oct and Dec 2006 in the USA. The remaining 40 per cent were
attributed to other GII.4 strains.
Europe has also experienced an increased frequency of norovirus
outbreaks this [northern] winter, with two new GGII.4 variants, named
GGII.4 2006(a) and II.4 2006 (b), which were responsible for 85 per
cent of all outbreaks from 1 Jul 2006 until now (see: Norovirus,
increased activity - Europe 20061214.35220; for graphs and tables see
Eurosurveillance weekly release, volume 11, issue 12, 14 Dec 2006
< http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2006/061214.asp#1>).
Comparison of partial genomic sequences of US and European strains
suggests that the GII.4 strains circulating in the US (Minerva)
belong to the same new variant lineage as that identified in Europe
[GII.4 2006 (b) variant]. Work is ongoing to clarify the relationship
between the US and European emergent norovirus variants in greater detail.
GII.4 noroviruses have predominated globally in the last 10 years,
and several variants have emerged in different parts of the world.
However, it remains unclear why these variants are more successful,
and which sequence changes are most significant.
This complicates definition of a new norovirus strain or
variant. Harmonization of methods for identifying new emergent
strains, and rapid communication, will help to better understand the
evolution and potential differences in virulence associated with the
spread of new variant viruses.
Norovirus activity in Europe is monitored through the FBVE network
(the foodborne viruses in Europe network, website:
< http://www.eufoodborneviruses.co.uk/DIVINEVENT/DIVIndex.asp>) which
is a cooperation of epidemiologists and virologists in 13 countries
who report outbreaks to a central database on the web. From a
significant part of the outbreaks, sequence and typing information is
available besides epidemiological information. A reference sequence
of two parts of the genome (region A and region C) of the 2 new
European variants is available via an open access strain matching
system <http://www.rivm.nl/bnwww>). This was launched by the FBVE
network to allow harmonized sequence comparisons worldwide for
commonly used genome regions, and to stimulate the use of the same
strain designation
Similarly, the CDC are working to launch a norovirus sequence network
(CaliciNet) using the PulseNet platform for State Health
epidemiologists and virologists. Requests for strain comparison can be sent to
- <fbve@rivm.nl> for European researchers and to
- <CaliciNet@cdc.gov> for North American researchers.
