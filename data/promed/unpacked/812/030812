Banana Disease Sends Shock Waves in Mukono
------------------------------------------
[A mysterious disease which appeared in October 2001... is threatening
banana crops in Bulyanti Village, Mukuno District [of Uganda. ... The
disease is spreading like a bushfire, leaving destruction in its wake. The
green banana plants that once dominated the countryside have vanished. ...
Bulyanti is the major banana growing area in Nakifuma county. The rampaging
disease threatens the livelihood of the peasants and consequently their
food supply.
Dr. Tushemereirwe, Programme Leader, National Banana Research Programme in
Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute (NARO) says, the disease has
affected 50 farmers.
"I visited 10 plantations, in Ntunda sub-county, Bulyanti village. A
meeting was held between farmers and researchers. And during the meeting,
50 farmers said their plants were affected by the bacterial wilt,"
Tushemereirwe said. The disease has not been reported in Uganda before, he
observed. When one plant in the garden is infected, all the other plants
are affected. The disease spreads rapidly and can be carried from place to
place in planting material.
Samples of diseased tissues were sent to CABI, Bioscience, United Kingdom
for further isolation and identification of the organisms. [Preliminary
results indicate that the bacterium _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv.
_musacearum_, [is the most likely cause, [but further testing is ...
required [to confirm its identity. This bacteri[um is known to cause wilt
of Ensente (a relative of bananas) in Ethiopia, and it is possible that the
[same bacterium is responsible for [the disease in Uganda.
The symptoms [include ...yellowing, wilting, and premature ripening in
young plants. If the fingers of the matooke are cut, a pink purple
coloration confirms the presence of the disease. Sometimes, the symptoms
fail to show up but the pink purple coloration in the fingers, [a sign of
wilt, is always ... seen.
The disease affects both highland and exotic (dessert/ beer) bananas. The
former were the dominant types and therefore most affected. ... Rain
droplets fall on an infected plant, the bacteria ooze out and spread in the
droplet [and ... wind blows the droplets to other plants [where the
infection takes place.
Kyambadde Kyeyune, [coordinator of ... the banana programme at the
Agricultural Research Development Centre in Mukono, points out that, "The
disease is dangerous but it is difficult to control its spread because the
farmers must be compensated before the affected crops are destroyed. The
disease endangers all banana growing areas in Uganda."
"The danger of this disease spreading significantly across the country is
very high if measures to contain it are not immediately and effectively
administered," warns Tushemereirwe. He observed that local quarantine
measures might have to be considered if these precautions are not taken.

[The apparent pathogen causing disease in banana is a bacterium. Neither
disease appears similar to black sigatoka or Panama disease, both of which
are caused by fungi which cause severe disease in other parts of the world.
Another banana wilt disease has been reported recently in Mukuno, but no
pathogen has been definitively implicated. I have asked for more
information from the plant pathologists who are investigating the second
case, and I hope to provide a second report. - Mod.DH
