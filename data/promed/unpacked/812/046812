Tests have confirmed that 4 patients have chikungunya and 2 dengue in
Budge Budge and Bishnupur II blocks of South 24-Parganas. The 6 are
from Moukhali village in South Bishnupur.

Numerous others from the village show symptoms of these diseases with
complaints of high fever, body and joint pain, vomiting, and rashes
on their bodies. Though official figures put the number of ailing at
250-300, local leaders claimed at least 2500-3000 were suffering.

The district's chief medical officer health (CMOH) Sachidananda
Sarkar said, "More than 100 people have been admitted to the local
Muchisa Hospital in Nodakhali." Others are admitted to nearby
hospitals and to the only nursing home in the area. Hospitals are
forced to turn away patients for the lack of beds.

The authorities have set up 3 medical camps in the 2 blocks. Sarkar
said the number of medical camps will be increased and more medical
teams spread out in the villages and make door-to-door visits from
Wednesday [15 Oct 2008]. "We are monitoring the situation and will
take all necessary steps to tackle it," said Sarkar.

[This confirms that both dengue and chikungunya viruses are
circulating in the same locality, and not far distant where a recent
chikungunya outbreak was reported on 1 Oct 2008 (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20081002.3112) in the district to the immediate east. The
6 cases (4 of chikungunya virus infection and 2 of dengue virus
infection) appear to be the very small tip of a large iceberg.

Differentiating dengue cases from chikungunya cases will not be
easily accomplished without laboratory support. Measures to control
virus transmission for both viruses are the same -- reduction of
populations of the vector _Aedes_ mosquito with emphasis on
elimination of water catchments that serve as breeding sites in
houses and other buildings.
