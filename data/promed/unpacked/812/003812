[One does not expect to see anthrax cases in the winter months unless they result from contaminated animal feed or hay. The nature of this case, whether cutaneous or gastroenteric, is not defined. But the medical authorities are not inexperienced with this disease so I think we can presume that UY is under proper medical care.

Batken forms the southern boundary of the Fergana valley of Uzbekistan, which is an area of chronic livestock outbreaks of anthrax. While Uzbekistan fails to report either human or livestock cases, they are routinely diagnosed in the surrounding Kyrgyz provinces. Unfortunately, these provinces are a long way from Bishkek and, therefore, do not get the oversight they need to have annual vaccination of their livestock. This would cost-effectively and cheaply prevent both livestock outbreaks and human cases.
