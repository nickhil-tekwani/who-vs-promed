Although _B. cereus_ is an increasingly recognized pathogen in
endopthalmitis due to penetrating trauma and in hematogenous endopthalmitis
in IV drug users it is a quite rare cause of postoperative endopthalmitis.
It seems to me that this outbreak likely involves a common source. The
large number of cases and the temporal clustering suggest a contaminated
common source rather then a general lapse in aseptic technique or an
environmental source. In their 1996 review of post cataract surgical
endopthalmitis Han et al. found only 1 case due to _B. cereus_ from 420
patients with post operative endopthalmitis. I would search for a
contaminated solution of irrigating fluid, an instrument valve which is
colonized or perhaps a malfunction in the autoclave. An additional source
to be considered would be contaminated implants or lenses.
