Qatar announces 3rd MERS-CoV death
----------------------------------
An expatriate living in Qatar has died after he contracted MERS-CoV, bringing to 3 the number of deaths from the coronavirus in the Gulf state, health authorities said on Tuesday [19 Nov 2013].

The 61 year old man had also suffered from "chronic illnesses", said Qatar's Supreme Council of Health in a statement published by the official QNA [Qatar News Agency].

Another foreign man, aged 48, who had contracted the virus, was discharged from a Qatar hospital after being successfully treated for 3 weeks, the same statement said.

In September [2013], Qatar announced 2 other deaths from MERS-CoV of a man and a woman.

The World Health Organization said earlier this month [November 2013] that it has been informed of 153 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases worldwide so far, including 64 deaths, most of them in Saudi Arabia.

Experts are struggling to understand the disease, for which there is no vaccine. It is considered a deadlier but less-transmissible cousin of the SARS virus that erupted in Asia in 2003 and infected 8273 people, 9 per cent of whom died.

Like SARS, MERS appears to cause a lung infection, with patients suffering from a temperature, coughing, and breathing difficulties. But it differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure, and the extremely high death rate has caused serious concern.

In August [2013], researchers pointed to Arabian camels as possible hosts of the virus, and the Saudi government said on [11 Nov 2013] that a camel in the kingdom has tested positive for MERS, the 1st case of an animal infected with the coronavirus.

[In the most recent WHO statement, there were 157 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported globally, including 66 deaths, using WHO criteria for laboratory confirmation (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (88): Kuwait, WHO, Spain 20131119.2062587). This tally did not include the 2 recently reported cases from Spain associated with travel to Saudi Arabia. If one includes the 2 newly reported cases including one death mentioned in the Saudi MOH press release above, and the newly reported death in a previously reported case in Qatar, this will increase the global tally of MERS-CoV infections to 161 cases and 68 deaths.

Al-Jawf is located in the north of Saudi Arabia, bordering with Jordan. It's estimated population was 440 009 in the 2010 census. Its capital is Sakakah (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jawf_Province, where a map of the province can be found). For a map of the Middle East Region where cases of MERS-CoV have been identified or linked to, see http://healthmap.org/r/1HAJ. - Mod.MPP]
