[Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes, based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453.

Low pathogenicity subtypes of avian influenza (H5N2, H5N3, H5N1, H5N9, and H5N8) have been circulating in France since November 2015.

All outbreaks of LPAI reported from 1 Nov 2015 to date (6 Jun 2017) can be seen on the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/ycaufs2u (click on the section of interest on the map, and zoom in).
