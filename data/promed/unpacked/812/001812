A 2nd horse is showing signs it may have contracted the equine herpesvirus [EHV], a highly contagious condition, the Iowa Department of Agriculture confirmed.

One horse already tested positive for EHV. Owners say he went from healthy to near death in hours. The horse needed to be euthanized. The confirmed case was found at the Pine Hollow Stables in Altoona, where now a 2nd horse started showing signs of EHV.

The animal is now in quarantine and being evaluated.

The Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) has received confirmation of a 2nd case of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) in the state this year [2019].

A mare at a private equine training facility in Bannock County aborted a pregnancy in late March [2019]. On 4 Apr 2019, the ISDA received laboratory confirmation the abortion was caused by EHV-1 infection, despite the mare being current on her vaccinations.

The horse has not traveled to any events or locations since fall 2018 and is currently under veterinary care at the private facility, which is under quarantine. She had been in direct contact with 2 other horses at her home facility. None of the 3 horses have exhibited respiratory or neurologic signs of disease, and they do not have regular contact with horses in training at the facility.

There is no evidence to suggest this case is in any way connected to the EHV-positive horse diagnosed in Ada County last week.

The ISDA is urging owners to avoid transporting their horses unless absolutely necessary. At this time, the decision to cancel upcoming equine events and competitions remains with the event coordinators at each host facility. Should horse owners elect to participate in events, they are strongly urged to implement enhanced biosecurity.

EHV 101
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment, including bits, buckets, and towels; or the clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Some horses have been known to be lifelong EHV-1 carriers that can spontaneously shed the virus, causing other horses to acquire the disease. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help present disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease.

Biosecurity and equine events in Idaho:
At this time, the ISDA said, the decision to cancel upcoming equine events and competitions remains with the event coordinators at each host facility. But owners might want to avoid transporting their horses unless necessary.

Horses exposed to EHV often take several days to demonstrate clinical illness and run the risk of shedding the virus undetected. Exposed horses that travel to shows or exhibitions could expose other horses before disease containment can be implemented. The ISDA urges horse owners to incorporate preventative biosecurity measures while transporting or boarding horses at facilities with regular traffic on and off the grounds, especially where horses are likely to commingle with new horses such as at rodeos or fairgrounds.

Some key biosecurity measures that can help minimize a horse's risk of contracting the virus include

- disinfecting stalls before use;
- never sharing water or feed buckets, tack, or grooming equipment without 1st cleaning and disinfecting it; and
- avoiding unnecessary contact with other horses.

Additionally, people who work at multiple equine facilities should practice biosecurity measures by washing hands and changing footwear and clothing before entering each facility.

In Idaho, EHM/EHV is a notifiable disease to the state veterinarian. Anyone suspecting or confirming a case of EHM/EHV should call 208/332-8560 to report cases

[EHV is a very nasty disease. Owners need to step up their biosecurity and get a notebook to document each animal's temperature twice daily. Treatment (which may be only supportive care) at the earliest moment may be important to the life of your animal. That earliest possible moment may be the 1st hint of a rise in body temperature. Do not blow off a tiny rise in temperature as ambient temperature. Be safe and treat early. Get your veterinarian involved at the earliest possible moment. Consider if that competition, show, trail ride, or whatever is so important that you would endanger your animal. This disease is nasty and shows no mercy. A few horses recover, but it is very few, and there are no guarantees yours may be in those very few recoveries. - Mod.TG
