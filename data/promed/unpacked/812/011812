The "very contagious" chickenpox is going around Auckland, the region's public health service has warned, reminding parents that children can be vaccinated for free against it at 15 months old.

On Tuesday [17 Aug 2021], Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) posted on social media that chickenpox was "about" in the country's largest city.

"It's very contagious," the post said. "The chickenpox vaccination is available and free for children turning 15 months old; discuss it with your family doctor."

A spokeswoman for ARPHS said the health authority didn't need to be notified of cases, but it had recently received a "handful" of calls about the disease.

According to the Ministry of Health, chickenpox causes small and itchy blisters on the skin that can become infected if scratched. It is spread through the air by infected people when they sneeze, cough, and touch things after touching the blisters.

"Very occasionally chickenpox can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia, problems with the kidneys, heart, joints, or nervous system," the ministry said. "Chickenpox is also serious for pregnant women."

On average, chickenpox lasts between 3 and 7 days for adults and between 5 and 10 days for children.

It can also increase tiredness and lead to a fever and general aches and pains.

The disease is highly contagious for the 1st 2 days before red spots begin to appear on the body, the ministry said.

"Avoid close contact with other people, stay home from work, and keep children home from school and early childhood education centres for one week from the appearance of the rash until all blisters have dried."

Children aged 15 months are eligible to receive one dose of the chickenpox vaccine for free, the ministry said. Children turning 11 are also able to access the vaccine for free if they have never been infected by the disease or previously vaccinated against it.

Most people who become infected with chickenpox will become immune to it and won't catch it again. Those with a mild case may become infected again, but the ministry said this was "very rare."
