[This most recent outbreak in Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Nouvelle-Aquitaine is in the bottom south-west corner of France, on the Spanish border; see Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques.

However, the previous 2021 outbreak reported below was in fact on 2 farms in Mozelle and Cote d'Or, which are in the distant north-east. Two cases were reported. The final report was made on 31 Dec 2021 and available at https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=45669:
(a)
Outbreak 1, located in Langatte, Sarrebourg, Moselle, Grand Est
Started: 23 Oct 2021
Ended: 27 Nov 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 212 / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 210
Affected population: Successive deaths of 2 cattle grazing on fields where anthrax had previously been detected. Investigation of the cause of infection is ongoing but no earthworks have been undertaken and no excessive rainfall has been observed in the area. The cattle have been vaccinated.
(b)
Outbreak 2, located in Seigny, Montbard, Cote d'Or, Bourgogne-France-Comte
Started: 30 Oct 2021
Ended: 20 Dec 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 232 / 7 / 7 / 0 / 0 / 97
Affected population: suckler herd; 7 cattle deaths spread over several weeks on 35 grazing animals -- in a herd of 232 cattle.

The report indicated that the source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection was 'cursed' fields.

So the comment "Identification of an area of pasture at risk where cases of anthrax have been detected previously" would indicate historical events, not something in the previous 6 months. Checking our reports we do not have a previous outbreak in Nouvelle-Aquitaine much less Pyrénées-Atlantiques. So this is a mystery. A logical possible explanation, backed by events elsewhere, is that the farmer was involved in excavations in this field and thereby dug up an anthrax grave and surviving spores. It is possible and is recorded. In the meantime, we must await any investigation results from our French colleagues. (With many thanks to Cristina) - Mod.MHJ
