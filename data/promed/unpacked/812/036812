Others more authoritative will comment on the international validation of
diagnostic tests to discriminate serological responses in infected animals
versus vaccinated animals. It seems the risk of foot and mouth disease
(FMD) outbreaks in unvaccinated populations could well increase rather than
decrease in the future, and perhaps the strategy for outbreak control might
change because of the cost and impact of present measures.
One example might be the "firebreak" vaccination plus identification
approach advocated by the Netherlands to restrict virus production while
other measures are applied. In this context, is there a place to experiment
with some markers for use in FMD vaccines -- unique antigens that would
provide additional evidence to the above diagnostic tests that the animal
had been vaccinated?

Source: Rationale for Vaccination: A Review of the Scientific Literature


[It is reasonable for the people to want to vaccinate and protect the
animals. However, it seems they do not know vaccinated animals will later
be killed. Â­ Mod.TG
The European policy of non-vaccination has the objective of creating a
European herd without evidence of antibodies to FMD virus, since this might
indicate animals that carry infection after exposure.
Since antibodies also arise from vaccination, very considerable effort has
been made in the 1990s to develop tests [that distinguish between
vaccination antibodies and infection antibodies. At least 5 different tests
have been developed and validated (an entire European Union-funded
Concerted Action was devoted to this, research summarized in over 15 papers
in the supplement of the Vet Quarterly, 1998, 20, suppl 2) and these now
transform our ability to identify vaccinated animals that have not been
infected. They can also identify the important category of animals that
have been vaccinated in an emergency situation and [that subsequently
become infected upon severe virus challenge.
Developing international recognition ("standardization") of these tests for
the purposes of trade is [in progress, and DG-SANCO of the European
Commission is revising its recommendations on the use of vaccination to
incorporate these technical advances. This committee is due to report
shortly. Since it is likely they will recognize the use of these tests in
clean herds after vaccination, that policy will change to allow FMD-free
status to be regained after surveillance for infection in vaccinated
animals (Panina and Ahl, 1998, ref above) after a much shorter waiting
period than is currently necessary.
Examples of peer reviewed papers [on the subject:
Bergmann IE, et al. Improvement of a sero-diagnostic strategy for FMD virus
surveillance in cattle under systematic vaccination. Arch Virol 2000;
145(3): 473-89.
Sorensen KJ, et al. Differentiation of infection from vaccination in
foot-and-mouth (shortened title). Arch Virol 1998; 148(8): 1461-76.
In other words, if DG-SANCO (and later the Office Internationale des
Epizooties in Paris (OIE)) were to decide tomorrow that these tests could
be used in herd surveillance after vaccination, then vaccinated herds would
not need culling unless they were shown to be infected. This decision could
well be made in the next few weeks and would completely change the economic
arguments (effect on livestock trade) against vaccination.

[This possible change in policy seems long overdue. We will certainly be
hoping the decision to use tests to distinguish between the antibodies will
shortly be put into place. - Mod.TG
