As many as 125 people have died till Saturday [27 Jul 2019] in Assam due to Japanese encephalitis [JE], with 6 deaths reported on Friday [26 Jul 2019] from different districts of the state.

Apart from the death of one 72-year-old in Jorhat, the other deaths were reported from Chirang, Barpeta, Dima Hasao, Golaghat and Sivasagar districts.

Amid the increasing numbers in JE deaths, health officials, however, said that with a change in the season, the number of cases reported is decreasing gradually.

"From 25-30 cases per day earlier, presently the number of reported cases has come down to 8-9 per day," said sources from the health department.

"We are hopeful that soon cases of JE will go down significantly and then be wiped out completely," the sources added.

According to the National Health Mission (NHM) 23 Jul [2019] report, a total of 222 deaths have occurred in the state since January [2019] due to JE and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).

The NHM report further stated that the total number of JE/AES positive cases during this period was 1569.

AES and JE gripped several districts from Assam, including Jorhat, Golaghat, Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur and Kamrup.

A union team was dispatched to Assam on 30 Jun [2019] to review the total reported cases in the state.

The Assam government, after the initial cases of JE were reported, made efforts to spread awareness about the virus.

Assam's 27 districts were covered under the vaccination programme against JE for children up to 15 years.

[The JE virus transmission appears to be declining. A previous report suggested that the floods in Assam may have washed away the larvae and pupae of the Culex vector mosquitoes. If this, in fact, occurred, that may have contributed to the decline in the numbers of JE cases.

The above report does not indicate what proportion of the 1569 JE/AES cases are due to JE, nor what the suspected etiologies of the AES cases might be. Several etiolgies for AES in northeastern India have been proposed. The JE vaccination program was doubtless helpful in preventing cases in children in Assam, but the percentage of coverage in that cohort of the population is not specified in the above report. - Mod.TY
