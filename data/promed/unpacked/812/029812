---------------------------------------------------------------
The Swedish salmonella control [system] is very well described in the last
posting. The serotype involved in the outbreak is _Salmonella reading_.

The reasons for the "stamping out policy" are financial. It was
agreed between the herd owners and the Board of Agriculture that
culling the animals and cleaning and disinfection of the premises
would be cheaper and faster than a stepwise on-farm eradication (such
as usually employed for non-poultry species). However, only 2 of the
5 infected herds so far have been depopulated, in the others a
reduction of the population with increased slaughter of cull cows has
been employed.

What is worrying in the outbreak is that there appears to be some
degree of salmonella contamination in the local environment. All
infected farms are in a small area, but they don't have any contact
links other than geography.

A common link between some of the herds is a stream, where samples
have intermittent occasional contamination of both water and sediment.

A survey of wild birds and rodents in the near vicinity is ongoing.

The authorities are working on recommendations on how to prevent
further spread, but in the absence of clear data these will be of a
general nature.

[This immediate, firsthand response is gratefully acknowledged.

The Swedish authorities are not required to notify this event to the
OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health), since salmonellosis in
bovines and ovines is not included in OIE's disease list.

As a footnote: _S. reading_ was found, several years ago, to be a
potential contaminant of sprouts in Norway. - Mod.AS]
