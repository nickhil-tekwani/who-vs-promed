[ProMED-mail posted Vitamin B contamination - USA: recall refused, alert 20130803.1861510 on 3 Aug 2013. The following information was received from Viki Hansen <viki.hansen@internationalsos.com>:

"The news source was published on 2 Aug 2013 but appears incorrect, likely because they quote a company official from "Wed 13 Jul 2013" as refusing the recall. Actually, the company has recalled the supplements voluntarily as of 31 Jul 2013."

ProMED-mail now posts the US Food and Drug Recall notice of the product below and apologizes for stating that the company was refusing to cooperate. - Mod.TG]:
