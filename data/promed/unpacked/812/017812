Chronic wasting disease found in NM deer
-----------------------
A mule deer collected from White Sands Missile Range has tested positive
for chronic wasting disease (CWD), forcing the State Department of Game and
Fish to declare an animal health emergency. The declaration closes the
state to any imported deer or elk.
This is the first positive test for CWD in New Mexico. CWD is a
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy, and is in the same family as
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad-cow disease. It has so far
only been found in North American deer and elk.
Infected animals' brains, spinal cords, eyes and lymph nodes can be
affected. These animals become emaciated, drink water to an excessive
degree and lose control of bodily functions, including balance.
The disease has been found in free-ranging deer and elk in Colorado,
Wyoming, Nebraska, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Saskatchewan, Canada.
According to a Department of Game and Fish press release, there is no
practical or proven test to determine if CWD is present in living animals,
since the best test is to remove and examine portions of each brain stem. A
test of deer tonsils is being developed, but the department says such a
test is not feasible for the state's entire deer population.
The department is encouraging hunters to provide the heads of deer and elk
within a 48-hour period for testing. There is no known relationship
between CWD and any other disease of animals or people. However, state
officials are encouraging hunters to follow precautions when handling dead
game. Hunters are asked not to consume any neural tissue of animals, such
as the brain or spinal cord, and to wear latex gloves when field dressing
dead game.

[There is an experimental test for CWD using samples from the animal's
lymph nodes. Although still in the experimental stage, the lymph node test
is proving to have excellent results and good correlation with pathology
specimens. If the lymph node test were to be used, it would be possible to
sample the lymph nodes or surgically remove a lymph node without killing
the animal. It must be remembered that this disease has been in the United
States for decades and only recently has it caused a stir. It is a good
case study in disease surveillance in general. If you do not look for a
disease then it is not there. Most states never looked for CWD until
recently, and so there appears to be a spreading of the disease when in
reality this may not be the case. - Mod.TG]
