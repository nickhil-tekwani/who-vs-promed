Fungal disease reduces onion produce
------------------------------------
Fungal disease resulted in yield losses in the onion supply in Ilocos Norte. An assessment by the municipal agriculture office revealed that the area planted to the red onion variety have decreased by almost 50 per cent because of the sudden occurrence of the disease during this year's [2016] planting season.

Cornelio Dinong, municipal agricultural technologist, said the dominant fungal diseases that hit the onions are "anthracnose" and purple blotch, which usually develop during drizzles and the rainy season, and are further aggravated by climate change.

[An] information campaign was staged urging local farmers to practice soil sterilization and crop rotation at the onset of planting season. Farmers, meanwhile, have chosen to grow corn, mungbean, and vegetables in lieu of onion.

[Anthracnose
-----------
Anthracnose of onion (also called smudge, twister) is caused by the fungi _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (previously _Glomerella cingulata_) or _C. circinans_. An additional species, _Gibberella moniliformis_, has been identified to be associated with a severe form of the disease in the Philippines (see links below) where up to 100 per cent crop losses have been reported. Symptoms include water-soaked, pale yellow spots on leaves, which expand lengthwise until covering the entire leaf blade, followed by shrivelling and drooping of affected leaves.

The pathogens survive on crop debris. Spread occurs mainly with infected plant material and by mechanical means. Disease management may include removal of infected crop debris to reduce inoculum, crop rotation, fungicides (although effectiveness may be limited), biocontrol organisms (for example _Trichoderma_), and cultural measures (reduction of moisture in the crop). Some resistant or tolerant onion cultivars are being developed.

Purple blotch
-------------
Purple blotch of onion is caused by the fungus _Alternaria porri_. Crop losses depend on environmental conditions and may range from 25 to 90 per cent. The damage may continue to develop post-harvest. Symptoms may include small, water-soaked lesions with purple centres on leaves, leaf bases, and flower stalks, which expand and result in necrotic patches. The disease is favoured by high humidity and often occurs as a secondary infection on plants already affected by other pathogens or pests (for example, onion thrips).

The pathogen is mostly spread with infected plant material and by mechanical means (including insects and human activities). Disease management may include fungicides, clean planting material, phytosanitation to minimise inoculum, and crop rotation.
