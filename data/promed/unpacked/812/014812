A Garfield County [Colorado] resident is officially the 1st confirmed case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the area since 2012.

There are very few details released on the confirmed case at this point. Officials haven't released information on the status of the patient, or even what city the patient caught the virus in.

"Usually what happens is you're cleaning something, and the virus gets put into the air, and you breath it in, and you don't really think much of it," said immunization coordinator for Garfield County Danielle Yost. "Then usually anywhere from a couple days to a few weeks later you start getting flu like symptoms that rapidly deteriorate into the inability to breathe."

Symptoms include muscle aches, fatigue, high fever, dizziness, headaches, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain which can eventually lead to death [the fatality results from heart and lung compromise and the disease is termed hantavirus pulmonary or cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). - Mod.TY]

Garfield County officials are concerned enough to call for citizen precautions, especially since it's the spring-cleaning season. The county Public Health Department is warning all residents to know how to protect themselves from this potentially deadly disease.

The virus is usually carried in the Western Slope by the deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. Officials urge any resident's cleaning out garages, or other areas with rodent droppings or urine, to not sweep the mess but rather pour a bleach and water mix over the affected area. Always wear protective gloves and scoop up the mess with a paper towel.

The 1st case of the mysterious disease started back in 1993 in the 4-Corners region of Colorado [southwestern corner of Colorado, northwestern corner of New Mexico, northeastern corner of Arizona, and southeastern corner of Utah], and the hantavirus has now spread across the western hemisphere [HPS was doubtless occurring for a very long time in the broad geographic areas where deer mice occur, but was unrecognized until the 4 Corners outbreak when Sin Nombre hantavirus was identified as the etiological agent involved. Rather than geographic spread, what has increased is recognition of the disease and ability to detect the virus. - Mod.TY]. The CDC reports a 36 percent mortality rate for those with the disease [HPS].

"There is no vaccine, no medication for it, your body basically has to fight it off on its own," said Yost.

[Although not stated in the report above, the virus involved in this HPS case probably is Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) including in Colorado. This is the season for spring cleaning in North America, and closed buildings that have been unused overwinter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with HPS are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant. Individuals cleaning areas where the mice may be present are well advised to heed the recommendations above in order to avoid exposure.

This report does not indicate the sex or age of the patient, the patient's condition, or the specific location and environmental setting in Garfield County where the infection occurred. ProMED would appreciate receiving this additional information.
