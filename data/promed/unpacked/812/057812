Suspected cholera outbreak in Ugandan capital kills 8
-----------------------------------------------
As rainy season in East Africa sets in, a suspected cholera outbreak has
also hit Katanga, one of the slums in Kampala, killing 8 people, 3 of them
children.
The Kampala District Medical Officer, Mubiru Messach, told Xinhua by
telephone on Tue 14 Jun 2005 that 8 people have so far died after suffering
from severe diarrhea and vomiting.
He said that a team of medical officials have been sent to the slum to
investigate whether it is cholera that has hit the area. He said that
laboratory tests have been carried out and that they are now waiting for
the results.
Local media on Tue 14 Jun 2005 quoted a local official in the area, Hassan
Wasswa, as saying that a sewer line broke down, and sewage flowed into
residents' homes.
According to Wasswa, the deaths have been occurring since last week [2nd
week June 2005]. Katanga is one of Kampala's congested slums, with a
population of about 2000 people.

Uganda: Cholera kills 10, hundreds infected
-----------------------------------------------
Cholera outbreaks in Uganda have killed at least 10 people, while hundreds
of others have been treated for the disease, health officials said on Thu
16 Jun 2005.
The outbreaks were recorded in a congested Kampala slum; in Jonam County in
Nebbi District, 300 km northwest of the city; and in a camp for internally
displaced people in Gulu District, 380 km north of Kampala. In the slum,
north of the city center, 4 deaths and 4 cases of infection have been
recorded. The slum is home to an estimated 30 000 people.
"We have since banned the selling of food and vending of water in the area,
and we have discouraged the population from using the well nearby as more
tests are undertaken," Francis Lubowa, the Kampala City Council's health
secretary, said.
The 1st case was reported in the slum on 29 May 2005, he added. He said the
outbreak was due to poor sanitation and drainage in the slum, and that the
zone where the cases were recorded had only 4 functioning toilets.
In Jonam County, 117 cases, including 3 dead, have been recorded. "There
are no good water sources in the area, and people resort to using
tributaries of the River Nile, some of which are stagnant, leading to the
problem," Paul Ajal, the medical officer in charge of Janam, said. He said
health officials were making people aware of cholera risks through radio
and public announcements.
Officials said the outbreak in Pabbo camp in Gulu was now under control.
Camp leader Wilson Ojok said 309 cases of the disease, including 3 deaths,
had been recorded since April 2005, with the last death recorded on 31 May
2005.

Cholera Outbreak: 41 eateries in Semporna ordered closed
-----------------------------------------------
41 eateries here were ordered closed, as the cholera outbreak in the
district reached a critical stage. State Health Department deputy director
(public health) Dr. Mohd Yusof Ibrahim said the closure followed an
inspection of all the eateries in the district by a team of health officers.
The inspection was conducted in light of the cholera outbreak in the
district since May 2005. "The closure was for unsanitary condition," Dr.
Mohd Yusof told the New Straits Times.
In May 2005, 116 students of SK Bubul and SMK Kabongan were warded at the
Semporna District Hospital, after being confirmed as cholera carriers. More
than 160 people, including students, sought treatment at the hospital for
cholera symptoms over the past week [2nd week June 2005], with 17 confirmed
cases.

At least 9 people, mostly children, died, while 70 others got ill, in what
officials said was an outbreak of diarrhea in at least 3 remote villages of
Palimbang town in Sultan Kudarat.
Palimbang Mayor Labualas Mamansual told the Inquirer that 7 of those who
had died since the outbreak about 2 weeks ago [around the beginning of June
2005] were from Barangay Domulol. The 2 other affected villages were Kra'an
and Malisbong.
Mamansual said the victims died of apparent dehydration. He said that,
among the 3 villages, Domulol had more serious cases of diarrhea.
Of the 70 people afflicted with the disease, at least 30 come from the
village. Mamansual said the latest fatalities, who died on Mon and Tue 6-7
Jun 2005, were from Barangay Kra'an.
[The fatalities suggest that the illness may well be cholera. - Mod.LL]

Monks in Monywa Suffer From Cholera
-------------------------------------------
About 90 monks of Maha Zawtikayama Buddhist Monastery in Monywa Town,
central Burma, suffered from cholera and have been given medical treatment.
The cholera outbreak, which created panic among the monks of Monywa's
largest monastery, started on 12 Jun 2005, after the monks were reportedly
consuming "old and over-ripe" fruits.
"The situation is not that bad now. Some of the monks were allowed to
return home," a monk from the monastery said yesterday, 16 Jun 2005. A team
of health staff led by a doctor opened an emergency clinic within the
monastery compound for the sick monks. Apart from this, some monks were
being treated at Monywa's civil hospital.
Reportedly, out of the 74 monks who received treatment in the emergency
clinic, over 30 have returned home after receiving 3-4 days treatment.
Meanwhile, 8 out of the 13 monks taken to civil hospital have recovered.
Recently, there have been reports of at least 3 deaths in Myaing Township
in central Burma caused by cholera.
