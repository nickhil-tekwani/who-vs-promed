Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea 30 Jun 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Situation in Korea
Between [27 and 30 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of one additional confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) alongside 2 additional deaths.

Additional information on the outbreak in Korea
To date, a total of 182 MERS-CoV cases, including 33 deaths, have been reported. One of the 182 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.

The median age of the cases is 55 years old (ranging from 16 to 87 years old). The majority of cases are men (60 percent). 26 cases (14 percent) are health care professionals. To date, all cases (excluding the index case) have been linked to a single chain of transmission and are associated with health care facilities.

Detailed information concerning MERS-CoV cases in the Republic of Korea can be found in a separate document (see related links available at the source URL; these include maps, graphs and a line listing of all confirmed cases to date).

Public health response
The government of the Republic of Korea continues to implement intense case and contact management activities. As of [30 Jun 2015], 2638 contacts are being monitored, while a total of 13 354 contacts have been released.

From [3-14 Jul 2015], the city of Gwangju will host the 2015 Summer Universiade (the World University Games). To support the safe and successful hosting of the event, on [29 Jun 2015], the head of the Infectious Disease Management division of the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established in Gwangju a MERS response and support task force. On the same day [29 Jun 2015], health care workers in the hospitals of the athletes' village and approximately 200 stadium stewards were trained in the use of fever detectors and educated on how to respond to the occurrence of a suspected MERS-CoV case.

Global situation
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1357 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 486 related deaths.

[Hopefully, this will be the last WHO update with increasing numbers of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in South Korea. It is nice to see that the World University Games will be held during July 2015 and that there is preparation ongoing for collaboration with public health.

As mentioned above, the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV is now 1357 including at least 486 related deaths, for a reported case fatality rate of 35.8 percent. - Mod.MPP]
