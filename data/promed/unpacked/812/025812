Victoria's Department of Environment and Primary Industries says a disease that has killed about 30 cows near Colac, in south western Victoria, will not spread to other animals.

The department's director of animal biosecurity and welfare, Tony Britt, says early reports show the cattle died early this week [week of 9 Jun 2013] from acute bovine liver disease. He says the disease is sometimes observed in the western district at this time of year.

Mr Britt says farmers should contact their veterinarian if their animals are sick, but they should not worry about the disease spreading from animal to animal. "The exact cause is not known with any degree of certainty but it's probably a fungal contamination on the pasture," he said.

"The cattle ingests the fungus, (then) the fungus damages the liver. That's the underlying cause of the disease."

[The fungus referred to here may be phomopsins. The issue of it occurring every year makes this fungus come to mind. It might seem that it is a management issue, but something like fungus on the forage is not always so easy to manage.

Phomopsins are a family of mycotoxins produced by the fungus _Diaporthe toxica_ (formerly referred to as _Phomopsis leptostromiformis_). Lupins are the main host for the fungus, and infected stubble is the major source of animal exposure to phomopsins. Lupin seed is used in food and feed production, but the extent is poorly documented and data on the occurrence of phomopsins in lupin-based foods and feeds are limited. Therefore, it was not possible to assess dietary intake of phomopsins. Phomopsins are modified polypeptides, which bind with high affinity to tubulin isotypes and disrupt microtubular functions. Phomopsin A, the major toxic congener, is hepatotoxic in all animal species tested at sufficient doses. Phomopsin A is also hepatocarcinogenic in rats. The absence of either dose-response information on toxicities associated with phomopsins or exposure/occurrence data precludes an assessment of human or animal risks. However, the severity of toxicities in numerous animal species suggests that human and livestock exposures should be kept as low as possible.
