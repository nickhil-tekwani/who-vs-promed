Human Ingestion of _Bacillus anthracis_-Contaminated Meat --- Minnesota,
Aug 2000
On 25 Aug 2000, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) was notified by
the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) of _Bacillus anthracis_
isolated from a steer on a farm in Roseau County, Minnesota. The infected
steer was one of 5 dead cattle found in a pasture on 20 Aug 2000. On the
basis of phage typing of isolates cultured from tissues and blood samples
by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, _B.
anthracis_ was confirmed. This report describes the management of and
public health response to human exposure to meat contaminated with anthrax.
On 24 Jul 2000, the farmer who owned the infected steer also had killed,
gutted, and skinned a cow that was unable to rise. A local veterinarian
approved the slaughter of the cow for consumption by the farmer's family.
Immediately after slaughter, the farmer took the carcass (carcass X) to a
custom meat-processing plant; on 31 Jul and 1 Aug 2000, carcass X was
processed. 2 family members ate hamburgers made from carcass X on 15 Aug
2000 and steaks on 19 Aug 2000; 3 other family members ate hamburgers on 20
Aug 2000. A sixth member prepared the meals and also may have eaten
contaminated meat. All meat was reported to have been well cooked.
To investigate the possibility that they had eaten contaminated meat, the
family members were interviewed by MDH on 25 Aug 2000. 2 reported
gastrointestinal illness; one reported 1 day of diarrhea approximately 48
hours after eating meat from carcass X, and the second reported 3 days of
abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a temperature of 102.3 F (39.1 C) beginning
24--36 hours after consumption. Both recovered without treatment. The
family was advised by MDH not to eat any more of the meat, to contact a
physician, and to begin antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin (500 mg,
orally, twice daily).
On 29 Aug 2000, samples of carcass X tested by the MDH Public Health
Laboratory (MDH PHL) were found to contain gram-positive bacilli on
microscopic examination. _B. anthracis_ contamination was confirmed at MDH
PHL and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases
through culture on blood agar, presence of a capsule, lack of motility,
gamma-phage test, and fluorescent antibody to cell wall polysaccharide and
capsular antigens.
On the basis of this exposure to meat highly contaminated with B.
anthracis, the family was advised to continue chemoprophylaxis, and
vaccination with anthrax vaccine was initiated (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed*,
Bioport Corporation, Lansing, Michigan).
The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) contacted the custom meat
processing plant on 28 Aug 2000 and placed a hold on all meat processed
after carcass X. On 29 Aug 2000, MDA inspected the plant; sanitation
practices were satisfactory. 7 carcasses had been processed after carcass
X. Owners of meat from the carcasses were advised not to eat any of the
meat and were asked to return meat to a central location for incineration;
all the meat products were accounted for and none had left Minnesota.
Samples from the other carcasses and environmental swabs collected after
plant cleaning tested negative for _B. anthracis_.
Reported by many experts.
Editorial Note: [edited
In the United States during the early part of the 20th century,
approximately 130 human cases occurred annually (1); [however, only 2
cutaneous infections have been reported since 1992. Before this exposure,
no animal anthrax cases had been reported in northern Minnesota since
recordkeeping began in 1909. However, in adjacent areas of North Dakota
during 2000, 120--150 cattle have died of anthrax (L. Schuler, North Dakota
state veterinarian, personal communication, 2000), and 11 farms have
reported anthrax-related cattle deaths in nearby Manitoba, Canada (Figure
1) (J.G. Spearman, Manitoba Department of Agriculture, personal
communication, 2000).
Gastrointestinal anthrax in humans occurs 1--7 days after eating raw or
undercooked meat from infected animals, and 2 forms of gastrointestinal
disease have been reported. Disease affecting the distal gastrointestinal
tract results in nausea, anorexia, and fever followed by abdominal pain and
bloody stool. The case fatality rate among reported cases ranges from
25%--60. Gastrointestinal anthrax never has been documented in the United
States. Anthrax has not been documented among the persons exposed to _B.
anthracis_-contaminated meat described in this report; however, a serologic
test to determine presence of infection is pending.
Limited experience with gastrointestinal anthrax complicates
recommendations for use of postexposure prophylaxis. An extended duration
of therapy is recommended for inhalational exposure because of the
persistence of spores resistant to the action of antimicrobial agents. Upon
cessation of chemoprophylaxis, such spores can cause disease several weeks
after exposure. No evidence supports the existence of persistent spores
associated with gastrointestinal forms of the disease; however, the meat
consumed by the family in this report was highly contaminated with _B.
anthracis_. Although possible interventions range from close observation to
antibiotics alone to antibiotics with vaccination, because the family was
at high risk for anthrax infection, management consisted of an extended
course of ciprofloxacin combined with administration of anthrax vaccine.
Federal-inspected and state-inspected animal processing facilities are
required to perform intensive cleaning after contact with an
anthrax-infected carcasses; veterinary inspection is not provided at custom
meat processors. Slaughter house workers who may be exposed to an
anthrax-contaminated carcass should receive medical evaluation for symptoms
and for possible treatment.
Management of anthrax in livestock should include 1) quarantine of the
herd; 2) removal of the herd from the contaminated pasture, if possible; 3)
vaccination of healthy livestock; 4) treatment of symptomatic livestock;
and 5) disposal of infected carcasses, preferably by burning. Bedding and
other material found around the carcass (e.g., soil) should be incinerated
with the carcass and buried.
Veterinarians notified of sudden death in an animal or of an animal unable
to rise should consider anthrax as a diagnosis, especially in areas where
anthrax is endemic. However the potential risk for animal anthrax exists in
all areas of the United States. [With the exception of counties adjoining
the Mississippi, livestock anthrax has been absent for many years from the
states east of the Mississippi. MHJ Vaccination of livestock in areas
where anthrax is endemic is the most effective method of prevention in
animals and humans. Cases of anthrax in animals and cases of suspected
human exposure should be reported immediately to the state health
department, federal animal heath officials, and to CDC's National Center
for Infectious Diseases, Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch, telephone
(404) 639-3158.
