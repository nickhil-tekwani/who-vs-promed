1998. Black Sigatoka confirmed in Brazil. INFOMUSA 7(1): 31.
Black Sigatoka disease, caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella
fijiensis_ Morelet (perfect stage), _Paracercospora fijiensis_
(Morelet) Deighton (anamorphic), is the most serious banana disease
world-wide.
Yellow Sigatoka, similar to black Sigatoka, has been present in Brazil
since the 1940's. Despite its severity, yellow Sigatoka is usually
replaced by black Sigatoka in banana- growing areas where both
diseases are present. This is due to the high aggressiveness of black
Sigatoka, in comparison with yellow Sigatoka, thus inducing
significant yield losses that can be as high as 100% if no control
measures are implemented.
Another direct effect of black Sigatoka is the increase in production
costs due to the intensive spraying of fungicides needed to control
the disease; in Central America the number of sprayings may be as high
as 40 per year, that is four times as many as the number of fungicide
sprayings used to control yellow Sigatoka. In addition,
_M. fijiensis_ is capable of infecting a large number of banana and
plantain varieties, which are widely cultivated by small growers in
the North and Northeast Regions of Brazil.
In February 1998, José Clério Resende Pereira, Luadir Gasparotto and
Ana Fabíola da Silva Coelho, plant pathologists from EMBRAPA/CPAA,
detected black Sigatoka in Brazil. They observed a severe outbreak of
the disease in several banana cultivars in the
State of Amazonas and consequently notified the Brazilian Ministry of
Agriculture. Banana experts from EMBRAPA/CNPMF visited several
infected plantations and confirmed the presence of the disease in the
Amazon region.
Black Sigatoka incidence was particularly high in the banana cultivars
Prata Anã and Maçã and several local plantain cultivars; no infection
was observed in the cultivar Ouro.
Black Sigatoka disease was first detected in Brazil in banana
plantations located near the town of Tabatinga, in the State of
Amazonas, on the border with Colombia. The disease has already spread
over more than 400 km from the initial detection site so that it is
now present in banana-planting areas in the districts of Benjamin
Constant and Coari [shown as Figure 1 in the original text.
Due to the destructive potential of black Sigatoka, it has been
suggested that the following actions be immediately implemented.
Genetic control
---------------
The first measure proposed is to replace the varieties susceptible to
black Sigatoka, presently grown in the affected area, by resistant
genotypes. Besides being the most economic and effective control
measure, growing resistant cultivars is also an environmentally safe
and sustainable technology. In August, to carry out this task,
EMBRAPA/CNPMF will be providing 50 000 vitroplants of propagation
material of both 'Caipira' and PV 03-44, both resistant to black
Sigatoka. Other genotypes, such as
FHIA-01, FHIA-03, FHIA-20, FHIA-21, SH-3640 and Thap Maeo, introduced
and/or
selected at EMBRAPA/CNPMF and showing resistance to the disease, will
be multiplied ín vitro to be subsequently tested in the Amazon Region.
It is expected that planting resistant genotypes will decrease the
inoculum potential, thus reducing yield losses, and will slow down the
spread of the disease within the Amazon Region, as well as towards
other banana-growing areas in Brazil.
Monitoring the spread of the disease
------------------------------------
The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, through its Department in the
State of Amazonas, has already decided on actions aiming at
preventing/regulating transportation and commercialization of plants
and plant products belonging to the Musaceae family in order to
prevent the spread of the disease.
Researchers and agronomists from EMBRAPA and the Ministry of
Agriculture will carry out surveys in banana-growing areas of the
Amazon region. Such an activity will enable sanitary barriers to be
established in order to prevent the movement of black Sigatoka
infected material.
Possible impact on the Brazilian banana industry
------------------------------------------------
Since most of the banana producers in Brazil are small and medium
growers, who use very low-production technology and could not afford
the cost of chemically controlling black Sigatoka, and given the
disease severity observed in the Amazon region, it is thought that
this will have a very negative impact on yield and fruit quality in
areas where no control measures have been taken. For those growers who
are used to controlling
yellow Sigatoka, they will see an increase in production costs, since
more intensive fungicide spraying will be necessary. In North and
Northeast Brazil, it is expected that this will have great impact on
plantain production since plantain cultivars are resistant to yellow
Sigatoka, while highly susceptible to black Sigatoka.
