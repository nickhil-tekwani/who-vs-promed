Ebola virus disease update - West Africa
--------------------------------
Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 16 Aug 2014, Total Cases 2240, Deaths 1229.

Between 14-16 Aug 2014, a total of 113 new cases of Ebola virus disease (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 84 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia*, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

Health sector response
...To reduce the likelihood that those who are infected will carry the disease outside their communities, the governments have set up quarantine zones in areas of high transmission including severely-affected cities such as Gueckedou in Guinea, Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone and Foya in Liberia...

WHO is working with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to ensure people in the quarantine zones receive regular food aid and other non-medical supplies. WFP is now scaling up its programme to distribute food to the around one million people living in the quarantine zones in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Food has been delivered to hospitalized patients and people under quarantine who are not able to leave their homes to purchase food. Providing regular food supplies is a potent means of limiting unnecessary movement.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.) Temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at: IHR Emergency Committee meeting on Ebola outbreak in west Africa http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en.

Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 16 Aug 2014: The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health.

* Information from Liberia, throughout this update, is from 15 Aug 2014.

Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh, the Senior Consultant Physician and Endocrinologist who was one of the doctors who attended to Patrick Sawyer at First Consultant Hospital [Lagos] has died from the ebolavirus, which she contracted from Sawyer.

Dr. Ameyo died this afternoon Tue 19 Aug 2014 at the isolation unit of the Mainland Hospital in Lagos where she'd been quarantined. She died a hero because she was the doctor who refused to let Patrick Sawyer, the man who brought the ebolavirus to Nigeria, leave the First Consultant Hospital in Obalende, Lagos, when he attempted to leave. She saved many lives by doing this. Her death is so heartbreaking. She's survived by a son and her husband. May her beautiful soul rest in peace... Amen.

Nigeria ex Liberia: suspected contacts quarantined

[excerpt]
Two missionary workers and their driver have been quarantined at the Benue State University Teaching Hospital (BSUTH), in Makurdi, the Benue state capital, [Nigeria] on suspicion of infection with Ebola virus disease.

Chief Medical Director [CMD] of BSUTH, Professor Orkurga Malu, who disclosed this to newsmen in Makurdi, dispelled rumours that the quarantined persons were infected with the virus. Malu explained that Benue indigenes, who hitherto resided in Monrovia for a year where they engaged in missionary work, relocated from the Liberian capital in the wake of the EVD outbreak.

"There is no truth that some Benue indigenes from Monrovia, Liberia are victims of the deadly ebolavirus. What happened is that since some airlines have shut down operations to Liberia, the couple and their driver had to take a connecting flight from their base to Accra, Ghana where they stayed for a week before travelling to Nigeria."

While refusing to disclose the identity of the persons concerned, Malu said, on arrival in the state, they were quickly admitted in the hospital and have been kept under close observation. "They have not shown any symptoms of the disease because at every stage their temperature is checked and tested right from Monrovia before they boarded the plane to Ghana and then Nigeria. Since they came in here on Thu [14 Aug 2014], we have been testing them on a daily basis, and there is no evidence of temperature rise or any of the symptoms of the virus. So we are 99.9 percent sure that they do not have EVD. But just in the remotest case of 0.1 percent, we have kept them to ensure they do not have the disease," he stated. The CMD who urged the people of the state not to panic assured that the hospital has adequate facilities to cater for any victim of the virus.

http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/08/ebola-latest-3-new-cases-4-victims-discharged/#sthash.Le1NCTXU.dpuf

[Since Liberia does not require visas from Nigerian nationals, and these passengers arrived from Ghana after a week's stay (where they were apparently not treated as possible contacts in view of their origin in Liberia), they must have had a Liberian entry stamp in their passports in order to have been flagged as coming from Liberia. This episode emphasizes the importance of immigration staff detecting the original embarkation point of passengers even if they are not coming directly from one of the EVD-affected West African countries. - Mod.JW]

From: Sarah McCord <sarah.mccord@mcphs.edu> [edited]


Forwarding on behalf of my colleagues at the US National Library of Medicine: This list seems to be the most efficient way to get this information into the hands of those who need it.

The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Emergency Access Initiative (EAI) has been activated to support healthcare professionals working on the EVD public health emergency in West Africa. The Emergency Access Initiative is provided on humanitarian grounds by the generosity of the participating publishers in partnership with the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Permitted use includes:

- Temporary collection replacement for library collections inaccessible due to specified disaster
- Emergency medical response for populations impacted by the specified event
- Public health response efforts for populations impacted by the specified event
- Health professionals and others providing medical treatment in affected areas

Prohibited use of the content available from the Emergency Access Initiative site includes any use not in support of the specified disaster event, and specifically prohibits use related to commercial gain, commercial document delivery, or downloading for communal or future use. For access to biomedical literature outside of the permitted uses, contact your local medical library.

The EAI is a collaborative partnership between NLM and participating publishers to provide free access to full-text from over 650 biomedical journals and over 4000 reference books and online databases to healthcare professionals and libraries affected by disasters. It serves as a temporary collection replacement and/or supplement for libraries affected by disasters that need to continue to serve medical staff and affiliated users. It is also intended for medical personnel responding to the specified disaster. EAI is not an open access collection. It is only intended for those affected by the disaster or assisting the affected population. If you know of a library or organization involved in healthcare efforts in response to the EVD outbreak, please let them know of this service. EAI was activated 4 times in the past, including following the earthquake and subsequent cholera epidemic in Haiti, flooding in Pakistan and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

NLM thanks the numerous participating publishers for their generous support of this initiative: American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Chemical Society, American College of Physicians, American Medical Association, American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists, ASM Press, B.C. Decker, BMJ, EBSCOHost, Elsevier, FA Davis, Mary Ann Liebert, Massachusetts Medical Society, McGraw-Hill, Merck Publishing, Oxford University Press, People's Medical Publishing House, Springer, University of Chicago Press, Wiley and Wolters Kluwer.

Resources on EVD
-----------------------
NLM has several other resources that will be helpful for people working on EVD:
- Articles in PubMed: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=ebola
- Ebola (for the general public): http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ebola.html
- International health (for the general public): http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/internationalhealth.html

CAMEROON
18 Aug 2014: Cameroon has closed all its land, sea and air borders with Nigeria in a move to help prevent the spread of the Ebola virus disease, the government spokesman told AFP Mon 18 Aug 2014. "Our thinking is that it is better to act preventively rather than have to heal" later those who may fall ill, said Issa Tchiroma Bakary, who is Cameroon's communications minister. No cases of EVD have been recorded so far in Cameroon, which shares a nearly 2000-km (1240-mile) long border with Nigeria, where the virus has claimed 4 lives with about a dozen people infected.

SIERRA LEONE
19 Aug 2014: the agricultural minister has said the EVD outbreak is having a severe impact on the economy, as 66 percent of people were farmers, and agriculture accounted for 46 percent of GDP and 25 percent of all exports. "We're expecting devastating effects not only on the labour, but we're also talking about farms being abandoned by people running away from the epicentres," Joseph Sam Sesay told the BBC http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28852384.

18 Aug 2014: EVD could have a devastating effect on Africa's gorilla population, researchers have warned.

The disease can influence reproductive potential, immigration and social dynamics, researchers say. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2728164/Ebola-decimate-Africas-Gorilla-population-researchers-warn.html#ixzz3ArAEok1J. - Mod.JW
