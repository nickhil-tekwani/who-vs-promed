A 14-year-old teenager died of anthrax last month [Aug 2021]. This is recent news from Shandong Province's Disease Control and Prevention Bureau. The reporter's statistics showed that the country has reported at least 162 anthrax cases and 2 deaths this year.

Anthrax is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by a bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_. Skin anthrax is the most common, while pulmonary anthrax can quickly cause coma and death, with a mortality rate of more than 90%. People who are infected with anthrax are mostly those engaged in breeding and slaughtering cattle, sheep, and livestock, and selling related products. People engaged in fur processing can also be infected with anthrax. Researchers say that the chaotic private livestock trade brings the risk of anthrax outbreaks.

This year [2021], anthrax or suspected anthrax epidemics have been detected in many provinces and cities in China, and deaths have occurred. According to reports published by China CDC, Shandong Province CDC, Binzhou CDC, and other units, there have been 2 confirmed patients of anthrax in Binzhou City, Shandong Province in August 2021 as reported by Shandong CDC on 15 Aug 2021. There were 2 anthrax cases, a 14-year-old student and a 35-year-old male. The student visited a medical institution several times and died a few days later.

According to Beijing's disease control news, on August 9 this year [2021], Beijing reported an exceptional case of pulmonary anthrax. The case came from Weichang Manchu and Mongolian Autonomous County in Chengde City, Hebei Province. He had a history of contact with cattle, sheep, and their products in the local area. 4 days after the onset of illness, he was transferred to Beijing by ambulance for treatment. The case was treated in isolation in the hospital.

On August 24 [2021], Tongliao City, Inner Mongolia, notified disease control that a suspected case of skin anthrax was recently discovered in the city. 18 provinces in China have reported anthrax cases this year.

The reporter searched and calculated the monthly statistics released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and found that from January to July this year [2021], a total of 159 cases of anthrax were reported in the country, with one death. Combined with the confirmed cases in Beijing and Shandong in August [2021], at least 162 anthrax cases and 2 deaths have been found in China this year.

According to the Statistical Bulletin of China's Health Development, 224 cases of anthrax and 0 deaths were reported in the country last year [2020].

[Our thanks to Dan for forwarding this very informative link. Anthrax is clearly a disease of national concern, whether in humans or livestock. We see but a trivial fraction of the real problem. Hopefully, the Chinese government may in due course be encouraged to share a truthful report on the national 2021 situation. - Mod.MHJ
