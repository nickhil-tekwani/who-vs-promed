Abstract:

Background
--------
In October 2009, it was reported that 68 of 101 patients with chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS) in the US were infected with a novel gamma
retrovirus, xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus (XMRV), a
virus previously linked to prostate cancer. This finding, if
confirmed, would have a profound effect on the understanding and
treatment of an incapacitating disease affecting millions worldwide.
We have investigated CFS sufferers in the UK to determine if they are
carriers of XMRV.

Methodology
----------------
Patients in our CFS cohort had undergone medical screening to exclude
detectable organic illness and met the CDC criteria for CFS. DNA
extracted from blood samples of 186 CFS patients were screened for
XMRV provirus and for the closely related murine leukaemia virus by
nested PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers. To control for the
integrity of the DNA, the cellular beta-globin gene was amplified.
Negative controls (water) and a positive control (XMRV infectious
molecular clone DNA) were included. While the beta-globin gene was
amplified in all 186 samples, neither XMRV nor MLV sequences were detected.

Conclusion
-------------
XMRV or MLV sequences were not amplified from DNA originating from
CFS patients in the UK. Although we found no evidence that XMRV is
associated with CFS in the UK, this may be a result of population
differences between North America and Europe regarding the general
prevalence of XMRV infection and might also explain the fact that 2
US groups found XMRV in prostate cancer tissue, while 2 European
studies did not.

[In their discussion, the authors state that: "Unlike the study of
Lombardi et al., we have failed to detect XMRV or closely related MRV
proviral DNA sequences in any sample from CFS cases. There have been
numerous claims for an infective aetiology to CFS over the years, not
least because, as in this sample, many patients report that their
symptoms were triggered by an infective episode. Prospective
epidemiological studies have confirmed that certain infective agents,
for example Epstein Barr virus, are unequivocally associated with
subsequent CFS [20], even if the mechanisms are unclear and almost
certainly multi factorial. Nearly 2 decades ago, sequences from
another retrovirus, the human T-lymphotropic virus type ll, were
amplified from the PBMCs of 10/12 (83 percent) adult and 13/18
paediatric CFS patients, but not from healthy control subjects [21].
However, subsequent studies carried out on small numbers (20-30) of
CFS patients failed to confirm evidence for HTLV (type 1!
or 11) [22]-[25] or other retroviruses, including the closely
related simian T lymphotropic virus type l, the prototype foamy
virus, simian retrovirus, bovine and feline leukaemia viruses[26] and
HIV-1 [23].

Our study differs from that of Lombardi in several respects.
Primarily, the PCR operator was blinded to the provenance of the DNA
samples. In fact, with the exception of the PCR controls, all 186 DNA
test samples originated from CFS patients. Care was taken to grow the
XMRV plasmid in a laboratory in which no MLV had been cultured and no
MLV vectors used, and the PCR was carried out in a CPA-accredited
Molecular Diagnostics Unit which processes only human tissue.
Multiple (6) water (negative) controls were included in every run to
detect low level contamination, and a PCR to amplify a sequence that
is conserved in most murine leukaemia viruses was included in order
to expose any circulating MLV contamination and to detect any variant
of XMRV that might be circulating in the UK CFS population. Based on
our molecular data, we do not share the conviction that XMRV may be a
contributory factor in the pathogenesis of CFS, at least in the U.K."

An unfortunate outcome of this research is that the causation of both
chronic fatigue syndrome and prostate cancer remains obscure. - Mod.CP]
