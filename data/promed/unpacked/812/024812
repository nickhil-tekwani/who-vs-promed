Suspected food poisoning in a Guangdong rice noodle roll shop causes 1 fatality; preliminarily determined to be bongkrekic acid poisoning

Regarding the issue of "Suspected food poisoning at a rice noodle roll shop in Huilai County", a staff member of Jieyang Health Bureau in Guangdong's Huilai County told The Paper on the afternoon of 3 Aug 2020 experts at Guangdong Province CDC provisionally confirmed the event was caused by bongkrekic acid poisoning.

On the same afternoon, a staff member of Huilai County Market Supervision and Management Bureau told The Paper children were among the 11 customers with symptoms of food poisoning from the above event. The bureau is now investigating.

On the morning of 2 Aug 2020 the Huilai County Government website reported on 28 Jul 2020, a food poisoning event occurred in Shenquan Township of Huilai County. Per initial investigations, after 11 customers at "Shitou Rice Noodle Roll Shop" in Shenquan Township ate Ho Fen (locally called "Kuey Teow"), they developed vomiting, diarrhea, and other symptoms consistent with food poisoning. 5 people have been sent to the hospital for treatment (of whom 1 died after rescue attempts failed, 2 are relatively serious condition, and 2 are in stable condition); another 6 had lighter symptoms and are being observed at home in stable condition.

[Bongkrekic acid (BA) has a unique mechanism of toxicity among the mitochondrial toxins: it inhibits adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) rather than the electron transport chain. Bongkrekic acid is produced by the bacterium _Burkholderia gladioli_ pathovar _cocovenenans_ (_B. cocovenenans_) which has been implicated in outbreaks of foodborne illness involving coconut- and corn-based products in Indonesia and China.

Bongkrekic acid is a heat-stable, highly unsaturated tricarboxylic fatty acid with a molecular weight of 486 kDa. Outbreaks have been reported from Indonesia, China, and more recently in Mozambique. Very little is known about the toxicokinetics of BA. Bongkrekic acid produces its toxic effects by inhibiting mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). ANT can also alter cellular apoptosis. Signs and symptoms in humans are similar to the clinical findings from other mitochondrial poisons, but they vary in severity and time course. Management of patients is symptomatic and supportive.

Bongkrekic acid is a mitochondrial ANT toxin and is reported primarily in outbreaks of foodborne poisoning involving coconut and corn. It should be considered in outbreaks of foodborne illness when signs and symptoms manifest involving the liver, brain, and kidneys and when coconut- or corn-based foods are implicated.

So while we do not know precisely what dish of food may be responsible for this situation, it appears that it could have been a local dish using corn or coconut. - Mod.TG

The review article cited above references several publications of bongkrekic acid poisoning from China that implicated fermented corn flour. However, "kuey teow" is a Cantonese term for flat rice noodles that are usually fried with shrimp, bean sprouts, and other ingredients, but not typically coconut or corn products. The SINA news report above goes on to mention an investigative focus on the rice noodles themselves, and the possibility that the noodle supply could have been contaminated by spore-forming bacteria in the setting of hot, humid weather. - Mod.LXL
