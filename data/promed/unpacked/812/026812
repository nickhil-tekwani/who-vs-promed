Leptospirosis is an endemic zoonotic bacterial disease that has
diverse clinical manifestations. From North India [Chandigarh] there
has been very scant literature or confirmation of this disease. A
prospective observational study of 28 serologically confirmed
(PANBIO-ELISA) leptospirosis cases [seen in] the Medical Emergency
[department] from 1 Jan 2007 till 31 Dec 2007 [is presented below].

All cases presented with fever from the months of August to October
[2007]. The mean age was 35.9 years (range 16-81 yrs) and there were
15 males and 13 females. Headache, myalgias, and lethargy occurred in
17 percent, 20 percent, and 18 percent respectively. The typical
Weil's disease-like presentation was seen in 46 percent (hepato-renal
syndrome) and flu-like symptoms were present in 25 percent cases.
Abdominal symptoms like diarrhea were present in 10 percent and
vomiting occurred in 46 percent. Neurological manifestation in the
form encephalitis was seen in 32 percent. Three patients presented
with features of anasarca attributed to capillary leak syndrome.
Conjunctival hemorrhages were seen 75 percent cases and hepatomegaly
in 53.5 percent cases.

Significant associated comorbid conditions and complications that
were present included: falciparum malaria in 3, ARDS [acute
respiratory distress syndrome] in 4, ventilator associated pneumonia
in 3, hepatitis due to HAV in 1, HEV in another, and fulminant liver
failure (HBV) in 1 patient.

Investigations revealed anemia and thrombocytopenia in 64 percent
cases, leucocytosis in 60 percent, raised serum bilirubin in 67.8
percent, raised AST/ALT in 74.9 percent, and elevated alkaline
phosphatase in 53.5 percent. A low prothrombin time index and
elevated renal function tests occurred in 46 percent each. Seven
cases died and were related to the complication of upper
gastrointestinal bleeding.

Conclusion
----------
Leptospirosis does occur in North India and clinical manifestations
are as varied as elsewhere in the world. The typical Weil's disease
occurs in 46 percent cases only and co-occurrence with other tropical
infectious diseases is also seen.

[As can be seen from the postings below, leptospirosis has been a
significant problem in many parts of India for some time.

A water-borne zoonotic disease in most circumstances, cases of this
spirochetal infection invariably increase with the onset of the monsoon season.

Chandigarh, the capital city of both the states of Punjab and
Haryana, is located in the plains of Northern India with a monsoon
season from mid-June to mid-September
(<http://www.whereincity.com/india/chandigarh/chandigarh-weather.php>).
