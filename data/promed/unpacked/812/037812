The Lebanese Health Ministry said [Fri 8 May 2015], that 3 of 14 Syrians poisoned after eating sweets contaminated with thallium sought medical treatment in Lebanon.

In a statement, the ministry said the Syrians got sick after eating maamoul [shortbread pastries filled with dates, pistachios, or walnuts] "they received as a gift" in Deir Miqram in Syria last month [April 2015].

They headed to Lebanon after developing symptoms of chemical poisoning, which include pain in different parts of the body, the statement said.

The ministry said testing on the patients confirmed thallium poisoning. It said the results of samples of the maamoul sent to laboratories also showed the presence of thallium.

The Lebanon Ministry of Public Health has reported 14 cases of chemical poisoning due to thallium ingestion after receiving as a gift locally made cakes (Maamoul) in Dir Migrim area in Syria in the beginning of this month Azar (May 2015).

Most of the victims presented with neurological symptoms, orbital, abdominal, chest, and muscular pains, in addition to hair loss, itching, and dizziness. 3 of these cases were admitted to a Lebanese hospital. Blood, urine, hair, and stool samples plus the suspected cake were sent to referral laboratories and the results obtained have demonstrated evidence of thallium poisoning. It is worth mentioning that no local cases were registered among Lebanese citizens.

[Thallium is a heavy metal and may be obtained from the smelting of other metals. It is generally used in electronic devices and the semiconductor industry and for special glass manufacturing. As a pure metal it is odorless and tasteless, but it is often found in combination with other substances such as bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and iodine. When it's combined, it appears colorless-to-white or yellow.
Currently, thallium is used in the manufacture of electronic components, optical lenses, semiconductor materials, alloys, gamma radiation detection equipment, imitation jewelry, artist's paints, low temperature thermometers, and green fireworks [5, 6, 7]. Trace amounts of thallium are used as a contrast agent in the visualization of cardiac function and tumors. Thallium exposure may occur at smelters in the maintenance and cleaning of ducts and flues and through contamination of cocaine, heroin, and herbal products. Criminal and unintentional thallium poisonings are still reported, some leading to death [2, 3].

In the past, thallium was used as a therapeutic agent to treat syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and ringworm, and it was also used as a depilatory for excess hair. In the early part of the last century, a product known as Koremlu was marketed in the United States for the treatment of ringworm as well as a depilatory agent. By 1934, 692 cases of thallium poisoning were reported with at least 31 deaths [2, 3]. Thallium was also widely used as a rodenticide. Its use as a household rodenticide was banned in the United States in 1965 after multiple unintentional poisonings [4]. Commercial use was banned a decade later. Unfortunately, unintentional poisonings are still reported in other countries where thallium is used as a rodenticide and ant killer.

Thallium is a soft and pliable metal. It melts at 303.5 deg C [578.3 deg F] and boils at 1482 deg C [2700 deg F]. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Thallium has a similar ionic radius to that of potassium (Tl 0.147 nm vs K 0.133 nm), which is one principle behind its toxicity [1].

The symptomatology of thallium toxicity is usually nonspecific due to the multi-organ involvement. Initial symptoms may include fever, gastrointestinal problems, delirium, convulsions, and coma. Symptoms may appear rapidly, but more commonly the acute toxicity subsides to be replaced by a gradual development of mild gastrointestinal disturbances, polyneuritis, encephalopathy, tachycardia, skin eruptions, stomatitis, atrophic changes of the skin, nail changes (Mee's lines; see photo at http://www.thelancet.com/cms/attachment/2000996409/2003694116/fx1.jpg), and skin hyperesthesia (mainly in the soles of the feet and the tibia). The lethal dose of thallium is approximately 15-20 mg/kg; however, significant toxicity and death may occur with smaller amounts. Thallium poisoning more commonly occurs after oral ingestion.

The clinical presentation of thallium toxicity can vary depending on the type, severity, and timeframe of the exposure. Acute thallium poisoning is primarily characterized by gastrointestinal, neurological, and dermatological symptoms, while neurologic findings predominate with chronic exposure and tend to progress, even despite decreasing blood thallium levels [8].

In the recent history of the Middle East, thallium as a lethal poison has been reported to have been used as an ideal assassin's tool by the previous Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein against its opponents. It is tasteless and easy to administer, and its effects take some time to appear. It then causes a lingering and painful death.

Thallium has been used as a pesticide in other countries, such as Africa, causing poisoning through contaminated foods. It has been discovered as a contaminant in some Chinese herbal medications.

Thallium is toxic by cumulative intake; it can be absorbed through the skin, respiratory, and GI tracts. Therefore, besides oral ingestion, inhalation of contaminated dust during manufacture, sniffing what was thought to be cocaine, and skin absorption through protective gloves have all been reported as causes of thallium toxicity. In addition, cases of thallium intoxication by intravenous injection of contaminated heroin have been reported. However, the vast majority of cases result from oral exposures.

Because chronic thallium exposure mimics other disease, many cases of industrial thallium exposure most likely go unnoticed. On the other hand, accidental poisoning caused by direct contact with and careless handling of thallium-containing materials occurs more frequently.

Although both Prussian blue and activated charcoal absorb thallium, it appears that Prussian blue has absorptive superiority. In addition, because it has a far better safety profile than other proposed therapies, Prussian blue should be considered the drug of choice in acute thallium poisoning [9].

Prussian blue is a crystal blue lattice of potassium ferric ferrocyanide. It acts as an ion exchanger for univalent cations, with its affinity increasing as the ionic radius of the cation increases. Prussian blue exchanges potassium ions from its lattice with thallium ions in the gut lumen. Removal of thallium from the gut creates a concentration gradient causing an increase in thallium exchange into the gut lumen. This interrupts its enterohepatic recirculation and increases its elimination. Prussian blue releases a negligible amount of cyanide (less than 1.6 mg, minimal lethal dose of cyanide in humans is approximately 50 mg) and does not present a safety concern following its use [10].

In patients in whom Prussian blue cannot be obtained and thallium poisoning is suspected, multidose activated charcoal may be effective. Because thallium undergoes enterohepatic and enteroenteric recirculation, repeated charcoal administration (0.25-0.5 g/kg q2-4h) may enhance fecal elimination.

Forced diuresis with potassium loading was previously recommended to increase the renal clearance of thallium, but this may exacerbate the neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms and is no longer advised.

Treatment of thallium intoxication should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis is suspected because tissue-bound thallium may cause prolonged neurologic damage if detoxification therapy is not commenced within 72 h of onset of acute poisoning.

Thallium concentrations in the urine are measure initially 3 times per week to confirm a decreasing trend. Prussian blue treatment should be continued until the 24-hour urine thallium concentration returns to the reference range (0-5 mcg/d) [11].

Thallotoxicosis also is associated with a severe form of stomatitis; thus, monitor mouth hygiene closely. Shaving the patient's head may reduce the stress induced by hair loss and improve the patient's morale.

Prolonged neurologic damage may persist if detoxification therapy is delayed. Patients have demonstrated persistent signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy at least 6 years after intoxication. Reports or persistent findings most commonly involve the feet and lower extremities.

Cases of persistent agitation, aggression, personality changes, depression, and other psychiatric symptoms have been reported following thallium exposure.

If recognized and treated early, thallium intoxication carries a favorable prognosis; however, the course of recovery may be lengthy.
