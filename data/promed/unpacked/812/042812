Public Health England says there are signs that cases in Europe with the same strains of salmonellae were linked to eggs from a single source. The national salmonellosis outbreak which has struck down nearly 250 people across Britain could be traced back to a single source of eggs, health investigators have said.

Public Health England (PHE) has been trying to track down the origin of the outbreak of foodborne illness, which causes vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and fever. Break-outs have erupted across the country, with 99 cases recorded in Hampshire, 30 in London, 39 in Cheshire and Merseyside, and 54 in the West Midlands.

Earlier in August 2014, 3 hospital patients affected by the outbreak in Birmingham died. But the infection was not cited as a contributing factor on the death certificates of 2 patients and the coroner's report on the 3rd patient has not yet been delivered. Health officials said there have been 158 cases reported in the past week alone, since 15 Aug 2014, but said these are not new infections but historical cases and that the reporting of new infections had in fact slowed down.

Paul Cleary, consultant epidemiologist at PHE, said investigators had traced the outbreak in Europe to a single source of eggs which also reached supermarket shelves in England. But it has not been confirmed this is the root of the outbreak in this country. He said: "Investigations into the recent _Salmonella_ enteritidis outbreak are progressing, at both a national and European level. "There is now evidence to indicate that cases in Europe with the same strains were associated with consumption of eggs from a single source. This egg supply also reached distributors and food outlets in England, but at this stage we cannot conclusively demonstrate this is the infection source in this country.

"We are continuing to work with the Food Standards Agency and public health organisations in Europe but, importantly, the decline in salmonellosis case reporting this week alongside other elements of our investigations reassures us that the current risk to public health is low."

[Serotype Enteritidis is often associated with undercooked eggs or egg products. The posting seems to imply that the food is not at fault but rather the sanitary practices of the food handler. Given the serotype, it is likely that the reservoir was uncooked eggs or sauce made from raw eggs, and the food handler was implicated for inadequate cooking or poor kitchen hygiene techniques rather than for being infected and, by poor hand washing, contaminating the eggs and/or sauce.

Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. However, most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and are contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell is formed. - Mod.LL
