Algeria plans to prevent importation of Mali cattle
--------------------------------------------------------------
BAMAKO, Mali: The ambassador from Algeria to Bamako, alarmed by
information that Rift Valley Fever has appeared in Mali, has signified to
health authorities his intention to stop the importing of livestock from
that country. "There is no source of Rift Valley Fever in Mali [This
doesn't make much sense to me - MC; Unless he believes it came in over the
border - Mod.MHJ]. Meanwhile, the virus spreads," affirmed the press chief
from the Division of Hazards, Animal and Vegetable of the national
administration for rural support, Dr. Soumana Diallo.
Dr Diallo indicated that his service did not detect more than the clinical
symptoms of the disease, recognized as antibodies among certain animals.
"This says that the virus is present, but the illness has not manifested
itself," he remarked.
Rift Valley Fever was uncovered in Kenya. It appeared in West Africa for
the first time, in Mauritania, in 1997. It is transmitted to men and
animals by mosquitoes [It is worth noting that transmission of Rift Valley
fever virus to humans can also occur from contact with tissues and blood of
infected animals. - Man. Ed. DS]. According to specialists, the disease
manifests itself among animals by spontaneous abortion, and causes large
mortality among young animals. Humans who suffer from the fever [may]
experience convulsions, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and
nosebleeds. [Other complications include visual loss due to retinitis, and,
in patients with hemorrhagic disease, hematemesis, melena, gingival
bleeding, and death due to shock and hepatic failure. - Man. Ed. DS]
Recovery, he indicated, occurs after about 2 weeks. [The case-fatality rate
in human cases is approximately 1 to 2 percent, though it is on the order
of 10 percent in patients with hemorrhagic disease. - Man. Ed. DS]
