This is the source of the conflicting reports. Both are actually correct.
They have highlighted different parts of the CDC report. May 14, 1999 /
48(18);374-378
Update: Influenza Activity - United States and Worldwide, 1998-99 Season,
and Composition of the 1999-2000 Influenza Vaccine In collaboration with
the World Health Organization (WHO), the WHO international network of
collaborating laboratories, and state and local health departments, CDC
conducts surveillance to monitor influenza activity and to detect antigenic
changes in the circulating strains of influenza viruses. This report
summarizes surveillance for influenza in the United States and worldwide
during the 1998-99 influenza season and describes the composition of the
1999-2000 influenza vaccine.
United States
Influenza activity began to increase in mid-January 1999 and peaked during
the weeks ending February 6 through February 27. The predominant virus was
influenza A(H3N2), although influenza type B viruses also circulated widely
and were reported in all nine influenza surveillance regions. Influenza
A(H1N1) viruses were sporadically isolated during the season in six of nine
regions. During the weeks ending February 6 through February 27, 1999,
greater than 40 state and territorial epidemiologists reported widespread
or regional influenza activity*, with widespread activity first reported
from a state during the week ending January 16 and reported last during the
week ending April 10. Beginning the week ending January 23, the proportion
of patient visits to U.S. influenza sentinel physicians attributed to
influenza-like illness (ILI) increased above baseline levels (0-3%) to 4%
and remained elevated for 7 consecutive weeks. The proportion of visits for
ILI was at baseline levels in all surveillance regions by the week ending
March 20.
>From October 4, 1998, through May 1, 1999, WHO and National Respiratory and
Enteric Virus Surveillance System collaborating laboratories in the United
States tested 86,826 specimens for respiratory viruses; 12,993 (15%) were
positive for influenza. Of these, 10,041 (77%) were influenza type A, and
2952 (23%) were influenza type B. Of the 2501 subtyped influenza A viruses,
2481 (99%) were type A(H3N2), and 20 (1%) were type A(H1N1) ( Figure 1 ).
Beginning the week ending January 30, the proportion of deaths attributed
to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) reported by 122 U.S. cities exceeded the
epidemic threshold** for 12 consecutive weeks. During the week ending March
13, the proportion of deaths attributed to P&I peaked at 8.8% ( Figure 2 ).
Of the 327 U.S. A(H3N2) isolates collected from October 4 through May 1 and
antigenically characterized at CDC, 295 (90%) were similar to the 1998-99
A(H3N2) vaccine strain, A/Sydney/5/97, and 32 (10%) had antigenically
drifted from A/Sydney/5/97 based on hemagglutination inhibition testing.
Six U.S. influenza A(H1N1) isolates were characterized as
A/Bayern/7/95-like viruses, antigenically distinct from A/ Beijing/262/95,
the 1998-99 A(H1N1) vaccine strain; however, the 1998-99 A(H1N1) vaccine
strain produced high titers of antibodies that cross-react with
A/Bayern/7/95. All 180 antigenically characterized B isolates were similar
to the recommended type B vaccine strain, B/Beijing/184/93.
Worldwide
During October 1998-April 1999, influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated in
Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Israel, Japan, Korea, Latvia,
Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, Ukraine, and United
Kingdom. Influenza A(H3N2) isolates also were reported from Algeria,
Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, French Guiana,
Greece, Guam, Hungary, India, Italy, Malaysia, Martinique, the Netherlands,
Nepal, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Singapore,
South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand.
Influenza A(H1N1) viruses were isolated from sporadic cases in China,
Croatia, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Martinique, the Philippines,
Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, and Thailand. During
outbreaks in Peru in February and March, influenza A(H1N1) was the most
frequently isolated influenza virus type/ subtype. Other countries
reporting influenza type A viruses include Belgium, Iceland, Lithuania, and
Yugoslavia.
Influenza B isolates predominated in Belarus, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and
Taiwan. The number of influenza type B isolates was approximately equal to
the number of influenza type A isolates in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands,
and Switzerland. Outbreaks associated with influenza type B viruses were
reported in Brazil, French Guiana, and Japan. Influenza B viruses also were
reported in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia,
the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guam, Hong
Kong, Iceland, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Martinique, Nepal, Norway,
Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa,
Sweden, Thailand, United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia.
In April 1999, the first two cases of human influenza A(H9N2) illness were
identified among children hospitalized in March in Hong Kong, Special
Administrative Region, People's Republic of China. Case-patients were
girls, aged 1 and 4 years; both recovered from their illnesses.
Investigations are under way in Hong Kong to determine the potential impact
of this new subtype in humans. Surveillance in Hong Kong has been
maintained at enhanced levels since human influenza A(H5N1) infections were
identified in 1997. An additional five suspected human cases of H9N2
illness from Guangdong Province, China, were reported in March 1999 (1). No
human cases of influenza A(H5N1) illness have been identified since
December 1997.
Composition of the 1999-2000 Vaccine
The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biologic Products
Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) recommended that the 1999-2000 trivalent
vaccine for the United States contain A/Sydney/5/97-like(H3N2),
A/Beijing/262/95-like(H1N1), and B/Beijing/184/93-like viruses. This
recommendation was based on antigenic analyses of recently isolated
influenza viruses, epidemiologic data, and postvaccination serologic
studies in humans.
Most influenza A(H3N2) isolates were A/Sydney/5/97-like viruses. A small
percentage were distinguishable antigenically by
hemagglutination-inhibition testing. However, these viruses were
heterogeneous, and antigenic and genetic analysis did not reveal the
emergence of a representative variant. Therefore, A/Sydney/5/97 will be
retained as the influenza A(H3N2) 1999-2000 vaccine component.
A/Beijing/262/95-like (H1N1) viruses were identified in Asia and South
America and A/Bayern/7/95-like (H1N1) viruses were identified in Europe and
the United States during the preceding year. Persons who were vaccinated in
an experimental vaccine trial with A/Beijing/262/95 in 1998 developed
equivalent antibody levels against A/Bayern/ 7/95 and A/Beijing/262/95.
Because A/Beijing/262/95-like viruses produce a cross-reactive antibody
response to A/Bayern/7/95-like viruses, VRBPAC recommended retaining
A/Beijing/262/95 for the 1999-2000 vaccine.
Influenza type B isolates from all continents except Asia were similar to
B/Beijing/ 184/93, the 1998-99 recommended influenza B vaccine component.
In the United States, circulating influenza B viruses remained similar to
B/Beijing/184/93. Viruses antigenically related to the B/Victoria/2/87
reference strain were isolated in China, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand and
co-circulated with B/Beijing/184/93-like viruses in these countries.
However, B/Victoria/2/87-like viruses were not isolated outside of Asia.
For the United States, VRBPAC recommended retaining a B/Beijing/184/93-like
virus for the vaccine. Manufacturers will use the B/Yamanashi/16/98 strain
as the 1999-2000 influenza B vaccine component because of its growth
properties and its antigenic similarity to circulating
B/Beijing/184/93-like viruses.

Editorial Note:
Editorial Note: During the 1998-99 influenza season, both influenza A(H3N2)
and influenza B viruses circulated worldwide, and influenza A(H3N2)
predominated in the United States. This is the third consecutive year that
influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predominated in the United States and the
fourth consecutive year in which the proportion of deaths caused by P&I
reported by 122 U.S. cities was elevated for several consecutive weeks.
Overall, the 1998-99 influenza vaccine strains were well matched with the
circulating virus strains.
Although influenza epidemics generally peak during December-March each year
in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, sporadic cases of
influenza and occasionally large outbreaks can occur during the summer
(2,3). In temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, the influenza
season generally peaks during May-August. Influenza epidemics can occur any
time of the year in the tropics. Therefore, U.S. physicians should continue
to include influenza in the differential diagnosis of febrile respiratory
illness during the summer, particularly among travelers to the tropics or
Southern Hemisphere or among persons traveling with large international
groups.
The identification of two cases of human influenza A(H9N2) infection in
Hong Kong underscores the need for continued international virologic
surveillance for influenza and the timely subtyping of influenza type A
isolates. No plans exist to produce a vaccine against influenza A(H9N2).
However, several laboratories are working to develop a candidate vaccine
should the need arise.
Strains to be included in the influenza vaccine usually are selected during
the preceding January through March because of scheduling requirements for
production, quality control, packaging, distribution, and vaccine
administration before the onset of the next influenza season.
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for the
use of vaccine and antiviral agents for prevention and control of influenza
were published in an MMWR Recommendations and Reports on April 30, 1999 (4).
