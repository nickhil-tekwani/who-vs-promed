French baby milk formula maker Lactalis has ordered a global product recall over fears of salmonella contamination. Health authorities in France said 26 infants in the country have become sick since early December 2017. The recall affects products and exports to countries including Britain, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sudan. It covers hundreds of baby milk powder products marketed globally under the Milumel, Picot, and Celi brands.

Lactalis is one of the world's biggest dairy producers. Company spokesman Michel Nalet told AFP [Agence France-Presse] "nearly 7000 tons" of production may have been contaminated, but the company is currently unable to say how much remains on the market, has been consumed, or is in stock.

Lactalis believes the _Salmonella_ outbreak can be traced to a tower used to dry out the milk powder at its factory in the town of Craon in northwest France, according to AFP. All products made there since mid-February 2017 have been recalled and the company said precautionary measures have been taken to disinfect all of its machinery at the factory.

The recall expands a health scare that started at the beginning of December 2017 after 20 children in France under the age of 7 fell sick. At the time a limited recall was issued but regulators found the measures Lactalis had put in place to manage the contamination risk were "not sufficient."

The illness, caused by intestinal bacteria from farm animals, is dangerous for the very young and elderly because of the risk of dehydration.

It is not the 1st time the baby milk formula industry has been rocked by a health scare. 6 babies died and around 300 000 others fell ill in 2008 after Chinese manufacturers added the industrial chemical melamine to their infant milk powder products.

Baby milk maker Lactalis and French authorities have ordered a global recall of millions of products over fears of _Salmonella_ bacteria contamination. The French company, one of the largest dairy groups in the world, said it has been warned by health authorities in France that 26 infants have become sick since 1 Dec 2017.

According to a list published on the French health ministry's website, the recall affects customers in countries around the world, including: Britain and Greece in Europe, Morocco and Sudan in Africa, Peru and Colombia in South America, and Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China in Asia. The USA, a major market for Lactalis, is not affected. Company spokesman Michel Nalet told The Associated Press on [Mon 11 Dec 2017] that the "precautionary" recall affects "several million" products made since mid-February 2017.

Lactalis said in a statement that the 26 cases of infection were linked to products branded Picot SL, Pepti Junior 1, Milumel Bio 1, and Picot Riz. It said it is "sincerely sorry for the concern generated by the situation and expresses its compassion and support to the families whose children fell ill." The company said a possible source of the outbreak has been identified in a tower used to dry out the milk at a production site in May [2017]. Disinfection and cleaning measures have been put in place at the suspected site in western France.

The health scare started earlier this month [December 2017] when Lactalis was told that 20 infants under 6 months of age had been diagnosed with salmonella infection. The company ordered a 1st recall that has been extended to more products at the request of French authorities following new cases of infection.
