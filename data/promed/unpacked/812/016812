CDC [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states to investigate a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ serogroup O145 (STEC [EHEC] O145) infections. Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of _E. coli_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

The type of bacteria responsible for this outbreak is among those referred to as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). STEC bacteria are grouped by serogroups (such as, O157 or O145). The EHEC serogroup found most commonly in USA patients is _E. coli_ O157. Other serogroups in the EHEC group, including O145, are sometimes called "non-O157 EHECs". Some types of EHEC frequently cause severe disease, including bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is a type of kidney failure. Currently, there are limited public health surveillance data on the occurrence of non-O157 EHECs, including EHEC O145; many EHEC O145 infections may go undiagnosed or unreported. Compared with EHEC O157 infections, identification of non-O157 EHEC infections is more complex. First, clinical laboratories must test stool samples for the presence of Shiga toxins. Then, the positive samples must be sent to public health laboratories to look for non-O157 EHEC. Clinical laboratories typically cannot identify non-O157 EHEC. The EHEC O145 PFGE pattern in this outbreak has not been seen in PulseNet before.

Case count
----------
A total of 14 people infected with the outbreak strain of EHEC O145 infection have been identified in 6 states: Alabama (2), California (1), Florida (1), Georgia (5), Louisiana (4), and Tennessee (1). Among those for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 15 Apr 2012 to 12 May 2012. The time from the beginning of a patient's illness to the confirmation that he or she was part of an outbreak is typically about 2-3 weeks. Patients range in age from 1 year to 79 years old, with a median age of 33 years old; 79 per cent are female. 3 people have been hospitalized; 1 death has been reported in Louisiana.

Initial investigation information
---------------------------------
CDC initiated an investigation into this cluster of illnesses on 14 May 2012. At that time, 6 ill people had been reported to CDC PulseNet from 2 states during 3 May 2012 to 9 May 2012. Although the most recent report of an illness to CDC was on 4 Jun 2012, their onset of illness occurred before 10 May 2012 and was during same period as other ill people in this outbreak.

It has been about 4 weeks since the last illness onset among reported cases. Although this indicates that the outbreak could be over, CDC continues to work with state public health officials to identify additional cases and the source of these STEC O145 infections.

State public health officials have been interviewing ill persons to obtain information regarding foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week before illness. Based on interviews of 10 patients to date, a source for these infections has not been identified.

Initial laboratory testing information
--------------------------------------
Preliminary results indicate that this strain of _E. coli_ produces Shiga toxin type 2 and is susceptible to all antibiotics tested.
