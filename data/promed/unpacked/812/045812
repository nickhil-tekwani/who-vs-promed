At least 3 people in each household in Sindhuvalli village, 15 km (9.3 mi)
from Mysore, (off Mysore-Ooty Highway, located near the TVS Motor Company),
are suffering from a mysterious fever, which the villagers say, is similar
to chikungunya.
Though the doctors camping in the village have ruled out outbreaks of
malaria or typhoid based on the tests conducted on blood samples, the
number of those affected is constantly increasing, causing panic among the
villagers. The fever is spreading fast and there are reports that the
villagers are sending their children away from the village.
This correspondent, who visited Sindhuvalli on Thursday [14 Jun 2007],
found over 50 affected people at a health clinic waiting for treatment,
though a makeshift camp of Kadakola Public Health Centre (PHC) has been set
up in the village.
"I am getting 50 new cases every day. I am treating at least 80 cases a
day, including the previous ones. People have been suffering from high
fever, vomiting, and body pain for the past 20 days. Even after medication
and hospitalisation, the fever is not subsiding," said Vinod Kumar, a
private medical practitioner in the village.
A man has been on medicine for the past 15 days, but the fever, accompanied
by chills, severe head and body aches, has made his life miserable. "The
temperature and body ache will be severe in the evening," he said.
At Sindhuvalli, 187 cases have been detected following surveillance by 3
paramedical teams. The Widal tests (for typhoid) were negative and the
tests for confirming malaria were also negative. Though there is a mix of
symptoms of malaria, typhoid, and chikungunya (swelling of fingers and
legs) among the affected people, they have not been confirmed yet. The
doctors have also ruled out dengue.
The doctors are of the opinion that the fever could have been triggered by
some virus. Hence, symptomatic treatment is being given to the affected
persons. The villagers, who came in groups to vent their ire against
Kadakola Gram Panchayat over poor sanitation at Sindhuvalli, blamed the
panchayat [village council] for the deterioration of health in the village.
Meanwhile, the suspicion of villagers about possible contamination of
drinking water came true with water samples testing positive. "The tests
have confirmed water contamination and the fever could have been triggered
after villagers drank it," Nagarathna, medical officer, Kadakola PHC, said.
Water supply pipes were below open drains and sewage could have entered
them through the cracks causing contamination, the villagers alleged.
As a precautionary measure, halogen tablets are being distributed to
villagers and volunteers of the Health Department have launched an
awareness campaign.

[ProMED-mail requests additional information concerning the etiological
agent(s) that are involved in this outbreak as it becomes available. No
mention is made of diarrhea, which does not suggest enteropathogens. An
additional report published in the Star of Mysore
<http://www.starofmysore.com/main.asp?type=3Dnews&item=3D13358=20>, also
sent by Joseph Dudley, indicated that more than 2000 village residents have
suffered the fever, which is spreading widely, and that chikungunya virus
infection has been ruled out.
