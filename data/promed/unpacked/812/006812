Although the situation has not improved in the Bagazan community, Pachiza
district, which for weeks has been torn by an Oropuche fever epidemic, the
Ministry of Health has not taken any of the measures suggested to combat it.

On one hand, those responsible in Juanjul Health have requested the
declaration of a health emergency in Marscal Caceres. Meanwhile, Governor
Orlando Pinedo Vasquez and Mayor of Pachiza Segundo, Ruben Ruiz Weninger
have requested the installation of a field hospital in the community that
would not only serve for the treatment of the more than 200 affected
patients but would also avoid the spread [of the disease] to other areas of
the province. None of these suggestions have been carried out so far.

Residents indicate that there is no improvement in [the numbers?] of those
affected, and the numbers of cases are increasing.

[Juanjui is located in the department [state or province equivalent] of San
Martin, in northern Peru's Amazon region. Oropouche fever is the most
frequent cause of fevers of unknown origin in Amazonas. It occurs in
epidemics; however, it is a disease without major consequences. [The virus]
is transmitted by _Culicoides paraensis_; Oropouche virus is a Bunyavirus
and is named after a river on Trinidad Island. - Mod.LJS
