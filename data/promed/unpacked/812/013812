Monkeypox - Congo, Dem. Rep. (Mbuji-Mayi): 1999 20000428234058

Such laconic news as "315 deaths by monkeypox in 1999 in a mining city in
Democratic Republic of Congo", should not be published without some detail.
Monkeypox is a zoonosis among African tree squirrels (_Heliosciurus_,
_Funisciurus_). Human cases happen by direct contacts with ill animals
(trapping, chopping up...). Human to human subsequent cases are not very
frequent. The usual mode for this disease is anademic. There is no really
proved example of an important outbreak of monkeypox. You give 70 cases
with 6 deaths in 1996. This was the number given for an "outbreak" from
January to August 1996. Eleven cases were confirmed by isolation of the
monkeypox virus. All the cases were found in the North of Kasaï Oriental
which is the central province of he country. The epidemiologic
investigation in January 1997 confirmed three deaths and gave 92 possible
cases (case fatality rate 3.3%). From March to April 1997, 170 new cases
were notified. In October 1997, a new investigation found 304 probable
cases and 115 possible cases. This investigation was based on the answers
to a questionnaire. So there were 519 cases from January 1996 to October
1997 in this region with a case fatality rate of 1.5%. But 85% were less
than 15 and vaccination against smallpox, which gives a crossed
immunisation with monkeypox, was stopped since 1982. The age average should
have been higher. The human to human case rate was 78% which is much more
than usually. Did the virus mutate? In fact, it was told that the virus was
the same as in the 70's.
It is not possible to avoid the question of a confusion with chickenpox
(the investigators and WHO did mention it): the clinical diagnosis of
monkeypox is not so easy and chickenpox can be mistaken for monkeypox. The
acmes were in August 1996 and August 1997, in "dry" season (in Southern
hemisphere) which is the period of maximum transmission for airborne
diseases such as varicella. More, varicella which is considered as an
ordinary mild disease, can wear a very different clinical aspect and even
be a fatal disease for an immunodepressed organism. In DRC, the prevalence
rate of HIV is quite high.
It is not so easy to assess if monkeypox is really emerging or not. If it
was, it would be a great danger for humankind. We really need additional
information.

[Monkeypox is caused by a virus in the family Poxviridae, chickenpox by a
virus in the family Herpesviridae. Proper diagnosis would answer these
important questions.- Mod. CHC
