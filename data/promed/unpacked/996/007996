India toxic alcohol kills 50 in West Bengal
-------------------------------------------
More than 50 people have died after consuming toxic alcohol in India's
West Bengal state, police say. Several residents of the Magrahat,
Usthi and Mandirbazar areas in South 24 Parganas district fell ill
after drinking the alcohol on Tuesday night [13 Dec 2011]. 4 people
have been arrested. Some 100 others are being treated in hospital in
the Diamond Harbour area, with fears the death toll could rise.

Toxic alcohol deaths are a regular occurrence in India. Last week, the
state of Gujarat brought in a new law making the illegal manufacture
and sale of toxic alcohol there punishable by death.

Ransacked
---------
About 70 people are in a critical condition, state government minister
Shyamal Mandal told the BBC.

"More and more people are turning up with symptoms of liquor poisoning
and one local hospital is now overcrowded," district administrator NS
Nigam told the AFP news agency.

Gujarat is one state that has taken drastic action to try to prevent
toxic alcohol deaths. Some of the critically ill had been transferred
to Calcutta, he said. Medicine and doctors were being rushed to the
Diamond Harbour hospital.

4 breweries were ransacked after the deaths began to be reported, AFP
quoted officials as saying.

Illegal alcohol -- commonly called desi daroo or country-made liquor
in India -- usually costs as little as 10 rupees (20 US cents) and the
majority of the consumers are poor, daily-wage workers.

The liquor is usually spiked with methyl alcohol and industrial
spirits which can lead to fits, vomiting and death.

India has witnessed many incidents of toxic alcohol deaths.
- At least 10 people killed in Tamil Nadu in February 2010
- At least 30 people killed in Uttar Pradesh in September 2009
- Some 107 people killed in Gujarat in July 2009
Gujarat has taken the strongest action on toxic liquor with its new
law, which it says is intended to deter those involved in the illegal
trade.

Gujarat is the only state in India where alcohol is totally prohibited
by law.

Gujarat introduces death penalty for toxic alcohol
--------------------------------------------------
The illegal manufacture and sale of toxic alcohol in the western
Indian state of Gujarat will now be punishable by death. The governor
of the state, Kamala Beniwal, has given her assent to the new law
after keeping it on hold for more than 2 years. Gujarat has witnessed
many incidents of people dying after consuming poison alcohol. The
government says the law will deter those involved in the illegal
trade. Gujarat is the only state in India where alcohol is totally
prohibited by law.

The state legislative assembly passed the new stringent bill after
scores of people died in one incident in 2009. But the governor
refused to sign it into law. Correspondents say she wanted the
provision of the death penalty to be dropped from the bill, but the
state government did not agree.

It was then referred to the central government for "legal opinion,"
and the governor gave her approval only after getting the nod from
Delhi. The law will also allow the authorities to impound and auction
vehicles used for transporting contraband.

Poor victims
------------
Illegal alcohol -- commonly called desi daroo or country-made liquor
in Gujarat -- is usually sold in 200ml plastic pouches for 10 rupees
(20 cents) each. The majority of the consumers are poor, daily wage
workers.

The pouches are transported into the state's main city, Ahmedabad, by
couriers on motorcycles and scooters. Sometimes they slip into the
state capital carrying jerry cans containing the alcohol. The alcohol
is then sold from shantytown shacks which dot the city.

Local residents and journalists allege that the police are on the take
and collect "protection money" from the dealers.

Gujarat's toxic liquor is usually spiked with methyl alcohol and
industrial spirits which can lead to fits, vomiting and death.

[Methanol is a clear, colorless liquid with a faint odor like alcohol,
making it impossible to detect when mixed in alcohol.

Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the
developing world, where methanol is often a component of bootleg
alcohol, which is made in rural regions. Because of its low cost, it
is often consumed by those in lower socioeconomic classes, or is
mistaken for desired alcohol. Methanol has a relatively low toxicity,
hence the adverse effects are thought to result from the accumulation
of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. Formic acid
metabolism is very slow, therefore it accumulates in the body, leading
to metabolic acidosis.

Drinking methanol causes the same effects as excessive drinking, with
the addition of pronounced vision problems. However, after the effects
disappear, they reappear 6-30 hours later with much greater severity.
The most seriously poisoned lose consciousness and die of respiratory
or heart failure. Others may linger in a coma for as long as a week
and may be left blinded.

Initial symptoms occur 12-24 hours after ingestion and in general
correlate with the volume of methanol ingested and the amount of
ethanol concomitantly ingested. The minimal lethal dose is believed to
be 1 mg/kg body weight. Initial symptoms include disinhibition and
ataxia followed by headache, nausea, and vomiting or epigastric pain.
These are then followed by drowsiness, seizures, and eventually coma.
Visual symptoms like flashes of light, blurring, scotomas, and
scintillations occur and may progress to complete visual loss. Prompt
medical care is vital to avoid complications secondary to methanol
intoxication.

Supportive therapy is aimed at initiating airway management,
correcting electrolyte disturbances, and providing adequate hydration.
The metabolic acidosis may necessitate administration of bicarbonate
and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual
deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of
active formic acid. The amounts may be thought of as less than a
teaspoon of methanol can cause blindness and more than 4 teaspoons can
be fatal.

Antidote therapy is directed towards delaying methanol metabolism
until the methanol is eliminated from the system, either naturally or
via dialysis, often accomplished in 2 ways: ethanol or fomepizole.
Ethanol is also metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and the
enzyme has 10-20 times higher affinity for ethanol compared with
methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is
limited because of high costs and lack of availability.
