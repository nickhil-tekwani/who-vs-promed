An acute bacterial infection has killed thousands of crappies in
Pelican Lake near Ashby, MN. Dean Beck, Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) Fisheries Supervisor, said that reports of dead and
dying fish started coming in Sunday of Labor Day weekend [2 Sep
2007]. Dead fish were floating onto shoreline and diseased crappie
were lying on the surface of the water.
"Lab staff labeled the cause of death as Environmental Gill Disease,"
Beck said. "Fish folks call the bacterial infection Columnaris, after
the name of the bacteria _Flexibacter columnaris_.
DNR staff from the Glenwood area office captured some dying fish and
shipped them to the DNR pathology laboratory in St. Paul, MN, to
diagnose the cause of the fish kill. Beck was able to confirm the
crappie died from a bacteria attacking their gills, preventing
crappie from taking in oxygen from the water.
According to Beck, who is based in Glenwood and whose fish management
area includes Douglas, Grant, Pope and Stevens counties, certain fish
are more likely to be infected.
"Unfortunately, crappie is one of those fish," he said. "Once an
outbreak starts it's highly contagious to other crappie and can
spread quickly. It's common to see some dead fish floating around the
lake during the spring and early summer, but this was a very severe event."
He said the DNR estimates thousands of crappie were lost to the
disease outbreak. Most dead crappie were young, but 10- to 15-inch
crappie were also observed.
"I'd much rather see these fish on the end of someone's line than
feeding gulls," Beck said.
The bacteria, according to Beck, is naturally occurring and not
harmful to humans. He said that fish kills occur when susceptible
fish are weakened by some environmental stress.
Beck indicated that Pelican Lake's crappie population was likely
stressed from rapid water temperature changes that occurred during
the week preceding the Labor Day weekend.
"Temperatures dropped into the mid-60s and rapidly increased back to
the mid-70s," he said. "Once their immune system weakens, the fish
are vulnerable to such secondary infections. A columnaris outbreak
can be treated in an aquarium, but there aren't ways to prevent or
treat an outbreak in a large lake."
Beck said the DNR will complete some follow-up survey work to assure
adequate survival of adult fish to rebuild population density. This
was a big kill, but it would be very unlikely that it was a complete kill.
"Assuming good numbers of adult crappie remain, they'll be very
successful in producing lots of young crappie in 2008 to fill the
void created by the fish kill," Beck said. "The kill was big enough
that anglers will feel the pain, but crappie are resilient. They'll be back."
In a related issue, a large numbers of channel catfish have died in
the Red River. Cause of the fish kill has not yet been determined,
but according to Beck, its likely the same bacterial bug.
"Scaleless fish such as catfish are also susceptible to bacterial
infections," he said. "Columnaris outbreaks are a problem --
especially in catfish farms in southern states."
A Grand Forks angler who spotted dead catfish over the weekend [8-9
Sep 2007] along the Red River notified wildlife officials. The dead
fish have ranged in size from five inches to 30 inches. Some appear
to have died recently, while others have been dead for several days.
A few of the fish had lesions on their skin.
Lynn Schlueter, Red River fisheries biologist with the North Dakota
Game and Fish Department, said he traveled about 15 miles of river by
boat south of Grand Forks and encountered dead catfish the entire way.
He agreed with Beck and said the nature of the die-off suggests a
disease such as columnaris, a highly contagious bacterial infection
that includes skin lesions.
"I don't know if it's my imagination or not, but the fish I've been
catching lately seem sluggish," Red River fishing guide Larry Kyllo
said to the Associated Press. "We pulled in a 24-pounder here a few
weeks back, and a bigger fish like that usually heads to the bottom.
This one didn't even fight. It just laid on the surface.''

There does not seem to be a firm diagnosis in this case. However,
believing that it may be columnaris, a synopsis is presented below.
Columnaris, first described by Herbert Spencer Davis in 1922, is one
of the oldest known diseases of warm water fish. References to the
disease can be confusing. The causative bacterium has been referred
to by different names including _Bacillus columnaris_, _Flexibacter
columnaris_, _Cytophaga columnaris_, and most recently
_Flavobacterium columnare_.
Fish with columnaris usually have brown to yellowish-brown lesions
(sores) on their gills, skin and/or fins. The bacteria attach to the
gill surface, grow in spreading patches, and eventually cover
individual gill filaments. This results in cell death. Portions of
the gills are eroded by protein and cartilage-degrading enzymes
produced by the bacteria. Skin lesions produced by columnaris
initially are very shallow and may appear as an area that has lost
its natural shiny appearance. More advanced lesions may be round or
oval in shape, yellowish-brown in color, with an open ulcer in the
center. A characteristic lesion produced by columnaris is a pale
white band encircling the body, often referred to as saddleback
condition. As the infection progresses, a yellowish-brown ulcer often
is found in the center of the "saddle." Additionally, it is not
unusual to find a yellowish-brown, mucus-like growth of columnaris
bacteria inside the fish's mouth.
Columnaris bacteria probably occur in most, if not all, aquaculture
environments. The bacteria can cause disease under normal culture
conditions, but more likely when fish are stressed. Stressful
conditions favoring columnaris disease include low oxygen, high
ammonia, high nitrite, high water temperatures, rough handling, and
mechanical injury.
Columnaris can enter the fish through the gills, mouth, or via small
wounds on the skin. The disease is highly contagious and may be
spread through contaminated nets, specimen containers, and even food.
Columnaris can be external or internal and may follow a chronic or
acute course. Lesions in chronic cases progress slowly, taking many
days before culminating in fish death. In acute cases the lesions
spread quickly, often wiping out entire populations of fish within
hours. High water temperatures accelerate the progression of the disease.
