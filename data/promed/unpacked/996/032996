Bites prompt state agency to warn Beaufort County residents about threat
--------------------------------------------------
A 4 year old girl was treated in hospital this week after she was attacked
by a rabid raccoon while playing with other children outside her Hilton
Head Plantation home. She was treated for exposure to rabies, hospitalized
with an infected bite, and underwent surgery at Hilton Head Regional
Medical Center, said her father.
The child was bitten repeatedly and scratched by a raccoon on Sunday
afternoon. The animal was killed and its carcass tested positive for rabies
on Wednesday, said South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental
Control spokeswoman Clair Boatwright.
The victim's father said his family was decorating their Bayley Point Lane
house for Christmas on Sunday. The victim, her 7 year old sister, and a
friend went to play on a swing set in the back yard while the father hung
Christmas lights in the front. "They started walking around the house and
then they started screaming," he said. When he ran to see what was wrong,
he found his daughter on the ground being attacked a raccoon. He kicked the
animal and scooped the girl up.
Neighbors heard the screams too and came running. They took care of his
daughter and washed her bites while he got a gun and killed the raccoon.
The father took his daughter to the emergency room, reported the case to
the health department, and gave them the animal's body.
The girl suffered bites to her ear, hand and wrists and scratches on her
face, head and neck. Her father was suspicious that the animal might have
rabies after the girls described its unprovoked daylight attack. He took
his daughter home from the hospital on Sunday night, but she was readmitted
the next day after getting a secondary infection from one of the bites. She
had to have surgery to clean a bite on her ear and was recovering at home
on Thursday. "She's doing great," her father said. "She's back to her
normal self." Meanwhile, DHEC is urging Beaufort County residents of all
ages to avoid wild or stray animals.
"Rabies is 100 per cent fatal if the disease is contracted," Boatwright
said. "Merely being exposed does not mean the disease will be contracted
but it is DHEC's responsibility to monitor the disease (and) provide
vaccine [post exposure prophylaxis, PEP] to those who are exposed to rabies
in order to prevent the disease from being contracted."
There have been 7 confirmed cases of rabies reported in Beaufort County
animals so far in 2004 -- more than twice as many as in all of 2003. 5 of
the infected animals have been raccoons. A rabid fox bit a Bluffton woman
in Shults Park on May 17 and a rabid stray cat was found in Port Royal on
May 24.
Rabies is a fatal viral disease that attacks nerve and brain tissue. It can
be spread among mammals through saliva, usually via bites. Anyone bitten,
scratched or exposed to the saliva of a rabid animal must undergo immediate
medical treatment to prevent the virus from reaching the brain, said Sue
Ferguson of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health.
"If you are bitten or scratched by a wild animal or domestic pet,
immediately wash the wound with plenty of soap and water," Ferguson said.
"Be sure to get medical attention and make sure the incident is reported to
your local DHEC environmental health office at the county public health
department."
Be particularly leery of wild animals that appear to be tame, night animals
out in the daytime, pets which seem to have difficulty walking, eating or
drinking and signs of excitement or meanness in any animal. "If you see a
nocturnal animal during the day, it's best to get away from that animal,"
Boatwright said. "Even if it appears to be acting sickly, it can run pretty
quickly, especially animals like foxes and such."
Parents should also talk to their children about rabies and warn them
against trying to pet or help a wild animal. If they spot a wild animal in
their yards, they should go inside and tell a parent immediately,
Boatwright said. Vaccinating pets is the best way to protect them and
humans. "State law requires that all pets be vaccinated against rabies and
we strongly encourage residents to make sure their own pets have been
vaccinated to protect both the pets and their owners," Ferguson said.
Wild animals account for about 93 per cent of rabies cases. The disease is
most commonly found in raccoons, skunks, bats, foxes and coyotes. Only 3
cases of rabid animals were reported in Beaufort County last year. All
involved raccoons. About 400 South Carolinians must undergo preventative
treatment for rabies each year after being bitten. There were 276 confirmed
rabies cases in animals statewide in 2003.

PEP, the health department is involved. It is stated that an exposed victim
needs PEP, so it was probably given. - Mod.TG]
