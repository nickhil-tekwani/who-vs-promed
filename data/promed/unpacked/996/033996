According to Jorge Gomez Benavides, the official responsible for
zoonoses in the general directorate of epidemiology of the Ministry
of Health [MINSA], more than 20 persons have died from rabies
transmitted by the bite of hematophagous bats in Puno and Madre de
Dios.
Gomez Benavides indicated that between July [2006] and 15 Feb [2007],
health networks of Mazuko (Madre de Dios), San Gaban (Puno), and
Huepetuhe (Madre de Dios) reported 27, 370, and 130 cases of vampire
bat bites respectively, for a total of 527 [people].
Of the total of [individuals] affected, there have been 23 reported
cases of rabies transmitted by bat bites since last December [2006]:
17 from Lechemayo, Ayapata (Puno) District and 6 from Vuelta Grande
in the Huepethue District.
It is assumed that the 23 people who died from this disease did so
because they failed to go to health facilities for treatment after
having been attacked [by the bats]. According to a specialist,
because of the large distances in this area and the difficulty of
access, these individuals went to health centers after symptoms had
already appeared or in the days previous to the initiation of
symptoms.
Gomez Benavides indicated that [bat bites] frequently occur during
the night and that these hematophagous bats prefer to bite [feed] on
the heads when their victims are children, and on the toes in the
case of adults. He added, "If the bite is on the head, the incubation
period of the rabies virus is shorter than when [the bite] is on the
feet."
He remarked that in the case of a bite, the desired [action] is to
wash the wound with soap and water and to go immediately to the
closest health center to receive anti-rabies treatment, provided at
no cost.
As a preventive measure, MINSA will continue the vaccination campaign
for affected persons in areas located 20 km. around the initial
rabies outbreak, which began in Vuelta Grande and in Lechemayo Chico.
Gomez Benavidez said that the main risk factor for bat bites is the
construction of unprotected housing -- that permits the access of
vampire [bats]--, [characteristic] of gold mining camps, or in
population centers. He added that ecological changes may have
unleashed the outbreak. The [housing] in these camps, consists only
of plastic and wood or leaf [thatched] roofs, practically without
walls, which facilitates [bat] bites of the miners.
Recommendations:
- avoid bat bites by placing wire screens, preferably in sleeping areas.
- use bed nets, avoiding contact with the net sides, as a vampire
[bat] can bite through the material.
- when dealing with a bat bite, immediately wash the wound with lots
of soap and water, then go immediately to the nearest health center
for anti-rabies treatment.
- persons in the Huepetuhe e Inambari (Madre de Dios) y Ayapata
(Puno) Districts who suffered [bat] bites between July [2006] and
February [2007], should go to health units to receive anti-rabies
treatment.

[The area of this outbreak is in the tropical Peruvian Amazonian
lowlands. Presumably the vampire bat involved is _Desmodus rotundus_.
This bat usually prefers to feed on cattle and horses, making one
wonder if these larger species are unavailable in the areas of this
outbreak, or if larger domestic animals have been removed recently
from these areas, leaving humans as an accessible alternative host.
An image of _D. rotundus_ can be seen at

of Madre de Dios and Puno in the southeast, bordering Bolivia, and
