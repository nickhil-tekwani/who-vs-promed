African swine fever strikes collective farm
-------------------------------------------
Veterinary officials on Thursday [19 Mar 2009] confirmed an outbreak
of African swine fever [ASF] at a collective farm in the southern
Stavropol region, the 3rd such incident in the area since October
[2008].

A Moscow region lab confirmed that pigs at the Lenin kolkhoz
[collective farm] were infected with the disease. A team of
veterinarians, law enforcement officers and Emergency Situations
Ministry officials were working in the quarantine zone, and police
are guarding entrances to the farm, local news agencies reported.

The disease, which has largely been eradicated outside sub-Saharan
Africa, has caused serious damage in the agricultural Stavropol
region since an outbreak was confirmed there in October [2008]. More
than 18 000 pigs there have been culled or died of the disease since,
Rossiiskaya Gazeta said on its website Thursday [19 Mar 2009]. The
Gazeta newspaper reported Thursday that officials were also trying to
contain a suspected outbreak in South Ossetia.

African swine fever is not dangerous to humans.

A local Emergency Situations Ministry official said that about 50
pigs had died at the farm in the Kievka [Kiyevka] village, Interfax
reported. Roughly 2700 pigs -- most of them at private farms -- are
within the quarantine zone, a local veterinary official told the news
agency.

A major outbreak in the Caucasus in 2007 was blamed on wild boars,
and Georgian officials had to cull 30 000 pigs after the United
Nations warned that the outbreak could cause an economic disaster.

In January [2009], some 7000 pigs were culled after the disease was
detected at another Stavropol region farm. Sochi, in the neighboring
Krasnodar region, said at the time that it had allotted RUB 4 million
(USD 118 000) to contain a smaller outbreak there.

In February [2009], 4 workers at a Stavropol collective farm -- also
named after Lenin -- were found guilty of veterinary violations and
fined RUB 50 000 to 60 000 [USD 1480-1770].

[Following its initial introduction into Georgia, probably through
the Black Sea Georgian harbour of Poti, during the 1st quarter of
2007, ASF has been continuously spreading in the Caucasus region,
continuing its northwards march in south Russia. Initially affecting
the territories of Georgia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, and
Azerbaijan, ASF penetrated Russia in November 2007. The distance from
the current outbreak, in Kievka (Kiyevka), to the Ukrainian border,
on its north west, is about 350 km (218 mi).

The Russian epizootic has, by now, been reported from the territories
of Chechnya, North Ossetia-Alania, Ingushetia, Orenburg (outside the
Caucasus; reportedly, wildlife affected), the Stavropolskiy Kray
(Stavropol), and the Krasnodarskiy Kray (Krasnodar). As of 16 Jan
2009 (most recent, 13th follow-up report), the total number of
outbreaks reported to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)
by Russia since the start of its epizootic on 5 Nov 2007, had reached
50.

An update of the situation, in a new follow-up report, is
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
