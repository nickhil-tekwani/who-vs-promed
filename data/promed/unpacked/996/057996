Leishmaniasis outbreak in Iraq
-----------------------------------------
Health officials in Iraq are concerned following an outbreak of the
parasitic disease cutaneous leishmaniasis in Baqubah, some 120 km from the
capital Baghdad, with as many as 250 new cases reported in the last 2
weeks. Dr Abdul Jalil Nafi, director of the Infectious Diseases Control
Centre (IDCC), told IRIN in Baghdad, that the discovery of such a high
number was extremely worrying and that they feared that there could be an
epidemic if prevention and control programmes were not put in place
immediately.
Leishmaniasis is a disabling disease transmitted by the bite of the female
sandfly. Dogs and other animals act as a source of infection which the
flies spread to humans. Rodents, especially certain species of rats, are
considered the main carriers. The disease leads to disfigurement of the
face and hands, and social stigma, particularly for women and children.
Known locally as the "Baghdad sore," leishmaniasis is linked to poor social
conditions, especially in areas lacking sanitation and waste disposal.
Baqubah has been suffering from poor sewage treatment and accumulation of
rubbish in many areas around the city.
"The biggest problem that we are having now is related to the poor hygiene
in the area, and it's something out of the control of the Ministry of
Health. We depend on the cooperation of other ministries to help in the
cleaning up of the city to prevent the proliferation of the flies," Nafi said.
The doctor added that many areas in Iraq were suffering from poor hygiene
and that poor distribution of information on prevention was compounding the
problem. He explained that the most common type of leishmaniasis was urban,
which is transmitted by human contact. The rural type comes from the
interaction of humans with rodents, and in poor hygiene areas the presence
of rodents was very high, worsening the situation.
According to Dr Husseiny Sami, an infection specialist at the main hospital
of Baqubah, the large increase in cases in such a time frame was not
common. "We haven't had such a large number of cases in our city before and
this makes the situation worse. We are offering treatment here but with
this increase we require much more medicine to be offered, as most of the
families cannot afford treatments," he explained.
Prolonged systemic treatment may be necessary for the disease, according to
Sami and, in endemic areas, sandflies should be controlled by spraying
homes with insecticide. He added that rubbish heaps, which are breeding
areas for sandflies, should be eliminated. Dr Nabil Amin, head of the World
Health Organization (WHO) in Iraq, told IRIN that although an increase
could be expected during this season in the country, the numbers were
larger than predicted. "We are supporting the IDCC with insecticides,
instruments, lab materials for the tests and training to provide more
efficient and fast diagnosis of the disease," Amin added.
The WHO has been working in partnership with Kimadia, Iraq's formerly
state-run pharmaceutical company, to cover needs in the country. "All our
efforts could come to nothing if the government doesn't take urgent action
to reduce sewage on the streets and repair the water purification system in
the country because, without it, the doors will still be open for the
appearance of new diseases," Nafi maintained.

[The situation of visceral leishmaniasis in Iraq was commented on by Dr.
Philippe Desjeux, Department of Communicable Disease,Surveillance and
Response, (CDS/CSR), WHO] in the ProMED posting on the subject from 2
Jun 2003: "There is no real outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis but an
accumulation of untreated cases. The transmission season is from May to
October with a major risk of transmission in September/October and, due to
the incubation time, cases are mainly detected from November to April. Due
to the pre-war situation and the lack of drugs during this period,
accumulated cases of transmission that occurred last year are seen now.
UNICEF and WHO have recently sent a large quantity of drugs." ProMED
assumes that this is still a precise description of the situation also
regarding cutaneous leishmaniasis. - Mod.EP]
