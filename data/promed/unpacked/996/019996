Anthrax Confirmed in South Dakota
---------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed as the cause of recent death loss in a Stanley County [South Dakota] cattle herd. State Veterinarian Dr. Dustin Oedekoven says that two 11-month-old replacement heifers died suddenly last week. A local veterinarian who was called to the ranch suspected anthrax, which was later confirmed by laboratory testing. The group of replacement heifers was not vaccinated, while the rest of the cow herd has a good vaccination history.

Dr. Oedekoven says that, while this is not the typical time of year that anthrax cases appear, it is likely that the unseasonably warm and dry weather conditions have contributed to the infection in this herd.

Anthrax spores survive indefinitely in contaminated alkaline soils and nearly all areas of South Dakota have the potential of experiencing an outbreak under ideal climatic conditions. Significant climate change, such as drought, floods and winds, can expose anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Livestock producers should be aware that anthrax should be suspected in cases of sudden death loss. Affected animals are often found dead with no prior illness detected. An effective vaccine is available to protect livestock from anthrax, and producers across the state should consult their veterinarians regarding appropriate vaccination protocols.

Strict enforcement of quarantines and proper disposal of carcasses from livestock suspected to have died from anthrax is important to prevent further soil contamination with the bacterial spores.

[These 2 heifers died on Wednesday (18 Mar 2015) and Friday (20 Mar 2015) of last week. They had not been vaccinated. They had been held in a feed lot and fed hay. The surviving 9 have been moved out and vaccinated. An adjoining lot of 25 pregnant cows was not vaccinated as they are due to calve shortly -- at this point of pregnancy any upset can result in miscarriages -- but are being observed closely. They had been vaccinated in previous years. The hay is due to be checked for contamination with anthrax spores. While out of season (e.g., not during the summer) outbreaks can follow from grazing, it is much more likely to be from contaminated hay, silage, or a commercial feed. This hay was grown on cropland, not a hay meadow, on the same farm, and therefore, if found, should genetically match what we know or don't know about outbreaks in that part of South Dakota. This is complicated by the fact that under the present federal regulations the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at South Dakota State University in Brookings is not allowed to hold or transfer any diagnostic cultures. Such is the forward thinking of USDA in support of forensic tracing and the fear of cultures going sideways. Present genetic analyses are very precise and allow for very informative mapping. Premature incineration aborts that ability and insight.

Livestock and wildlife anthrax is truly sporadic in South Dakota. For a county map of South Dakota, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/southdakota_90.jpg. Stanley County is in the central part of the state and on the west bank of Lake Oahe. - Mod.MHJ
