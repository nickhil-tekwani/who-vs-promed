The following background data on Leptospirosis in Thailand were
abstracted from GIDEON <http://www.GideonOnline.com>.
Primary references available on request:
Leptospirosis was 1st reported in Thailand in 1985. Disease rates
increase during the rainy season as a result of wading through
contaminated water. Most cases occur among agricultural workers,
notably rice producers.
The graph shows incidence rate and cases/100 000 of leptospirosis
from 1988 to 2004. For graph, see
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Thailand-Leptospirosis.jpg>.
55 to 272 cases per year were officially reported during 1982 to 1995
(mean rate 0.3 per 100 000).
1992 - Included 776 hospitalized cases.
1997 - Included 111 fatal cases. The disease rate was 16 per 100 000
in Nakhornratchasrima Province.
1998 - Included 102 fatal cases, with several hundred cases (22
fatal) in the area of Prae and Surin provinces.
1999 - Included 136 fatal cases.
Rates in the northeastern region were 0.30 per 100 000 in 1995, 3.9
per 100 000 in 1998.
Prevalence surveys:
1.1 percent of acute febrile illness seen in Thai hospitals (1991 to 1993)
17 percent of febrile adults on the Thai-Myanmar border (1999 to 2002)
36.9 percent of unexplained acute febrile illness (2001 to 2002)
Case fatality rates as high as 4.4 are reported.
_Leptospira interrogans_ serovar. bataviae predominates in Bangkok,
and serovar. autumnalis in rural areas. Serovars. icterohaemorrhagiae
and javanica are also encountered.
The principal reservoirs in this country are rats and dogs. 11
percent of dogs in Chiang Mai are seropositive (2004).
Notable outbreaks:
1999 - An outbreak (43 cases) was reported among persons involved in
cleaning a pond.
2005 - An outbreak (10 cases) was reported in Kalasin (northeastern region).
