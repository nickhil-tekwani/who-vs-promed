Via: USDA press release

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has prohibited the importation into the
United States of live birds and poultry from Norway and Northern Ireland
because of recent outbreaks of exotic Newcastle disease in chicken flocks.
This action also restricts the importation of products of poultry, game
birds, and other birds from Norway and Northern Ireland.
Exotic Newcastle disease has not infected domestic chicken flocks in
the United States since 1974. APHIS will consider declaring a country free
of exotic Newcastle disease if the country has no reported cases of the
disease for at least one year.
Notice of this interim rule is scheduled for publication in the
April 18 Federal Register and became effective April 15. Consideration will
be given to comments on the interim rule received
on or before June 17. An original and three copies should be sent to
Docket No. 97-021-1, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS,
Suite 3C03, 4700 River Road Unit 118, Riverdale, Md. 20737-1238.
Comments may be reviewed at USDA, Room 1141, South Building, 14th Street
and Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C., between
8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons
wishing to review comments are requested to call ahead at (202)690-2817 to
facilitate entry into the comment reading room.

The first mention of this was acctually in Feburary and at that time it
included Great Britain:
Federal Register: February 7, 1997 (Volume 62, Number 26)]
[Page 5741-5742]
AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.
ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments.
SUMMARY: We are amending the regulations by removing Great Britain from the
list of countries that are considered to be free of exotic
Newcastle disease. We are taking this action based on reports we have
received from the Office International des Epizooties and Great
Britain's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, which confirm
that an outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease has occurred in Great
Britain. This action restricts the importation of live birds, poultry, and
poultry products into the United States from Great Britain.
