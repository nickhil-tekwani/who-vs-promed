Brazil, in the grips of its latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth (FMD), is
likely to keep the disease from reaching the levels witnessed over the last
month in neighboring Argentina and Uruguay, industry experts said.
Brazil has been fighting FMD for over half a century and is methodically
addressing the latest setback which both government and independent experts
say should be contained without losses getting much worse.
Only the cattle in Brazil's southern ranching circuit -- Rio Grande do Sul
and Santa Catarina states -- are at risk of contracting the disease. These
states had stopped vaccinating. The cattle here ended the vaccination
rounds in April, 2000. Although antibodies in adults are reported to last
for 2 years, the length of immunity is unknown in calves. Consequently,
calves born after vaccinations stopped are susceptible to the disease.
The former state, where the outbreaks occurred, has only 13 million head
out of Brazil's 167 million head. The rest of the nation's herd is
currently under a vaccination program and the bulk of them graze in the
Center-West circuit.
The government locked down the two infected farms in Rio Grande do Sul
state and cut livestock traffic out of the state. The military patrols the
country's border with the infected nations to the south - Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay.
Of Brazil's annual 6.65 million tonne beef production about 90 percent is
consumed domestically, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and at least
half of its beef exports are unaffected by the disease because they are
cooked and canned.
Santa Catarina, just north of Rio Grande do Sul, remains Brazil's great
hope and should be able to continue exporting its fresh beef so long as it
remains FMD free without vaccine as it has for the last year. But the
division between the 2 states will be under scrutiny in the coming month
when the International Epizootic Office (OIE) in Paris assesses the recent
outbreaks in the southern cone of South America. The OIE sets world
sanitary standards and grants bills of health to countries' livestock
industries.
