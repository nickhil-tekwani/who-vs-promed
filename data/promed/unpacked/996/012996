Sightings of several dead deer are being reported but are not uncommon, according to officials with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency [TWRA], due to a yearly string of bluetongue cases.

The sickness is called hemorrhagic disease [HD] and reaches various levels of severity each year, the agency reported [Mon 21 Aug 2017], but a predominant number of cases have been catalogued in East Tennessee and are part of a larger multi-state outbreak involving several nearby states.

At least 20 counties in the region have reported HD among deer and the number of cases places it in the above-average category. "So far the intensity of the outbreak seems to be localized," said TWRA Wildlife Health Program leader Roger Applegate. "We don't anticipate this outbreak to rival that of 2007, but it is still early and we're actively monitoring the situation."

HD is caused by a virus that is transmitted to deer from biting midges or "no-seeums", the agency said. The virus is not transmitted from deer to deer and is usually fatal within 5 to 10 days if the deer is able to survive the fever, respiratory distress and other symptoms.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) or bluetongue virus (BTV) groups (Reoviridae: Orbivirus), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in the United States. In North America there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2 and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13 and 17). Isolated cases BT viruses from infected deer were 1st reported in 1968, although white tail deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886. - Mod.PMB
