[This is an unusual situation because the report does not contain
completed test results which are, in fact, still pending.
Foot-and-mouth disease does present distinct enough clinical picture
so that disease can very cautiously be put into the vesicular disease
group, after excluding things like trauma or toxic exposures. However,
foot-and-mouth disease and vesicular stomatitis cannot be
distinguished from each other in ruminants and pigs. For pigs,
vesicular exanthema and swine vesicular disease also produce difficult
to differentiate vesicular lesions. Thus, the follow up reports which
will confirm foot-and-mouth disease are essential.

The location of the outbreak can be seen appended to the OIE WAHID
report cited above. The outbreak is located in the southern part of
the country, not too far from South Africa, Swaziland, and the Indian
Ocean. - Mod.PC]
