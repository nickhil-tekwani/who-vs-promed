[According to the Saudi Ministry of Health coronavirus update page, there have been a total of 339 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 102 deaths. The most recent WHO global tally had a total of 261 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 93 deaths as reported on 26 Apr 2014.

Noteworthy in the above report of 16 new cases and 8 deaths is:
- 4 of the cases were admitted to the hospital for other health issues and then after hospitalization developed respiratory illness.
- 9 of the 16 reported cases were in Health Care workers (3 doctors and 6 nurses).
- 1 of the cases was a 9-month-old child, the 1st documented infection in a young child.
- It appears as though the city of Tabuk, located in the northwest of the country (near the border with Jordan) has had nosocomial transmission, as 6 of the 9 Health Care workers who were positive for MERS-CoV infection were located in Tabuk, working at the Prince Fahd bin Sultan Hospital.
