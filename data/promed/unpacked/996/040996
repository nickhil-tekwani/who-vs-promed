Russia: 5 HFR deaths in Bashkortostan
---------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of 2006, 5 fatalities from hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS) have been recorded in the Republic of
Bashkortostan, which is one of 3 natural foci of HFRS (mouse fever)
virus in the world, according to Gennadiy Minin, head of the Center
of Hygiene and Epidemiology in the Republic. At a press conference on
Fri 20 Oct 2006, he stated that the situation regarding HFRS
morbidity in Bashkortostan remained difficult, but controllable. From
the beginning of this year [2006], more than 2000 cases of HFRS have
been recorded in the region; 5 patients with the severe form of the
disease are receiving intensive care, and 4 require kidney dialysis treatment.

Marked increases in HFRS-related morbidity are being recorded for the
1st time in other regions of Russia, in particular in Chuvashia,
where morbidity is approaching that observed in Bashkortostan, and in
the Orenburg region [oblast] [to the south of it]. Minin stated that
... the "red field vole" (_Clethrionomys glareolus_) [is] the main
vector of HFRS virus in Bashkortostan.

Bashkortostan is one of 3 foci of HFRS virus, the other 2 being the
Primorsk region of Russia, and South Korea. An abundance of deciduous
(lime) trees and suitable weather conditions favor the spread of the
red field-vole in these regions. The peak of HFRS morbidity occurred
in 1997, when 9000 persons fell ill and 34 died. The average cost of
treatment of a patient is 12-20 000 rubles [USD 447-745].

Rodent control measures around and in houses (supplemented by
poisoning) remains the sole means of combating the red field vole,
the vector of HFRS. About 4 700 000 rubles [USD 175 000] have been
allocated from the budget of the Republic for this purpose in 2006.
However, as the head of the Center of Hygiene and Epidemiology
observed, payment of much of the funding has been delayed, preventing
epidemiologists from deploying appropriate control measures in time.

Diagnosis of HFRS has been a problem in the past. Scientists in
Bashkortostan have devoted many years to development of rapid
diagnostics. Now, however, a rapid diagnostic technique developed by
the Tarasevich Institute of Standardization and Control (Moscow) has
passed clinical tests and is available for use. Scientists say that
the system has no equivalent elsewhere and will allow diagnosis of
HFRS by the 8th day after onset of infection.

[The level of HFRS morbidity in Ufa -- the capital of Bashkortostan
-- this year (2006) is 2-3-fold higher than last year:
<http://www.mkset.ru/news/nonstop/5994/>. During the last month
(October 2006), the number of patients suffering from HFRS in
Bashkortostan had increased by more than 300. The peak of HFRS
morbidity usually occurs during September/October, and a further
increase in the number of HFRS patients must be expected. Last year
(2005), a total of 2300 people contracted HFRS in the Republic. It is
very probable that this year morbidity will be higher.

The total area of the Republic of Bashkortostan is 143 000 sq. km
(0.8 percent of the total area of Russia), and its capital is Ufa.
Bashkortostan occupies a large part of the Southern Urals, and
adjoining it are plains. In the north, Bashkortostan borders the Perm
and Sverdlovsk regions; in the east the Chelyabinsk region; in the
southeast, the south and southwest, the Orenburg region; in the west,
the Republic of Tatarstan; and in the northwest, the Udmurt Republic. - Mod.NP]

[The genus _Hantavirus_ is one of the 5 genera comprising the family
_Bunyaviridae_, a group of negative-stranded RNA viruses with
tripartite genomes. The hosts of hantaviruses are primarily rodents,
and each genetically distinct hantavirus is usually associated with a
single rodent species. Hantaviruses cause persistent non-pathogenic
infections of their rodent hosts. Human infection is incidental to
viral survival and is almost always a dead end in the infection
chain. Unlike viruses of the other genera of the family
_Bunyaviridae_, the hantaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods.
The virus responsible for these outbreaks of HFRS in the
Bashkortostan Republic likely belongs to the species _Puumala virus_.
