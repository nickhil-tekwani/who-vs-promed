Rabies virus now confirmed in Bali's cattle and pig stocks
----------------------------------------------------------
Bali University officials have confirmed that rabies virus is now present
in the island's cattle and swine populations. Bali's continuing battle with
rabies entered a new and concerning phase with the news that evidence of
the deadly virus has been found in the cattle and swine populations of the
island. Radar Bali [news agency] quotes an unnamed source who confirmed
that scientific studies conducted at Bali's Udayana University reveal that
the rabies virus has been found in a sample of cows and pigs present on the
island.

This report was further confirmed by the head of the veterinarian
biomedical and molecular laboratory of the University, Professor I Gusti
Ngurah Mahardika, who said rabies had "certainly" spread to Bali's cattle
and pig population. Speaking on the phone with Radar Bali, Professor
Mahardika said, "Yes, laboratory tests show victims of rabies among cattle
and pigs."

Locations in which rabies have been confirmed in these farm animals are in
the regencies of Tabanan and Badung. While reluctant to give specific areas
for the outbreaks, Mahardika did confirm cattle infections in Tabanan and
in the Bukit Jimbaran area of the island.

Professor Mahardika said the cases of cattle and pig infection were tied to
bites from rabies-infected dogs. The pigs and cows bitten by the dogs
eventually displayed rabies symptoms and died. When asked of the risk of
infection from cows and pigs to humans, Mahardika discounted such risks as
being minimal. He did warn, however, of the chance of infection to meat
handlers with open cuts that come in contact with the [secretions] of
infected pigs and cows.

He called for better public education on how rabies is spread in order to
address the ineffective way in which rabies has been dealt with in Bali to
date.

[Rabies in cattle and swine generally takes the form of dumb (as opposed to
furious) rabies. Animals with this form of rabies may be depressed or
unusually docile. The animal will often have paralysis, generally of the
face, throat and neck, causing abnormal facial expressions, drooling, and
inability to swallow. Paralysis may affect the body, first affecting the
hind legs. The paralysis progresses rapidly to the whole body with
subsequent coma and death. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include
confusion, depression, sleepiness, agitation, or paralysis of the face,
throat, and neck. Death generally results from progressive paralysis
Consequently the risk of transmission of rabies virus infection from cattle
and swine to humans is lesser than that from dogs, cats, and monkeys (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/ressources/RABIES-EN.pdf>). Nonetheless the
detection of rabies infection of cattle and swine in the island of Bali is
an unwelcome development and a consequence to the inadequate response of
the authorities to the introduction of a single rabid dog into the
previously rabies-free island in 2008.
