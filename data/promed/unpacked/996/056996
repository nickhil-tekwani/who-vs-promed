A dust cloud soars behind farmer [TK's] pickup truck as he drives down a gritty dirt track to a neat row of pig sheds. The landscape is flat and muted: dry, mostly treeless ground and patchy grass. At this farm in the southeastern state of Victoria, there are hundreds of flies and not a single visible mosquito. It's a world away from the verdant places one might expect to find fatal tropical diseases.

Yet a month ago [TK's] sows started birthing stillborn piglets. Some of the animals emerged shriveled and desiccated, like little mummies. Alarmed, he called state authorities, who tested the animals and confirmed the diagnosis: Japanese encephalitis. Within weeks, he learned a few dozen farms had been affected. More shockingly, the viral illness was killing Australians. By the start of this month [April 2022], authorities had counted 34 human cases and 3 deaths.

Japanese encephalitis is rare and mostly asymptomatic. In 99 percent of cases, it passes through the body without causing symptoms. But of the unlucky 1 percent, nearly 1/3 die, and about 1/2 of the survivors are left with permanent problems. There is no cure, and Australia is spending millions of dollars in a rush to import vaccine doses.

Public health professionals say the appearance of Japanese encephalitis here is just the latest example of how global warming is contributing to the spread of disease. 6 years ago, melting permafrost in Siberia released frozen anthrax, which infected an Indigenous community. In 2007, the tropical chikungunya virus was detected in Europe for the 1st time in 2 Italian villages and has since appeared in France. In the United States, Lyme disease cases have doubled over 30 years as warmer conditions create longer tick seasons. And in Australia, experts warn that Japanese encephalitis could be the 1st of several illnesses to spread south.

Tim Inglis is the head of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Western Australia.

"With accelerating climate change, we're going to be in a world of hurt," he said, "with some of these diseases that have in the past been restricted in the tropics extending, as we're beginning to see.

"Some of these diseases are not nice -- and Japanese encephalitis is just one of the family."

Japanese encephalitis is endemic to 24 nations in a sweltering patch of Asia and the Pacific, from Australia's northeastern tip to Japan, the Koreas, China, Southeast Asia, and India. It claims between 13 000 and 20 000 lives per year.

The mosquitoes that carry it need pools of stagnant water, such as those created by the heavy downpours of the tropics, to breed. In February and March [2022], the northeast coast of Australia was hit with record floods -- conditions that enabled the virus to travel hundreds of miles south and west via mosquitoes biting water birds, horses, and, especially, pigs.

It found a foothold and moved beyond the flood zone into an outbreak encompassing four states: Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Separately, over the past decade, it has traveled in the opposite direction, to higher-altitude regions of Tibet and Nepal.

Margo Andrae, chief executive of Australian Pork, said pig farms were the "early warning system that something else was hitting Australia."

"I think it took us all by surprise," Inglis said. "We really hadn't expected to see things come this far south, even with extreme weather conditions."

The weather in Australia is ruled by the multiyear revolving patterns of El Niño and La Niña -- the former hot and dry with long droughts and wildfires, the latter cool and rainy with cyclones and flooding. It's La Niña years, as the planet warms, that carry an increased risk of tropical disease. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which leads to more intense rainfall and flooding, enabling mosquito-borne and water-loving illnesses to thrive.

Malaria is another illness that could encroach on Australia, Inglis said. He has tracked the southward movement of melioidosis, a bacteria found in wet soil that can cause abscesses, seizures, and death. Stagnant water seems to be a requisite for outbreaks of Buruli ulcer, a disease caused by flesh-eating bacteria with a growing presence in southeastern Australia.

As for Japanese encephalitis, a single previous case on Australia's mainland was recorded at the country's northernmost point 2 decades ago. But it has now shown up 2000 miles [about 3220 km] to the south, in cooler, drier farmland.

Across eastern Australia, government and council workers are hanging mosquito traps to gather specimens to test for the virus and track its spread. The federal government is rolling out vaccines to pig farmworkers and others at higher risk. The key message from authorities is to avoid bites: wear repellent, cover up in loose clothing, drain or remove standing water.

Pig farmers are taking the same measures. The virus doesn't affect the animals' meat -- it's not transmitted by eating pork or bacon -- but it does affect production.

"I think Australians, in general, are feeling they have to watch out for more and be more cautious and more aware of the unknown," Andrae said. "Whether it's floods, bush fires -- now mosquitoes. Things are moving into Australia. Whether it's people, whether it's climate, whether it's just that the risks are greater, the speed that they're moving with we just haven't seen before."

In an update on the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) situation affecting several states in Australia, the Department of Health now reports 35 human cases. The breakdown is as follows:
23 have been confirmed with definitive laboratory evidence: New South Wales [NSW] (10), Queensland (2), South Australia (3), and Victoria (8).

12 are probable cases where the person has been linked epidemiologically and/or has symptoms of the disease and has laboratory suggestive evidence: Queensland (2), South Australia (5), Victoria (3) and NSW (2).

The death toll remains at 3 -- one each in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria.

A Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance was declared by health officials on [4 Mar 2022].

The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment has also reported additional infected piggeries. There are currently more than 60 infected piggeries across the 4 states.

Japanese encephalitis is a viral zoonotic disease that is spread by mosquitoes. The virus can cause reproductive losses and encephalitis in pigs and horses. In rare cases, Japanese encephalitis can cause disease in people. People and horses are considered 'dead end' hosts. Once infected, they do not play a role in transmitting the virus. Pigs and some species of wild birds are amplifying hosts.

Most Japanese encephalitis virus infections in people are asymptomatic, however, those with severe infection (which occurs in less than one per cent of cases) may experience neck stiffness, coma, and more rarely, permanent neurological complications or death.

Encephalitis is the most serious clinical consequence of infection. Illness usually begins with symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache, and vomiting. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek urgent medical attention.

People should try to prevent mosquito bites by using mosquito repellent containing picaridin, DEET, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on all exposed skin and reapply every few hours. Wear long, light colored and loose-fitting clothing as well as covered footwear when outside. Ensure accommodations, including tents, are properly fitted with mosquito nettings or screens.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) transmission continues to slowly increase the number of affected people and pigs. The overview report above indicates that there is one additional human case and 10 affected piggeries more than in the previous national-level report (see Japanese encephalitis - Australia (16): human, stock, CDINS 20220405.8702416). The integrated human and animal health response by the Australian government is commendable as a good example of a One Health approach to an emerging disease outbreak. Ongoing vaccination of people who are in areas of higher JE risk, particularly near affected piggeries where JE virus is being transmitted, is not mentioned above but is another active preventive response to the outbreak. - Mod.TY
