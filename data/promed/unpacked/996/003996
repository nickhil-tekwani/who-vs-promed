- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.

[Once again one can look at this weekly report as good news and not so good news.

The good news is that:
- No newly confirmed WPV1 cases in both Pakistan and Nigeria -- 2 of the 3 remaining polio endemic countries.
- No newly confirmed WPV1 cases reported with dates of onset in 2018.
- No newly confirmed cVDPV2 cases reported from Syria, with most recent date of onset in September 2017 -- over 3 months ago.
- No newly confirmed cVDPV2 cases reported from Nigeria.

The not so good news:
- 1 newly confirmed case reported in Afghanistan with date of onset 28 Dec 2017
- Multiple environmental samples positive for WPV1 in both Pakistan and Afghanistan with dates of collection of specimens in late December 2017, suggesting continued circulation of the WPV1 in both countries.
- 5 more cases of cVDPV2 confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with dates of onset in November 2017.
- 2017 total number of cVDPV2 cases now at 91, with 74 reported from Syria and 17 reported from the DRC.

[2] Polio workers killed in Pakistan - media report
Date: Thu 18 Jan 2018
Source: BBC [edited]
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42738360


Gunmen in Pakistan have shot dead a mother and daughter who were administering polio vaccinations in the south-western city of Quetta.

[A 38-year-old woman], and her [16-year-old] daughter, had been giving drops to children when 2 gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire, police said. No group has said it was behind the attack. However, Islamist militants oppose vaccination, saying it is a Western conspiracy to sterilize Muslims.

Police said that the vaccination team had not been given security as in the past the police presence had drawn attention to their work. Police official Naseebullah Khan said the women had been part of a major immunisation campaign in Balochistan province, of which Quetta is the capital. "They died on their way to a hospital," he said.

The attack in Quetta has been widely condemned. Balochistan chief minister Mir Abdul Qudus Bizenjo condemned the shooting as an act of "cowardice and terrorism". "An attack on those working to serve the people is an attack on humanity," he added.

Scores of people have been killed in recent years in militant attacks on polio immunisation campaigns. In January 2015 a suicide bombing in Quetta killed 15 people outside a vaccination centre in Quetta. The Pakistani Taliban and another militant group, Jundullah, claimed to have been behind that attack.

Pakistan is one of only 3 countries in the world, along with Nigeria and Afghanistan, that have failed to prevent the transmission of polio, according to the World Health Organization.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi ordered authorities in Balochistan to step up security around the polio teams.

[Every time I see these reports about violence against polio workers I have serious problems understanding the psyches of individuals who would deprive life saving measures such as vaccinations from vulnerable populations. I was under the impression that an accord had been reached with the Taliban that resulted in a cessation of attacks against vaccinators. Either the accord has broken down or there are new players on the scene continuing the barbaric practices. - Mod.MPP]
