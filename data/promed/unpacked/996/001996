Health authorities are warning that Denpasar remains under threat from
DHF, the frequently fatal form of the mosquito-borne disease [virus
infection]. They say that while the official rainy season had ended,
that did not mean dengue [virus]-carrying _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes
were no longer a threat; 3 children have died of the disease in
Denpasar this month [June 2010]. Sanglah Hospital, the chief treatment
centre for serious cases, remains busy with dengue patients.

This season's dengue outbreak in Bali is the worst in years. Dengue
mosquitoes, which generally bite during the day, breed in any still
water, even small puddles and around houses where stagnant water is
left unattended. They thrive in badly serviced and dirty urban
environments.

Health authorities say the outbreak this year [2010] is worse than
usual because extended rains have left a lot of standing water around
Denpasar. They have warned residents to make sure their houses and
gardens are clean and free of water suitable for mosquito breeding.

They have also reminded people that dengue symptoms can be confusing,
since a characteristic of the disease is high fever followed by an
apparent return to normal temperature, or sub-normal temperature. But
this is when dengue is most dangerous because it can induce shock and
may indicate the onset of haemorrhagic fever. Children are especially
susceptible. Sanglah paediatrician Dr Made Dwi Lingga said parents
should not delay taking their children to hospital if they considered
there was any risk that the child might have dengue.

He said that while in normal seasons dengue cases reduced rapidly from
May, this year [2010], it looked likely that more cases would occur in
coming weeks.

The latest statistics on dengue from the Epidemiology Unit of the
Health Ministry says 113 dengue victims have died so far this year
[2010]. The number of dengue patients so far diagnosed increased to 17
411, although it has been declining from a high of 4672 in January to
a low of 1888 in May 2010, the statistics showed.

The month of June 2010 has shown a rise in the number of cases to 1943
[this number conflicts with those in the next sentence. - Mod.JW] due
to the devastating floods last month [May 2010] in most parts of the
country. The highest number of patients, 2354, was diagnosed from
Colombo, the most developed district of the country. Jaffna and
Gampaha districts also showed high prevalence of the disease. The
number of patients diagnosed in Jaffna district is 2181, while 2129
were found from Gampaha district. There were 1253 patients traced from
Ratnapura district, while 1048 cases have been reported from
Batticaloa district. The outbreak of dengue was remarkable in
Kurunegala, Puttalam, Ampara and Kalutara districts as well, points
out the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health.

The Epidemiology Unit urges the public to keep their environments
clean to prevent breeding of the dengue mosquitoes.

Following an epidemic of dengue in the Comores, the surveillance of
dengue in La Mayotte was stepped-up in March 2010. This surveillance
rested on laboratory virological tests by the CHM (Centre Hospital de
Mayotte). An active research for sick people in the neighborhood was
carried out, highlighting any probable or confirmed cases of dengue
not reported to the agents of the anti-vector (AVL) [campaign], and
tracking the number of suspicious cases seen by physicians in the
sentinel surveillance network, and also in the CHM emergency
department by the monitoring of the distribution of antipyretic drugs
sold by the sentinel network of pharmacies.

As of 23 Jun [2010], the laboratory at the CHM had confirmed 49 cases
of dengue from a total of 666 analyses done since the beginning of
March [2010]. There have been 10 new cases since 9 Jun [2010]. The
number of RT-PCR analyses is about the same [remains stable]. The
total of positives varies, 3.2 percent in [epidemiological] week 24
and 14.3 percent in the preceding week [EW 23].

All the confirmed cases are locally acquired, giving a total of 24
indigenous cases. In addition to the indigenous cases, [there were] 20
imported cases, 3 were lost to followup and 2 are still being checked
[for status] making a total of 49 cases confirmed since March 2010.
The number of probable [suspected] cases is 23: 20 indigenous plus 3
imported. The cases are dispersed all over the island. The 1st group
of cases was at Passamainty in the suburbs and a small cluster of 2
confirmed cases and one probable case in Mtsangamouji.

In [epidemiological] week 24, 3 people with dengue have been
hospitalised, but they have not developed the serious, or hemorrhagic,
form of the disease. Since the start of the circulation of the virus
on the island, no form of the serious fever has been registered .
There have been no deaths.

The government in the Cap Verde Islands has decided to allow absences
on Friday [2 Jul 2010] of officials and workers in the private sector
to enable them to participate in the national health campaign designed
to eliminate sources of mosquitoes to prevent the emergence of a new
epidemic of dengue in the archipelago, said official sources to PANA
[news agency] in Praia.

In 2009, Cape Verde had registered for the 1st time an epidemic of
dengue fever, which had killed 4 people out of a total of 21 304
cases. According to statistics compiled by health authorities this
year [2010], 305 cases of dengue have been reported, especially in the
islands of Fogo (161) and Santiago (115), without cases of hemorrhagic
disease or fatalities.

Announcing the launch of this campaign, the Cape Verde Minister of
Health, Basilio Ramos, revealed, after the completion of 2
entomological studies to assess the levels of infestation, that the
country's sanitation "was poor," hence the government's wish to
strengthen the risk-preventive measures. In this context, the
government, to prevent the situation from last year [2009] repeating
itself, raised awareness among populations about mosquito control.
Next Monday [28 Jun 2010], another campaign will commence spraying
houses and community structures in the islands at high risk, including
Santiago, Fogo and Maio.

The campaign on Friday [25 Jun 2010] called "Clean Cape Verde," will
be coordinated by the city councils of each district; however, the
government hopes for the involvement of the entire population, given
the risk of outbreaks of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, such as
dengue, yellow fever and malaria, (which will occur) if the sanitation
of the country is not improved.

The Health Minister has given assurance, however, that unlike last
year [2009], when health authorities did not know how to respond to
dengue, Cape Verde is now prepared to face any outbreak of disease.
"We have a contingency plan, and health facilities will follow what is
already planned, and we are working to ensure that the situation does
not repeat itself," said Basilio Ramos, who warned that the greatest
challenge to prevent a new epidemic "will always be prevention."

The dengue epidemic has spilled over into Honduras and threatens to
decimate our population. It is estimated that one person dies every
day in public hospitals from DHF.

There has been a resurgence of dengue in Central America and some
Latin American countries, due in some measure to the abundance of
rain, but, as far as Honduras is concerned, due to neglect in the
fight against the transmitter of this disease, the mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_.

Dengue in its fatal form, DHF, and classical dengue fever have been
growing rapidly, without the population becoming aware of the danger
of this epidemiological phenomenon. DHF occurs in people who have had
classical dengue fever before.

The Secretariat of Health sees a collapse in its ability to receive
all dengue patients, as there are too many sick people for the
hospital capacity. Accordingly, the government has had no choice but
to hospitalize only those affected with DHF. In view of this
situation, clearly an emergency, it is shown that the public health
system needs the cooperation of the entire population to address this
problem. It also requires the support of the private health care
system, which must adhere to the guidelines established by the
Secretariat of Health.

According to health authorities, the fact that the private health
system has not strictly followed these guidelines for diagnosis, a
product of the experience and expertise of the World Health
Organization (PAHO), has helped to aggravate the situation when
patients finally, in the later stages [of the disease, end up in
public hospitals.

But even with these disadvantages, the key is the attitude of the
majority of Hondurans, who ignore the calls to observe the measures
required to prevent the proliferation of mosquitoes. They do not clean
up weedy areas, avoid water stagnation, or apply insecticides known as
"untadita" of abate [a larvicide], and finally, leave it all to the
goodness of God and action of the government.

In this sense, the initiative of the Secretariat of Health is logical
so that the executive branch decrees a state of health emergency for
the dengue epidemic and a request to municipal governments to apply
coercive means to compel people to observe the measures necessary to
combat the plague of mosquitoes and prevent massive [vector]
infestations throughout the country.

[The 19 Jun 2010 edition of Tempo
(<http://www.prensa-latina.cu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=199023&Itemid=1>) indicated that they were 10-15 patients daily being admitted to the Seguro Social Hospital in Tegucigalpa. The country has had 10 780 dengue cases so far in 2010; 461 of these are cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever, with people under 19 years of age as the main victims, and 10
deaths.

Dengue fever remains a health problem in Puerto Rico, Health
Department Secretary Lorenzo Gonzalez Feliciano reported today [22 Jun
2010]. Up to 27 May [2010], 236 cases of dengue had been reported, 22
of which are DHF cases, which means 171 over the normal amount.
Gonzales Feliciano stated that 2 people have died from the disease.

"I've been very clear that we must be at major risk, if compared with
1998, which is the pattern most similar to what we are seeing this
year [2010], in the [epidemiological] weeks of 31-36," said the
Secretary.

"The adult mosquito tends to hide under beds and in closets, so it is
very important that people who do not have screens use recommended
[insecticidal] products that are already known be effective in
control," he recommended.

Gonzalez Feliciano said efforts to combat mosquitoes continue through
spraying and training for primary care physicians to consider dengue
in a differential diagnosis, when they get a patient with symptoms of
a viral disease. He also emphasized the use of repellents, especially
on a day at the beach, as after 5:00 pm, "mosquitoes begin to annoy."

[Puerto Rico was one of the first Caribbean islands to be hit by
dengue. When I was director of the CDC dengue lab there from 1975-80
it was endemic, with epidemics every rainy season. The situation has
not changed due to the refusal of the population to cooperate in
keeping their dwellings and neighborhoods free of mosquito breeding
places. - Mod.JW]
