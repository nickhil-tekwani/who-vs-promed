Lumpy skin disease [LSD] was diagnosed in late July 2012, about a month after its actual initial outbreak in beef herds of Druze villages on the Golan Heights [on the Syrian/Lebanese border]. LSD virus affects cattle only; infection [with field strains] renders lifelong immunity.

The morbidity rate in affected beef cattle herds was recorded to be 1-95 percent, mortality 1-25 percent. The total number of deaths in the beef cattle herds, as reported to the District Veterinary Offices (DVO) of the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary Service & Animal Health (VSAH), was 434; 14 cattle were culled by the VSAH in these beef herds.

In dairy cattle, a morbidity rate of 1-29 percent was recorded in affected farms. VSAH's policy in dairy cattle farms included culling of all animals showing generalised disease (multiple nodules) to limit the virus' spread. The total number of culled dairy cattle has been about 150.

LSD control measures, as applied by the VSAH, included vaccination of all cattle with an attenuated live sheep pox vaccine within the zone declared at risk (north to the imaginary line between Yagur in the west and the Gilboah area in the east), spraying cattle with fly repellents, and bio-security measures. There are still active clinical cases in Genossar [northwest of the lake "Sea of Galilee"], Kannaf [northeast of the Sea of Galilee] and Ramat Tzevi [eastern Valley of Jezreel, Esdraelon, Gilboah area].

In view of the risk of the disease spreading further south and considering the observations that the protection rendered by the [RM65] sheep-pox vaccine in cattle was somewhat less than complete, it has been decided to introduce changes in the vaccination program. Following the (already completed) safety tests, 2 vaccines will be applied:
1. The RM65 sheep-pox live attenuated vaccine (10-fold enhanced virus contents). It will be applied by the VSAH personnel;
2. The South African LSD live vaccine for cattle (Neethling strain). This vaccine will be applied by the practitioners of the Hachaklait in as yet unvaccinated dairy and beef cattle in northern Israel, followed by vaccination in other regions. This operation is planned to start later this week, and to be accomplished before the end of March 2013.

[The delayed initial discovery/diagnosis of LSD in northern Israel (July 2012) had an unfavorable effect upon the disease's control; no stamping-out was (or could be) applied during its earlier stages; this led to the vector-borne virus spreading throughout the northern part of the country, including during the winter months; currently, LSD threatens to continue its spread into central Israel where many dairy farms are located (the mean annual milk yield of Israel's 120 000 lactating cows exceeds 11 500 kg per cow). It will be interesting to obtain, when available, the results of the field observations on the protection conferred by the 2 candidate vaccines. Ideally, comparative experimental protection trials in cattle, performed with both vaccines, would have eased the burden of decision makers.

The South-African manufacturer's user instructions for the freeze-dried, live attenuated virus (Neethling strain) are available at http://www.obpvaccines.co.za/Cms_Data/Contents/OBPDB/Folders/Product/~contents/PZBJ3K5TLC47W3BJ/2223_LumpySkin_PI.pdf.

The most recent follow-up report on LSD in Israel was submitted to the OIE on 4 Feb 2013, reporting a total of 78 outbreaks accumulated since the start of the epizootic; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.14_LSD.pdf. - Mod.AS
