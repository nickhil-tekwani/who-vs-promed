Moroto district is under health surveillance following the mysterious death of a 16-year-old pupil from Lia primary school.

The primary-6 pupil was rushed to Moroto Army Barracks HC1V on [Tue 14 Nov 2017] night with signs akin to the Marburg virus, a highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or animals.

Medical personnel say that the patient was bleeding and vomiting blood. She died on [Wed 15 Nov 2017] and buried in Oyam district. Moroto District Health Officer Andrew Rews Ilukol says that blood samples have been taken for testing at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe to establish the cause of bleeding and death of the minor.

Ilukol told URN that the district has already coordinated with the Ministry of Health and World Health Organization officials within the region to handle any emergencies. He, however, called for calm among the community as they await the results from Entebbe.

At the Barracks where the patient was admitted prior to her death, persons who came in close contact with her have been isolated and their movements restricted. The Army has also restricted entry to the Barracks and put up a hand washing facility at the gate for all people entering the Barracks.

It's the 1st case of Marburg reported in Moroto since the Ministry Of Health confirmed an outbreak of Marburg virus in Kween district, Sebei sub-region on [Thu 19 Oct 2017].

As of [Tue 14 Nov 2017] 3 cases had been reported including 2 confirmed cases and one probable case. All 3 cases have died, resulting in a case fatality rate of 100 percent. The cases were epidemiologically linked and all belong to the same family.

The 1st probable case was a 35-year-old herdsman who frequently hunted near the area of Kaptum, known for its bat-infested caves. He was admitted to hospital on [Wed 20 Sep 2017], with Marburg-like symptoms and died 5 days later. The 1st and 2nd confirmed cases were his relatives who died later.

Prior to his death, the 2nd confirmed case traveled to Kenya where he visited his relatives in West Pokot County, as well as a traditional healer in Trans Nzoia County.

The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km [186.411 mi] northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus.

The ministry, together with the World Health Organisation have undertaken active case search, death surveillance, safe and dignified burials and community mobilization in Kween and Kapchorwa districts and parts of Kenya where the cases had visited. Enhanced surveillance activities will continue until [Thu 7 Dec 2017], according to the Ministry of Health.

Uganda has previous experience in managing recurring Ebola and Marburg virus disease outbreaks. Cases have historically been reported among miners and travelers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda.

[This new case is quite distant from the 3-case cluster in Uganda. Clearly these are independent Marburg virus acquisitions. The source of the virus in this latest case is not stated. This report provides a summary of the recent cases of MVD in Uganda and possible exposure in Kenya, when one of the cases traveled across the border to seek treatment from a local herbalist. There has been proactive surveillance of possible contacts on both sides of the border by the health authorities with the assistance of the WHO and other organizations. One hopes that the measures taken as mentioned above are sufficient to prevent spread of the disease.
