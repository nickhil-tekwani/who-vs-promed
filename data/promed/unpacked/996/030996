Florida Department of Health Officials have received reports of more than a dozen eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases among horses so far this year [2013], according to the agency's weekly arbovirus surveillance reports.

In total, 16 Florida horses have tested positive for the virus since the 1st case confirmation in early January [2013] in Levy County; all of the affected horses have been euthanized, the reports indicate. Cases have also been confirmed in Lake, Gilchrist (4 cases), Alachua, Madison, St. Johns, Columbia, Gilchrist/Columbia (the horse had been in both counties during the 2 weeks prior to onset), Hamilton, Bradford (2 cases), Putnam, and Hernando counties.

In 2012 Florida confirmed 34 cases of EEE in horses.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

A Brunswick County horse has died after contracting eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The North Carolina Department of Agriculture confirmed the death, which was the 1st confirmed case of EEE in the state this year [2013]. In 2012, there were 20 veterinary cases in North Carolina and 2 human cases. Brunswick County had one case of each.

In a statement, Brunswick County Health Director David Stanley cautioned residents to protect themselves against EEE and other mosquito-borne illnesses. He urged residents to wear light-colored long pants and shirts and to avoid exposure at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.

Jeff Brown, Brunswick County's vector control supervisor, said EEE is spread primarily by mosquitoes that live in floodplains or saltwater marshes.

EEE is a viral illness that attacks the central nervous system and can be fatal to animals and humans. There is a vaccine for horses, but not for humans. Stanley urged horse owners to ensure that their animals are properly vaccinated.

Dozens of horses at the Rock Smith Farm in Myrtle Beach are being monitored following the deaths of several others in Horry County from equine encephalitis.

Dr. Karen Bolten, the veterinarian for Myrtle Beach Equine Clinic, says she has already had to put down 4 horses in the past 3 weeks in Horry County, and she's awaiting the tests on 3 others.

Equine encephalitis is a mosquito-borne neurological illness that kills more than 90 percent of horses that become infected. "If they are still standing they like to stumble around. They don't want to move. Their heads hang low, and they act very sedated," says Bolten. "I saw one this morning that was just constantly biting at the grass. It's very strange behavior."

Bolten cares for thousands of horses in Horry County and says this is the most cases of encephalitis she's seen in years. She blames the rain. In June [2013] we were more than 7 inches above normal, and for July [2013] so far we are more than 2 inches above normal.

"I had 4 cases last year, and we've already surpassed that number, and it seems like it's escalating this week [week of 15 Jul 2013]," says Bolten.

The disease is preventable. There is a vaccine for horses, but Bolten says most horse owners make the mistake of only getting their animals vaccinated once a year when they should be doing so 2 times a year.

Myrtle Beach Equine Clinic will be holding a low-cost clinic this Saturday [20 Jul 2013] from 9 a.m. until noon at Vereen's Turf Center in Longs.

[Horry County, South Carolina, is in the northeast corner of South Carolina adjoining Brunswick County in North Carolina. Logically the 2 counties have a common problem. See http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/south_carolina_90.jpg. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map is at http://healthmap.org/r/7GE0.

It is unfortunate that horse owners will delay getting their horses vaccinated against this lethal disease. It always reminds me of one of our horse owners in the Florida parishes who, when told that his horse had died of EEE, replied that he supposed he had better get the other 5 horses vaccinated. Unfortunately a bit late when you have an arbovirus spread by mosquitoes. - Mod.MHJ]
