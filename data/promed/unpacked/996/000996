Epidemics Delay Start Of Romanian School Year
---------------------------------------------
Outbreaks of meningitis and conjunctivitis forced authorities in
parts of Romania to delay the start of the school year on
Wednesday. Schools remained shut in Bucharest and 6 of
Romania's 41 counties, mostly in the north and east, to allow the
epidemics to subside.
More than 4000 cases of meningitis have been registered in the
past 3 weeks in areas near the border with the former Soviet
republic of Moldova.

Echoviruses -- see ref. above - Mod.JW
