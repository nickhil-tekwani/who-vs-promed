In the past 24 hours, 15 more children died in Bihar of suspected encephalitis as the disease spread to new districts, taking the death toll to 92, officials said Monday [16 Jun 2014].

Officials said 13 children died of the suspected acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) Sunday [15 Jun 2014], while 2 children died Monday, taking the death toll to 92.

The disease, which was limited to Muzaffarpur district till last week, has now spread to at least half a dozen districts across the state. "The AES is now spreading its tentacles to new areas," said Deepak Kumar, principal secretary of the health department. Cases of AES were reported from Vaishali, Samastpur, Sheohar, East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Begusarai, Gaya and Patna districts. But Muzaffarpur remains the worst affected by encephalitis, followed by Sitamarhi and East Champaran districts, health officials said.

Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Gayan Bhusan said the number of children showing AES like symptoms has crossed the 300 mark this year [2014]. "Monsoon rains will provide relief to children suffering from the disease and will help to suppress the virus causing the disease," he said.

Bihar Health Minister Ramdhani Singh said the health department has sent mobile treatment vans and 55 doctors from other districts to Muzaffarpur.

According to doctors, AES is a severe case of encephalitis characterised by inflammation of the brain. The mosquitoes transmit the infection, causing high fever among the children.

Early this year [2014], the state government launched a special vaccination drive to cover hundreds of thousands of children against encephalitis.

[Apparently, the local health authorities believe that the AES cases that they are seeing are due to infection from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), since mosquitoes are mentioned as transmitting the infection among the children. No mention is made of laboratory confirmation of JEV in these cases. The nature of the vaccination campaign is not mentioned but most likely is for Japanese encephalitis. However, Dr Jacob John dismisses JEV etiology in these early season AES cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140615.2540893). He pointed out that the outbreaks in the Muzaffarpur district in Bihar state, annually recurrent, are quite different from many other outbreaks of JEV in various parts of India, including some parts of Bihar. He noted that JEV has a post-monsoon seasonality, obviously due to increase in _Culex_ mosquitoes. Muzaffarpur outbreaks are during May-June (with some in April and some in July), and with onset of monsoon rains, the outbreak stops. The clinical and laboratory parameters of these cases in Bihar are not like encephalitis, rather are typical of encephalopathy.
