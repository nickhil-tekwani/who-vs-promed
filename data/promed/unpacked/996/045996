From: "Dr. Norman Ronald" <n-ronald@TVMDL.TAMU.EDU>
Associate Knowledge Base lists the following symptoms for psittacosis in
mammals:
Cats: pneumonia
Cattle: abortion and CNS signs
Sheep: abortion and polyarthritis, there are two different strains in
sheep, one which causes abortion, and one which causes polyarthritis. The
strain which causes abortion in sheep is also the one which causes abortion
and miscarriages in women.
Transmission to women can cause fetal death at any stage of gestation.
Transmission is likely to occur only from handling aborted fetuses.
No reported cases of gestational cases in women who have handled aborted
calves.
Note: the clinical disease in cattle and sheep are similar to Listeriosis
in cattle and sheep. Listeria also causes abortion in women. Dermal
papules and pustules usually preceed other clinical signs in Listeria cases
in humans handling aborted fetuses [i.e. aborted ruminant fetuses. Mod.-p.c.].
