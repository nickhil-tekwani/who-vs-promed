Rabies: farmer fights for life
------------------------------
An Underberg [KwaZulu-Natal] farmer and top canoeist has rabies, his doctor Grant Lindsay confirmed yesterday [Mon 13 May 2012]. Lindsay said they have lab results confirming the rabies diagnosis. "The test came back positive that he is infected with rabies [virus]. He is in a critical, but stable condition," he said. He added that the patient is still in the Intensive Care Unit at the Medi-Clinic fighting for his life.

The farmer was holidaying in Mozambique when he became ill and returned home. His condition worsened and he was admitted to hospital last Wednesday [9 May 2012]. Lindsay said there is a chance of survival for the patient, who is well-known in farming and canoeing circles.

[The circumstances of the exposure of the Underberg farmer to rabies virus infection are not explained, nor is it stated whether he contracted rabies from a domestic animal, a wild-life source, or a bat. The unfortunate victim is now in intensive care, but is judged to have a chance of survival which suggest that he may have received post-exposure vaccination and/or immunoglobulin treatment at some time after his exposure. Hopefully he may survive.

Rabies is endemic in Mozambique including among urban canines. The US CDC Health Information for Travelers to Mozambique (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/mozambique.htm) recommends that rabies vaccination should be considered for travellers intending to spend a lot of time outdoors, especially in rural areas, involved in activities such as bicycling, camping, or hiking. Rabies vaccination is also recommended for travelers with significant occupational risks (such as veterinarians), for long-term travelers and expatriates living in areas with a significant risk of exposure, and for travelers involved in any activities that might bring them into direct contact with bats, carnivores, and other mammals.

Underberg is situated in the south of KwaZulu-Natal far away from the border with Mozambique in the north. The location of Underberg can be found in the map of KwaZulu-Natal at:
