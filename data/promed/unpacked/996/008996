Chone is under surveillance after FMD outbreaks
-----------------------------------------------
A restriction of movement may be declared today [16 Jun 2005] in the canton
of Chone, in Manabi, Ecuador, after 2 outbreaks were detected in 24 cows.
Yesterday [15 Jun 2005], personnel from the Ecuadorian Service of Sanidad
Agropecuaria (SESA) inspected the zone of Internode, where the outbreaks
were detected.
Franklin Tip, coordinator of (SESA) in Chone, said that samples were taken
in May 2005, and vaccination was begun. Nevertheless, there are reports of
other outbreaks in neighboring areas.
In the meantime, the cattle fair of Santo Domingo was held last Tuesday, in
the midst of some concern, after the outbreaks were detected. Luis
Armbands, local coordinator of the SESA, established rigorous control along
the route from Chone with aid from the Montufar Battalion.

[Foot and mouth disease can spread very quickly and easily. It appears that
workers in Ecuador are vaccinating and are well aware of the situation.
These animals may not have been vaccinated, or perhaps a different strain
of the virus is involved, a common, though not insoluble, problem for
vaccination programs in endemic countries such as Ecuador.
It is important to know the strain involved in this outbreak, as there have
been reported in the past couple of months a type A from Colombia, a type O
from Peru, a rarely seen type C from an island in the Amazon in Brazil, and
an earlier type O from Brazil. - Mod.TG]
