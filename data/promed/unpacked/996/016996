Free State game farmers ordered to shoot herds of blue wildebeest
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The South African game industry is in crisis after farmers in the Free
State were told by the Bloemfontein High Court to shoot out their herds of
blue wildebeest. Neighbours are holding the game farmers responsible for an
outbreak of malignant catarrhal fever amongst their cattle. Some animals
have died.
Thinus Schoeman, one of the game farmers, must either pay R250 000 [USD 34
000] to his neighbour or shoot the 18 blue wildebeest on his farm. Schoeman
[said]: "This is unfair as the animals are endemic to the area and in high
demand amongst international hunters."
Scientists are not sure how malignant catharral fever is spread. Blesbuck
and kudu, like the wildebeest, are also suspected of being carriers of the
virus.
Game farmers say dead cattle should be tested for other sicknesses as well,
like Rooiwater [Afrikaans for Babesiosis] and Lamsiekte [Botulism].
Meanwhile they say the order to shoot their animals will be fought on the
highest level.

[Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is an acute, generalised, and usually
fatal disease affecting many species of Artiodactyla (mainly species of the
subfamily Bovinae, such as cattle, and of the family Cervidae. MCF, an OIE
list-B disease, can be caused by either of 2 gammaherpesviruses:
alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AIHV-1) and Ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2). The
natural host of AIHV-1 is the wildebeest, which is infected inapparently
and causes the disease in cattle in regions of Africa and in a variety of
ruminant species in zoological collections worldwide. The vectors of OvHV-2
are domestic sheep, in which the infection is subclinical; this sort of MCF
occurs, as a clinical disease, in cattle in most regions of the world. This
form of the disease was formerly referred to as sheep-associated MCF. MCF
is defined by the recognition of characteristic lymphoid cell accumulations
in nonlymphoid organs, vasculitis, and T-lymphocyte hyperplasia in lymphoid
organs. In both forms of the disease, animals with clinical disease are not
a source of infection, as virus is only excreted by the natural hosts:
wildebeest and sheep.
The disease may present a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging
from the acute form (when minimal changes are observed prior to death) to
the more florid cases (characterised by high fever, bilateral corneal
opacity, profuse catarrhal discharges from the eye and nares, necrosis of
the muzzle, and erosion of the buccal epithelium). Infectivity from animals
with the AIHV-1 form of MCF can be recovered only by employing techniques
that retain the viability of host cells. Diagnosis is normally achieved by
observing the characteristic histopathological changes, though detection of
viral DNA in either form of the disease has become the preferred method.
