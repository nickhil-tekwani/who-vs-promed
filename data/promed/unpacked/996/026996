An outbreak of yellow fever in Matazu Local Government Area [LGA] of Katsina State has claimed 115 lives, Daily Trust gathered. Though locals say so far 115 people have died from the disease, government insists that only 18 died in the 3 weeks that the disease broke out in the area. A former councillor of Kogari Ward, Malam Sule Ibrahim, said the disease first hit Kogari ward before moving to Unguwar-Sarka community.

However, when contacted, the executive secretary of the state Primary Health Care Development agency, Dr Shamsu Ahmad said, "it is a suspected case of yellow fever, and based on our line list and documentation, 45 people fell ill, and 18 deaths were recorded. As at today [Mon 28 Oct 2019] there are 45 cases on ground. Of those ill, 11 blood samples were taken, 5 results turned out negative of yellow fever and we are awaiting the result of 6 others. We normally take the samples to Abuja and Lagos for confirmation because we don't have the facility to do it here". He said only recently, 6 729 000 people were immunised against yellow fever across the state.

Sources also confirmed that there was vaccination at Kogari area of Matazu LGA, where the recent outbreak started. It would be recalled that over a month ago suspected bandits residing in Danmusa forest axis had approached a team of vaccinators to accompany them into the forest to vaccinate some inhabitants, following death of some of their members from yellow fever. Their demand, it was gathered, was as a result of the death of a notorious kidnap kingpin, ATK, and 11 others who had been terrorising Katsina and Zamfara. Many people however mistook their death as a "curse following intense prayers over their attacks", and they celebrated the development.

[Yellow fever cases have been occurring in various states across Nigeria this year (2019). Now, there is an active yellow fever outbreak going on in the Matazu LGA in Katsina state. A 31 Aug 2019 report indicated that at that time, so far this year (2019) there were 3 confirmed yellow fever cases in Katsina state (see ProMED-mail post Yellow Fever - Africa (17): Nigeria, WHO 20191012.6721138). Now, however, the currently reported number of fatal cases has increased but varies widely: 115 from undefined local sources versus 18 reported on Tue 29 Oct 2019 by the executive secretary of Katsina State Primary Health Development Agency, Dr Shamsuddeen Yahaya (https://punchng.com/18-die-of-suspected-yellow-fever-in-katsina/). The reason for the discrepancy in the fatal case count is not clear, but the reliability of the larger 115 number depends on the source, which is not defined. The good news is that a large number of individuals in the state, nearly 7 million, have been vaccinated. The 2006 census indicated that there were 5.8 million inhabitants in the state but the population is doubtless much larger now, some 13 years later, so we do not know the percentage of the population that is covered by the vaccination campaign in the state, nor specifically in the Matazu LGA.
