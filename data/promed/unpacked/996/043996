At least 240 people have contracted tick-borne encephalitis as a result of
tick bites in Udmurtia [since the beginning of the tick season]. According
to the State Sanitary Epidemiological Surveillance Centre, 2600 people
including 758 children have suffered tick bites. Health officials are
warning people to take care in forested areas. Udmurtia is an ideal
environment for ticks due to its favourable climate. That is why the
incidence of tick-borne encephalitis is on average 6 times higher than in
[the rest of] Russia.
