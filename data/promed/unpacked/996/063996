A new outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been reported in Mexico.

The H7N3 strain of the flu was discovered at a commercial layers farm in Sayula, Jalisco. In total, of the 151 000 birds susceptible, 15 cases were reported.

[Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes, based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types, yielding a total of 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453).

Avian influenza can and does affect people and clearly has been in Mexico for several years, so one would expect them to have a very active surveillance program.
