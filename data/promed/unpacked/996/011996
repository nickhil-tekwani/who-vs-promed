A horse from Clay County was euthanized at the Minnesota 4-H State Horse Show on Fri 18 Sep 2015 after it displayed signs consistent with a virus that can affect neurological systems.

Officials won't know what caused the signs until test results are known midweek. Among the possibilities is that the horse had EHV-1, a sometimes deadly virus that spreads easily -- particularly when horses are gathered in large numbers.

"Without a confirmed case, we're just letting people know it's a possibility," said Aimee Viniard-Weideman, communications director for the University of Minnesota Extension's 4-H program. "What's vital is that we keep participants informed, so they can decide what's best."

The horse began to display signs of distress Friday morning and was euthanized that evening. Viniard-Weideman said she did not know the horse's age or breed.

About 640 horses had registered for the show at the State Fairgrounds Coliseum. Viniard-Weideman said entrants already at the show are less likely to withdraw, since the potential for exposure already had occurred.

The show began Thursday and ends Monday. The Grand Entry and drill team events were canceled, because those events involve many horses.

Participants already at the show are encouraged to take their horse's temperature twice a day and report any unusual behavior, such as unsteadiness or a lack of focus, to the on-site veterinarian, Viniard-Weideman said. After the show, horses should be kept in quarantine for 3 weeks, the dormancy period of the virus.

In March 2015, 7 horses from around the Twin Cities metro area displayed signs of EHV-1.

The animals reportedly might have contracted the virus at a barrel racing event.

[Without knowing the specifics of this event, it seems like a very public place to euthanize a horse. If the horse was already down and unable to rise, or to rise and walk somewhere to put participants (children and adults) at risk then this may have been appropriate. One can only hope they curtained off the area, or removed participants from the area during the procedure. Hopefully this was a decision reached with the owner of the animal and not a command forced upon the owner. Altogether, this article presents a rather grim picture of what may have happened. While the article emphasizes transparency of communication, it fails to capture any alternatives or treatments or attempts at palliative treatment.

This disease has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease (and this article does not let us know if this was an option available to the owner), and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately. This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease, EHM, has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may last longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM-positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

It should be noted that to date, 9 EHVs have been identified worldwide. 3 of these -- EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV- 4 -- pose the most serious health risks for domesticated horses and can have significant economic impacts.

EHV-1: can cause 4 manifestations of disease in horses, including a neurological form, respiratory disease, abortion, and neonatal death. EHM is most often due to mutant or neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1, so called because of a particular mutation in the genome.

EHV-3: causes a venereal disease called equine coital exanthema that affects the external genitalia.

EHV-4: causes a nonfatal upper respiratory tract disease in foals and is uncommonly associated with abortion and rarely with neurologic disease.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.
