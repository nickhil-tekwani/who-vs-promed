Guinea pigs have been a reliable snack in parts of Ecuador, Peru and Colombia for generations. Called cuyes in Spanish, the animals are reportedly easier to raise and breed than chickens, and are eaten en-masse during key holidays.

Chagas disease, American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the protozoan parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (_T. cruzi_). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7 million people are infected with the debilitating disease worldwide, with 30 percent of all chronic patients suffering from persistent heart problems and even organ failure. Another 10 percent may suffer from digestive problems after their esophagus or colon swells to an unnatural size.

_T. cruzi_'s main vector, the kissing bug, has to take a blood-meal from a person and then defecate near its bite. Only scratching at that bug's "kiss" in just the right way can push that feces into the wound. As far as we know, only one human becomes infected with Chagas for every 1700 kissing bug bites.

In Arequipa, Peru, guinea pigs may be to blame for this local plague. According to a study recently published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, seasonal feasts may be "bottlenecking" domestic populations of the tasty rodents, causing them to become the ideal middlemen for ensuring that most kissing bugs in a region are carrying _T. cruzi_.

Being animals that reproduce at a stunning rate, guinea pigs became preferred even over chickens in South America for animal husbandry within the last couple of decades. They have even been celebrated in the southern US as a new and economical alternative to cattle.

However, for small Peruvian communities, feeding these little rodents during dry summers -- when alfalfa prices spike -- can prove too costly. That's why most farmers will slaughter the majority of their stock save for one or 2 healthy breeding pairs. The resulting meat, which has been described as oily and pork-like, is then cured and saved for a great many festivals and holidays that occur during the season.

Unfortunately, with fewer rodents around, the remaining guinea pig populations are relatively doomed to be bitten by _T. cruzi_-infected bugs and may serve as reservoirs for the parasite, spreading it back to other kissing bugs until the great majority of the biting insects are infected with _T. cruzi_.

In this way, researchers theorized that they would find many more kissing bugs infected than usual, a change that would directly influence how frequently local humans are exposed to the disease.

And that appears to be exactly what occurred in Arequipa. After many generations of this "bottlenecking" cycle of parasite hosts, more than 80 percent of the kissing bugs taken from local guinea pig pens boasted the parasite. Comparatively, only 6 percent of the sample kissing bugs from rodent enclosures -- where seasonal culling does not occur -- carried _T. cruzi_.

Still, many experts are arguing that this revelation shouldn't dissuade locals from raising guinea pigs. In fact, many groups are pushing for the animal to become a common stock even in the US. Instead, the WHO recommends that blood screening and animals tests become common place, treating and defeating the disease before it is given an opportunity to spread.

[The study the text refers to is: Levy MZ et al. Bottlenecks in domestic animal populations can facilitate the emergence of _Trypanosoma cruzi_, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease. Proc Biol Sci. 2015 Jul 7;282(1810) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26085582). It important to note that in the reported study, guinea pigs were artificially infected with _Trypanosoma cruzi_.

Another study: Alroy KA et al. Prevalence and Transmission of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ in People of Rural Communities of the High Jungle of Northern Peru. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015 May 22;9(5):e0003779 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26000770), found a _T. cruzi_ serprevalence of 3.3 percent in Guinea pigs.

It is important to realize that even if guinea pigs are reservoirs of _T. cruzi_, infection of humans from the guinea pigs is through infected triatome bugs (kissing bugs). - Mod.EP]

[Carnivores reportedly can acquire _T. cruzi_ when they eat infected prey (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/trypanosomiasis_american.pdf). Would curing the guinea pig meat be sufficient to kill trypanosomes and if not, is it possible that Peruvians also become infected by eating infected guinea pig meat? - Mod.ML
