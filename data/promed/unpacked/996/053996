Follow-up report No. 3
Translation of a fax received on 11 August 1998 from Dr L.O. Barcos,
President of the
National Department of Agrarian Health (SENASA), Ministry of Economy,
Public Works and Services, Buenos Aires:
End of previous report period: 15 July 1998 (see Disease Information, 11
[28, 101, dated 17 July 1998).
End of this report period: 10 August 1998.
Participating bodies: SENASA and the following:
- Official organisations: Centre for Research into Veterinary Science of
the National Institute for Agricultural and Livestock Technology
(CICV-INTA), Centre for Research and Development of the Timber and Related
Industries, which is run by the National Institute for Industrial
Technology (CITEMA-INTI), Department of Pharmacobotany of the Faculty of
Pharmacy and Biochemistry of the National University of Buenos Aires (F.
F.&B. - UBA);
- Non-official organisations: Equestrian Federation of Argentina and private
veterinarians in the sector.
Report on actions taken:
A) Attempts to detect an infective agent:
Samples analysed: nasal and buccal swabs, epithelium, blood sera.
The laboratory evidence obtained allowed the following diseases to be ruled
out: vesicular stomatitis, African horse sickness, glanders, dourine,
equine viral arteritis, equine adenovirus, equine herpesvirus HVE-1 and
HVE-3, and piroplasmosis (_Babesia equi_ and _B. caballi_).
The possibility of a bacterial or mycotic aetiology was also investigated
but no micro-organism corresponding to the clinical signs was isolated.
B) Attempts at experimental transmission:
Two horses housed in isolation stalls under biosafety conditions were
challenged by inoculation of various types of material obtained from sick
animals from the German Riding Club and also the supernatant of slightly
suspect cell cultures.
Data recorded: body temperature, results of haematological and clinical
examinations, and microbiological data (from day 0 to day 26 following
inoculation).
Results: under the conditions described above, the clinical manifestations
and lesions observed in horses in the German Riding Club were not
reproduced experimentally.
C) Analysis of bedding material: various samples of wood shavings used as
bedding material that had been collected during the disease episode were
analysed.
Summary of findings:
C.1 Identification of the botanical species: CITEMA confirmed the presence
of _Simaruba amara_ and _Pinus_ sp. in 5/5 and _Erisma uncinatum_ in 2/5 of
the samples. In addition, it determined the absence of impregnating
substances in the said samples, such as CCA salts (chromium, copper,
arsenic) and pentachlorophenol. The species cited first - _Simaruba amara_
- is a species not native to Argentina and, according to official records,
it has been imported from Brazil since the month of September 1997, with a
marked increase in imports during the course of 1998, during which year
some imports also came from Peru.
C.2 Confirmation of the phytotoxic hypothesis: at F. F.&B. - UBA, using
chromatography [TLC(1) and HPTLC(2), wood shavings of 100% pure _Simaruba
amara_ stock were compared with five control samples obtained in the same
place and manner as in C.1. In all of the samples the presence was observed
of characteristic chemical compounds, generically known as quassinosides,
present in woods of the Simarubaceae family. Quassinosides include quassine
and neoquassine. A previous case with similar characteristics was reported
to have occurred in Illinois (United States of America) between 8 and 12
April 1992(3). The bibliography also includes the report of an episode in
which an irritant chemical substance found in a tree from the Simarubaceae
family was found to be responsible for vesicular eruptions on the face and
hands of gardeners who had been in contact with it(4).
D) Reproductibility of the disease: in a joint SENASA/CICV-INTA experiment
carried out at INTA headquarters from 7 July 1998, following the negative
results of attempts to detect a causal agent described in paragraphs A) and
B), two horses were exposed to environmental changes. The straw bedding was
replaced with wood shavings comprised of 100% _Simaruba amara_. The animals
were fed with bales of alfalfa placed directly on the bedding. On the
fourteenth day of exposure, one of the horses started to reproduce signs in
the mouth. On the twentieth day after commencing the trial, both horses
faithfully reproduced the syndrome observed in the disease episode in the
equestrian centres, namely the characteristic mouth lesions and nasal
scabs. One of them presented a lesion in the mucocutaneous joint of the
anus on day 21 following the trial. Moreover, it was confirmed that the
biochemical profiles registered in the animals in the trial
(indirect-reacting bilirubin) coincided with those encountered in the
animals tested during the disease episode.
It was concluded from the results obtained that horses exposed to bedding
containing _Simaruba amara_ wood may develop erosive stomatitis.
General conclusion:
Taking into account that:
1. attempts at virus isolation in natural and experimental cases produced
negative results;
2. no antibodies were detected and no seroconversion was demonstrated for
viruses associated with manifestations of stomatitis;
3. no bacterial or mycotic agents capable of inducing the observed syndrome
were observed;
4. attempted experimental transmission of the disease was unsuccessful;
5. success was achieved with experimental reproduction of the syndrome by
incorporating wood shavings of Simaruba amara into the bedding;
it can now be concluded that stabled horses exposed to a bed of shavings
containing _Simaruba amara_ reproduce signs compatible with those
encountered in the disease observed between 29 May 1998 and 16 June 1998 in
five riding clubs in the Federal Capital and the surrounding area.
