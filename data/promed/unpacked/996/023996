****This is not a continuation of an earlier outbreak of undiagnosed
neurological illness reported on ProMED in March 2008. - Mod.JW****

2 more children have died of an unidentified disease marked by high
fever in a village in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur rural district, taking
the toll to 4 in the past 3 days, officials said Monday [11 Aug
2008]. On Saturday [9 Aug 2008], 2 children died in Muktapur village
of Gajner block and 2 more have succumbed to the "mysterious" disease
Sunday [10 Aug 2008] in Mangolpur village of the same block, a
district official said. Kanpur dehat (rural) district is about 100 km
(62 mi) from [Kanpur].

The disease that has affected nearly 100 kids in Muktapur came to
light only when District Magistrate Rama Shanker Sahu visited the
village Saturday [9 Aug 2008]. The district's chief medical officer
claims it is a water-borne disease. "The symptoms are clearly of
viral fever and jaundice and on Sunday [10 Aug 2008] we examined
about 100 patients in Muktapur and also distributed medicines. A
majority of the sick people are children," chief medical officer
Satya Singh told IANS by telephone.

He, however, blamed the villagers for not approaching doctors in time
for treatment. "Instead of visiting the government hospital, which is
barely 3 km (2 mi) from the village, they (the villagers) rely on
quacks who give wrong and expired medicines," Singh said.

He added that the disease was caused due to waterlogging in most of
the areas and unsafe drinking water used by villagers. [Waterlogging
occurs where soil becomes saturated such that excess water cannot
drain away. Waterlogging can occur following periods of heavy rain,
or as a result of inadequate drainage or poor irrigation management.
- Mod.CP]. Residents of Muktapur said that the village, which has a
population of nearly 1500, has only one functional hand pump. "2
pumps were installed about 5 years ago and one of them went out of
order soon afterwards. We have no other source of drinking water and
because there are no arrangements to draining out water from the
village, the remaining pump is giving dirty water," lamented [a
resident], whose 7-year-old son died of the illness Saturday [9 Aug
2008].

District Magistrate Sahu, meanwhile, assured villagers that 2 new
hand pumps would be installed in Muktapur soon. An administrative
official and 2 health workers have been suspended for failing to
inform district authorities about the disease. Administrative and
medical teams are now camping in the villages, while a team of
experts have also been rushed there.

[The predominance of children among the affected and the signs and
symptoms (fever and jaundice) are compatible with a water-borne
infection. Possible viral etiologic agents might be various
enteroviruses, hepatitis A virus, or hepatitis E virus. Further
information is awaited.

but with neurological symptoms, occurred in March 2008 -- see ProMED
