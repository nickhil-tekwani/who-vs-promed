[1] Austria: lockdown
Date: Fri 19 Nov 2021

Days after Austria imposed a lockdown on the unvaccinated, it has announced a full national COVID-19 lockdown starting on Monday [22 Nov 2021].

Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said it would last a maximum of 20 days and there would be a legal requirement to get vaccinated from [1 Feb 2022].

He was responding to record case numbers and one of the lowest vaccination levels in Western Europe.

Many other European countries are imposing restrictions as cases rise.

"We don't want a 5th wave," said Mr Schallenberg after meeting the governors of Austria's 9 provinces at a resort in the west of the country.

For a long time, there had been a consensus over avoiding mandatory vaccinations, the chancellor said.

However, too many people had been incited not to get the jab, because of "too many political forces, flimsy vaccination opponents and fake news", he added. The measures are yet to be finalised.

Latest figures show the incidence rate has risen to 1049.9 cases per 100 000 people in the past week, and Health Minister Wolfgang Mückstein said imposing a lockdown was a "last resort". A record 15 809 cases were reported in the past 24 hours, in a population of under 9 million.

Under the measures, Austrians will be asked to work from home, non-essential shops will close, and schools will remain open for children who require face-to-face learning. They will continue until [12 Dec 2021], but will be reassessed after 10 days.

Neighbouring Germany has seen several days of record infections this week, and Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken of "a national emergency that requires a combined national effort".

German leaders have already agreed to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people in areas with high hospital admissions. And parliament has backed requirements for people to show COVID passes on buses and trains, and in workplaces.

But now in Bavaria, which borders Austria, state premier Markus Söder has gone further, declaring a "de facto lockdown for the unvaccinated". Bars and clubs will close for 3 weeks and all Christmas markets have been cancelled. Where weekly incidence rates top 1000 per 100 000 people -- restaurants, hotels, sport and culture will also close.

Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger has already announced that a "lockdown for the unvaccinated" will start on Monday [22 Nov 2021], and the Czech government is also limiting access to a variety of services. The Netherlands introduced a partial lockdown last weekend.

In the UK -- where there is currently no lockdown, although masks have to be worn in some parts of the country -- the incidence rate per 100 000 is 395.4 cases, officials figures show.

Austria's is the first full lockdown imposed by an EU country this winter [2021].

The Europe regional director of the World Health Organization, Hans Kluge, has warned of a hard winter ahead. He blamed insufficient vaccination coverage along with "the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible delta variant".

Russia on Friday [19 Nov 2021] declared a record number of 1254 COVID deaths in the past 24 hours, for the 3rd day in a row.

Hungary reported its highest level of infections -- with 11 289 new cases in a population of 10 million. A 3rd booster jab will be made mandatory for health workers from Saturday [20 Nov 2021], along with masks in most enclosed spaces.

Tighter restrictions also come into force in Belgium on Saturday [20 Nov 2021], requiring working from home for 4 days a week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is Europe heading for lockdown?

There are only 2 ways for countries to slow the spread of COVID -- build up enough immunity or limit contact between people.

That wall of immunity -- from a year of vaccination -- is facing its 1st real test as winter rolls in across Europe.

It is already clear some countries -- Austria being the most notable -- have not vaccinated enough and feel the "need" to go back to restrictions that nobody "wants".

But it does not mean that every country is doomed to a winter lockdown.

Those that have vaccinated more, given boosters to more and protected more of the vulnerable and elderly (who are the most likely to need hospital care) have the best shot at a manageable winter.

The impact of the UK having high levels of COVID through autumn [2021], which will have topped up immunity levels, will be closely watched too.

However, it is still only November [2021]. There are many dark months to get through before the weather improves and makes it harder for COVID to spread.

[Just under 66% of Austria's total population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, one of the lower rates in the European Union.

The national lockdown -- the first in Europe this fall -- starts Mon 22 Nov 2021 and will last for 10 days minimum, and could be extended for a further 10 days, Schallenberg told reporters at a news conference in Vienna. ...

In Italy, all workers are required to have a "green pass" -- a health certificate that shows proof of either full vaccination, recent recovery from infection or a negative test within the previous 48 hours -- or risk a fine and suspension without pay. People must also show their "green pass" to enter public places like theaters and cinemas.

However, only health care workers are required to be vaccinated.

Italy's government has credited the "green pass" strategy with boosting vaccination rates.

Neighboring Germany also announced plans on Thu 18 Nov 2021 to introduce targeted COVID-19 restrictions on the unvaccinated in order to tackle record levels of infections amid its 4th wave of the pandemic. For a 12th day in a row, Germany has reported record new COVID-19 cases. The RKI on Fri 19 Nov 2021 reported 52 970 new cases within the past 24 hours. More than 98 000 people have died as a result of coronavirus in Germany, according to RKI data.

The country's current daily death rate stands between 200 and 300, Wieler said. However, due to Germany's record level of infections over the past 12 days, "the death rate is likely to increase over the coming days," he said.

France is also experiencing a rise in COVID-19 infection rates, but French President Emmanuel Macron has said a lockdown of the unvaccinated is "not necessary" given the country's COVID-19 strategy.

"The countries who are locking down the unvaccinated are those who don't have the 'health pass' in place," Macron said, in an interview with French newspaper La Voix du Nord published late Thu 19 Nov 2021.

France's "health pass" confirms the bearer's vaccination status or proof of a negative COVID test and has governed access to a wide variety of establishments in France since its introduction in July (2021).

Ireland, which has one of Europe's highest vaccination rates, with 89.1% of people over the age of 12 having been immunized, imposed a midnight curfew on bars, restaurants and nightclubs from Thu 19 Nov 2021 as the country faces a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections.

From next week, unvaccinated people will be largely barred from indoor spaces even if they test negative for COVID-19.

Greece has become the latest country in the European Union to impose more restrictions on those unvaccinated against COVID-19 following a surge in infections in recent weeks.

In a televised address to the nation, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said from Monday [22 Nov 2021], unvaccinated people will be largely barred from indoor spaces, including restaurants, cinemas, museums and gyms, even if they test negative for COVID-19.

Greece has so far fully vaccinated about 62% of its population of some 11 million people. Authorities had hoped for a rate of about 70% before the European winter sets in at the end of the year [2021].

"This is indeed a pandemic of the unvaccinated," Mitsotakis said. "Greece is mourning unnecessary losses because it simply does not have the vaccination rates of other European countries."

Under the new rules in Greece, vaccination certificates of those over 60 will be valid for 7 months after being issued, in an effort to encourage them to get a 3rd, "booster" shot.

Worshippers attending church will be allowed to enter with a negative test, Mitsotakis said.

In a subsequent statement, Alexis Tsipras, leader of the main opposition Syriza party, accused Mitsotakis of "being responsible" for the "unprecedented tragedy" that has seen Greece's coronavirus-related death toll surpass 17 000.

The country reported 7317 new infections and 63 deaths on Thursday [18 Nov 2021]. This brought total infections since the start of the pandemic to 861 117 and the total number of fatalities to 17 075.

Earlier in November [2021], the government had imposed some restrictions on unvaccinated citizens but had allowed them access to most services, provided they tested negative.

Austria, Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic all limited public life for the unvaccinated this week as infections rise across Europe.

The Greek prime minister said he would propose making this an EU-wide standard to the European Commission.

Those who are still hesitant to get vaccinated would "think differently if they heard what the unvaccinated who got sick experienced in intensive care units", Mitsotakis said.

The number of new daily infections hit record highs in Greece this month [November 2021], putting pressure on an already struggling healthcare system and forcing the government to order private sector doctors in 5 regions in northern Greece to assist public hospitals.

The requisition order, published in the official government gazette on Thursday [18 Nov 2021], is effective for a month.

[About 61% of Greeks are fully vaccinated, below the average rate in the European Union of 65.4%, according to the vaccine tracker of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Since the end of September 2021, new daily cases have shot up from an average of about 2100 to more than 6500, according to the Our World in Data project at Oxford University, and daily COVID deaths have spiked over the same period, going from an average of around 30 to more than 74. ...

[3] Merck: Molnupiravir

Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/19/eu-regulator-recommends-merck-covid-pill-for-emergency-use


The European Union's medicines watchdog has advised its member states they can use a potentially groundbreaking COVID-19 antiviral pill in emergency situations triggered by soaring infection rates, ahead of the treatment's formal approval across the bloc.

Molnupiravir, which is produced by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, can be given within 5 days of 1st symptoms to treat adults who do not need oxygen support and are at risk of severe disease, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a statement on Friday [19 Nov 2021].

The EMA said it had issued its advice to support national authorities who may be keen to deploy the pill, to be branded Lagevrio in Europe, ahead of it gaining full authoristation from the regulator "in light of rising rates of infection and deaths due to COVID-19 across the EU".

Coronavirus rates are currently spiralling in several European countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Hungary, leading governments fearing a difficult winter ahead to reimpose virus restrictions.

Molnupiravir has been closely watched since data last month [October 2021] showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of developing severe COVID-19 when given early in the illness.

The drug is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus that causes COVID-19 and is taken twice a day for 5 days.

Viral sequencing done so far has shown it is effective against all variants of the coronavirus, Merck has said, including the highly infectious delta strain.

The EMA's decision came after former EU member state the United Kingdom became the 1st country in the world to greenlight molnupiravir for use earlier in November [2021].

The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommended at the time that the drug be used as soon as possible following a positive COVID-19 test and within 5 days of the onset of symptoms, citing clinical data.

Merck has also sought approval for the pill to be used in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to deliver a decision on that imminently.

Treatments to tackle the pandemic, which has killed more than 5 million people worldwide, have until now focused mainly on vaccines.

Other options, including Gilead's infused antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, are generally only given after a patient has been hospitalised.

As the arrival of winter has increased the rate of COVID-19 infections in several countries, Pakistan's positivity rate, which remained less than 1% for the past 6 days, went up to 1% on Thursday [18 Nov 2021].

According to data of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), 460 people were infected with COVID-19 and 10 died over the past 24 hours.

The data showed that Pakistan had experienced a less than 1% positivity rate -- 0.94% -- on [8 Nov 2021] for the 1st time since the pandemic hit the country in February 2020.

The positivity rate has remained below 1% since [12 Nov 2021], but Thursday's [18 Nov 2021] data showed that the positivity ratio had gone up to 1.11%.

Similarly, the number of cases, which stood at 391 on [11 Nov 2021], dropped to 263 on [13 Nov 2021] and went further down to 216 on [15 Nov 2021].

It again started increasing and the data released on Thursday [18 Nov 2021] showed that 460 people were infected with the deadly virus.

The data further showed that the number of active cases was 22 501 out of which 1087 patients were admitted to hospitals on Thursday [18 Nov 2021].

Talking to Dawn, microbiologist Prof Dr Javaid Usman said that a decrease in the temperature was the only reason for the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.

"Cases have already started increasing in China, Russia, and Europe. Austria is on the verge of lockdown. It is happening just because of the arrival of the winter season," he said.

When asked how winter increased the spread of the virus, Prof Usman said that during the winter season daylight remained for a short time and a decrease in the temperature increased the number of cases.

"People keep their windows closed during winter and spend more time indoors due to which inter-human contact duration increases and the virus does not get the chance to go out. Because of lack of ventilation chances of infections go up. Viruses of influenza and corona family have similar symptoms and both become more active during winters," he said.

Talking about Pakistan, Dr Usman said this year [2021] the winter had arrived a bit earlier due to which a sudden increase in COVID-19 cases had been noted.

"I would suggest to the masses to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures and maintain social distance so that the rate of infection goes down again," he said.

COVID clusters have been identified in 5 districts in the country, Director General of Health Services Dr Asela Gunawardena said.

Accordingly, he told media yesterday [18 Nov 2021] that such clusters had been detected in Anuradhapura, Ampara, Hambantota, Matara, and Galle districts.

"These clusters have been created because of weddings, religious activities, and other functions held in respective areas violating health protocols," he underlined.

"We will not be able to contain these clusters if public gatherings continue to take place violating health guidelines resulting in a dangerous situation," Dr Gunawardena stressed.

Thus, he urged people to minimise events where people gather in large numbers until the country reaches normalcy.

The country currently reports over 700 COVID cases daily raising concerns among health authorities while the number of fatalities ranges at around 20.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 19 Nov 2021 at 08:10 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 34 489 623 / 465 082 / 333
Bangladesh: 1 573 458 / 27 939 / 167

Afghanistan: 156 739 / 7297 / 182
Maldives: 90 340 / 248 / 448
Bhutan: 2629 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 75 437, 1552, 2098, 2247, and 6398 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 81 779, 1421, 3984, 1945, and 4676 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in India and Pakistan, a state of almost stability in Bangladesh and Nepal, but again an increasing trend in Sri Lanka. The daily case positivity is now just below 1% in India and slightly above 1% in Bangladesh and Pakistan. As indicated in item [4] above, the daily case positivity in Pakistan dropped below the mark of 1% a few days back and has now increased to above 1%, suggesting a possibility of seeing an upsurge of cases due to an earlier onset of winter in the country. Some clusters of new cases across Sri Lanka could be the reason behind a significant increase of new cases over the last 7 days, as indicated in item [5] above.

Over the course of 24 hours since yesterday (18 Nov 2021), a total of 459 people died in India due to COVID-19. Of them 372 were from Kerala state, comprising 81% of the total deaths encountered across the country (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). As of 19 Nov 2021 at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 152 349 358 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above 18 years of age. As of 17 Nov 2021, 38.3% have received the 1st dose and 24.6% of the target population has received both doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php). The country has also started vaccinating school children between 12 and 17 years of age from 1 Nov 2021 with the Pfizer vaccine (https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/coronavirus/fallouts-fightback/vaccine/news/students-aged-12-17-40000-get-jabs-day-2208816).

As of 19 Nov 2021 at 9.47 AM, a total of 120 233 579 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 16 173 246 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 29 570 512. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 67.8% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/). The country is also vaccinating 18- and 19-year-olds against the disease with the Pfizer vaccine (https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-begins-vaccinating-18-19-age-group/article37001914.ece).

Sri Lanka, the 1st country in South Asia so far, has begun administering a 3rd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose to people aged 60 and older, from 17 Nov 2021 (http://www.news.cn/english/2021-11/18/c_1310318380.htm).
