New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Nova Canaa do Norte, Mato Grosso
Date of start of the outbreak: 5 Apr 2019
Outbreak status: Resolved on 5 Apr 2019
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 22 794 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: a 17-year-old beef cow - nelore breed. The animal was born and raised on a full-cycle beef farm on extensive grazing.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: as part of the Brazilian surveillance system for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a 17-year-old beef cow that was found fallen during an ante-mortem inspection at slaughter was confirmed as a case of 'atypical BSE', classified as H-type. After screening tests performed by the National Laboratory of Pernambuco LFDA/PE [Federal Laboratories for Agricultural Defense/Pernambuco] indicated the presence of prion antigens, the samples were sent to CFIA's [Canadian Food Inspection Agency] OIE BSE reference laboratory in Lethbridge, Alberta, and the confirmation diagnostic test was concluded on 31 May 2019. This is the 3rd case of 'atypical BSE' identified in more than 20 years of surveillance in Brazil. The last case has been detected in 2014. Specified risk material was duly removed and incinerated at the slaughterhouse. Meat and other products from this animal did not enter the food chain and pose no risk for human and ruminants populations. According to the OIE Terrestrial Code, for the purposes of official BSE risk status recognition, 'atypical BSE' is a condition believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate. Therefore, this event does not have any influence on official BSE risk status recognition of Brazil. This investigation was concluded.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; traceability; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; selective killing and disposal; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type/Species / Test / Test date / Result
Laboratorios Federais de Defesa Agropecuaria - Pernambuco [LFDA/PE] (national laboratory) / Cattle / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 13 May 2019 / Positive
CFIA's laboratory in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada (OIE reference laboratory) / Cattle / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 31 May 2019 / Positive
CFIA's laboratory in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada (OIE reference laboratory) / Cattle / western blot / 31 May 2019 / Positive

Future reporting

[This event of atypical BSE in Brazil was already covered in ProMED-mail posting 20190602.6499721.

The OIE recognizes Brazil as a country having negligible risk status for BSE. Cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country, and therefore, this latest detection will not change the negligible risk status of Brazil. - Mod.CRD
