Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update
------------------------------------------
WHO continues to monitor the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The current epidemic trend shows a mixed picture, as follows:

Liberia reported 16 new EVD cases and Sierra Leone, 34 new cases -- since 3 Jul 2014. These numbers indicate that active viral transmission continues in the community. There has been a reduction in the number of new EVD cases reported in Guinea, with no new cases during the last 7 days [1-7 Jul 2014]. WHO continues to encourage and support outbreak containment measures in the 3 countries.

Health sector response
----------------------
Among the key priorities at this time are:
- mobilization of community, religious, and political leaders to improve awareness about and understanding of EVD;
- strengthening surveillance, case finding, and contact tracing;
- deploying additional human resources with relevant qualifications to key hot spots;
- identifying and committing additional domestic financial resources;
- organizing cross-border consultations to facilitate an ongoing exchange of information; and
- working together and sharing experiences with countries that have previously managed EVD outbreaks [e.g., Uganda] in the spirit of south-south cooperation.

In addition, national intersectoral meetings involving key government ministries, national technical committees, and other stakeholders will be held to map out a plan for immediate implementation of a sub-regional response strategy. It has also been recommended that issues related specifically to the EVD outbreak be addressed at an upcoming summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Heads of States.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.
