Rabies is suspected to have claimed 2 lives in Bali on Sunday [20 Feb
2011], with one victim said to have been bitten by a dog as late as 2
years ago. The 2 victims, one from Klungkung and the other from
Bangli, died at RSUP Sanglah hospital, Denpasar. Both were taken
there in critical condition. "Their clinical symptoms show that they
have been infected with the rabies virus," Ken Wirashandi, the Rabies
Problem Tackling Secretary in RSUP Sanglah [hospital], said on Monday
[21 Feb 2011], as quoted by Tempointeraktif.com.

Wirashandi said that the family of the 2nd patient stated that the
latter had been bitten by a dog 3 months ago but was not given any
vaccine at that time. The victim began showing clinical rabies
symptoms, such as seizures, 4 days before his death, he said.

The 1st victim was said to have been bitten by a dog 2 years ago. A
day later, the dog died. This victim also was not treated with vaccine.

Head of the Bali Husbandry Agency Putu Sumantra said that the agency
promptly deployed monitoring teams in the field following the
incident to prepare for dog vaccinations. However, he said that he
was still waiting for lab tests of the victims' blood and saliva
samples to confirm rabies was the cause of death. Sumantra waved off
the notion that the incidents served as proof that vaccination
programs had failed.

[As of 14 Feb 2011, it has been estimated that 57 800 people have
been bitten by dogs on the island of Bali and that 119 have died from
rabies up to the end of 2010. If the 27 known rabies deaths that
occurred in 2008 and 2009 are included, the death toll becomes 146
going into 2011. With at least another 5 reported rabies deaths in
January 2011, the current total of rabies deaths on Bali since the
onset of the outbreak becomes 151 [see: Rabies - Indonesia (04):
(Bali, Sumatra, Maluku) 20110214.0493]. If the 2 suspected cases
described above are confirmed, the total for 2011 will become 7, and
the overall total may now be 153. The results of laboratory testing
of samples from these 2 most recent cases are pending.

One of the latest 2 victims had been bitten 3 months previously and
the other possibly 2 years ago. This is not unusual since the
incubation period for rabies is typically 1-3 months, but may vary
from under a week to over a year, according to the site of the bite
among other factors.
