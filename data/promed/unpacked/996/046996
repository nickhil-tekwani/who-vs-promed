[The report is a follow up to one issued on Jan 2013 that reported one suspicious case of a hantavirus infection in La Plata, Buenos Aires province (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130126.1516152) - Mod.TY]

It was finally proven that the suspected case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Villa Elvira [La Plata] was not that disease. Authorities of the La Plata Municipality Secretariat of Health and Social Medicine, after related tests, discarded definitively this possibility. Additionally, preventive tasks were carried out in areas that were frequented by the man.

The tests [on samples] from the man were negative for hantavirus [infection] as well as for leptospirosis. Hence, the possibility of a [hantavirus] infection focus in the city is absolutely discarded.

The history is that the man, who had a non-teaching job in the Journalism Faculty of the La Plata National University, became severely ill this past Wednesday [23 Jan 2013], was admitted to the San Vicente Hospital, and died on Thursday morning [24 Jan 2013]. It is thought that his death was due to a gastrointestinal infection.

The La Plata Municipality Secretariat of Health and Social Medicine stated that although there had been indications that the case was negative [for a hantavirus infection], they proceeded to take relevant action to avoid exposure of the population to risks. Given this, timely preventive tasks were undertaken where the man had been before becoming ill, such as his house, the Journalism Faculty, and the house of his friend, as well as in areas 9 and 76, where he had done cleanup tasks.

[The death due to a hantavirus infection apparently has been ruled out in this case. This case illustrates the need for timely laboratory testing to include or rule out the initial clinical diagnosis. One wonders what the etiology of the gastrointestinal infection was that caused such a rapid death after falling ill.
