A Sha Tin woman, 39 [years of age, was confirmed yesterday as suffering
from cholera. She had not been outside Hong Kong during the incubation
period. It was the eighth case this month and the ninth of the year and
came amid reports that there had been 125 cholera cases in Zhanjiang city,
Guangdong, between May and last Monday.
There are also fears that more than 60 people may have the disease in
Shenzhen, but neither mainland nor Hong Kong officials have been able to
confirm the cases. Dr Hitoshi Oshitani, regional adviser on communicable
disease surveillance and response for the World Health Organisation's
Western Pacific region, said his office was still awaiting a response from
Guangdong health authorities about reports of a possible cholera outbreak
in Longgang county, Shenzhen.
The deputy director of health at Baptist University, Dr Lam Ping-yan, also
warned yesterday that Hong Kong people might have been left in the dark
over outbreaks of infectious diseases on the mainland because of poor
communication.
He said the information exchange mechanism between the SAR, Guangdong,
Hainan and Macau mainly reported an "overall trend" of infectious diseases
rather than specific details. But he played down the cholera scare in Shenzhen.
A Department of Health spokesman said cholera was endemic in Hong Kong and
there was no need for travel restrictions.
