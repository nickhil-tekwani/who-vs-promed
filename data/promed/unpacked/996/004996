In the extensive press coverage of the B-virus-related death of the Yerkes
Primate Center worker, I have not seen mention of the fact that clear
guidelines exist for the prevention of such infection, including
prophylactic use of acyclovir for exposed workers. The guidelines are
detailed in Holmes GP, et al, "Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of
B-virus Infections in Exposed Persons," Clin Infect Dis 1995;20:421-39. It
would be helpful to know what measures were taken after this exposure in
considering whether these guidelines need to be reexamined.

Today's ProMED-mail post included a description of the fatal infection of a
Yerkes Primate Center research team member from herpes B virus, acquired
from a non-human primate there. The report included a statement that
antiviral drugs were administered.
I would like to suggest, in the future, should another human exposure to
the virus occur, that experimental treatment begin immediately with
recombinant human IL-12 (sources: Hoffman la Roche or Genetics Institute).
This cytokine is in Phase 2 human trials for several conditions ranging
from renal carcinoma to mycobacterial infections.
The efficacy of IL-12 in this situation is multifold: activation of NK
cells (which are essential in early stage herpetic infections; 1),
activation of Th1 cells which produce IFN-gamma, (2) and direct activation
of neurons to an antiviral state.
In experimental infections of animals, IL-12 treatment promotes recovery
from lethal infections, including encephalitis (3). Although generally the
design of experiments has initiated IL-12 treatment on the day of
infection, it may be delayed, briefly (4). In neurons, aside from the
IFN-gamma cascade of antiviral effects, IL-12 (TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma as
well) induce both the enzymatic activity as well as synthesis of nitric
oxide synthase type 1, NOS-1 (in endothelial cells and astrocytes NOS-3,
and in macrophages and microglia the inducible isoform NOS-2; 2,5) which
leads to inhibition of many viruses, including HSV-1 (2, 6, 7).

[It is good to see that antiviral regimens are being developed, but there
must also be rapid reporting of and response to exposure to the virus. -
