Malaria in U.S. traveler -- inappropriate chemoprophylaxis
----------------------------------------------------------
A case of malaria has been identified at Brockton
Hospital in Massachusetts. The patient had
returned from a several month stay in Uganda.

The patient changed from using doxycycline to
Qualaquin during his trip, and then reported
fever and chills several weeks after returning to
Massachusetts. He was diagnosed with malaria at
Brockton Hospital on 5 Mar 2010. The patient
underwent treatment with quinine and has been
discharged.

[Qualaquin contains quinine, and quinine is not
appropriate for malaria prophylaxis because of
its very short half life. Furthermore, there are
considerable problems with counterfeit drugs in
Africa, and the drug purchased in Uganda may have
been substandard and not contained what it was
supposed to contain.

The case illustrates that decisions about malaria
prophylaxis should be taken at home and not not
changed, and that the drugs used should be
brought from home and not purchased locally.
