1st Report of Apple Rot Caused by _Neofabraea alba_ in Chile.
J. L. Henriquez, Departamento de Sanidad Vegetal, Facultad de
Ciencias Agronomicas, Universidad de Chile, Casilla 1004, Santiago,
Chile. Plant Dis. 89:1360, 2005; published on-line as DOI:
10.1094/PD-89-1360B. Accepted for publication 2 Sep 2005.
A new rot of stored apples was observed in local and export markets
on apples that were grown in the south-central region of Chile during
2004. Circular, pale brown spots with a darker outer ring were
observed at least 3 months after harvest in cvs. Braeburn, Fuji,
Granny Smith, Pink Lady, and Royal Gala.
Lesions developed from lenticel cavities or wounds and reached 2 to 3
cm in diameter after 1 week at room temperature. Symptoms resembled
those produced by the bull's eye rot pathogens on apple that occur in
other parts of the world. Acervuli developed in the rotted areas, and
microscopic examination revealed the presence of the fungus
_Neofabraea alba_ (Guthrie) (anamorph _Phlyctema vagabunda_ Desm.)
characterized by production of curved macroconidia and absence of
microconidia (1).
Pure culture on potato dextrose agar (PDA) yielded a characteristic
white sterile mycelium. 4 cv. Pink Lady apples were wound inoculated
with mycelium of the pathogen and 4 apples were wound-inoculated with
a 50 000 CFU/ml conidial suspension.
4 apples were wounded and inoculated with sterile water as a negative
control. The fruit was held at 20 deg C. Symptoms appeared after 4
and 5 days in the mycelium and conidial inoculated apples,
respectively. Resulting symptoms were similar to those originally
observed. Abundant macroconidia were produced at the inoculation
sites, and a sterile white mycelium was recovered after isolation on PDA.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of apple fruit rot caused by
_N. alba_ in Chile.

[There are many fungal pathogens affecting apple worldwide. With
regard to those in Washington State, 4 species of the genus
_Neofabraea_ are known to cause Bull's eye rot (BER) of apple.
_Neofabraea alba_ (Na) is the main pathogen causing BER in
continental Europe, and also has been reported as a minor disease of
apple in eastern North America. _N. malicorticis_ causes anthracnose
canker of apple trees and is found principally in the more humid
areas of the Pacific Northwest (PNW). It is an aggressive pathogen
able to infect sound wood directly. _N. perennans_ causes perennial
canker of apple trees. The pathogen requires wounds to infect the
wood, and the fungus survives in cankers by infecting injured tissue
at the border of old cankers. _N. malicorticis_ and _N. perennans_
are considered a single species in Europe, whereas they have been
regarded as distinct species in North America. A putative new
species, yet to be described, has been recorded in Australia. It was
recently recorded in a phylogenetic study of _Neofabraea_ spp.
causing tree cankers and apple BER. It was represented by one isolate
from Nova Scotia, Canada, and one from Portugal. An undescribed
species also has been identified recently in a molecular study in
Australia. Another fungus, _Cryptosporiopsis perenanns_, causes
similar chronic diseases of apple wood and fruit, respectively.
Any factor that produces excess succulent growth -- such as high
nitrogen fertilization or overirrigation -- or that weakens the tree
increases the severity of perennial canker. Disease management
involves removal of branches containing cankers, which helps to
reduce inoculum of _Neofabraea_ spp. and _Cryptosporiopsis
malicorticis_ in the orchard. Ziram (zinc
bis(dimethyldithiocarbamate), applied within 2 weeks before harvest
is recommended for control of BER in the Pacific Northwest.
Any practice that helps to maintain trees in a healthy vigorous
condition is critical for controlling the canker phase of the
disease. Cankers generally develop only on stressed or weakened
trees. Prune trees annually and maintain a balanced fertility program
based on soil and foliar nutrient analysis. Cankers generally develop
rapidly on winter-injured trees.
The use of fungicides combined with good sanitation is beneficial for
controlling the fruit rot phase of these diseases. Fungicides are not
effective for controlling the canker phase of the disease on weakened
trees. Commercial apple producers should consult the appropriate
agencies for current information on recommended fungicides.
Postharvest controlled atmospheres (CA) are used increasingly to
supplement good refrigerated storage practices. In CA-controlled
storage, a beneficial combination of reduced oxygen levels and
increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are being
combined with refrigeration.
There is no relationship between ProMED and the manufacturers of
Ziram fungicide.
