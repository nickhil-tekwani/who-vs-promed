Re: Onychomadesis and hand, foot & mouth disease
------------------------------------------------
A paper describing another outbreak in Spain, also in nursery school
children, and also probably associated with a coxsackie B virus [B1
in this instance], has just gone online in Epidemiology and
Infection. The following is the reference and abstract of this paper.

Onychomadesis after a hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreak in Spain, 2009

Summary
-------
Few reports exist regarding the association between onychomadesis and
an enterovirus infection presenting clinically as hand-foot-mouth
disease (HFMD). In February 2009, an outbreak of HFMD occurred in a
Spanish nursery school, followed by onychomadesis 36 to 69 days
later. 12 of 17 children with HFMD developed nail shedding;
enterovirus was detected in stool samples from eight (47 percent) of
the 17. However, in only 3 of the children could an enterovirus
serotype coxsackievirus B1 be identified. The epidemiological results
of this study confirm onychomadesis as a complication in HFMD. In
future outbreaks, molecular characterization of enterovirus from
appropriate clinical samples should be studied.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Noah for drawing attention to this
newly published research which further documents an association
between onychomadesis and prior enterovirus (in this case
coxsackievirus B1) infection. - Mod.CP]
