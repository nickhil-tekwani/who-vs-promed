Pneumonia decimates bighorn sheep herd
---------------------------------------------
A pneumonia outbreak may have killed 175 of the 200 bighorn sheep in Custer
State Park and likely will force cancellation of at least one bighorn
hunting season there. The 75 percent mortality rate is an estimate based on
the number of live animals seen in the park, because many of the dead sheep
are in remote areas and never will be found, park wildlife biologist Gary
Brundige said on Tuesday [8 Mar 2005]. "There was a lot of circumstantial
evidence. It came post-rut, a time when the rams that are out come back to
the herd, and there have been a couple incidents of bighorns in domestic
herds around here in the Hills," he said.
Laboratory tests on 2 animals confirmed a bacterial pneumonia, likely a
type that domestic sheep can carry without developing health problems,
Brundige said. Lab workers never could positively identify it as that
bacteria, which would confirm what game biologists suspected, that one or
more of the park's bighorn sheep picked up the disease by coming in contact
with domestic sheep.
The Game, Fish and Parks (GF&P) Department's policy is to kill any bighorns
known to mingle with domestic herds to prevent the spread of disease to the
park herd, Brundige said.
25 to 30 dead animals were found in the 1st few weeks after bighorn sheep
began showing signs of the disease, but only 40 to 50 live sheep have been
seen in the park since, Brundige said. He said there is no indication the
disease has spread to the estimated 250 sheep in several other bighorn
herds elsewhere in the Black Hills. One ewe, equipped with a radio collar
and known to travel between Custer State Park and another herd in the Hill
City area, was killed to keep her from spreading the disease, he said.
The 75 percent die off, seen with such outbreaks in other states, likely
will mean transplanting sheep from other herds to rebuild the park herd.
"Normally, we see some limited lamb production and survival following the
disease for some years, and we're anticipating that. We will look at
supplementing the herd here in the future. The exact source of that still
remains open," Brundige said.
The GF&P issues 3 hunting licenses for bighorn rams in Custer State Park.
"Our recommendation is that we close the season this fall [2005], because
we don't know the extent of the disease. We'll monitor the ram population
next fall with the rut and then decide where to go from there," Brundige said.

-----------------------------------------------
Several years ago, we had an eastern South Dakota captive game producer
submit several cases of _Pasteurella haemolytica_ pneumonia to the lab (see
case 99-13913). He lost nearly all of the animals he was raising at the
time. Dr. Bulgin, from the Idaho Veterinary Science Department, commented
at the time that pneumonia outbreaks in the wild were very severe, as I recall.

[It seems from our archives that such die-offs have been seen before and
have been ascribed to _Pasteurella_ spp. infections, specifically, _P.
haemolytica_ & _P. multocida_. To quote my colleague, Mod.TG, in a previous
related posting: "Pneumonic pasteurellosis is caused most often by _P.
multocida_ in sheep and goats and can lead to high mortality and great
economic loss. Transition from infection to disease appears to be
facilitated by various stressors, including concurrent infections, changes
in climate, pasture, or feed, and other management factors." There is some
evidence to suggest that the bighorn sheep are infected from domestic goats
and sheep flocks. The organism is robust and can survive in the environment
for a couple of days, thereby allowing animals coming behind to get
infected. I recommend reading the previous related reports. - Mod.MHJ]
