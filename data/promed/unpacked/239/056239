Hospitals in China's northern port city of Tianjin have been swamped with
thousands of patients after a major flu outbreak and doctors fear they may
run short of medicine, the Xinhua news agency said Thursday.
At the city's Children's Hospital, long lines of sufferers were queuing for
treatment, the official news agency said.
"Harassed staff said the hospital had received more than 1,000 patients a
day over the past few weeks, most of whom are stricken by this latest
strain of flu which has been sweeping northern China," it said.
Statistics from eight major hospitals in Tianjin show more than 10,000
people have caught the flu in the past two days, with some hospitals
warning they have nearly exhausted their supplies of medicine, it added.
Doctors at the Tianjin Disease Prevention Centre fear the flu virus might
have mutated from the usual strain, making it more difficult to treat,
Xinhua said.

[Tianjin is one of the 3 largest cities in China, placing it among the top
10 megacities in the world. ItÂ´s also where I was born and went to school,
in English, at the Tientsin Grammar School (as it was known in prewar days)
