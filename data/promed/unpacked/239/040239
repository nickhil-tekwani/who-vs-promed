TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) - Bovine tuberculosis has been detected on a
Montmorency County dairy farm, the 10th cattle herd in Michigan known to
carry the disease. The discovery comes as officials test the state's one
million cattle in hopes of wiping out the deadly upper-respiratory ailment.
Officials would not identify the owner of the latest infected herd. Only
one of its 100-plus cows has actually tested positive, Bridget Patrick,
spokeswoman for the state's bovine TB eradication project, said.
The owner will have 2 options: destroying the entire herd and receiving
compensation, or accepting a quarantine while each remaining animal
undergoes stringent testing.
The farm is within the 5-county section of northeastern Michigan where the
outbreak was first detected, starting with a whitetail deer in 1994. The
first tainted cow was found in 1998.
The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) this year revoked the state's status
as TB-free, which can hurt the marketability of Michigan cattle elsewhere.
Officials plan to test all Michigan dairy cattle by next year and beef
herds by 2003. The faster timetable for dairy cows is required under
federal milk safety rules.
Bovine TB is difficult to pass to humans. Pasteurization of milk and proper
cooking of meat kills the bacteria that cause it.
The state Agriculture Department is covering the testing costs. The state
has allocated $83 million to the project.
