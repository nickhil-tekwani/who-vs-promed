A serious error by the agents of the Goueke health center would have favored the spread of the Ebola virus, which reappeared recently in this sub-prefecture located more than 40 km [25 mi] from the city of Nzerekore (in southern Guinea). The latter would have made a false diagnosis on a patient they received in December 2020 and who would be the 1st case of Ebola.

It was the health authorities of Nzerekore who announced the news on Wed 17 Feb 2021, reports the correspondent of <Guineematin.com> on the spot. Contrary to what has been announced so far, the Ebola virus did not reappear at the end of January 2021 in Guinea, but long before. The nurse who died [in January 2021] is therefore not the 1st victim of this disease.

Her stepmother [or possibly her mother-in-law based on conflicting translations. - Mod.JH], a 70-year-old who died in December 2020 at the Goueke health center, is said to be patient zero (the 1st case). In any case, this is what the daily report of the Ebola hemorrhagic fever response teams published this Wed 17 Feb 2021 in Nzerekore.

According to this report, the old woman was hospitalized at the Goueke health center after developing a vaginal hemorrhage. Health workers who diagnosed her concluded that she had "severe anemia." But, a few weeks after her death, the nurse who was caring for her and who happened to be her stepdaughter, fell ill and also died. Several people who attended her funeral subsequently fell ill, and 3 of them died.

This is why a few days after the tests revealing the presence of the Ebola virus disease in Goueke, the health authorities decided to count the old woman among the victims of Ebola, which makes 6 deaths caused by the epidemic since its resurgence in Guinea. Deaths, most of which are believed to be due to the false diagnosis made by the health workers who received the 1st patient, and which led to new contaminations.

Health authorities announced contacts went from 164 to 216 in Nzerekore.

Ebola in Nzerekore: 52 new contacts including 6 deaths (official)
A crisis meeting on the assessment of the Ebola virus epidemic was held this Wed 17 Feb 2021 at the headquarters of the prefecture of Nzerekore.

Since the detection of the 1st cases of Ebola in the locality of Goueke, concern has grown among the population where the number of infections and deaths continue to grow. This, despite awareness-raising and preventive measures put in place by the government to break the chain of contagion as quickly as possible.

To date, specialized health structures have reported 52 new contact cases, including 6 deaths.

The local health services indicate this now brings the number of contacts to 216 people, 2 isolated cases including one at high risk.

Of note, 100 hand-washing kits were made available to the hospital through the synergy of all partners active in the fight against Ebola.

[Byline: Diawo Barry]

More than 4 years after the end of the Ebola epidemic, Guinea is facing a new resurgence of the virus, amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The Guinean health authorities announced the resurgence of Ebola less than a month after the death of the 1st official victim, who was a nurse from Goueke, at the end of January [2021].

When Ebola last appeared in Guinea in 2013, it took 3 times as long before "the victims who succumbed to a mysterious disease in Guinee Forestiere" -- as reported by the local press at the time -- were actually identified as victims of the haemorrhagic fever.

At the time, the samples had been sent to the Pasteur Institutes in Dakar and Lyon for analysis. This time, the tests took place on the spot.

The Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire (ANSS/National Agency for Health Security), headed by doctor Sakoba Keita, who was the national coordinator for the fight against Ebola from 2014-2016, quickly came together with support from health minister Remy Lamah, already at the helm during the 1st epidemic. A joint mission was then deployed to Nzerekore, the capital of the south-eastern region, from which the disease originated, as it did in December 2013.

Identifying the chain of contamination [See section above on this one for most up-to-date 1st. - Mod.LK]

[Even if the 1st recorded victim [the nurse from Goueke] developed symptoms after the hospitalisation of her mother-in-law, who died in January [2021], the latter "presented very few symptoms that are typical of Ebola" says doctor Adama Kaba, regional health director of Nzerekore, whom we contacted.

"None of the women in the village who performed the old woman's funeral cleansing developed the disease," he continues. "On the other hand, some of the people who attended the nurse's funeral fell ill. For the time being, and until there is evidence to the contrary, the nurse is patient zero."

This nurse was hospitalised in a facility in Nzerekore, then at the indigenat [traditional medicine hospital], where she died. Her body was then buried in Goueke. The challenge now is to identify and follow up on all the contact cases along this journey.

"We have listed all the contact cases, about 100, 80% of which reside in the sub-prefecture of Goueke. Their health is currently being monitored by agents. We have started raising awareness through local radio stations and have called on the ANSS and other partners who are arriving to support us in the response," explains doctor Kaba.

Gatherings banned, markets closed, and vaccines expected
A series of measures have been announced. In a statement read on the evening of 15 Feb 2021 on state media, President Alpha Conde banned any gatherings of more than 5 people in Nzerekore. In the sub-prefecture of Goueke, markets will also be closed for a month.

Among other provisions,
- the Red Cross will now provide dignified and safe burials for suspected or confirmed cases;
- checkpoints have been set up, as well as measures to check body temperatures; and
- isolated households will receive food to limit travel.

The authorities have also said that vaccines will be made available. While a trial vaccine has been introduced, thanks in part to research carried out in Guinea, the stockpile there that dates from the end of the 1st epidemic in 2016 has expired.

Georges Alfred Ki-Zerbo, the World Health Organisation (WHO) representative in Guinea, says that the residents of Conakry are eagerly awaiting new doses of the vaccine.

"We are in contact with the regional office in Brazzaville and the headquarters in Geneva to secure vaccines that will strengthen the response," he said, assuring that the WHO is also fully mobilised. "The 1st steps have been taken to activate the emergency management system, as part of the WHO programme set up following previous Ebola epidemics in West Africa," he continued.

"We have delivered logistical material in order to implement the government's directives concerning the management of the Ebola virus disease. This material is composed of PPE. This emergency transport was facilitated by the United Nations system in Guinea."

Several health problems
Even though the Guinean authorities' response to the COVID-19 pandemic proves that they have learned from the experience of the 1st Ebola epidemic, it is important to remain prudent, warns the WHO representative.

"Guinea is facing a very complex health situation. These new cases of Ebola come on top of the COVID-19 context; yellow fever, which is raging in Koundara, near the border with Senegal; and the outbreaks of polio that are being contained through vaccination campaigns," says Ki-Zerbo.

"There are many health problems, and the health system remains fragile. We need to learn all the lessons and, above all, not forget the lesson about community involvement in the 1st infected households: we need to make sure that communities' perceptions, their sensitivity, and their approaches to solutions are taken into account."

An inclusive approach is all the more important since, during the 1st Ebola epidemic, people were initially reluctant to observe certain social-distancing measures. Burial rituals, traditionally carried out by family members of the deceased, had often continued despite the dangers posed.

Guinea: Ebola virus disease outbreak emergency plan of action (EPoA) DREF Operation no. MDRGN0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Situation analysis
---------------------
Description of the disaster
On 14 Feb 2021, the Government of Guinea declared a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Goueke sub-prefecture, which is part of Nzerekore prefecture in Guinee Forrestiere Region. Following an alert by the director of the regional hospital of Nzerekore of cases of vomiting, bloody diarrhoea, and total haematuria, bleeding at the injection sites of 5 patients from the same family hospitalized in the intensive care unit and followed by a transfer to Conakry (CHU Donka). The surveillance team from the regional health authorities (DRS) and prefectural health authorities (DPS) went to the hospital and the subprefecture of Goueke, respectively, for an investigation.

Based on known information, 7 people have been infected to date including 3 deaths, 3 patients hospitalized in Nzerekore, and one hospitalized in Conakry. Although the 1st case was confirmed in February [2021], it is unclear when the outbreak started, which means the virus might have spread beyond the current known cases, and there have been at least 2 unsecure burials of community deaths. The origins of the outbreak are unknown for the moment, and all known cases so far are within the same family (Goueke and Nzerekore) and in people aged over 25 years.

As of 16 Feb 2021, a joint mission of the Ministry of Health has already deployed to support the Goueke team for the field assessment. Several actions have been launched to prevent transmission and identify new infections: case isolation, investigations and data collecting for tracing potential new cases, mobilization of vaccines and diagnostic kits, opening of a treatment centre, and safe and dignified burials to prevent post-mortem transmission. A national level coordination mechanism has also been launched to mobilize partners, while neighbouring countries including Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are on high alert.

As investigations and contact tracing are ongoing to determine the scale of the outbreak and the geography of the risk, all humanitarian partners are expected to meet on 19 Feb 2021 to strategize on intervention. The probable impact areas are the prefectures of Nzerekore, Guekedou, Macenta, Lola, Yomou, and Beyla. The number of people at risk in these areas is estimated at 1 042 251 inhabitants. The expected effect is a considerable increase in cases and the spread of the disease due to the displacement of infected people.

To note, Nzerekore region is the 3rd-most-populated region in Guinea, covering 18% of the national territory. It is at the same time the furthest from Conakry (870 km [540 mi] away), the most landlocked, and the least urbanized. Sociocultural conflicts (ethnic, religious, or socioeconomic) have led to unprecedented violence in Guinea Forest region since 2010. The region's rugged terrain makes access difficult, which highlights the isolation of several villages in the region.

The response to the COVID-19 epidemic has set a positive dynamic in terms of epidemic control and increased hygiene measures amongst the population to curb the spread of the disease. However, this should not be considered sufficient to prevent a 2014 scenario with the EVD outbreak spreading in the region. In that remote area, isolation of population and behaviours guided by fear of stigma and social impacts of the last Ebola outbreak remain an issue, and community burials are both standard practice and a high risk for rapid transmission of the virus.

In this context, the next few weeks will be crucial and must be spent building robust protection and control actions to avoid the spread of the outbreak.

- Tue 16 Feb 2021. Timeline
[AllAfrica, Reuters, WHO report, abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/202102170058.html

The Ebola virus has been detected in West Africa for the 1st time since the outbreak in 2013-2016. Here's a timeline of the key developments:

Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo are racing to contain fresh outbreaks of Ebola that have killed at least 4 people, amid fears the virus could spread across the region.

[Timeline of the main developments
----------------------------------
- 1 Jun 2020: Congo announces its 11th outbreak of Ebola since 1976, with a cluster of cases detected in its northwest Equateur province.
Congo is simultaneously battling the 10th outbreak in the northeastern North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which started in August 2018.
- 25 Jun 2020: Congo declares an end to the 10th outbreak in the northeast, which was the 2nd deadliest in the world, killing almost 2300 people.
- 18 Nov 2020: Congo announces the 11th outbreak of Ebola in Equateur province is over, after just under 6 months.
- 28 Jan 2021: A nurse who is thought to have been infected with Ebola dies in southeast Guinea's Nzerekore prefecture, near the border with Liberia and Ivory Coast, its 1st resurgence since the deadly 2013-2016 outbreak.
- 1 Feb 2021: The nurse's funeral takes place in Guinea, and 7 people who attend later report symptoms and test positive for Ebola.
- 7 Feb 2021: Congo announces a 12th outbreak of Ebola after a woman died in Butembo city in North Kivu Province.
- 14 Feb 2021: Guinea's health ministry declares a new outbreak of Ebola after 3 people die and 4 fall ill after attending the nurse's funeral on 1 Feb 2021.
The WHO announces it is working with health authorities in Liberia and Sierra Leone to beef up community surveillance of cases in border districts and strengthen testing capacity.
The WHO also reaches out to Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal, and other countries at risk in the sub-region.
Congo reports a 4th new case of Ebola in Butembo.
- 15 Feb 2021: Guinea's Health Minister, Remy Lamah, says authorities are tracking down people who had contact with Ebola patients and will rush vaccines -- the 1st of which won regulatory approval in 2019 -- to the affected area.
[- Wed 17 Feb 2021: Guinee Matin reports [see section [1], above] that Nzerekore health authorities have said that, contrary to what has been announced so far, a 70-year-old who died at the Goueke health center in December 2020 is said to be patient zero (the 1st case). The nurse who died [in January 2021], the 70-year-old's stepdaughter, is therefore not the 1st victim of this disease. However, no reports, other than that single post, are listing the 70-year-old as the index case, possibly because she apparently never was diagnosed, although the chain of events points to her. - Mod.LK]

Unlike during the 2013-2016 outbreak, Lamah said Guinea has the capacity to halt the virus' resurgence due to improved treatments.

The WHO launches an Ebola vaccination campaign in Congo's Butembo city. Health workers at Matanda health centre, where the 1st Ebola patient was treated, are 1st to be vaccinated.

- Tue 16 Feb 2021. Ghana: response protocol initiated
[MyJoyOnline.com, abridged, edited]
https://www.myjoyonline.com/initiate-response-protocols-for-ebola-ghs-directs-all-hospitals/


The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has directed the management of all health facilities in the country to initiate response protocols for the Ebola virus disease (EVD).

To ensure that the nation is prepared to combat the virus, the GHS Director-General, Dr Patrick Aboagye, in a statement on Tuesday [16 Feb 2021] has asked all regional and district public health emergency management committees to include EVD in their agendas.

"Additionally, regions, districts, health facilities, ports, health units at all border posts, particularly, along the Western border, and all landing beaches are to heighten surveillance for EVD using the standard case definition," he stated.

The Director-General further advised Ghanaians to practice safety protocols, including regular hand washing, avoiding contact with animals, and desisting from eating bush meat.

"We are to take note and remind the general public that, under no circumstance, should public or private transport be used in transporting a suspected EVD case.

"They are to call for support from the Director of Health Services of respective districts, municipalities, or metropolis in the transfer of such persons to a health facility," he cautioned.

- Tue 16 Feb 2020. West Africa: concern
[Care.org, abridged, edited]
https://www.care.org/news-and-stories/press-releases/new-ebola-outbreak-in-guinea-very-worrying-for-west-africa-as-suspected-case-reported-in-sierra-leone/

On 14 Feb 2021, Guinea reported 7 suspected cases of Ebola in the southeast of the country, in an area close to Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone borders, creating fears that it could spread wider across the region, with early reports of a suspected case already in Sierra Leone.

CARE Regional Director for West Africa, Balla Sidibe, says:
"This has terrifying echoes of the 2013 outbreak, which also started in Guinea. Countries across the region are also currently dealing with a 2nd peak of COVID-19, but unlike COVID-19, Ebola has much higher mortality rates and could pose even bigger risks to a weakened population that is suffering economic and health impacts of COVID-19, as well as high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition. In many of these countries, health facilities are already overstretched with COVID-19 and are likely to be overwhelmed should we face another expansion of the Ebola pandemic in this region.

A big worry is that the cases could spread into neighboring countries such as Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali. Once again, we have seen the risks our frontline health workers face every day, especially women, who make up 70% of the global health force. And we know that disease outbreaks have very gendered impacts and affect men and women differently, so we will be carrying out rapid gender analyses as part of our response to understand specific needs and apply learnings from the last Ebola outbreak.

The good news is that we now know a lot more about the disease and have ways to treat it unlike when it first appeared in 2013. Right now, what is most important is to isolate and treat the reported cases as well as those they have come into contact with, and to carry out mass information and sensitization campaigns on risks, transmission modes, and prevention measures -- working alongside local communities and building up government capacity -- in order to avoid a repeat of 2013 and stop any further spread early."

In Guinea, CARE has staff in the capital of Conakry and plans to support the response through the Guinean Red Cross with water, sanitation, and hygiene assistance and risk communication work. CARE is also monitoring the situation closely in both Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire and is prepared to respond should cases spread across the borders, with pre-packaged items including plastic sheets and IPC [infection prevention and control] materials.

[2] Congo DR (North Kivu): reinforced surveillance
Date: Wed 17 Feb 2021 18:58 WAT
Source: Radio Okapi [in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2021/02/17/actualite/sante/ebola-biene-dr-muyembe-plaide-pour-la-multiplication-des-investigations


"We must multiply investigations to prevent the Ebola virus disease declared in the Biene health area in the Lubero territory in North Kivu from affecting the neighboring province of Ituri," declared the director of National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe on Tue 16 Feb 2021 to the press in Bunia while he was in transit to the neighboring province of Haut-Uele.

According to him, while citing the provincial minister of health in Ituri, one of the Ebola patients would have passed through Biakato in the territory of Mambasa, hence the need to strengthen surveillance on the Ituri side:

"Ebolavirus disease has resurfaced in North Kivu. It seems, according to our Minister of Health, one of the patients went through Biakato, which means that we have to push the investigations to find out exactly how it happened and to carry out reinforced surveillance in and around Biakato," indicated Dr Muyembe.

"The actions are already there, and we, INRB, have already sent the drugs, our MAB 114 molecule. And the WHO has already sent the vaccines. So the actions will be taken very quickly. And this surveillance does not stop only in North Kivu. It will extend even in Ituri as during the years of the epidemic from 2018 to 2020," he added.

[The index case in the chain of transmission is becoming clearer, but the stepmother of the nurse may not be the true origin since she was misdiagnosed. Others may also have been misdiagnosed before her. And it still is not clear how she (the nurse's stepmother) became infected.

Fortunately, the country has experience and is responding quickly, giving hope for a rapid resolution once ring vaccination is in place and contacts are immunized.

As stated in earlier posts, rapid tests maintained in-country would be tremendously powerful in stopping outbreaks. - Mod.LK
