Northern Ethiopia humanitarian update situation report
------------------------------------------------------
Highlights:
- Malnutrition rates increasing in Afar with 30% increase in admissions of severely malnourished children in March [2022] and 28% in April [2022].
- Only 19 out of 33 woredas [third-level of the administrative divisions of Ethiopia -- after zones and the regional states] in Afar are getting nutrition support for the moderately malnourished due to resource constraints.
- Logia Hospital in Afar will now provide stabilization service for severely malnourished children. This will ease the load from Dubti Hospital.
- Since early April [2020], truck movements to Tigray followed an upward trend, from 170 trucks in April [2022], to over 1100 in May [2022] and over 1200 in June [2022] so far.
- A total of 9 people in Mariam Adi-Gesheti in North-Western Zone in Tigray tested positive for anthrax.

[Following a few excerpts from reports that provide background to anthrax in Ethiopia.

Livestock owners' anthrax prevention practices and its associated factors in Sekota Zuria district, Northeast Ethiopia. Seid K, Shiferaw AM, Yesuf NN. BMC Veterinary Research. https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-020-2267-0
"Globally, 10 000-100 000 human anthrax incidences occur annually with a significant number of cases from developing countries, like Chad, Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and India. At the moment, anthrax stands 2nd only to rabies among the zoonotic diseases which are dealt with by one health approach. The federal ministries of health and agriculture surveillance data of Ethiopia (2009-2013) reported a total of 5197 human and 26 214 animal anthrax cases. The highest human cases of 6.7 and 2.3% per 100,100 population were reported from Tigray and Amhara regions, respectively. About 2602 anthrax cases and 18 deaths were reported from Amhara region between 2010 and 2014; 50.6% of the cases and 33.3% of the deaths were from Wag-Himra Zone.

"The culture of raw meat consumption combined with the low level of awareness about anthrax have increased the risk for contracting the disease in Ethiopia. Additionally, most of the people of Wag-Himra support their life by cattle, sheep and goat husbandry which potentially exposes them to anthrax due to close contacts with livestock, use of hides and skins for different purposes and the consumption of the meat of animals that died from unknown cases with their families and neighbours. Livestock owners' knowledge and appropriate practices of prevention play a key role in the control of the disease both in humans and animals. Studies which could provide updated evidences about anthrax prevention practices of livestock owners have not been done in the area and in the region."

Knowledge, attitude and practice towards anthrax in Northern Ethiopia: a mixed approach study. Jun 2020 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346567793_Knowledge_Attitude_and_Practice_towards_Anthrax_in_Northern_Ethiopia_a_mixed_approach_study
"Background: Anthrax is the second most highly prioritized zoonotic disease in Ethiopia due to its negative impact at the household level, causing disease and production losses in livestock and severe disease in humans. This study seeks to assess the knowledge of, attitudes towards, and practices addressing (KAPs) anthrax in the communities of Eastern Tigray, Northern Ethiopia."

Resilience and livelihoods change in Tigray, Ethiopia. Vaitla B, Tesfay G, Rounseville M, Maxwel D. Oct 2012 https://fic.tufts.edu/assets/Resilience-and-Livelihoods-Change-in-Tigray-FINAL-30-10-12.pdf
"The 3 main categories of disease hazards found in the study area are human diseases, livestock diseases, and crop pests. Human illnesses include a wide range of gastro-intestinal and respiratory diseases, and malaria at lower elevations. The prevalence of HIV is relatively low. The main livestock diseases include pasteurellosis, which affects mainly small ruminants, and blackleg, foot and mouth, and anthrax, which affect cattle. The major crop pests are rust, which affects barley and wheat, and shoot fly, which attacks teff and maize (DPPA 2006)."

I am very grateful for Mahmoud assembling this report on anthrax in Northern Ethiopia.

Anthrax is hyper-enzootic in Ethiopia and the government has essentially given up reporting this disease. It is known to occur in wildlife but it goes unmentioned. Frankly it has got away from them and is exacerbated but the widespread malnutrition which encourages the consumption of dead cattle, not infrequently from anthrax, and the real threat that it poses to the human population. And without livestock vaccination and the proper disposal of carcasses, much less adequate surveillance, the disease the pathogen thrives. A lesson to us all. - Mod.MHJ
