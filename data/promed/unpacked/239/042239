Dear Colleagues,

Earlier this year, ProMED-mail asked a sampling of its readership to
take five minutes to complete a brief online survey. While the
demographic data about our fellow readers provided interesting facts
(for instance, that over 70% of respondents find significant
employment in more than one job), the most striking information
relates to the role ProMED-mail plays in people’s lives.

* 96% of subscribers say they look at ProMED-mail regularly. 39%
of our subscribers spend 60 minutes or more reading ProMED-mail each
week.

* 79% of ProMED-mail subscribers find its content important
enough to share. Mostly using email, but also in conversation, 72% of
readers share it with their colleagues, 26% pass its information on to
their staff, and 17% to their students. On average, users re-broadcast
ProMED-mail postings to another 6 people.

* 99% said they would miss ProMED-mail if it stopped; 61% said
they would miss it “a great deal.”

Given the strong endorsement of the importance and efficacy of
ProMED-mail for the people who read it, I find it puzzling that as of
today less than one percent of all subscribers have donated to support
this vital resource.

Can it really be that out of 58,000 subscribers only 439 are able to
help keep ProMED-mail uncensored, unfettered, and free?

If you are one of the 39% who spend more than an hour each week with
ProMED-mail, please donate today.

If you ever find ProMED-mail important enough to share with your
colleagues, staff, or students, please donate now at:

If ProMED-mail can’t pay its bills, it will cease to publish. If you
are one of the 99% of readers who will miss it, please donate
generously.

To those who have already given, thank you! To those who “keep
meaning to give” – please stop procrastinating! To those who
assume it will take too long, I promise an online donation will take
you less than six minutes. Finally, to those who think they can’t
afford it, please think again. Everybody’s contribution is
important – please help!


Sincerely,
--
