[1] Taiwan ex Thailand: flight attendants

A 2nd case of measles has been confirmed among flight attendants working for budget airline Tigerair Taiwan, raising concern for the passengers on the 6 flights the 2nd victim worked on after contracting the virus.

Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang of Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported on [Wed 4 Apr 2018] a new imported case of measles contracted by a female flight attendant in her 20s who works for Tigerair Taiwan.

On [Sat 17 Mar 2018], the steward who was the 1st reported case of measles and the stewardess came into contact with a 30-year old Taiwanese man who contracted measles in Thailand and flew to Okinawa in Japan where he was treated.

The steward, in his 30s, was confirmed to have contracted the disease on [Tue 3 Apr 2018]. He was put under quarantine on [Mon 2 Apr 2018], according to Tigerair Taiwan.

Although the stewardess stopped working after she fell ill on [Sun 1 Apr 2018] and was later informed by the CDC that she had measles, the window of infection during which an infected person can spread the disease is 4 days before and after the onset of the fever, Chuang said.

In other words, passengers on the 6 flights the stewardess worked from [Thu 29-Sat 31 Mar 2018] could have caught the virus from her. Those flights were from Taoyuan to Osaka, Osaka to Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung to Tokyo, Tokyo to Taoyuan, Taoyuan to Macao, and Macao back to Taoyuan.

The CDC has identified the 852 people the stewardess came into contact with and are monitoring their health.

This marks the 6th confirmed case of measles in Taiwan this year [2018], with 3 being domestic and 3 imported -- 2 from Thailand and 1 from Indonesia.

While some symptoms of measles can resemble that of a cold, such as fever, coughing, and a runny nose, Hwang Kao-ping, a pediatrician at Taiwan's China Medical University Hospital, said that what sets measles apart is the Koplik spots that develop inside the mouth before the rash appears. Once the rash presents, it lasts for 4-7 days, Hwang said.

http://www.freepressjournal.in/india/jharkhand-3-infants-die-after-they-were-vaccinated-for-measles/1253455


A total of 3 infants died while 6 [became ill] in Loyenga village of Jharkhand's Palamu district, hours after they were vaccinated. The local villagers alleged that the children's health deteriorated soon after they were vaccinated for Japanese encephalitis (JE), measles, and DPT [diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus]. The angry locals also took hostage the village's Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM). Concerned officials reached the village to probe the reason behind the death.

"The matter is in initial stages, only after investigation we can ascertain the reason," investigation team doctor Anil Kumar Srivastava said. Chief Minister Raghubar Das also announced a compensation of Rs. 1 lakh [about USD 1532] each for families of the victims.

MLA Radhakrishna who visited the village, said, "A team is probing the matter, if wrongdoings are found, action will be taken. Chief Minister has expressed grief."

[See the next report which blames the deaths on the Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine. It is not clear if this may be local contamination of multi-dose vaccine vials, and if so, which vaccine. The culprit could be measles, JE, or DPT vaccines. Since the infants became ill within hours of the vaccination, the responsible agent is fast-acting. See the following item. - Mod.LK

To date, 4 infants have died since [Sat 7 Apr 2018] after being vaccinated for Japanese encephalitis and measles in Jharkhand's Palamu district, one of the state's most backward districts. 3 of the victims died within 8 hours of the vaccination on [Sat 7 Apr 2018] while 5 others are undergoing treatment at a government hospital.

A total of 9 children were given the vaccines at the local government health subcentre in Loinga village under the Patan community health centre in Palamu on [Sat 7 Apr 2018].

The district administration has ordered a high level probe into the deaths and a team from Ranchi was sent to find out the reason for the casualties in the village, almost 200 km [about 124 mi] northwest of the capital Ranchi.

Villagers alleged within 6-8 hours after vaccination, the children fell seriously ill with high fever and bouts of vomiting while their eyes turned yellow. Their condition deteriorated so quickly that 3 of them died before anything could be done.

Family members along with villagers blocked traffic for more than 3 hours near the village, 25 km [15.5 mi] from Daltonganj on [Sun 8 Apr 2018]. The irate villagers also briefly held the village auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) Draupadi Pandey hostage, accusing her of being responsible for the tragedy.

Of the victims, 3 were aged between 1 year and 18 months. The 4th child, 2 years old, died Sunday afternoon [8 Apr 2018] at Daltonganj Sadar Hospital. Another infant was referred to RIMS, Ranchi for better treatment.

Palamu deputy commissioner (DC) Ameet Kumar acknowledged the tragedy and assured the villagers of action against the guilty. "9 children were vaccinated in the village yesterday [7 Apr 2018]. It was a routine vaccination for measles and other diseases. 3 children have died while 6 others are admitted at Sadar Hospital. They are responding well to the treatment," he said.

"The Palamu civil surgeon is probing the incident. We will take action after the probe is over. Guilty will not be spared," Kumar added. The office of the chief minister announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 1 lakh [about USD 1532] for the each of the bereaved families and free treatment for those children still in hospital.

An outbreak of measles has spread across the South Island with 5 confirmed cases. 2 further cases of measles have now been confirmed, one in Nelson and the other in Christchurch. These are linked to the 3 cases notified late last week [week of 2 Apr 2018] which were reported in Queenstown, Wanaka, and Christchurch.

Public Health officials across the South Island are urging anyone with symptoms suggestive of measles to phone for health advice in the 1st instance given the geographical spread of those affected.

Canterbury DHB [District Health Board] Medical Officer of Health Dr Ramon Pink said staff had been unable to trace the source of the outbreak. This person may have had a relatively mild illness and now be fully recovered.

They have been able to determine that the 1st 3 confirmed cases all visited Queenstown Airport on [22 Mar 2018] and those cases, and others infected since, have travelled on domestic flights within the South Island and may have visited supermarkets, restaurants, campgrounds, various recreational facilities and other public places.

Investigations are continuing and close contacts are being identified for follow-up.

[...]

The Public Health team in Nelson was investigating whether the latest case had been immunised to protect against measles; the other 4 cases had not been immunised. The cases range in age from 13 months-46 years old.

People are considered immune if they have received 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, have had a measles illness previously, or were born before 1969.

Canterbury DHB Medical Officer of Health Dr Ramon Pink said staff had been unable to trace the source of the outbreak. This person may have had a relatively mild illness and now be fully recovered...

DOH [Department of Health] launches 'Ligtas Tigdas' as measles cases rise to 723. The Department of Health (DOH) is set to hold a 2-month supplemental measles vaccination drive for children 4 years old and younger in the National Capital Region (NCR) and parts of Mindanao to help stop the rising cases of measles in the country.

This is part of DOH's "Ligtas Tigdas" strategy launched on Thu 12 Apr 2018, in response to the 723 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles recorded from [1 Jan-26 Mar 2018].

Most of the cases are found in the Davao Region, Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Zamboanga Peninsula, Soccskargen, and Northern Mindanao.

A total of 13 deaths have also been reported so far.

To address the rising measles cases, the DOH will hold a National Measles Supplemental Immunization Activity for children 6 months up to 4 years old and 11 months in NCR [National Capital Region] from [25 April-25 May 2018].

The same vaccination program will be held in Mindanao areas with reported cases of measles from [9 May-8 Jun 2018].

DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III primarily attributed the increase of measles cases to the panic triggered by the controversial Dengvaxia dengue vaccine.

Ever since Dengvaxia maker Sanofi Pasteur announced the possible risks of their vaccine, Filipino parents became scared to get their children immunized for other diseases, including measles.

Measles outbreaks were previously declared in Negros Oriental, a barangay in Taguig, Zamboanga City, Davao region, and Davao city.

Duque emphasized the measles vaccine is "safe." A vaccinated person, however, may feel "generally mild and transient" side effects after getting a measles shot. "Slight pain, tenderness, mild swelling and redness at the injection site, mild fever and local adenopathy may usually occur. Severe and systemic reactions following vaccination are rare," said Duque.

He already told health workers to "woo" parents to avail of free vaccination programs again to help protect their children.

According to the Directorate-General for Health (DGS), 7 additional confirmed measles cases have been reported in Portugal, bringing the total confirmed cases since February [2018] to 105, (computer translated).

The bulk of the cases are linked to the Santo Antonio Hospital in Porto where some 85 cases have been reported in health care professionals.

Of the total number of infected, 15 were not vaccinated and 10 had not completed the vaccination schedule.

Measles is one of the most contagious of all infectious diseases; approximately 9 out of 10 susceptible persons with close contact to a measles patient will develop measles. The virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can live for up to 2 hours in the air or on surfaces.

People with measles usually have a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Some people also get an ear infection, diarrhea, or a serious lung infection such as pneumonia. Although severe cases are rare, measles can cause swelling of the brain and death.

Another measles outbreak in the [Dnieper] river. [23 students and 3 members of the local Agrouniversity in Dnipro contracted the disease]. The regional laboratory center of the Ministry of Health reported that figures are not final, because every day there are new cases.

Doctors diagnosed measles in 19 people, mostly agriculture students. All had the same symptoms -- high fever and rash on the body. Doctors say there were no complications because they [received medical attention on time]. One of the reasons for the disease is lack of vaccinations.

At the University, [there was] no panic. First, quarantine was announced in the dormitory. It was decided not to declare a full quarantine in the hostel. Rather, it was closed for visitors for only 2 weeks, during which it was sanitized.

Now 2 students of the agrarian-economic University are in the hospital.

In southwest France, the largest administrative region, Nouvelle-Aquitaine is experiencing an epidemic situation of measles, according to French health officials.

Since 1 Jan 2018, France has reported a significant increase in measles cases, recording 1346 cases. In Nouvelle-Aquitaine, more than half of the country's cases have been reported (758). Outbreaks of measles have been reported from other regions as well.

20 percent of the total cases across the country required hospitalization.

The measles resurgence began in November 2017 in France after reporting decreasing numbers since 2012.

Health officials blame the resurgence on inadequate vaccination coverage in infants (79 percent with 2 doses of vaccine instead of the 95 percent needed), children, and young adults. In the current outbreak, 87 percent of measles cases occurred in unvaccinated or poorly vaccinated individuals.

Public Health France reminds that vaccination is the only way to protect against measles.

The measles outbreak in Limerick continues to worsen after 4 months. The HSE [Health Services Executive] has confirmed that there are now 28 cases of measles in the Mid-West region, the majority of which are in Limerick city.

This week marks the 4th month since the measles outbreak was first announced by the HSE.

Three cases are linked to Clare, Dublin and Galway. "There are also a number of cases in the South East area, who are possibly linked to the Limerick outbreak," the HSE said.

The HSE is continuing to urge adults aged under 40 across the Mid-West to get the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine which is available free from GPs and is warning that "measles is a serious public health issue."

A spokesperson said: "Over 2/3 of cases are aged between 15 and 50 years. As cases are continuing to occur the HSE is advising that adults who have not had measles infection in the past should ensure that they have had 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

"There is a risk of ongoing exposure especially for those whose work involves meeting large numbers of people, such as people who work with children, people who work in healthcare, those who work in education, those working in public offices or public services, those who work in retail premises, and those who attend healthcare premises either as patients or visitors."

"It is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected," said a spokesperson.

[...]

Bernard Gloster, chief officer for HSE Mid-West, pictured, has urged people to avail of the vaccines. "They [the programmes] have been the subject of criticism and concern and views. People are entitled to their views, but certainly, when I see some of the commentary that I see about vaccines and I now look at the 25-plus cases of the outbreak of measles, it really for me is 2 and 2 will always be 4. And we have to continue to get our protection levels up."

State health officials are investigating a confirmed case of measles in New Orleans [Louisiana].

Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that can spread quickly among people who have not been vaccinated. In extreme cases, it can lead to hospitalization and even death.

The person who tested positive for measles is currently hospitalized in New Orleans, according a Department of Health press release. Officials are trying to identify and notify people that the patient may have come in contact with to prevent the spread of the virus.

The patient traveled to New Orleans last week [week of 2 Apr 2018] from the United Kingdom and became increasingly sick through the week before being hospitalized over the weekend. Test samples taken over the weekend came back positive for measles.

Dr Charles Goodman posted a clear notice in his waiting room and on Facebook: His practice will no longer see children whose parents won't get them vaccinated. "Parents who choose not to give measles shots, they're not just putting their kids at risk, but they're also putting other kids...

"Measles is extremely rare in the US because almost all children are vaccinated before they enter school. Nonetheless, we take measles very seriously and will take all steps to alert the public and give them the information to best protect themselves," said Dr Jimmy Guidry, a state health officer. "Our epidemiologists are working to learn where the individual has traveled, and where he has visited since landing in New Orleans to try and determine if other people may have been exposed." ...

The outbreak of measles at the internally displaced persons (IDPs) camp at Abagena in Makurdi, Benue State, has claimed the lives of not less than 7 children.

A parent and one of the displaced persons whose 2 children were in critical condition, told The Guardian at the camp yesterday [5 Apr 2018] that the camp has been hit by the measles outbreak in the past 9 days during which the deaths were recorded.

He said the camp officials have provided drugs for his sick children but their condition was not getting any better, adding that no fewer than seven children have died from measles in the camp, while others were still lying critically ill.

Another internally displaced person said 3 pregnant women who were affected by the measles had miscarriages...
