There have been 6 confirmed cases of scarlet fever in Guernsey.
However, the director of public health is reassuring us not to worry.
Dr Stephen Bridgman says there have been no severe cases of the virus
[actually a bacterium, _Streptococcus pyogenes_ is the cause of
scarlet fever] so far and the situation is being monitored.

The time between becoming infected and having symptoms is short,
generally 1-2 days. The illness typically begins with a fever and sore
throat. The rash usually first appears on the neck and chest, and then
spreads over the body. It is described as "sandpapery" in feel. The
texture of the rash is more important than the appearance in
confirming the diagnosis. The rash can last for more than a week. As
the rash fades, peeling (desquamation) may occur around the
fingertips, toes, and groin area.

Around 20 confirmed and suspected cases of scarlet fever have been
identified at island schools.

An Education Department spokeswoman said yesterday [14 Feb 2011],
however, that most schools were actually clear. 'The department sent
out information about scarlet fever, its symptoms and advice on
treatment and prevention to all schools on 7 Feb 2011 after the health
authorities confirmed that 3 cases had been identified in primary age
children.

[Scarlet fever is an infection caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_,
also known as group A streptococcus (GAS), a Gram positive coccus that
grows in chains. Scarlet fever is usually associated with concurrent
streptococcal pharyngitis, but may be associated with a streptococcal
infection at other sites. An erythrogenic exotoxin released by the
strains of _S. pyogenes_ that cause scarlet fever leads to the red
rash that is characteristic of the illness. The incidence of
pharyngeal disease is highest in school-aged children (5-15 years),
during winter and spring, and in a setting of crowding and close
contact. Person-to-person spread from infected patients by means of
respiratory droplets is the most common mode of transmission. It can
rarely spread through contaminated food
(<http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196904242801702>).

Persons who have GAS sore throat or skin infections are most likely
to spread the infection; those who carry the bacteria but have no
symptoms are less contagious
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm>).
A history of GAS sore throat or scarlet fever in the community,
neighborhood, or school may increase the likelihood of infection.

The incubation period (the time between becoming infected and having
symptoms) is short, generally 1-2 days. The illness typically begins
with a fever, sore throat, and an initially white, then bright red
tongue with prominent red papillae, the so-called a "strawberry"
tongue, followed 12-48 hours later by a rash. The rash usually first
appears on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body, and is more
intense in skin folds, the so-called Pastia lines. The rash is
described as "sandpapery" to touch. The face may be flushed with
perioral pallor. The rash can last for more than a week and is
followed by peeling (desquamation) of the skin around the palms,
fingertips, toes, and groin area.

Diagnosis of scarlet fever is clinical. Blood cultures are rarely
positive, but GAS can usually be demonstrated in the throat by culture
or rapid streptococcal test. Complications of scarlet fever include
local spread of the streptococcal throat infection to involve regional
lymph nodes, retropharyngeal tissues, middle ear, and sinuses and
immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Septic complications due to
spread of GAS in blood, such as meningitis, pyogenic arthritis, and
endocarditis, occur rarely.

Treatment of scarlet fever is no different than that of GAS
pharyngitis, that is, oral penicillin, erythromycin, or clindamycin
for 10 days, or one intramuscular dose of penicillin G benzathine.
With proper antibiotic treatment, complications are uncommon:
penicillin therapy for treatment of GAS pharyngitis within 9 days of
onset of symptoms has been shown to decrease the incidence of ARF;
unlike ARF, antimicrobial therapy does not prevent acute
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Early recognition and treatment of GAS pharyngitis is essential to
prevent spread of group A streptococcal infections. Patients should no
longer be infectious after taking antibiotics for 24 hours.

The Bailiwick of Guernsey, with a population of 65 726 in 2008, is a
British Crown Dependency in the English Channel off the coast of
Normandy (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey>) and includes the
islands of Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, Brecqhou, Herm, Jethou, Burhou,
and Lihou, which along with the Bailiwick of Jersey form the Channel
Islands. Guernsey is situated 30 miles (48 km) west of France's
Normandy coast and 75 miles (121 km) south of Weymouth, England. The
island of Guernsey itself had a population of 59 710 in 2001 and has a
total area of 25 square miles [about 65 sq km). Saint Peter Port, the
capital of Guernsey as well as its main port, had a population of 16
488.
