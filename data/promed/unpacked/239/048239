Earlier this week, 14 children between the ages of 4 and 11 were taken to the Tielt hospital in West Flanders after contracting the disease. It soon became apparent that the source of the infection was to be sought from a caterer who had provided meals to several Flemish schools. The Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (Afsca) has also suspended its activity Thursday night [24 May 2018].

It now seems that the infection is much more than the 2 schools initially affected. "We are talking about at least 37 kindergartens and primary schools in West and East Flanders," says Joris Moonens of the Health and Care Agency. "We suspect that the children were infected on [17-18 May 2018] by their school canteen meal."

About 60 of them were hospitalized because they had symptoms of salmonellosis. Others went to a doctor, of whom 37 were confirmed to be salmonellosis. "We expect this number to continue to increase."

Other infections are not excluded. The caterer delivers also in CPAS and other institutions. However, no case has been reported yet. "We are going to analyze the stool of the staff working for the caterer to exclude that the caterer's products have been infected by one of his workers," adds Joris Moonens. For if the raw materials of the caterer have been contaminated, this may also be the case of equipment or other products. "That's why we take not only food samples, but also parts of the installation," says an Afsca spokesperson.

The caterer remains closed for the moment. A specialized company takes care of decontaminating the catering company.
