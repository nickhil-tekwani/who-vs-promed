Ten people fell ill with anthrax in the Haymana district of Ankara after butchering cattle affected with anthrax.

According to information obtained from Tepekoy county, 12 people were bringing cattle back from grazing in the neighborhood when the animals started dropping dead. Not wanting to have a total loss, the carcasses were butchered, and the meat shared with their neighbors. Later, 10 people were taken to hospital, found to have cutaneous anthrax, treated, and released.

Headman Necati Sea said in a statement: "It is suspected that the infections followed from exposing cuts to the infected blood. Currently, our neighborhood life has returned to normal. Official investigations are continuing. A panic situation does not exist. There will be animal movement controls into and out of the district for a limited time," he said.

Following the detection of cases, and a Food, Agriculture and Livestock Directorate quarantine in Tepekoy, life was back to normal.
