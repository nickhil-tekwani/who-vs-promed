Within the last week, a person in Mecklenburg County [North Carolina] was diagnosed with red measles, or rubeola [an alternative name for measles in English-speaking countries], after traveling to a country where the disease is common. The patient is now under quarantine at home. Mecklenburg County Health Director Marcus Plescia said the person traveled to Charlotte from India and had not been vaccinated. Officials say preventative measures are being taken and there is no immediate risk to the general public. Dr Plescia said family members of the patient were initially quarantined and tested for measles.

Red measles is described as a contagious respiratory disease that is caused by a virus. Officials say it is spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, a sore throat, and a rash that spreads over the entire body. Measles can be prevented with a MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Children and adults can contact their primary contact care physician if they have not been vaccinated. The MMR vaccine is usually given to babies between 12 and 15 months and again when the child is between 4 and 6 years old. Anyone planning to travel outside of the country is urged by officials to contact their primary physician about vaccinations.
