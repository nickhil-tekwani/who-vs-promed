The recent spell of rain in Kodagu district [Karnataka] has left growers worried as coffee and black pepper vines are badly affected with fruit rot disease. Rainfall has aggravated the disease. The growers feel that about 20 to 30 per cent of the crops have been damaged.

Fruit rot is a fungal disease. The affected leaves turn black and branches start decaying. Agriculture experts have urged the growers to initiate measures to prevent the spread of disease. "The roots of the coffee plants should be cleared. If a plant is affected, then such leaves and beans should be destroyed. Bordeaux mixture [copper sulfate] should be sprayed before the monsoon," the Coffee Board said.

ICAR [Indian Council of Agricultural Research] organised a demonstration on controlling bacterial wilt affecting pepper vines.

[It is unclear which diseases the report above refers to. Reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed for successful management of the problems.

For coffee, a number of fungal diseases exist that can affect fruits: Anthracnose (_Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_) has been reported from India, but it affects not only fruits, but also leaves and stems. Thread blight (_Corticium koleroga_) of coffee is known to occur in Karnataka (for example, ProMED-mail post 20130821.1891616), the symptoms of which include rot on leaves, twigs and berries followed by defoliation, berry drop and dieback. Coffee berry disease (_Colletotrichum kahawae_), which could be considered a 'fruit rot', has so far only been reported from Africa.

For black pepper, no references to any 'bacterial wilt' can be located, but in general, bacterial wilts due to, for example, _Ralstonia_ or _Xanthomonas_ species can affect many crops. However, pepper berries as well as other parts of the vines can be affected by fungal anthracnose (_C. gloeosporoides). Quick wilt (also called foot rot; _Phytophthora capsici_) affects the whole plant and is considered the most serious threat to this crop in India.
