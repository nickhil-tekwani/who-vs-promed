Contaminated maize kills 26 in Makueni District
--------------------
26 people have died in the southern Kenyan district of Makueni after eating
maize believed to have been contaminated with aflatoxin, a poisonous mould
that grows mostly on cereals harvested or stored under damp conditions, a
health officer said on Friday.

6 other people were in hospital suffering from aflatoxin poisoning, a
condition characterised by vomiting, abdominal pain, pulmonary oedema,
convulsions, coma, and death from cerebral oedema and swelling of the
liver, kidneys, and heart, Benjamin Ndaka, a health education officer in
charge of Makueni, told IRIN by telephone.

He said the 26 deaths had occurred over a period of a month since the first
case had been reported on 10 Apr 2004.

"We took samples of maize and maize meal from the affected villages for
analysis, and aflatoxins were detected," said Ndaka.

Ndaka said the most affected area was Ulilinza village of Kibwezi Division,
but that other cases of aflatoxin poisoning had been reported in Makindu
and Mtito Andei divisions as well.

He said district health officials were still trying to identify the source
of the contaminated maize. The area was currently experiencing grain
shortages, he added, resulting in people relying on maize that had been
brought in from other areas of the country.

Humans are exposed to aflatoxins through the consumption of foods
contaminated with fungal growths.

Toxic grain kills 26 Kenyans
--------------------
At least 26 people have died and several others have been admitted to
hospital in the past month after eating toxic grain in eastern Kenya, a
medical official said on Friday.

"Not less than 26 people have died here in Makindu hospital as a result of
food poisoning for almost a month now," Eastern Province's public health
official Joseph Matheka told reporters by phone.

All the victims had consumed infected cereals, Matheka added.

"Several others are still admitted and they are presenting the same
symptoms caused by aflatoxin," a toxin that occurs in soil, decaying
vegetation, hay, and grains, he said.

Incidents of food poisoning are quite common in Kenya, but they rarely
cause deaths, owing to the accessibility of medical care and medication.

[In yesterday's posting (see Undiagnosed deaths, children - Kenya
(Makueni): RFI 20040513.1299 ) we ran through possible infectious
etiologies for the undiagnosed deaths, but also mentioned the possibility
of hepatotoxins. Aflatoxin is a potent hepatotoxin and has been reported
in Kenya in the past (see Aflatoxicosis, human - Kenya 20011007.2427).

The area involved is mentioned to be experiencing grain shortages, which
would lead to use of grains from other geographical areas and prolonged
storage that would enhance the growth of the molds.

Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mycotoxin produced by 2 types of mold:
_Aspergillus flavus_ and _Aspergillus parasiticus_. _Aspergillus flavus_ is
common and widespread in nature and is most often found when certain grains
are grown under stressful conditions such as drought. The mold occurs in
soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological
deterioration and invades all types of organic substrates whenever and
wherever the conditions are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions
include high moisture content and high temperature. At least 13 different
types of aflatoxin are produced in nature, with aflatoxin B1 considered as
the most toxic. While the presence of _Aspergillus flavus_ does not always
indicate harmful levels of aflatoxin, it does mean that the potential for
aflatoxin production is present.
(From:<http://www.usda.gov/gipsa/newsroom/backgrounders/b-aflatox.htm>).

Aflatoxins are acutely toxic and have been shown to be carcinogenic for
some animals. Their toxicity varies between different species, but data
from a large outbreak of poisoning in India in 1974, which involved mouldy
maize and in which nearly 100 people died, suggests that the toxicity of
aflatoxin B1 for humans lies somewhere between that for the dog and that
for the rat. The involvement of aflatoxins with human cancer is more
complex and remains to be defined.
