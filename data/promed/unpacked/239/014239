Spread of Bighorn Sheep Pneumonia Continues
-------------------------------------------
The deadly spread of pneumonia in Montana's bighorn sheep population
picked up momentum west of Anaconda, where a hunter alerted Fish,
Wildlife & Parks (FWP) of possible disease in the Lost Creek
population. Biologists killed 4 sheep and confirmed through lab work
they were infected. FWP announced the latest outbreak today, which
occurred in the 6th bighorn sheep population in west central Montana.

FWP, in its killing of suspected sick sheep, is continuing an
experimental and aggressive battle against the easily spread and
usually fatal respiratory disease.

"We're too early in this to know everything we'd like to know. But,
until we are able to survey and collect more sheep, we have to
proceed as if we are dealing with a pneumonia outbreak," said FWP
Wildlife Biologist Ray Vinkey. "We can't afford to miss the chance of
removing the last sick sheep before they infect the rest of the
population. Right now we're taking it one day at a time."

A hunter of Butte, 1st reported signs of sick sheep west of Anaconda
during a preseason scouting trip on 17 Aug 2010. Vinkey and another
FWP wildlife biologist, Jay Kolbe, responded and shot the sheep that
exhibited clinical signs or behavior suggesting pneumonia. According
to an FWP news release, they collected blood and tissue samples for
further analysis at the FWP wildlife lab in Bozeman. Necropsies
showed everything from early to advanced infection in the lungs,
which in the worst case had also compromised the heart and liver. The
varying stages of infection suggest that the disease is spreading over time.

Other pneumonia outbreaks affected bighorn populations in the East
Fork of the Bitterroot late last fall [2009] and in the Bonner area
and Lower and Upper Rock Creek herds in January and February [2010].
Most recently FWP detected pneumonia in the Skalkaho population east
of Hamilton on 9 Aug 2010.

Last fall, FWP began killing sick sheep from the East Fork and Bonner
populations to try to protect healthy animals. Officials allowed the
disease to run its course in Lower Rock Creek, however, due to
terrain and difficulty in finding and approaching the bighorns there.
The disease also ran its course in Upper Rock Creek, where it was too
widespread to try to control. Bighorns wandering to or from Rock
Creek could have spread the disease to the Anaconda herd this summer
[2010], but the source may never be proven, according to FWP.

"Our experience so far in the East Fork of the Bitterroot
demonstrates that killing sick sheep can succeed in saving the rest
of the population," said Mike Thompson, FWP Region 2 Wildlife
Manager. "This kind of work is hard on everyone. But, the key is
early detection and a quick, aggressive response."

Chris Anderson, a student volunteer with FWP from the University of
Minnesota, documented the survival of 32 lambs per 100 ewes in the
East Fork this summer, where FWP removed 80 sick individuals last
fall [2009] and winter, and at least 87 seemingly healthy sheep
remain. But where FWP let the disease run its course last winter,
Anderson was unable to find any lambs that had survived exposure to
the pathogens persisting in Rock Creek bighorns. He reports
landowners have found dead lambs and sick adults in that area this summer.

The Lost Creek herd was established in 1967, with help from the
Anaconda Sportsmen's Club, when 25 bighorns were transplanted from
the Sun River herd. More than half of the population was lost to
pneumonia in 1991, but has since recovered to number at least 297
sheep. Twelve hunters hold either-sex licenses and 30 hold
ewe-licenses for this hunting district, which are valid beginning 5
Sep 2010. FWP will contact hunters as more becomes known about the outbreak.

There have been no known cases of humans or pets contracting
pneumonia from wild sheep, but FWP cautions anyone who finds dead or
sick bighorn sheep to leave the animal alone. FWP also encourages the
public to immediately report any observations of sheep exhibiting
signs of an illness or strange behavior.

"Reports from the public were responsible for the 1st detection of
pneumonia in most of our recent outbreaks," said Vinkey. "These
reports from the public help us determine how widespread the sickness
is and give us a chance at catching it in its early stages."
