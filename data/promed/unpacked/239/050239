Bluetongue Disease (Germany)
----------------------------------
More than 1500 new cases of BT have been registered in cattle and
sheep Germany between 1 Jun 2007 and 3 Sep 2007. The current outbreak
started in an area east of Cologne and Bonn that had been affected
already in the BTV-8 epidemic in 2006. The disease is spreading in
northern, eastern and southern direction.
So far, cases have been reported from Bavaria, Hesse, Lower Saxony,
North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Thuringia.

[We are very appreciative to have a 1st-hand account from Prof.
Mettenleiter and colleagues that summarizes the extent and
distribution of the outbreak in Europe. The map referenced above is
useful and depicts the density of these outbreaks.
We will continue to occasionally provide OIE update reports in
summary form only as this BT-8 epidemic will be difficult to report
in real-time because 50 or 100 farms can be reported in a single
update report. Maps are always attached in the OIE updates and are an
excellent adjunct tool -- maybe the best in this situation -- for
tracking the extent and distribution of the epidemic. - Mod.PC]
