Support for a "Pan-global" Vaccine
----------------------------------
I read Dr. Woodall's recent post [Influenza vaccine: time for global unity?
20010210.0268 with great interest, as I am also struggling with the
northern-southern hemisphere influenza vaccine issue. I am a regional
medical officer with the US Department of State posted in Lima, Peru and I
cover the northern tier of the South American continent. My patients, the
diplomatic staff of the State Department, are at high risk of contracting
influenza during both peaks, i.e., December-February and May-July. As you
are aware, the vaccines for the hemispheres do not provide
"cross-coverage"; hence we are currently vaccinating twice yearly.
Needless to say, this is not met with a great deal of enthusiasm by our
patients or by our Health Units, who must procure, administer and monitor
these vaccines. I share your interest in the development of a unified, once
yearly "pan-global" [global vaccine.

An Alternative Perspective
--------------------------
I am curious as to the seminal thought that led to distinctions between
northern and southern hemispheric varieties [of influenza virus. It is
obvious that actual geography does not obey the arbitrary lines drawn on
the planet by mankind... nor do infectious disease agents care much for
lines drawn for navigational purposes. Dr. Jack Woodall's initial post in
this thread is the first I've ever read of such a man-made geographical
distinction being used to define the range of an infectious agent.
Perhaps the explanation lies in the shortcomings of human language. It may
be easier to speak of northern and southern hemispheres than continents
(separated by water) and regions (separated by physical features such as
large rivers, mountains, and inhospitable environments: deserts and ice).
Nevertheless, I find the "north-south" designation quite arbitrary,
potentially vague, possibly misleading, and definitely confusing.
Scientific language provides for precise, definitive descriptions. If
anyone could provide a rationale for such a distinction, I would be
interested in reading it.
