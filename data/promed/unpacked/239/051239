RABIES, BATS - ENGLAND: RFI
===========================

Subject: Rabies in United Kingdom
I realize that for most of the world rabies is not technically an
emerging disease, but it is for Great Britain. A friend there gave
me a little info on an outbreak of rabies at a bat sanctuary that
is apparently causing all sorts of animal exportation problems. Can
anyone out there expand on this story?

[- There was a very brief note in my local Sunday paper indicating
that a rabied bat had been diagnosed in southern England, with no
more details than that. There are some published observations that
certain species in Kent & Sussex appear to fly across the Channel
to/from the French coast. Would our British members please provide
details on the rabied species involved, circumstances, and the nature
of the exportation problems. Thanks. MHJ ]
