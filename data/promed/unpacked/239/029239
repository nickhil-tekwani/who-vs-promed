An outbreak of infections among people using legal highs has been reported by doctors. More than 100 patients in the East of Scotland have been treated for the skin infection in the last 6 months, with many needing to stay in hospital for some time, and it is understood at least one person has had to have a limb amputated.

The problem is associated with the injection of legal highs often known as 'Burst' -- a practice which seems to have become popular in the Edinburgh and Musselburgh area. Jim Sherval, consultant in public health for NHS Lothian, said the frequency with which people were injecting the drug was leading to the infections. While heroin users may inject around 4 times a day, he said anecdotal evidence suggests it is not unusual for people to inject Burst and similar products 10 times a day and as often as 30 times in extreme cases.

The legal high is based around a stimulant called ethylphenidate. Mr Sherval said: "It is a stimulant. It is a sociable drug so people are injecting together more and they are sharing equipment."

So far 125 cases of the "soft tissue infection" have been treated in NHS Lothian since October last year [2014]. The infection starts with redness and swelling of the skin, but can develop to become a weeping wound. Many of the cases seen are described as "severe" and have required surgery.

Mr Sherval said the legal highs involved were "positively dangerous". He said: "They may be legal, but they are absolutely not safe. They are very dangerous drugs and even if you swallow this particular drug it can also cause behaviour problems. "People can behave very aggressively and that is causing difficulties for their friends and families and also when they appear at accident and emergency departments there is very violent, aggressive behaviour. It is difficult to manage."

Professor David Goldberg, epidemiologist for Health Protection Scotland (HPS), said surveys currently being undertaken suggest the habit of injecting the highs was concentrated in the Lothian area but this did not mean it would not spread.

The health board has written to retailers supplying the substances about the impact they are having in the hope of reducing their availability. A report about the issue published by HPS said: "During this outbreak, updates and advice have been circulated to healthcare and drugs agency colleagues on the appropriate investigation and management of infections in people who inject drugs. NHS Lothian is working closely with the police, councils and other agencies to pursue the best options for preventing, controlling and treating the use of new psychoactive substances, including any potential legal avenues."

The community affected by the outbreak involves people who have used heroin in the past or are still addicted to the drug. David Liddell, director of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said: "We have across Scotland a significant vulnerable population of older drug users who are either outside of treatment or on the edges of treatment services and we need to look at how we engage with this population more than we are doing just now."

["Legal highs", also called new psychoactive substances (NPS), are legal drugs that have properties similar to those of illegal drugs, but are yet to be classified as illegal. They are sold in specialist "head shops" and over the Internet in Edinburgh.

The NPS causing the most concern in Edinburgh are stimulants (mainly (ethylphenidate) that are sold in a powder form with brand names such as "Burst" (http://www.mycrew.org.uk/drugs-information/burst). Ethylphenidate is an analog of methylphenidate (Ritalin), a drug used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although ethylphenidate is not a controlled drug, it could possibly be one if considered an analog of a Schedule II substance (methylphenidate) under the Federal Analog Act in the US (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylphenidate).

"Burst" can be snorted or dissolved in water and injected. Users report a short duration of 1.5 to 3 hours of action, prompting frequent redosing. Between April and October 2014, the number of NPS users involved in a needle-exchange program in the Edinburgh almost doubled to nearly 600 (http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/health/legal-highs-kill-six-in-less-than-a-year-1-3668866). It is said to be "caustic" and cause nasal septal perforation when snorted (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylphenidate) and soft tissue infections due to staphylococci or streptococci when injected (http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/health/legal-highs-kill-six-in-less-than-a-year-1-3668866). The need for amputation in one case reported in the news report above suggests necrotizing fasciitis.

Infection from injection drug use could come from contaminated skin, drug, diluent, or syringe and needle. A variety of infections, including anthrax, tetanus, botulism, clostridial gas gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis, and myonecrosis, can follow injection of illicit drugs. If the injected material contains anything that could cause vasoconstriction (such as epinephrine), it would set up anaerobic conditions that would enhance the risk of disease with obligate anaerobes. More detailed information concerning the source and the nature of the infections caused by the injection of "Burst" would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Lothian is a region of the Scottish Lowlands, lying between the southern shore of the Firth of Forth and the Lammermuir Hills and includes Edinburgh City (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothian). Edinburgh, with a population in 2013 of 487 500, is the capital of Scotland and is located on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh). Musselburgh, with a population of 21 900, is a town on the coast of the Firth of Forth, 6 miles (10 km) east of Edinburgh city centre.
