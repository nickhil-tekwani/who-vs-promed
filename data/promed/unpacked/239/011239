At least 5 cases of leptospirosis have been confirmed so far this year [2022] in Ciego de Ávila, according to authorities from that province in the center of the island.

In the territory, 12 cases have been seen with symptoms suggestive of the bacterial disease of zoonotic origin, although only 5 have been confirmed, and the results of tests from 3 patients that are being analyzed at the Pedro Kourí Institute of Tropical Medicine in Havana are still awaited. Dr Manuel Álvarez Ramírez, a specialist at the Provincial Center for Hygiene, Epidemiology and Microbiology (CPHEM), pointed out in the official media outlet Invasor.

He also pointed out that the most likely source of infection in the territory is contact with the contaminated urine of livestock and rodents as well as with contaminated soil or vegetation.

The groups at greatest risk in this province are agricultural and livestock workers, veterinarians, Community Services workers, plus the population living in flood zones, added José Luis López González, deputy director of the CPHEM.

He assured that the 1st dose of the vaccine against this disease was applied to 93.3% of these people, and the 2nd dose to more than 70%.

The specialists also said that prevention is fundamental, not only in risk groups since anyone can get it the disease if they do not wash fruits and vegetables correctly, especially when there is a greater incidence of rains in tropical climates such as the one on the island.

Likewise, they warned that it is necessary to get medical assistance promptly in the face of clinical manifestations such as high fever, headache, myalgia, and redness of the eyes, among other signs because there is evidence that this disease proliferates more in the last quarter of the year.

This disease, transmitted by contact with the urine of infected animals such as mice, if not treated in time, can cause life-threatening infections of the kidneys, liver, brain, lungs, or heart.

Last July [2022], it transpired that the province of Camagüey was on epidemiological alert for leptospirosis, a situation that coincides with recent complaints from neighbors about the proliferation of sewage leaks in the territory.

Carlos Morán Giraldo, provincial director of Health in that province, warned the population that in the face of symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, they should immediately go to medical services, as it could be a case of arbovirus or the disease caused by the _Leptospira_ bacteria.

In addition, he asked to eliminate rats from homes and community micro-dumps, as well as boil and treat drinking water, and maintain absolute hygiene when cooking food.

However, he did not mention the situation in which hundreds of families live, due to the delay in solving problems such as the escape of sewage water, which affects the spread of rodents, transmitters of this disease, as also occurs in the nearby province of Holguín, where residents of the Vista Alegre neighborhood have a health crisis due to the overflow of a pit for 11 and that keeps their street covered with sewage water.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to urine of infected animals or to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated flood water or moist soil for weeks to months.

For a discussion of leptospirosis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED post Leptospirosis - New Zealand: rural, occupational, animal, waterways exposures 20220706.8704256.

Dr T Jacob John reminded ProMED readers (ProMED post Leptospirosis - France (02): (CN) cleaning a stream, comment 20221015.8706168) that, when exposed to contaminated flood water and moist soil, the US CDC advises preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline; wearing protective clothing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/leptospirosis). - Mod.ML
