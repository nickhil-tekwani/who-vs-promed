INFECTION CONTROL: REQUEST FOR INFO
===================================
Date: Mon, 3 Jun 96 07:27 EDT
From: wskinner@fast.net

As a health care geographics professional, I would be interested in learning
how many and which of the responding organizations are using Geographic
Information System technology to aid in mapping outbreaks and tracking
spread of epidemiological events.
