[2] Protective antibodies
Date: Tue 10 Nov 2015
Source: Vaccine News Daily [edited]
http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/stories/510647375-study-suggests-one-vaccine-may-prevent-chikungunya-and-similar-viruses


Scientists from Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis [Missouri, USA] recently found broadly neutralizing antibodies that could be used to create one vaccine to protect people from chikungunya and its related viruses.

These antibodies have potential to protect people from infections that involve multiple, distantly related alphaviruses that cause crippling joint pain and fever.

"There is a lot of emphasis on identifying and understanding broadly neutralizing antibodies for other viruses -- HIV, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, influenza virus -- but most of those antibodies neutralize different strains of the same virus," Michael Diamond, senior author and a professor of medicine and director of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccine Development in the Center for Human Immunology and Immunotherapy Programs, said. "What we've identified here are antibodies that actually neutralize several different alphaviruses."

This discovery could help researchers find other ways to create one treatment or vaccine for multiple alphaviruses.

"If you can make an antibody response against this region, you may be able to protect against many viruses in the family," Diamond said. "Our group is making proteins now that focus on this epitope, and we're planning to start immunizing animals soon to see if we generate the right kinds of antibodies."

Cell. 2015. pii: S0092-8674(15)01406-3. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.050. [Epub ahead of print]; abstract available at http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)01406-3. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

Chikungunya is an infection in humans caused by the chikungunya virus. Humans and other primates are the natural hosts for the chikungunya virus, which is spread to humans by the bite of an infected female _Aedes_ species mosquito -- _Ae aegypti_ or _Ae albopictus_. The chikungunya virus is present in Africa, southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Indian Ocean islands, where a number of outbreaks have occurred [also in the Americas].

Most people infected with chikungunya virus will develop some symptoms usually 3-7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The most common symptoms are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash. Chikungunya disease does not often result in death, but the symptoms can be severe and disabling. In some people, the joint pain may persist for months. People at risk for more severe disease include newborns infected around the time of birth, older adults (65 years and older), and people with medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections.

There is no specific treatment for chikungunya infection. The use of pain medication and rest can provide relief for some of the symptoms.

Concept of use of multi-functional cross reactive antibodies to counter infections from various viruses would be an ideal solution, provided their effectiveness can be validated by in vitro and in vivo studies. - Mod.UBA]
