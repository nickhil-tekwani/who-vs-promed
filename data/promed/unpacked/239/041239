Granuloma inguinale = Donovanosis = Ulcerating Granuloma of the Pudenda
-- which is a very good descriptive name for the condition. Can be
mistaken for a destructive cancer. Treatable with Streptomycin (1 G
intramuscularly daily for 10 to 20 days) and some other antibiotics.
Would take a long time to be fatal, but is very alarming. I used to see
and treat occasional cases in Malawi, and to follow streptomycin
treatment with plastic surgery to close ulceration through the penis into
the urethra.

From: "William Chapman" <William_Chapman@fmi.com>

Since we are currently guessing the etiology of "Nkumunye" which has "sores
which deepen and eventually destroy the entire reproductive organs", should
we add amoebiasis to the differential diagnosis?
[Taking the statement about destruction of "the entire reproductive organs"
with a grain of salt and ... considering chronic unrelenting deepening
ulcers ... I have no reference, but my experience in Papua New Guinea has
shown me several cases where the glans penis was eroded down to the urethra
by amoebae.
