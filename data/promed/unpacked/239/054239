Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered

Outbreak 2: Penticton, British Columbia
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Oct 2013
Outbreak status: Resolved (20 Nov 2013)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 51 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Beef cattle bluetongue sentinel herd located in the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia (cow-calf)

Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 251 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 1.59 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Previous outbreaks in the same area in the past were likely associated with natural incursions of infected Culicoides from the United States of America

Epidemiological comments: The 2 current infected premises reported today [28 Nov 2013] were detected as part of the Okanagan zone BTV sentinel herds programme established in 1989. No clinical signs were observed. This is the 4th occurrence of BTV serotype 11 (North American lineage) in the Okanagan. BTV 11 is one of the 5 serotypes that are known to be present in the United States of America (BTV-2, 10, 11, 13, 17). Canada's control measure of compulsory cattle identification and traceability for Okanagan cattle continues to apply from 1988. Additional control measures would be implemented for any serotype of bluetongue other than BTV 2, 10, 11, 13 and 17. The current climate conditions in Canada are not favourable for bluetongue transmission. Sporadic incursions of bluetongue have occurred in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, Canada, since surveillance started in 1969. National serological surveys have been conducted periodically in the Canadian domestic cattle population and the bluetongue virus has never been detected in Canada outside the Okanagan Valley.

Control measures
Measures applied: Vaccination prohibited, No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result

National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease - CFIA Winnipeg (National laboratory) / Cattle / virus isolation / 20 Nov 2013 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's fact sheet on bluetongue, available at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/bluetongue/fact-sheet/eng/1306116803992/1306121522520:

"In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has divided the country into 5 zones for bluetongue, based on the presence or absence of bluetongue-transmitting midges. The midges that spread bluetongue are only presently found in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, and in the southern parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

"Most of Canada is currently free of the disease.

"There have been 5 known occurrences of bluetongue in Canada, which are believed to be the result of wind-borne introduction of infected midges from the US. All occurrences have been in the Okanagan Valley in the past 30 years.

"In Canada, the presence of the virus is usually restricted to late summer and early fall, since conditions must be warm enough for the bluetongue virus to multiply within the midge (13-35 deg C). Midge activity ceases with the 1st hard frost. There is no evidence that bluetongue is able to survive winter in Canada.

"The virus does not survive in the environment outside a midge or its animal host. It cannot be spread through contact with animal carcasses and products such as meat and wool.

"The types of bluetongue considered endemic in the US (serotypes 2, 10, 11, 13 and 17) are immediately notifiable under the Health of Animals Regulations. In general, there are no response programs for immediately notifiable diseases; however, laboratories are required to report confirmed diagnoses to the CFIA. This enables prevalence verification and supports international reporting and certification requirements.

"Any detection of the US types of bluetongue originating from the Okanagan Valley or the US will not impact Canada's bluetongue-free status outside the Okanagan Valley. Evidence of disease spread within Canada will affect Canada's bluetongue-free status; however, it is hoped that trading partners will recognize the 5 ecologically distinct zones identified by the CFIA, so that only the zone where the detection occurs may be subject to possible trade restrictions.

"Detection of infection and evidence of disease spread of US types of bluetongue virus outside the Okanagan Valley would lead to a re-evaluation of the bluetongue geographic zone and a detailed epidemiological investigation. This would include tracing of all potentially infected animals, as well as a recommendation for insect control measures during the biting fly season.

"All remaining types of bluetongue, exotic to the US, are federally reportable under the Health of Animals Act. This means that all suspected or confirmed cases must be reported to the CFIA for immediate investigation by veterinary inspectors.

"Should an exotic type of bluetongue occur in Canada, the CFIA would respond in order to limit the impact of the disease to the geographic zone in which the disease is found. The exact nature of the response would depend on a number of factors including the ability of the midges to exist and thrive in the season, and the zone where the outbreak is occurring." - Mod.CRD
