3. Item(s) published on WHO WWW EMC Outbreak Information pages this week

3 June:
Meningococcal infection in the Balearic Isles
The Public Health Laboratory Service, UK comments that the current
meningococcal season is one of the highest reported in the United Kingdom.
It started earlier than usual and the incidence was still quite high during
May. The majority of cases were diagnosed meningococcal meningitis Group B
but there has been a shift towards more Group C and an upward shift in the
age distribution of cases.
Therefore, the cases in Mallorca probably reflect the epidemiology in
England quite well.
The Spanish authorities have instituted appropriate control measures in
Mallorca including information, surveillance and antibiotic therapy. The
tourist population in Mallorca is also informed to seek medical advice
immediately in case symptoms appear.
