Tokyo school officials: Food poisoning likely after over 940 fall ill
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Education officials in Tachikawa City [central Kantō region] revealed on [Sun 19 Feb 2017] that over 940 students and teachers suffered food-poisoning symptoms last week [week of 12 Feb 2017], with the outbreak likely being due to the eating of tainted school lunches.

The Tachikawa City Board of Education said 943 people from 7 elementary schools have so far reported food poisoning symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain, TV Asahi reported. A total of 4 of the affected schools will close on [Mon 20 Feb 2017] officials said. The city's public health center investigating the case suspects lunches served at the schools caused the outbreak.

The suspected tainted meals were part of a batch of some 3000 meals prepared at a facility that was distributed on [Fri 17 Feb 2017].

[Knowing the incubation period from when the food was ingested to the beginning of symptoms, whether vomiting or diarrhea was more prominent, whether fever is associated with the illness and how long the illness lasted can help to suspect a particular cause.

Tachikawa is a city located in the western portion of Tokyo Metropolis, in the central Kantō region of Japan. - Mod.LL
