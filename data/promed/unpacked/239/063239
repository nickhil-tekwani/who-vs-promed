[I have to add a caution in interpreting specific case information. Information on the website has changed periodically so it is difficult to follow at times as the classifications change; exposure histories change as more information becomes available and possible typos.

There appears to have been a MERS-CoV superspreader in Wadi Aldwasir, given the increase in secondary cases reported in the community, in household contacts and in the healthcare environment. Alarmists might also speculate that the virus has changed and is now transmitted person-to-person with more ease. In the absence of information on specific contact exposures, it is hard to speculate further but the short time frame suggests that this may have all been related to a single primary case and not increased numbers of transmission chains. Time will tell.

There was a primary case reported from Wadi Aldwasir, with a history of contact with camels reported on 29 Jan 2019. Since then there have been an additional 11 newly confirmed cases all reported as due to secondary transmission (contact with other known confirmed cases); 2 were listed as secondary community acquired cases, 4 were reported in household contacts, and 5 were reported as healthcare acquired infections. No further information as to whether the healthcare acquired cases were in healthcare workers or in patients.

In addition to this outbreak in Wadi Aldwasir, there was a primary case with known contact with camels reported from Khamees Meshait in `AsÄ«r region.

Sigh, it's time to move MERS-CoV back to a front burner as there is now a significant event with secondary transmission ongoing.
