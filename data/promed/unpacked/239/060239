The current WHO-recommended method for monitoring wild poliovirus
circulation is based on AFP surveillance. More than 95 percent of
poliovirus infections are asymptomatic, a percentage that may rise in
direct proportion to the immunization status of the population.
This silent circulation can be monitored by environmental surveillance of
sewage samples using supplementary surveillance protocols recommended by
the WHO. (WHO 2003 Guidelines for Environmental Surveillance of Poliovirus
Circulation. World Health Organization, Dept of Vaccines and Biologicals,
Ordering code: WHO/V&B/03.03
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-documents/DoxGen/H5-Surv.htm>).
Such surveillance is particularly useful in poliomyelitis-free regions that
are adjacent to areas where there is poliomyelitis. Such surveillance
would go a long way towards answering the hopes of the moderator that local
circulation of polio was not re-established in Saudi Arabia before
appearance of any additional AFP cases. Since it is critical to break
chains of poliovirus transmission as early as possible in outbreaks,
environmental surveillance might also help (1) to pinpoint those areas
surrounding the Sudan outbreak which would require more intensive
immunization and (2) to monitor the efficacy of such an intervention.

[Dr. Shulman raises some interesting points about the value of
environmental surveillance for circulation of poliovirus. A number of
countries have been conducting environmental surveillance for poliovirus,
especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO). Of note, in the
summary of the document referred to by Dr. Shulman is the following
statement: "Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is the gold standard
for surveillance in the polio eradication initiative. Under certain
circumstances valuable supplementary information can be obtained by
environmental surveillance. However, because of inherent limitations and
additional resource requirements, environmental surveillance should be
restricted to selected populations where deficiencies in AFP surveillance
are suspected and where conditions exist that render the population at risk
for poliovirus circulation (e.g. low polio vaccination coverage or risk of
poliovirus importation). Environmental surveillance should only be
implemented after careful planning of all steps in the operation and
thorough assessment of the potential benefits and alternatives."
According to the available information on polio vaccination coverage from
WHO/UNICEF estimates, coverage with 3 or more doses of polio vaccine in
Saudi Arabia has been above 90 percent since 1989, with coverage greater
than or equal to 95 percent since 2000. (Most recent figure, 95 percent in
2003).

These coverages should theoretically be high enough to prevent widespread
poliovirus circulation in the country. Concerns are more that there might
be contact with other migrant populations, among whom polio vaccination
coverage may not be as high as those in Saudi Arabia. - Mod.MPP]
