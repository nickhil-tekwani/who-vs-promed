The Washington State Department of Health today closed Quilcene Bay in Hood
Canal to oyster harvesting due to increased levels of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_.
This is the third area in the state to be closed recently due to high
levels of the vibrio bacteria. The other two areas are the Jackson Cove to
Pleasant Harbor area of Hood Canal and all of Totten and Skookum Inlets in
south Puget Sound.
The closure area for Quilcene Bay includes all the growing area north of a
line drawn from Point Whitney to the most southern tip of Bolton Peninsula
on Hood Canal. Nearby Dabob Bay is not included in this closure at this
time but is being closely monitored.
