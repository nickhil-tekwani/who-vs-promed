[1] Saudi Arabia, 3 new cases - MOH
Date: 1 Aug 2013

Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 3 confirmed cases have been recorded. The 1st case is a 67-year-old female citizen in Riyadh who had been suffering from various chronic diseases, and she is now in the ICU receiving health care and proper treatment. The [other] 2 cases are 39-year-old female residents who work in the health sector; one of them lives in Asir and the other in Riyadh. They have mild symptoms [and] their health status [is] stable.

[These 3 newly reported, confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection will raise the global case count to 94 including 46 deaths (when added to the 29 Jul 2013 WHO update information). As of 1 Aug 2013, the number of confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia is now 74 including 39 deaths. As previously seen, it appears as though serious clinical disease is seen with infected individuals having pre-existing co-morbidities, whereas clinical disease seems to be milder for those individuals previously healthy without pre-existing co-morbidities. While one suspects that the 2 health care workers acquired their infections in the healthcare setting, one wonders what the possible source of exposure was for the 3rd case; was this case infected by contact with the as yet unidentified source, or was this individual also exposed to other infected individuals in the healthcare setting while receiving care for the pre-existing co-morbidities?

[2] Global update - WHO
Date: 29 Jul 2013

WHO has been informed of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia. The patient is an 83-year-old man from Assir region who became ill on 17 Jul 2013 and is currently hospitalized.

Additionally, a previously laboratory-confirmed case, also from Assir region, has died.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 91 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 46 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travelers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that with the information now available and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not, at present, been met.
