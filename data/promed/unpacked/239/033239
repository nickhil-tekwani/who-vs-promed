Over 55,000 people die of rabies in the world every year
-------------------------------------------------------
Over 55,000 people in the world die of rabies eve
ry year and more than ten million people undergo medical treatment for
it. This infection is tenth-significant cause of human fatalities in
the list of infectious diseases and is registered in more than 150
countries.These data are given by the World Health Organization (WHO)
study for the World Anti-Rabies Action Day which is marked on
Wednesday [Sept. 28, 2011].

>From four to twenty-two cases of incidence of the disease have been
annually recorded in Russia for over 40 years. "From 250,000 to
450,000 people apply for medical aid every year in view of attacks by
animals," says a report issued by Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service for
Supervision of Consumers Protection and Welfare). "Recent years have
seen a deterioration of the situation connected with rabies among
animals and the number of unfortunate points has been growing.
Epizootics of natural type (among animals) are taking shape and
efforts to fight them encounter difficulties and are not legislatively
sealed. The number of neglected animals increases against the
background of the unsatisfactory condition of the public services in
settlements and towns," specialists maintain.

Humans get infected with rabies from domestic animals and those living
in the wild, predominantly carnivorous ones as a result of close
contact with infected saliva or in case of bites and scratches (by
dogs, cats, foxes, racoon dogs, etc. [and bats]). Until now the only
means of aid to humans subjected to the risk of infection is a timely
injection of anti-rabies immunoblobulin and the prescription of a
therapeutic immunization course. The vaccine used in the Russian
Federaiton is a highly effective medicinal preparation that is up to
all WHO requirements.

"All people who fell ill with rabies in our country, either did not
take an anti-rabies course at all or discontinued it for some reason,"
the Rospotrebnadzor official pointed out.

[Human rabies is a tragic and unnecessary disease. I have long held
that urban rabies control is to veterinary public health as is
mastitis control for large animal clinicians. Anyone can control these
diseases if you want to do it, anyone, and frankly urban rabies can be
cost effectively eradicated in 3-4 years. It is not complicated or
expensive. Just takes management skills in getting suffient
vaccination teams out at the right time of the year, data management
including GIS, and a system for seeing and catching dogs missed the
first time round. Bat rabies is something else but public awareness
will reduce the number of people picking up sick bats.

[A global conference on rabies control, organised by the OIE in
collaboration with FAO and WHO, was held in Seoul, Republic of Korea,
from 7 to 9 September 2011 The Conference recognised that vaccination
of dogs is the preferred method of controlling and eliminating rabies:
for ethical, ecological and economic reasons, the culling of animals
cannot be considered as the priority method for control and
eradication except in very specific situations. All successful rabies
eradication programmes have included measures combining stray dog
population control and vaccination of all dogs having owners.
