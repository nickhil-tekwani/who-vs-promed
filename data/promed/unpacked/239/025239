2010 measles outbreak in BC traced to single visitor from China
---------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles in northern British Columbia [BC] in 2010 can be traced to a single visitor from China, according to research from scientists at the BC Centre for Disease Control and the University of BC. The study is billed as the largest using whole-genome sequencing techniques to identify the genetic code of a measles virus and to chart its spread.

"In the past when we wanted to reconstruct an outbreak, we'd have to talk to patients and ask: 'Who do you know? Who are your contacts? Where do you go?' And we try to make a best guess about how a disease spreads based on our interviews," said Jennifer Gardy, a senior scientist with the Centre for Disease Control and lead author of the study published online Monday [6 Jul 2015] by the Journal of Infectious Diseases. "In this case, it's almost like we interviewed the virus and asked: 'Where did you go?'"

Researchers tracked 82 cases of measles after 3 people fell ill at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, obtaining samples of blood, urine or cells from mouth swabs that contained enough of the virus for complete genome sequencing in 27 cases. That allowed them to connect the dots in the 61 patients from northern BC. Six other cases in Metro Vancouver were linked to a single carrier of a strain called D8, which is normally found in the United States, Italy and India. Another 15 cases couldn't be definitively linked to either carrier.

The single H1 strain of measles virus traced to China moved with the Chinese visitor up Highway 97 -- which runs from the US border in the Okanagan up the centre of BC to Prince George and beyond -- causing 61 cases of measles. "With the genomic analysis -- the sort of forensic DNA investigation -- we were able to determine that all cases in the north of British Columbia ... were the result of the single introduction of a virus," said Gardy in a phone call from Boston, where she is taping an episode of CBC's The Nature of Things as an occasional host. "It just goes to show that measles is the most contagious virus that's out there."

All of the people who developed measles' signature rash and fever were either unvaccinated or had been vaccinated in past decades when only one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was routinely given to kids. The current standard for MMR in BC is 2 doses: the 1st administered at one year of age and the 2nd between the age of 4 and 6. Vaccination rates are falling, however, as some parents decide not to follow public health recommendations.

An outbreak in 2014 of more than 400 cases in BC centred on a conservative Christian school in Chilliwack. Considered eradicated in Canada in 1998, measles is making a comeback among kids of parents too young to remember the wrath of epidemic childhood diseases.

Although serious complications from measles such as pneumonia and encephalitis are rare, the disease can be deadly. The World Health Organization estimates that measles caused 2.6 million deaths each year before widespread vaccination became available globally in 1980. Since measles is now considered a re-emerging virus, studies of this kind can arm health officials with more information, added Gardy. "What genome sequencing techniques allow us to do for the 1st time is definitively reconstruct the path that virus took," she said.

It's a growing area of study across a range of infectious diseases -- from Ebola to tuberculosis -- as the cost of sequencing the DNA of a virus or bacterium falls to around USD 100 per sample, if done in bulk.

Measles outbreak in State of California triggers tougher vaccination rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A recent outbreak of the dreaded viral disease called measles has caused a stir amongst the state of California, pushing its governor to sign a bill mandating stricter vaccination requirements for children. This new law requires all children to be immunized before entering kindergarten with exceptions allowed only in cases where a doctor advises against immunization, particularly in circumstances where immunization is not recommended due to family medical history.

Measles is highly contagious and could easily be transmitted in crowded areas. It causes fever and a break out of rashes on the face and body. In worst cases, it could lead to brain damage, loss of hearing, sight and even death. Children, the aged and most especially those persons with a weak immune system may be particularly vulnerable to the virus.

Studies have shown that the result of immunization given to children during their younger years have kept a number of infectious and dangerous diseases at bay, thereby creating a healthier community. Several vaccination programs have driven away the onset of the viral disease, but when immunization was not strictly implemented, some parents have stopped vaccinating their children, giving rise to the comeback of measles.

A measles outbreak at a Disneyland theme park [in California] last December [2014] which has affected more than 100 people has raised awareness on the dreaded disease once again and has sparked concern in the health sector of the community. Hence, a renewed drive on the prevention of measles through vaccination earning support from both Republicans and Democrats of the state.

Reported measles case on Martha's Vineyard was misidentified
------------------------------------------------------------
[The primary description was recorded in "Measles Update (25)" under USA (Massachusetts). - Mod.CP]

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has notified the Martha's Vineyard Hospital and public health officials that a case 1st identified there by doctors and then confirmed by lab tests as measles, was actually not measles, according to Dr Jeffrey Zack, chief of emergency medicine at the hospital [on Martha's Vineyard, an island of Massachusetts]. Dr Zack said the unvaccinated child originally thought to have the very contagious disease, apparently had a similar virus that tested positive in the same way measles would. He said the virus, which like most viruses does not have a name [?], was generally contagious but was not dangerous, and the symptoms were much less severe than measles.

"It's not known to have done anything other than cause high fever, rashes and respiratory symptoms," Dr Zack said. "We screened about 10 cases where we felt it was close enough to test for, but they all ended up negative [for measles]. You have a clinical picture that was mimicking measles, you had an initial test from the (Massachusetts) Department of Public Health (DPH) that said it was measles," Dr Zack said. "It walked like a duck and it talked like a duck but it was a platypus. It's a bit of a freak occurrence. Now we understand why we didn't see any more cases." Dr Zack said the experience helped highlight how local health officials can improve their response to an infectious disease. "It's a good and a bad thing," he said. "Obviously it caused a great amount of anxiety and concern on the Island. It was a good learning experience for us in terms of responding to a potentially dangerous public health infection. We got a lot of practice in terms of what worked, and what didn't work."

The child, who lives in another state, came to the Martha's Vineyard Hospital emergency room on [17 Jun 2015]. Late Friday afternoon [19 Jun 2015], about 48 hours after the initial exam, DPH notified the hospital that cultures taken from the patient tested positive for measles. That triggered a protocol involving DPH, local boards of health and the hospital. Epidemiologists traced the movement of the child and his family beginning on [8 Jun 2015], and issued an alert informing the public that child was at West Tisbury, Chilmark and Aquinnah libraries at various times while infectious. The child also visited the Airport Laundromat, as well as Ryan Family Amusements and Sharky's Cantina in Oak Bluffs.

Dr Zack said that as a result about 125 people were vaccinated against measles and other infectious childhood diseases at 2 free clinics organized by the hospital staff on [24 and 25 Jun 2015]. Dr Zack said hospital staff and public health officials plan a debriefing in the near future to discuss what turned out to be an erroneous diagnosis, the response to the measles scare, and the implementation of the protocols intended to prevent the spread of the disease.
