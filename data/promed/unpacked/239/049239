link unchecked. Quarantine is applied on the farm and movement
restrictions are implemented in the area. This event coincides with
the beginning of the 1st phase of vaccination against FMD in 2008,
which allows a better control of the disease.

[An outbreak in Ecuador and in this province is not unexpected.
Although the report indicates a previous outbreak in 2007, the OIE
WAHID database shows no outbreaks in 2007, but 16 in 2006 and 23
outbreaks in 2005. Out of these 39 total outbreaks, 10 were in
Esmeraldas province.

What is interesting is the source of the imported animals. The owner
indicated he had imported some animals into the herd but apparently
was unable to identify the source. Further information along these
lines might help in future control efforts.

Esmeraldas province is located on the coast and directly adjacent to
Colombia (see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmeraldas_Province> or the OIE report
referenced above. - Mod.PC]
