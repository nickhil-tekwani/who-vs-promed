At least 35 people have died in a meningitis epidemic that has hit
several districts in western and north-western Uganda over the past 2
weeks, a health ministry official said. "Cumulatively we have
recorded 47 cases of meningitis with 13 dead in Hoima District," Paul
Kaggwa, a spokesman for the ministry, said. "Another 150 cases have
been reported in Arua, with 18 dead, and 14 in Masindi, with 4 deaths."

In its Africa weekly emergency situation update issued on 19 Jan
2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) said one sub-county in
Hoima had crossed the meningitis epidemic threshold. There was also
concern about Karamoja region [located in northeastern Uganda] where
dry weather had set in.

Kaggwa said the latest reports indicated Arua had also crossed the
threshold of 5 cases per 1000 people. "The immediate intervention we
are embarking on is to carry out vaccination in Arua and Hoima," he
told IRIN [Integrated Regional Information Networks] on 22 Jan 2009.
"We are still determining whether the situation in Masindi justifies
a vaccination [drive]. We are engaged in active surveillance and case
management [and] are sending teams to the areas to support
community-awareness programmes," he added. "We have deployed film
vans to help in the campaign."

The Uganda Red Cross (URC) in a 14 Jan 2009 statement said most
patients in Arua were from Dadama and Oluko sub-counties while those
in Hoima were from Kigorobya sub-county.

According to the URC, the outbreak in Hoima occurred in an area with
no history of vaccination for meningitis and few health units. The
affected homes were also congested. Medical experts said dust, which
is common during the dry season, leads to an increase in respiratory
infections and helps spread meningitis because the bacteria attach
themselves to dust particles.

Uganda lies within the African meningitis belt, stretching from
Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, according to the WHO.
The region, home to about 350 million people, experiences meningitis
cycles whenever the dry season sets in.

Up to 30 000 people suffer from the disease each year in Uganda. Last
year [2008], the government introduced a vaccine, which it said
significantly reduced mortality rates from the deadly disease.
Experts, however, say preparedness for meningitis epidemics is
difficult because vaccines cannot be administered until it is known
which of the many different forms of the bacterium is spreading. As a
result, 5-10 percent of patients die, typically within 24 to 48
hours, while some survivors suffer brain damage, hearing loss or
learning disabilities.

[The above news release confirms that the number of cases
meningococcal meningitis and deaths continue to increase in 3
northwestern districts (Arua, Hoima, and Masindi), but also mentions
that there was 'concern' about the Karamoja region, which lies in
northeastern Uganda, but does not indicate if any cases of meningitis
actually occurred in this region. The meningococcal serogroups
causing the outbreak in Uganda have not as yet been specified.
