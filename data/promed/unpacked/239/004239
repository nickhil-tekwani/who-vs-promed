Each year, a number of horses die from eating corn or corn byproducts
containing fumonisins. Fumonisins are a group of toxins produced by
an endophytic mold found within the corn kernel. Typically,
fumonisins are produced while the corn plant is growing in the field,
but levels can also increase under improper storage conditions after harvest.
Although more than 10 types of fumonisins have been isolated and
characterized, the most prevalent in contaminated corn is fumonisin
B1 (FB1), which is believed to be the most toxic. The dangers from
fumonisins are dose-related, and horses and rabbits are the most
susceptible of the domestic species.
Fumonisins can produce the serious neurological disease known as
leukoencephalomalacia (ELM) in horses. Most of the investigated
cases of fumonisin poisoning in horses have involved corn screenings
[corn screenings were described as "crushed kernels and other damaged
grain material that was removed during the drying of corn by a local
grain elevator" in a CDC NIOSH (National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health) document on the death of a farmer who was exposed
to corn screenings. This document is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/FACE/stateface/mn/96mn083.html> - Mod.MPP]
. For this reason, FDA recommends that corn screenings NOT be used
in horse feed.
Corn and feed containing corn also needs to be kept dry and protected
from moisture when stored to prevent levels of fumonisins and other
mold toxins from increasing. FDA recommends that corn and corn
by-products used in horse feed should contain less than 5 parts per
million (ppm) of fumonisins and comprise no more than 20 percent of
the dry weight of the total ration.
In November 2001, CVM and FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition jointly issued a final guidance for industry on fumonisin
levels in human food and animal feeds, which can be viewed at:

[Leukoencephalomalacia is extremely detrimental to horses and if not
fatal, results in a debilitated animal that is normally euthanized.
The portion of the corn responsible for the fumonisin can be seen in
the feed when viewed under a microscopic, and the detrimental
chemical can be detected by other analyses. Because of its
appearance, the portion of the corn responsible for the disease is
sometimes called 'bees wings.'
Manufacturers that include corn screenings in their feed are liable
for legal issues when horses either die or are euthanized. The corn
screenings and fumonisin can be identified in the stomach contents of
euthanized horses.
The fungus that makes the fumonisin toxin, _Fusarium moniliforme_
(_Fusarium verticillioides_), is found wherever corn is grown. Dry
weather early in the season, followed by wet weather during silking
of the corn plant, and insect infestation increase the extent of
fungal infection of corn kernels. In several countries, high levels
of fumonisin in moldy corn have been suspected of causing esophageal
cancer in humans. - Mod.TG]
