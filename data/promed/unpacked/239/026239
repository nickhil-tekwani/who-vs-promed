[This immediate notification report provides the response to the recently published ProMED-mail request for information, archive No. 20141014.2864198.

Since these outbreaks occurred close to the border with Romania and Serbia [where bluetongue serotype 4 has been reported this year (2014), see ProMED archive list below], it should not be unexpected that the disease has now been reported in Hungary.

This year (2014), 717 outbreaks have been reported in Romania and 23 in Serbia, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=15910 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=15987, respectively.
