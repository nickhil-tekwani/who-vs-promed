Typhoid fever and salmonellosis struck cadets of Mojayskiy Military
Cosmic Academy in the middle of September 2006. The spread of
infection was not stoppable because the doctors made a wrong
diagnosis initially. At the beginning, the patients had been
receiving treatment for acute respiratory disease; later, the true
diagnosis was established.
By mid October 2006, 286 cadets were admitted to the hospital, 67 of
them diagnosed with typhoid fever.
The [supposed] source of this outbreak was a woman cook, ill with
typhoid fever, from Kyrgyzia, who was working in the company
"Business-Torg." This company has been supplying food for school
canteens. After repeated tests on this cook, neither typhoid nor
salmonellosis was found. It seemed that the cadets could not have
contracted the infection from her.
There are 2 canteens in the Academy divided by a wall with arches.
3rd-year cadets have meals on one side, about 2000 people. Among
those who contracted the infection, all had meals in this part of the
canteen; none of the cadets who had meals next to the arched wall got
the infection. Each of the canteens has its own kitchen, but the food
comes from the same source, that is, food preparation is the same for
both canteens.

67 cadets from St. Petersburg's Mozhaisky Military Space Academy have
been diagnosed with typhoid fever, after 286 in total were
hospitalized with food poisoning, Interfax reported Mon 16 Oct 2006.
All the patients are in stable condition, and the Defense Ministry is
in control of the situation, Alexei Kuznetsov, a spokesman for
Russia's Space Forces told Interfax on Monday [16 Oct 2006].
Kuznetsov said that 286 cadets of the Academy were admitted to the
442nd District Military Hospital a few days ago with a suspected
"infectious disease." Salmonella poisoning had been confirmed in 57
cases, he said.
Last week, one of the cadets felt unwell and was immediately
hospitalized. Shortly after, 166 of the Academy students were rushed
to hospital, also with a suspected "infectious disease."
All the cadets eat in the same in-house canteen, which has been
established as the source of the poisoning, the St. Petersburg-based
Fontanka.ru news portal reported. "[The mass poisoning] is an extreme
case for all [Russia's] military, not only for the Academy or the
Space Forces," general Igor Puzanov, the commander of Leningrad
military district said Monday [16 Oct 2006], Interfax reported.
The Academy has ended its contract with Business-Torg, the company
which was providing catering to the academy at the time of the
incident, Kuznetsov said, the website reported. Puzanov said the idea
to have a commercial company supply food to the Russian military was
correct, but "in this case, bad violations were allowed to occur."

The typhoid epidemic at Manthali, the headquarters of Ramechhap
district in central Nepal is increasing, the National News Agency RSS
reported on Mon 6 Nov 2006.
More than 200 locals suffered from typhoid within the last week in
the area, the report said.
Around 10-15 typhoid patients are undergoing treatment in the
district hospital and Tamakoshi Community hospital each day,
according to the report.
"More than 10 new patients are coming to our hospital," an official
at Tamakoshi Community hospital was quoted by the RSS as saying,
adding that the disease is assumed to spread due to polluted water
around the area.

Typhoid fever has so far stricken 478 people in Agusan del Sur, a
number of them confined in hospitals in Davao City, which have better
facilities, the provincial information office said. Agusan del Sur
Gov. Adolph Edward Plaza has deployed provincial health workers
headed by Dr. Estefania Nonan, deputy provincial health officer, to 2
communities in Barangay Libertad, Bunawan town, where the typhoid
outbreak was reported last Tue 31 Oct 2006.
At least 202 typhoid-stricken residents, according to provincial
information officer Ferdinand Perez, were brought to the Bunawan
district hospital. Of the patients, at least 29 were released the
following day, since their farms were left unattended.
Besides the Bunawan district hospital, the typhoid patients were also
brought for treatment to the Libertad barangay rural health center,
Bunawan municipal health office, Democrito Plaza Memorial Hospital,
and hospitals in Davao City.
Health authorities said contamination of deep wells might have caused
the outbreak.
