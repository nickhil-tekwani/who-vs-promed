Beef grinder close to salad prep area, official says
----------------------------------------------------
Workers at the [Milwaukee south side Sizzler, where a major _E. coli_
outbreak started, ground raw beef a foot away from an area used to prepare
foods served on
the restaurant's salad bar, a health official said Friday.
That particular spot in the Sizzler kitchen was the "most likely location"
where the _E. coli_ bacteria found its path from "cow to customer," infecting
more than 60 people and leading to the death of a 3-year-old girl, city
Health Commissioner Seth Foldy said.
Health officials found the _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria in a sample of raw
ground meat taken from the restaurant, early in their investigation last
month. Since then, they have tried to discover how the bacteria were
transferred to the watermelon and other salad bar items consumed by the
customers who became sick.
Foldy stopped short Friday of definitively identifying the grinding area as
the spot of the cross-contamination, but he cited no other examples in his
news conference.
"All we know is the opportunity existed, and it probably occurred," Foldy
said.
He said the restaurant received its meat, tri-tip sirloin, in large
vacuum-sealed packages. Workers then cut the 10- to 15-pound slabs into
steaks and ground the trimmings into meat used for tacos on the buffet.
The grinder was about one foot away from the kitchen area where other
workers prepared the foods for the salad bar and buffet line, Foldy said.
He said restaurants, particularly those that process raw meat and prepare
numerous salad and buffet items, should separate that work in different
rooms or at least distant areas of the same kitchen. _E. coli_ is routinely
found in raw meat, and preventing it from spreading to uncooked foods
should be a priority for all restaurants, he said.
