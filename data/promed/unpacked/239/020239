A total of 10 people, including an ambulance crew, were hospitalized in Southern Kazakhstan Oblast on suspicions of carrying a deadly virus on Monday, 23 Jun [2014], Tengrinews reports, citing IA Novosti-Kazakhstan.

Spokesman for the South Kazahstan Oblast Department of Emergency Situations Nurlan Temirbayev said that Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was the probable cause.

Temirbayev informed that the day before a woman fell very sick. Her relatives called an ambulance for immediate help. During examination, the doctors noticed that the woman's hand had livid spots that looked like traces of a tick bite. Ticks are frequent transmitters of CCHF. The woman was hospitalized along with 9 other people -- the ambulance crew, who were 1st to respond to the emergency call, and the woman's close relatives, who lived with her in the same house.

Later on Monday [23 Jun 2014], the diagnosis of CCHF was confirmed by a laboratory test, as stated by Deputy Head of the Department of Consumer Protection of Southern Kazakhstan Oblast Zhumagul Medetov.

"The presence of the virus has been confirmed by laboratory tests. The 31-year-old resident of Akbastau village in Kazygurt district was taken to the central district hospital's intensive care unit. Her medical condition is assessed as serious but stable. Her one-year-old child has been hospitalized as well," Medetov said.

This is the 1st case of a person being hospitalized in connection with CCHF in South Kazakhstan [This year (2014)? There have been several cases in past years (see ProMED-mail posts given below). - Mod.TY]. Emergency Department employees are going to hold community meetings with the citizens to introduce them again to the 1st signs of CCHF and teach them how to act to protect themselves against the infection.

According to WHO, CCHF has a high fatality ratio of 10 to 40 per cent and is difficult for treatment and prevention. It is endemic in Asia south of the 50th parallel north, the Balkans, the Middle East and all of Africa. Some of the symptoms include sudden muscle ache with fever, dizziness, neck and back pain, sore eyes and sensitivity to light.

[CCHF cases have been reported with some frequency in Kazakhstan in past years. Apparently, the affected woman in the above report was infected via tick bite. _Hyalomma_ ticks are the main vectors of CCHF virus. It is not clear if the 9 ambulance workers were ill with symptoms of CCHF virus infection or not. The report implies that they were exposed via contact with the fatal case. CCHF virus infection can be acquired by contact with viremic blood, but it is difficult to envision that this exposure occurred with all 9 ambulance workers. Perhaps 1 or 2 might have had contact with the woman's blood through administration of IV fluids en route to the hospital, but it is very unlikely that all 9 would have.

An 8th person fell victim to [Crimean-]Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] at Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) on Friday [11 Jul 2014], said officials there. The 8 victims, including one hospital staffer and 6 Afghan nationals, all died over the last 3 months [April-July 2014]. A nurse at the hospital was also infected and remains under treatment at the hospital.

A 54-year-old from Bannu [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province] was diagnosed with CCHF. However, This person did not survive the infectious disease and died on Friday [11 Jul 2014] -- the 2nd person from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to succumb to the disease, the hospital staffer being the 1st.

HMC has no separate treatment facility for such infectious diseases or specialists equipped to deal with patients with the virus. In an attempt to keep infected patients away from other in-patients, several private rooms have been marked as an isolation unit for the specific care of those with CCHF.

Human-to-human transmission
---------------------------
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), catching CCHF from another human being would require close contact with the infected person's blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids.

It was such contact which also ultimately led to the demise of a man, 46, who worked as a peon at HMC. Earlier in June [2014], an official of the hospital, requesting anonymity, had told The Express Tribune that the man contracted CCHF after he administered a cannula to an Afghan patient when trained doctors and nurses were unable to do so.

In a similar fashion, a 30-year-old also contracted the CCHF virus while on duty in the makeshift isolation unit, possibly without personal protective equipment (goggles, masks, gowns, caps and shoes covers).

At HMC
------
HMC CEO Dr Mumtaz Marwat lauded the efforts of the hospital staff in their management of CCHF cases despite inadequate resources.

"Private rooms 15 to 19 will be used as the isolation unit and all CCHF cases will be admitted there," said Marwat. "The mortality rate for Congo virus is high, ranging from 25 to 50 per cent."

He emphasised that doctors should use complete sets of personal protective equipment. "All such products will be available at the unit and the casualty ward."

"The availability of a sufficient number of blood and platelet bags has been ensured by the hospital's blood bank," he added. 25 to 50 bags of platelets will be available on a daily basis, said Marwat, and a daily inventory report will be communicated to all medical units.

According to Dr Wali Rehman, the focal person for CCHF, protective gear is already stocked in the hospital storage and has been issued; "More will be provided." Additional gear has been requested from the WHO, he said.

CCHF fatalities [this year, 2014]
---------------------------------
A person, 26, from Afghanistan was admitted to the hospital on 22 Apr 2014 and died on 3 May 2014. Another, a 28-year-old, also from Afghanistan, died at HMC on 5 Jun 2014, also of CCHF [virus infection]. A 40-year-old person was admitted on 12 Jun 2014 and died on 17 Jun 2014. This person was from the neighbouring country. An individual, 30, was admitted on 22 Jun 2014 and passed away on 25 Jun 2014. An 18-year-old person died on 1 Jul 2014 and an 18-year-old on 5 Jul 2014. All 3 [later cases] were from Afghanistan and died of the CCHF virus [infections] at HMC.

[As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140418.2413017, CCHF virus is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north. Cases occur with some frequency in Pakistan. CCHF virus is a tick-borne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. CCHF virus can cause severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs, as noted in the above report. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
