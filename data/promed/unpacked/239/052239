Public Health Notice: Outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections linked to frozen whole kernel corn
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why you should take note
------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections involving 5 provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. The illnesses reported in Ontario were related to travel to Alberta and British Columbia.

Many of the individuals who became sick reported eating a variety of raw and cooked produce items before their illness. Initially, investigators identified that fresh avocados were reported by many cases before they became ill; however, more information was needed to confirm the source of the outbreak.

As part of the food safety investigation, the CFIA collected different food items from restaurants where ill people dined. Testing found the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ in an unopened package of Alasko brand frozen whole kernel corn. Traceback findings identified Alasko as the common brand of frozen corn consumed at various food service establishments by individuals who became sick. Based on the investigation findings to date, the outbreak is linked to Alasko brand frozen whole kernel corn.

The CFIA issued food recall warnings on 14 and 19 Dec 2021 for Alasko brand frozen whole kernel corn. The recalled products were distributed in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec, and may have been distributed in other provinces and territories. This led to a secondary recall for Fraser Valley Meats brand frozen whole kernel corn on 18 Dec 2021. Several additional secondary recalls have been issued since then for products that were made using the recalled Alasko brand frozen whole kernel corn. More information on the recalled products is available online. The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.

The outbreak appears to be ongoing, as recent illnesses continue to be reported. Do not eat, use, sell, or serve any of the recalled corn or products made with the recalled corn. This advice applies to individuals, as well as retailers, distributors, manufacturers and food service establishments such as hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and long-term care homes, across Canada. This outbreak is an important reminder to Canadians and businesses that frozen vegetables can carry harmful germs that can lead to foodborne illness if not properly handled and cooked prior to consuming. This public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.

Investigation summary
---------------------
As of 21 Jan 2022, there have been 110 laboratory-confirmed cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis illness investigated in British Columbia (42), Alberta (49), Saskatchewan (4), Manitoba (13) and Ontario (2). The illnesses reported in Ontario are related to travel to Alberta and British Columbia. Individuals became sick between early September 2021 and late December 2021. Four individuals have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 1 and 89 years of age. The majority of cases (64%) are female.

The CFIA issued food recall warnings on 14 and 19 Dec 2021 for Alasko brand frozen whole kernel corn and a secondary recall for Fraser Valley Meats brand frozen whole kernel corn on 18 Dec 2021. Several additional secondary recalls have been issued for products that were made using the recalled Alasko brand frozen whole kernel corn. The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.

Who is most at risk
-------------------
Anyone can become sick with a _Salmonella_ infection, but young children, the elderly, pregnant women or people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk for contracting serious illness.

Most people who become ill from a _Salmonella_ infection will recover fully after a few days. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others.

What you should do to protect your health
-----------------------------------------
The following advice applies to individuals, as well as retailers, distributors, manufacturers and food service establishments such as hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and long-term care homes, across Canada:

- Do not eat, use, sell or serve any of the recalled corn or products made with the recalled corn.
- Clean and sanitize all surfaces and storage areas that recalled corn or products made with the recalled corn may have come in contact with, including countertops, containers, utensils, freezers, and refrigerators.
- If you have been diagnosed with a _Salmonella_ infection or any other gastrointestinal illness, do not cook food for other people.

For general use of frozen vegetables, including frozen corn, the following tips will also help reduce your risk of becoming ill:

- Frozen vegetables are not ready-to-eat products. Always remember to cook frozen vegetables according to the package directions.
- Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling frozen vegetables.
- Wash and sanitize any surfaces that may have come in contact with frozen vegetables and its packaging, such as countertops, containers, utensils, freezers, and refrigerators.

Epidemiological information
---------------------------
Figure 1 [see source URL above. - Mod.LL] is an epidemiological curve for this outbreak, which shows the numbers of new cases by week. Outbreak investigators use this information to show when illnesses begin, when they peak, and when they trail off. It can take several weeks from the time a person becomes ill to when the illness is reported and testing confirms a link to the outbreak. Data are available for 110 cases.
