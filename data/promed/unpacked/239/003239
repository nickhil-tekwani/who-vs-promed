Chinese criminals have been exploiting the country's African swine fever [ASF] crisis by intentionally spreading the disease to force farmers to sell their pigs for a low price before smuggling the meat and selling it on as healthy stock, state media has reported.

Sometimes the gangs spread rumours about the virus, which is fatal to pigs, but in more extreme cases, they are using drones to drop infected items into farms, according to an investigation by the magazine China Comment, which is affiliated to state news agency Xinhua.

The disease has reduced the country's pig herds by over 40 per cent due to mass culls designed to stop it spreading further.

The resulting shortages have seen pork prices more than double, providing opportunities for the criminals to exploit. The magazine's report said that the gangs tried to spread panic among farmers to force them to sell their livestock at a discount rate.

Sometimes they spread rumours about the disease spreading in the locality and may even leave dead pigs on the side of a road to make farmers believe the infection is spreading.

In some extreme cases, the gangs even placed infected feed inside local pigsties, the report said.

"One of our branches once spotted drones air dropping unknown objects into our piggery, and later inspection found [the] virus in those things," a farmer manager told the reporters.

Once they have bought the pigs, the gangs then smuggle the animals or their meat to other areas where prices are higher, despite a ban on transporting pork or livestock between provinces to control the spread of the disease.

The profit margin can be as much as 1000 yuan (USD 143) per pig, so dealers have been stockpiling funds for bulk purchases.

"However many pigs you have, we are taking them all," the story quoted a dealer as saying.

In the southwestern province of Yunnan alone, the authorities have already intercepted 10 000 live pigs, some infected with the virus, that were destined for other provinces. The report said police believed that one gang had smuggled 4000 pigs from the province in one day. It said that smugglers had been bribing inspectors and faking quarantine certificates to smuggle the animals across provincial borders.

In one such case in Lichuan, a city in the central province of Hubei, the disease spread through the area after a vet forged certificates for infected animals.

The smugglers are trying to profit from a spike in prices that has seen the cost of meat rise from about 20 yuan [USD 2.86] per kilogram to a high of 52.30 yuan [USD 7.50] last month [November 2019].

Between now and the Lunar New Year holiday in late January 2020, when demand is expected to peak, prices could rise to between 65 and 75 yuan [USD 9.30-11] per kilo, according to Nomura.

[Reuters news agency published a similar report 5 months ago, namely 12 Jul 2019. It was based upon information from China's Ministry of Agriculture. Its opening segment stated: "Criminal gangs in China are faking outbreaks of African swine fever on farms free of the disease and forcing farmers to sell their healthy pigs at sharply lower prices, the agriculture ministry said." See: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-swinefever/china-vows-to-tackle-dead-pig-scam-amid-swine-fever-epidemic-idUSKCN1U71CN?il=0.

The recent information, widely disseminated by various media sources, warrants verification; it is rather inconceivable that China's government would allow criminal activities to continue for such a long period.

As previously discussed, undoubtedly, human activities have played their respective role, in particular within the food and feed chains.

A solid explanation for the extensive, speedy dissemination of ASF in China, since its initial introduction in 2018, most likely from Russia, is yet to be satisfactorily formulated.

MARA [China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs] released a "3-year action plan to accelerate the recovery and development of pig production" on 4 Dec 2019. The plan's main aims are to:
- curb the decline of the pig inventory and stop soaring pig prices before the end of 2019;
- ensure the pork market supply stabilised during the next New Year's Day (25 Jan 2019) and during the annual national plenary sessions in March 2020;
- recover production capacity near average year by the end of 2020;
- achieve full recovery by 2021.

The plan differentiates areas and implementation objectives:
a) Production area: increase production to ensuring supply (Northeast, North China Plain, Central-south Regions),
b) Consumption area: increase self-sufficiency to 70% (Southeast Coastal Region),
c) Megacities: secure 70% of supply sources by establishing production zone and/or through supply agreement (Beijing, Shanghai), and
d) balanced areas: maintain self-sufficiency (Southwest, Northwest Regions).

The above and additional parts of China's pig industry's restructuring plans are presented in FAO/EMPRES's last (12 Dec 2019) weekly update "ASF Asia," at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/2019/Situation_update_2019_12_12.html.
