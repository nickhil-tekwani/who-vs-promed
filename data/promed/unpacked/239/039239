[1] Peru (Iquitos)
Date: Tue 18 Jan 2011
From: Juan Carlos Celis <charapa3@yahoo.com> [in Spanish, trans.

The epidemic of dengue [virus]-2 Asian/American [genotype III] has now
been present for a month and a half since the confirmation of the 1st
cases in the Peruvian Amazon region and has reached epidemic levels.
Health services and hospitals continue to apply contingency measures
in the face of increasing demand [for health care] by patients with
serious signs who require hospitalization. Human and laboratory
resources have reached critical levels, and to date, 3 deaths have
been confirmed, and another 3 are highly probable [dengue deaths], but
confirmation has not been possible even though they had clinical
pictures compatible [with dengue infections].

The 2 city hospitals in Iquitos have provided hospital beds in
auditoriums and reorganized [treatment] facilities to meet the demand;
an average of 80 beds are available in each hospital for dengue
patients. Currently, an average of 8-15 dengue [patients] are
hospitalized in each hospital, challenging their installed capacity.

Today [18 Jan 2011], the epidemic took the life of a 10-year-old girl,
who developed dengue shock syndrome on the 4th day of her illness,
with pleural leakage, ascites, liver damage and probably myocarditis,
which led to general organ failure.

The office of the Regional Health unit is developing control measures
through a fumigation campaign in Iquitos city and for tomorrow [19 Jan
2011] declared a non-work day for a massive campaign to collect trash
[that could provide breeding sites for _Aedes aegypti_ vector
mosquitoes] in order to contain the epidemic. The rainy season of the
year that is expected to begin in coming months is favoring the
progression [of the epidemic] and making control measures difficult.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Celis for this firsthand report updating the
outbreak in Iquitos. This report provides a vivid example of an
outbreak that threatens to overwhelm local health care capabilities in
this geographically isolated region in the Peruvian Amazon. Diverting
patients to other medical facilities is not feasible. Fumigation
efforts will provide only short-term mosquito vector population
reduction at best. It is critical that the vector breeding sites in
and around buildings be significantly reduced, an effort that will
require community participation. One hopes that there is a massive
community education effort to accomplish that goal.

The 23 Jan 2011 edition of El Comercio
(<http://elcomercio.pe/peru/702701/noticia-iquitos-nueve-aumento-numero-fallecidos-dengue-hemorragico>) indicated that there have been 9 DHF deaths, and in the Diresa-Loreto area, the dengue cases total 5269 since 25 Dec 2010, when the 1st cases were
reported.
