South Africa's banana growing and export industry is at risk following the discovery of Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) in Kwazulu-Natal's [KZN] Ugu district. Subsistence farmers are hit the hardest with their livelihoods at risk. The disease has already wiped out a 160 ha [about 395 acres] commercial farm on which the outbreak was first identified after the farmer had to uproot and destroy every single plant to curb spread of the virus. Banana plants surrounding the affected area are also under pressure. Commercial farmers in the region were contributing towards chemicals to help the rural communities.

The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), together with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the farming community, say that if left uncontrolled the virus could spread to other banana growing parts of the country, with dire consequences for the industry and the South African economy. Prior to the identification of BBTV in South Africa [ProMED-mail post 20160719.4352159], the virus was detected in neighbouring Zambia and Mozambique [see ProMED-mail post 20090127.0372].

Currently, the disease is restricted to the Southern KZN region and ongoing surveys are conducted to monitor the spread. The ARC is also conducting surveys in other banana growing regions and to date no other outbreaks have been reported. Early detection of further infections is crucial to prevent crop losses. Control measures include scouting for banana plants with symptoms, removal of infected plants, and control of the banana aphids. People are not to plant banana on the same position for 6 months to eliminate spread.

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the type member of the genus _Babuvirus_ (family Nanoviridae) and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and death of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia and the Pacific Islands.

BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material or by air currents. The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools). Disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting or natural cluster of plants is considered impossible, and the only option is to kill off all plants in the group. Tolerant varieties can be used to enable some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs.

There are 2 groups of BBTV isolates from different regions: the South Pacific group (including Australia, Burundi, Egypt, Fiji, India, Tonga, Western Samoa) and the Asian group (including Philippines, Taiwan, Viet Nam). The mean sequence difference between the 2 groups has been reported as approximately 10 per cent (see link below). This is thought to suggest that the virus has spread after the initial movement of its hosts from the Indo-Malaysian region, where edible _Musa_ species originated, to Africa and the Americas.
