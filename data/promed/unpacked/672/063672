[On 27 May 2011, Kazakhstan submitted to the OIE an immediate notification
on FMD in Tinali (Uralsk, west Kazakhstan), where -- according to the
report -- stamping out was applied by the destruction of all 827 cattle and
2350 sheep/goats (leading to the outbreak declared as resolved a month
later). Reportedly, serotyping was "pending" and vaccination prohibited.
ProMED-mail added (20110527.1623) the following RFI:

1. According to Kazakhstan's reports to the OIE, vaccination was widely
applied during previous years. Has vaccination been prohibited since? In
case affirmative, why?
2. Information on the serotype of the virus involved, and on the country of
origin of the "new introduced live animals" which are reported as the
source of infection, will be much appreciated.

The current follow-up report No. 1, while indicative of continued
stamping-out policy, provides some of the requested information:

1. The FMDV involved has been serotyped as serotype O.

In 2010, the Kazakhi isolate was genotyped, according to WRLFMD data, as
topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2, close to strains from Iran and Pakistan
as well as to the 2007 strain from Kazakhstan.

2. The control measures do not repeat mentioning "vaccination prohibited";
instead they include "Vaccination in response to the outbreak" (involving
just 707 cattle and 3030 sheep/goats).

The following additional information is requested:
1. From where have the "new live animals" been introduced?
2. What is the distance between the 2 reported outbreak within the Akzhaik
region? (A map of the Akzhaik region, within the province West Kazakhstan,
is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akzhaik_District).
3. Have contacts between the 2 farms been demonstrated/ruled out?
4. Is the currently circulating FMFV strain similar to the 2010 strain?
(genotyping results would be appreciated).
5. The discontinuation of mass vaccination is still to be explained.
6. Has the vaccine strain (particularly serotype O) in the trivalent
vaccine strain applied (on limited scale) in response to the outbreak been
changed, compared to the vaccines widely applied in previous years?
(According to unofficial information, the vaccines applied in 2010 and
previously were produced locally).
7. What is the current disease situation of the Saiga antelope populations,
allegedly affected by 'pasteurellosis' in 2010? - Mod.AS]
