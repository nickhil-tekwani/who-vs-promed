HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE - KENYA (02)
********************************
A ProMED-mail post
[See also
Hemorrhagic disease - Kenya 971222222644]
Yesterday's post on this subject indicated that there had been 13 deaths.
David Basckin <kingbee@iafrica.com>, Durbin, South Africa, sent an article
from a Johannesburg newspaper (23 December 1997) suggesting that more than
140 are now dead of this hemorrhagic fever in eastern Kenya, which has
experienced severe flooding recently.
Angie Lee <Finchley@aol.com> sent the BBC News web site for Monday,
December 22, 1997.
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_41000/41884.stm>
This site does not say much other than regards the increased number of
cases reported but it does mention a "malaria virus". So much for accurate
reporting.
As specimens are being tested in Nairobi, we must await those results, and
perhaps others, before the etiologic agent of this outbreak can be determined.
