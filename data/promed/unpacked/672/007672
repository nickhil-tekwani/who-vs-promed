Sliced apples and products containing them produced by Sun Rich Fresh Foods Ltd., of Brampton, Ontario are being recalled because of the possible presence of _Listeria_. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says the recall is based on its test results, and there has been one illness linked to the slices.

The recall covers Sun Rich Apple Slices in 57-gram, 595-gram and 3-pound packages with a best-before date of 17 May 2015. Other Sun Rich products -- Fruit Medley, Waldorf Salad Kit and Apple Slices with Grapes -- are also being recalled. Shoppers Drug Mart Apples and Grapes and Subway Apples are also part of the recall. The CFIA initially listed Starbucks Seasonal Fruit Salad as one of the affected products. It later updated the notice to say: "This product does not contain apples affected by this recall and as such is excluded from the recall."

The CFIA says food service establishments such as hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and nursing homes should also avoid selling or using these products.

A list of the recalled products, package sizes and best-before dates are available at the CFIA website http://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/20150429b/eng/1430375161334/1430375167258.

[The recent American outbreak caused by 2 genotypically distinct strains of _Listeria_ linked to eating caramel apples involved 37 cases, including 6 deaths, in 11 US states. In addition, 2 Canadians have also developed listeriosis caused by _Listeria_ with the same genotype as one of the US outbreak strains. No illnesses were said to be associated with uncoated apples or caramel candy, or with caramel apples that were not prepackaged, according to the CDC. All the companies involved obtained some of their apples from the same apple supplier headquartered in Bakersfield, California (Bidart Bros.). This recall does not appear to be related to the USA one. - Mod.LL
