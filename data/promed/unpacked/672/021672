Downtown St Augustine is under a rabies alert as 2 rabies cases have been
confirmed.

The St Augustine Police Department said it has already responded to several
reports of rabid raccoons in the area, and the Health Department has issued
a 2-month-long alert in the area surrounding Sevilla Street. But no one
knows whether the problem is confined to the area. The county can't gauge
the rabies rate because it only tests animals when there has been human
exposure, St Johns County animal control director Paul Studivant said.
Because the testing costs USD 155 per animal, it would be cost-prohibitive
to test every animal that's acting strangely.

A rabid raccoon attacked and bit a girl 3 times in the courtyard of
Memorial Presbyterian Church, where she was attending a St Augustine
Children's Chorus practice at Memorial Presbyterian Church on Sevilla
Street, church pastor Dudley Weaver said. Staff and the child's father
"were able to beat the raccoon off of her," he said. "They called police
and EMS and got animal control here. It was a terrible, terrible thing and
very frightening for the child," Weaver said. "She is a very brave little
girl, and she handled it really well." Weaver also said it was disorienting
"to think we have these wild animals in our midst." The girl was treated
[presumably beginning a course of post-exposure immunization] and released
from Flagler Hospital and is doing fine. Rabies is preventable if shots are
given within 2 days of a bite.
Studivant said that another raccoon was confirmed rabid last week after it
possibly bit a dog. The dog had its rabies shots and was fine, but it was
given a booster shot just in case.

Studivant said his department picks up pets that are sick, hurt or in
violation of ordinances but wildlife "only on a sick or injured basis," he
said. If residents are worried about wildlife on their property, they
should call a private wildlife trapper unless the animal is staggering,
unable to swallow (foaming at the mouth), acting overly friendly when
normally it should run or is nocturnal but wandering around in the day.
Then they should call animal control. "We want to know if animals exhibit
that (behavior), especially downtown," Studivant said.

In the meantime, the Health Department urges residents to stay away from
wildlife and to keep pet food inside. The rabies virus is secreted in
saliva, so residents who are bitten or scratched should wash and disinfect
the wound and go to the hospital immediately. Officials also urge residents
to avoid contact with wild animals, including raccoons, particularly if
they're acting strangely. But they also shouldn't panic if a pet or animal
is acting oddly. The pet may have distemper, a common [viral] disease with
some of the same signs. And a nocturnal animal wandering during the day
"could just be looking for food," Studivant said.

[The revised guidelines for post exposure vaccination are contained in the
following document: Use of a reduced (4-dose) vaccine schedule for
postexposure prophylaxis to prevent human rabies. Recommendations of the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. MMWR Recommendations and
Reports 2010; 59(02);1-9, Mar 19
<http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5902a1.htm>. Previously, ACIP
recommended a 5-dose rabies vaccination regimen with human diploid cell
vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV). These new
recommendations reduce the number of vaccine doses to 4. The reduction in
doses recommended for post exposure prophylaxis was based in part on
evidence from rabies virus pathogenesis data, experimental animal work,
clinical studies, and epidemiologic surveillance.
