A Kentucky family's trip to Massachusetts took an unexpected turn when one member got severely ill after consuming oysters. A couple traveled to Boston at the beginning of July [2022] with family to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. The wife said the family was looking forward to the New England seafood, after trying them for the 1st time a few months earlier.

"We had them for the very 1st time this spring," she said, and reported that her husband was eager to try them in Boston. "He was like, 'I can't wait to get good oysters,'" she added. Less than a week into the trip, things took an unexpected turn.

"The morning of [6 Jul 2022], which is actually our anniversary, my husband woke up super, super sick," she said, adding that her husband's stomach was bulging and swollen. He was rushed by ambulance to Tufts Medical Center in Boston, where doctors said he had come down with a rare bacterium called _Vibrio_. While doctors cannot be sure, they believe it's highly likely it came from those oysters.

"They said it's super, super rare," the wife said. "_Vibrio_ itself is common, but this particular strain they haven't seen to make anyone that sick."

Doctors removed part of the husband's intestines and put him on a ventilator. "Couple times, they didn't think he was gonna make it," she said. "Today was what they say is a miracle. They were able to extubate him, and he immediately started talking and asking for us, so today's a good day," she said.

According to the CDC, vibriosis causes an estimated 80 000 illnesses and 100 deaths in the USA every year. People with vibriosis become infected by consuming raw or undercooked seafood or exposing a wound to seawater. The CDC says most infections occur from May through October when water temperatures are warmer.

The family said they all ate oysters at 3 different restaurants. They said the health department is working to track down where the infection may have come from. The family hopes to bring the husband back home to Kentucky next month [August 2022].

[There is little discussion about the clinical features of the case, but requiring bowel resection in _Vibrio_ infections is quite rare. The post implies that the strain was not generally considered pathogenic, so it is likely not a vulnificus or parahaemolyticus species.

It is important to stress that vibrios are naturally present in marine waters and their presence does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of, in the western hemisphere, the American Gulf Coast, but also in warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska, and British Columbia, clearly accentuated by global warming.

Eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease the chances of acquiring a case of foodborne illness compared to eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August) but only in the northern hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
