Salmonella infected 2 children after an Asian dinner, an 11-year old and his cousin 14-year old were hospitalized urgently at the Bambin Gesu Hospital on 8 Jul 2012, with the diagnosis of salmonellosis, thought to have contracted the bacterium from contaminated shrimp toast.

The children minors ate dinner the night before with their families in a Chinese-Japanese restaurant in Tor Marancia. On the same evening of 7 Jul 2012, 3 other adults that were in the restaurant were infected with the bacterium: the mother of 11-year old (for whom there was no need for hospitalization) and 2 girls, admitted to Spallanzani Hospital.

According to the health [department], all contracted Salmonella serogroup D: i.e. the Salmonella Thipy [perhaps it is supposed to be Typhi, an anagram of Thipy - Mod. LL], particularly aggressive especially for children. The children have reporteded the 1st symptoms the next morning after the dinner and arrived at the hospital with a very high fever.

The 11-year old began to have stomach ache and diarrhea: despite the timely hospitalization, the problems continued for the entire week with as many as 150-200 episodes of diarrhea in 5 days that had caused the child to lose 6 kilograms (13.2 pounds). The 14-year old, on the other hand, began to vomit the morning of 8 Jul 2012 and arrived at the hospital with over 39 degrees C fever.. Now the children are at home, after they have been discharged last Friday, 13 Jul 2012.

[The short incubation period and prominent diarrhea are both quite uncommon for _S._ Typhi which it appears that is being reported. There are other serogroup D salmonellae that are non-Typhi and one of these is more likely to be the etiology. Salmonellae are not usual microflora of shrimp so it is likely that the shrimp, if that is the vehicle, to have been contaminated during the period from harvest to the table. - Mod. LL
