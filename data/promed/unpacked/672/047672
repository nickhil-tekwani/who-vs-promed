The 1st case of SBV infection in the French-speaking (Romandie) part of Switzerland has been identified in a cow in the [northwestern] Swiss canton Jura, Alpha Channel reported on Wed 25 Jul 2012. Last week, 2 cattle had been found infected in the canton of Bern. The disease affects cows, goats and sheep and would not represent a risk to humans.

No request for slaughter has been filed despite the lack of vaccine. We are in a phase of observation. In addition, there is minimal risk to humans since infected animals are declared unfit for human consumption, and the disease is not transmissible.

"The virus is transmitted not directly but actually moves from one individual to another through a vector, i.e. a midge or biting insect," said Anne Ceppi, cantonal veterinarian, Jura.

Schmallenberg is the name of the German city where the 1st sample came back positive. The disease causes fever, reduced milk production and diarrhea, among other symptoms. In the pregnant animal, the virus can kill the fetus or cause fetal malformations.

[An official confirmation, including details on clinical and diagnostic aspects of the case, are anticipated.

For a map showing the distribution of SBV as updated 20 Jul 2012 (just prior to the addition of Switzerland), see http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=15054&d=1342182811. The virus (or rather infected vectors) may have spread to Switzerland from France or Germany.

Further updated information on the current SBV situation in Switzerland, in the other 9 infected countries, and throughout the rest of Europe may become clearer if/when a serosurvey is applied.
