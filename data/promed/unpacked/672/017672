UNDIAGNOSED MORTALITY, CATTLE - CANADA (SASKATCHEWAN)

SASKATOON (CP) - Nearly 70 cattle have dropped dead in a field in
south-central Saskatchewan and no one can figure out why. Lab tests have
ruled out all infectious diseases including anthrax, which has recently
killed several cattle in Manitoba. The dead cattle were found Friday [18
Aug 2000] in a 120-hectare communal pasture near Meyronne, a town in
south-central Saskatchewan. Another 150 cattle in the same field had no
noticeable injuries or illness.
A team of veterinarians from the University of Saskatchewan visited the
site Monday and took specimens from 61 cows and 8 calves. They ruled out
starvation since grass was plentiful in the field. There was also plenty of
water which originated from the same source as the town drinking supply.
Most of the dead animals were dehydrated, but Janzen isn't sure why.
Lightning sometimes kills several cattle at once if they are huddled
together, but the carcasses were scattered throughout the field. Foul play
or poisoning would also be nearly impossible to time so that all 69 died on
the same day, Janzen said. Veterinarians will continue their investigation
but it's unclear whether they will find any more clues. Janzen said the
fact the cattle weren't analyzed until several days after their death makes
things extremely difficult.

[Thanks to Dr. Doyle for sending this one in. Although there was grass in
the field, the condition of the animals at death is unclear from this
report. ProMED-mail would appreciate any information from someone in
Saskatchewan as to whether these deaths are associated with an infectious
agent. -Mod.PC]
