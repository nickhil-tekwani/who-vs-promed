The Minister of Health of Cuba, Dr. Jose Ramon Balaguer, informed the
PAHO/WHO Country Office in Cuba of the presence of a classic dengue
outbreak affecting 4 provinces in Cuba, with 9 per cent of the cases
among children. At the time of this release, 3 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) had been reported, with no deaths.
Dr. Lea Guido, PAHO/WHO Representative (PWR) in Cuba, pointed out to
the press (to Spanish-language news agency EFE <http://www.efe.com/>)
that "control of the vector is a high priority for the country and is
being handled at the highest political level." He added that
treatment of the subject on the part of the authorities "has an
intersectoral approach that goes beyond the Ministry of Health" and
involves the community at large.
On 13 Oct [2006], PAHO/WHO-Cuba received a news briefing from the
Cuban Ministry of Public Health reporting that the country continues
to face a dengue outbreak with a predominance of classic dengue.
Although the outbreak has spread in territorial terms, it affects a
limited number of municipalities, with the adult population
predominantly affected. Only 10.3 per cent of the cases have occurred
among children. All cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever have taken
place in the adult population and have, in a limited number of cases,
produced deaths associated with preexisting chronic pathologies.
According to the Ministry of Health of Cuba at the time of this
report, a significant reduction in the number of cases was observed,
both in the provinces and in the capital. Vector-control measures are
in effect, with active investigation of new cases. However, exact
figures on the number of cases were not available.
The Ministry reported that the country continues to respond with
intensified vector-control measures and active investigation of the
population, in order to guarantee early admissions for patients, a
factor that has been favorable in dealing with the situation.
The note from the Ministry of Health points out that the country has
the necessary resources, materials, and trained staff to deal with
this event, in addition to political will and integrated activities
on the part of the different sectors and agencies involved and with
effective and increasing community participation.
Dengue is not endemic in Cuba but has had an impact on the country
due to major epidemics in 1977 (viral serotype dengue 1) and 1981
(dengue 2). Following 16 dengue-free years during which the disease
was not reintroduced, an outbreak hit the island in 1997, in Santiago
de Cuba. In 2001, there was an outbreak of Dengue 3, affecting the
capital and other provinces of the country.

Report Vol. 3, No. 2 [edited]
<http://www.paho.org/english/AD/DPC/CD/eid-eer-2006-oct-31.htm>

The government of El Salvador declared a state of emergency in
several regions of the country, including San Salvador, in their
response to dealing with the dengue epidemic that has already taken
the lives of 2 children. As of 22 Aug 2006, a 'yellow alert' remained
in force in the departments of San Salvador, La Libertad and
Sonsonete, where 70 per cent of the cases have been concentrated.
The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (Ministerio de Salud
Publica y Asistencia Social / MSPAS) of El Salvador reported that
over US$ 4 246 000 have been allocated from the Health Solidarity
Fund (Fondo Solidario para la Salud / FOSALUD) for clinical care,
vector-control activities, purchasing ovitraps, mass communication
and information-dissemination campaigns, and hiring 149 contractors
for related field operations.
Support is being provided by the Ministry of the Defense, through the
Armed Forces, where 180 soldiers are involved in distributing
supplies and fumigating. Their base of operations is located at the
Metropolitan Area Technical Team facilities.
Overcrowding, problems with public provision of drinking water, and
the absence of good hygiene practices -- coupled with the presence of
a large number of vector breeding sites in domiciliary and
peridomiciliary areas -- all characterize those places where the most
cases have been reported, according to experts.
Authorities from the Ministry of Health (MSPAS) emphasized once more
that the population should play a more active role in preventing
dengue, eliminating mosquito breeding sites, and practicing good
hygiene at home, in addition to helping health workers do their job
by willingly providing them access to their home and having somebody
there who can let them in.
In fact, the entire Department of Sonsonete has become a concern for
the Ministry of Health, since it once again stands out as one of the
areas "most affected by dengue." The municipalities of Sonzacate, San
Antonio del Monte, and their county seats -- along with their shared
border area -- monopolized the case toll for the department, with 37
of the 55 cases.
Of the 6 Basic Integrated Health Systems (Sistemas Basicos de Salud
Integral / SIBASI), Sonsonete is one department with a rate of over
50 cases per every 100 000 inhabitants. Also falling into this
category are the municipalities of Nueva Concepcion in Chalatenango
Department, Centro and Soyapango in San Salvador, Suchitoto in
Cuscatlan, and San Vicente.
Up to 4 Oct 2006 (during Epidemiological Week / EW 40), continual
measures were taken to fight dengue, progressing from yellow to red
alert in 3 departments. There were 1032 suspected cases of dengue
during the week of 20-26 Aug [2006](EW 34), rising to 1175 during the
first week of September (EW 35) and falling to 722 during the week of
24-30 Sep [2006](EW 39).
The cases confirmed over the past 3 weeks have fallen by 33 per cent,
dropping from 579 to 387 cases and then to 352 at national level. Two
weeks ago, the reported percentage of samples testing positive for
dengue was 53 per cent; this week, it dropped to 43 per cent. The 4
dengue [virus] serotypes are still circulating in San Salvador, with
serotypes 1 and 2 circulating in Sonsonate and Santa Ana, and
serotype 2 circulating in La Libertad.
The investment in vector-control activities, as well as in clinical
care and social communication, has amounted to US$ 6.2 million.
Interinstitutional collaboration has intensified in the departments
under red alert, as well as in the cities of San Vicente,
Cojutepeque, Santa Ana, and Chalchuapa, where activities have been
carried out to enable the authorities to bring the outbreak under
control in the most populated urban areas.
In 2005, National Dengue Day (Dia Nacional contra el Dengue), held
every 26 August, was proclaimed by the Legislative Assembly to "raise
the level of awareness of the population as to the danger that such a
disease represents, as well as to implement preventive government
activities in the fight against dengue in El Salvador."

deaths. For EW 38, 18 087 cumulative cases of dengue and DHF were
reported -- almost double that reported for the same epidemiological
week in 2005, when there were 9839 cases and no reports of deaths up
to that week.
For EW 40/2006 (ending on 7 Oct [2006]), 19 443 cases were reported,
of which 204 were dengue hemorrhagic fever, followed by 3 deaths.
Follow-up is being done on the implementation of the Integrated
Strategy for Dengue Prevention and Control throughout the country.

There have been around 170 cases of dengue fever in the past few
months in the Cook Islands, although no New Zealand tourists to the
country are known to have contracted the disease. The outbreak was
first noticed in May this year [2006], and has mostly affected the
main island of Rarotonga.
The clinical director at Rarotonga Hospital says most of the cases
have been mild. Dr Henry Tikaka says he cannot tell how bad the
outbreak will get, but he says for this time of year there are a high
number of cases. Dr Tikaka says people are being advised to clear
away any mosquito breeding grounds.
Visitors to the country are being told to bring extra insect repellent.

National Assembly Standing Committee on Health has expressed grave
concern over vast spread of dengue fever and has declared the
measures taken by the District Governments for containing the virus
as insufficient. National Assembly Standing Committee on Health has
therefore directed Health Ministry to take prompt measures for
control of the disease.
This was decided in a meeting held on Thursday in Parliament House
under the Chairmanship of Dr Hajra Tariq Aziz, MNA. The Committee
was briefed by the Health Minister Naseer Khan regarding the efforts
taken by the Ministry to control and prevent of dengue fever. During
the briefing, he informed that 2286 cases of [suspected? -Mod.TY]
dengue fever have been reported all over the country till 31 Oct 2006
out of which 736 have been diagnosed [confirmed? - Mod.TY] with dengue fever.
He said most cases have been reported in Sindh and 30 persons have
died due to it. He said that the federal and provincial government in
Sindh has taken pragmatic measures on an emergency basis to cope with
it. He said that 9 new centres have been set up in Karachi.
Secretary Health Ministry Anwar Mehmood told the Committee that all
out efforts are being made for swift tests of patients on emergency
basis. The Standing Committee also directed that mobile laboratories
and hospital should be established in far rural areas for the help of
the people being affected from this virus and a media campaign should
be launched on TV and radio to create awareness among the people for
preventive measures from this disease.
On the other hand, National Assembly Standing Committee on Health has
expressed grave concern over vast spread of dengue fever and has
declared the measures taken by the district governments for
containing the virus inadequate. It opined that Health Department
must be taken back from district governments and handed over to
provinces as health is a provincial matter. [The] Health Minister
further assured the Committee that situation is under control and
Government is taking all possible steps for the cure and prevention
of dengue fever.

The Center for Disease Control on Thursday confirmed the first case
of dengue fever involving a military serviceman on active duty,
making the 25-year-old man the 6th person in 2006 to have caught the
fever by traveling to southern Taiwan. CDC Deputy Director Chou
Jih-haw said the man, who has been doing his military service in
Taipei City since the beginning of summer, was likely to have been
affected when he went home to the Chienchin District of Kaohsiung
City last month [October 2006] between the 12th and 25th. He also
reportedly visited Fengshan in Kaohsiung County.
Chou said the man did not show any fever symptoms until he returned
to the barracks on 26 [Oct 2006], where upon he was immediately taken
to the Armed Forces Sungshan Hospital that afternoon. So far, the man
has not been discharged from the hospital.
Chou said the center was informed of the man's condition on 30 [Oct
2006]. A blood test confirmed he had contracted [dengue] type 3 of
the infectious virus. Immediately after confirmation of the man's
condition, the CDC and Kaohsiung health officials sprayed both areas
with anti-dengue chemicals [presumably insecticides. - Mod.TY] to
prevent the virus from becoming widespread.
At the moment, no other cases of dengue fever have been reported at
the man's barracks in Taipei, said Chou. However, the barracks will
not be declared completely dengue-free until after a one-week
incubation period, he added.
According to CDC statistics, Taiwan has reported 514 cases of dengue
fever since the start of the summer with 350 of the cases reported in
Kaohsiung City, 151 in Kaohsiung County, 9 cases in Pingdong County,
2 in Tainan County and one report from Taipei City and Keelung City
respectively.
To date, 2 out of 9 victims have died from a slightly more serious
dengue hemorrhagic fever in Taiwan.

Saudi media reported an outbreak of Dengue Fever in Jeddah this week.
Hospital officials have so far reported 4 cases of dengue fever in
Saudi Arabia. There have been no cases of dengue fever reported in
Kuwait. According to local reports agricultural engineer, Mohammed
Habib Bukhari, has warned against a larger scale dengue fever
outbreak in Jeddah.
He said stagnant pools of water left over by an abrupt, but severe
downpour last week were a fertile breeding ground for dengue fever
[virus]-carrying mosquitoes. Bukhari pointed out that some 40 swamps
around the King Abdul Aziz International Airport in addition to the
Mesk Lagoon, Jeddah's dumping area, and the stagnant pools covering
several parts of southern Jeddah were high-risk areas. Dengue is
caused by the bite of the female _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, [which
breed] in stagnant water.

[WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults, but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours, or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management !
by experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of
DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy,
mortality may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case management.
