The dengue fever epidemic that struck the nation 3 months ago remains a
clear and present danger in some areas in Indonesia.
East Kalimantan province
-----------------------
Sugiyanto, an official at the health office of East Kalimantan provincial
government, said that a state of emergency had been imposed in the province
as of Tuesday, as the number of people with dengue fever had reached an
alarming level.
As of Friday last week [19 Mar 2004], a total of 1028 people in the
province had been hospitalized with dengue fever since January [2004]; 18
of them have died.
In the same period last year [2003], 1951 people contracted dengue fever,
31 of them died. Although the number of people with dengue in 2004 has
decreased compared to the 2003's figure, it is still a formidable threat in
the province," he said on Tuesday.
In the province, most dengue cases were found in 3 major cities here,
namely Samarinda, the capital of the province, Bontang and Balikpapan.
Sugianto said that the East Kalimantan provincial government would
intensify efforts to combat the dengue outbreak in the province through
fogging and information campaigns on the prevention of the disease. The
government would also order more Abate powder from private companies in
Jakarta. The powder is sprinkled on still water that could be a potential
breeding place of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the carrier of dengue fever.
Many dengue fever patients have been treated at hospitals in the East
Kalimantan province since it hit the province 3 months ago, but others have
been permitted to go home.
In Wahab Syahrani Hospital in the province, for example, only 10 people
were treated last week for dengue fever; 6 of them were permitted to return
home on Tuesday.
Aceh
-------
Separately in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam province, 5 more people were
admitted to hospital with dengue fever, bringing the number of people
affected by the disease to 110 since January [2004].
"2 are in Aceh Tamiang and the other 3 in West Aceh regency," Mulya
Hasjimy, the head of the health office at the Aceh provincial
administration, was quoted by Antara news agency as saying.
91 people contracted dengue in Aceh in 2002 and 128 people in 2003; 4 of
them died.
South Sumatra & North Sulawesi provinces
----------------------------
Only 2 provinces in Indonesia have been declared dengue-free, namely South
Sumatra and North Sulawesi provinces.
East Java province
--------------------
Separately in East Java province, the Banyuwangi regency government has
earmarked Rp 210 million (USD 26 250) to help prevent the spread of dengue
fever in the area. The fund will be used to finance mass fumigation in the
area.
A total of 62 local residents have contracted dengue fever since January
this year [2004] in Banyuwangi, 13 of whom are still being treated at
hospitals there.

rates higher than the countrywide rate: Falcon, Nueva Esparta, Merida,
Trujillo, Tachira, Monagas, Vargas, Capital District, Lara, and Barinas .
Falcon state reported the highest rate with 274.3 cases per 100 000 pop,
followed by Nueva Esparta (Margarita Island) with 120.3. The Capital
District rate is 43.4.
[There is a decreasing trend in reported cases over the last 7 weeks].
Cases per epidemiological week (2004):

Dengue Fever in El Salvador
---------------------------------------------
Last week El Salvador's Ministry of Health [had laboratory confirmation of
37 dengue fever cases]. This represents a considerable increase compared
with the 2 previous years.
For [2004], 455 cases of dengue have been reported (in 2003 for the same
epidemiological week there were only 269 cases). There are now more cases
than in 2002, a year which was considered as epidemic for DF in El
Salvador. Although there is a year-by-year increase, the first weeks of
2004 show a trend towards decreasing numbers. Previously, there were
between 46 and 66 confirmed cases per week.
However, the Minister of Health, Herbet Betancourt, says that people should
not trust this trend, because larval indexes are high.
For this week, there are 4 departments declared to be in alert status: San
Salvador, La Libertad, La Paz, and San Vicente (these departments still
have high hospitalization rates). San Salvador has already had more than
200 confirmed cases in 2004. Fortunately, DHF case numbers are still low.
This year only 19 cases (DHF) have been reported, compared with 24 in [2003].
Currently, 12 patients are hospitalized due to dengue fever, 3 in Santa
Ana, 2 in San Vicente, 3 in El Bloom, and 2 each in Sopayango and San Miguel.
In regard to entomological information, the current national larval index
is 5.9 percent, although there are places with up to 18 percent (Gran San
Salvador).
The incidence rate is high in comparison with the last epidemic year
(2002). Current incidence rate is [7.1 per 100 000 population]. In 2002
this figure was 5.6 [per 100 000 population].

[This report is for the first 10 epidemiologic weeks -- the period 4 Jan
through 13 Mar 2004]
As stated on the El Salvador Ministry of Health website, the dengue
incidence rate is increasing, compared to the last 2 years: the rates for
epidemiological weeks 1-10 in 2002 and 2003 were 6.3 [per 100 000
population] and 4.4 [per 100 000 population] respectively; [For the first
10 weeks of 2004] this figure is 7.1 [per 100 000 population]. There have
been no deaths [reported] so far in 2004 (compared with 3 during
2003). [The reported rates of DHF per 100 000 population for comparable
time periods are: 0.6 (2002); 0.4 (2003) and 0.3 (2004).]
According to official numbers, last month [February 2004], the national
larval infestation index of _Aedes aegypti_ was 5.9. [Provinces reporting
high rates of dengue activity include San Salvador, La Paz, La Libertad and
San Vicente].

Vietnam concerned over spike in dengue fever cases
-------------------------
Health authorities in Vietnam expressed concern over the growing numbers of
people infected with dengue fever, the mosquito-borne disease that has
killed 7 people this year [2004] in the country.
Pham Ngoc Dinh, deputy director of the Hanoi-based Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology, said 4199 people had been infected since the beginning of
2004, a 90 percent increase compared to the same period of 2003. The
worst-affected areas were in the southern Mekong Delta region, where moist
and humid conditions provide ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes. The
region accounted for over 90 percent of the cases and all the deaths.
"Dengue fever is an annual occurrence in Viet Nam, but every 3 to 5 years
there are strong outbreaks, and this could explain the high number of cases
in the first 2-1/2 months of this year," Dinh said.
Some 383 people died in the last such epidemic in 1998, which infected 234
866 people across the country, according to the World Health
Organization. "We are afraid that the numbers will keep increasing in the
coming months," Dinh said, adding that it was essential to eliminate pools
of dirty, stagnant water and other unhygienic conditions that allow the
mosquitoes to thrive.
