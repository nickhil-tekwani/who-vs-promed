Nonrecombining sympatric forms of the human
malaria parasite Plasmodium ovale occur globally.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background: Malaria in humans is caused by
apicomplexan parasites belonging to 5 species of
the genus Plasmodium. Infections with Plasmodium
ovale are widely distributed but rarely
investigated, and the resulting burden of disease
is not known. Dimorphism in defined genes has led
to P. ovale parasites being divided into classic
and variant types. We hypothesized that these
dimorphs represent distinct parasite species.

Methods: Multilocus sequence analysis of 6
genetic characters was carried out among 55
isolates from 12 African and 3 Asia-Pacific countries.

Results: Each genetic character displayed
complete dimorphism and segregated perfectly
between the 2 types. Both types were identified
in samples from Ghana, Nigeria, Sao Tome, Sierra
Leone, and Uganda and have been described
previously in Myanmar. Splitting of the 2
lineages is estimated to have occurred between
1.0 and 3.5 million years ago in hominid hosts.

Conclusions: We propose that P. ovale comprises 2
nonrecombining species that are sympatric in
Africa and Asia. We speculate on possible
scenarios that could have led to this speciation.
Furthermore, the relatively high frequency of
imported cases of symptomatic P. ovale infection
in the United Kingdom suggests that the morbidity
caused by ovale malaria has been underestimated.

[This is the 1st comprehensive study of the world
wide distribution of the 2 Plasmodium ovale
variants. It has been known for some time that P.
ovale existed in 2 variants which could not be
distinguished by light microscopy of Giemsa
stained blood films described from Asia (Kawamoto
F et al. Sequence variation in the 18S rRNA gene,
a target for PCR-based malaria diagnosis, in
Plasmodium ovale from southern Vietnam. J Clin
Microbiol. 1996;34:2287-9. Win TT, et al.
Molecular analysis of Plasmodium ovale variants.
Emerg Infect Dis. 2004;10:1235-40) and Cameroun
(Duval L et al. Chimpanzee malaria parasites
related to Plasmodium ovale in Africa. PLoS One.
2009;4(5):e5520). The new study shows that the 2
variants are distributed world wide, and probably
circulate at the same time in the same areas. It
is interesting that the species probably
separated million of years ago and the finding
probably do not reflect on-going transmission between primate and humans.

The confusion between P.malariae and P.knowlesi
in Asia, which was clearly demonstrated by
molecular typing, and the present results show
that the classification of malaria parasite based
only on light microscopy need to be further studied. ­ Mod.EP]
