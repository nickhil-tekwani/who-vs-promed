Australian _Salmonella Montevideo_ outbreak linked to imported tahini.
--------------------------------------------------
Cases of _S. Montevideo_ are being notified in Australia, principally in
New South Wales, with 54 Australian cases detected since 1 Nov 2002.
The implicated imported tahini has been recalled. Information from
interviews with new cases in conjunction with food sample testing are
suggesting possible links with other sources of tahini.
Countries detecting an increase of _S. Montevideo_ cases could ask about
history of travel to Australia and consumption of sesame seed-based foods.
A PFGE pattern of outbreak isolates is available.

[Tahini is a paste made from raw sesame seeds. Other products made from
sesame seeds include hummus and halvah.
Previous outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with food products
produced from sesame seeds. As reported in a previous ProMED posting
(Salmonella typhimurium DT104 - Australia, Europe 20010822.1980), between
1985 and 2001 the National Enteric Pathogen Surveillance Scheme (NEPSS) in
Australia has recorded the isolation of 17 different _Salmonella_ spp. from
sesame seeds and sesame seed products, including hummus, tahini, and
halvah, on 30 occasions. Sesame seed products should be always be
considered when attempting to identify a source of salmonellosis. - Mod.LL]
