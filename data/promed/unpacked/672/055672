In response to ProMED-mail "Hepatitis A - Latvia: Request for
information 20090201.0451," we draw your attention to the following
updated information on the hepatitis A outbreak in Latvia
(Eurosurveillance, Volume 14, Issue 3, 22 January, 2009
(<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19092>)

Community-wide outbreak of hepatitis A in Latvia in 2008 - update
-----------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis A has been ongoing in Latvia with 2817
confirmed cases reported between 20 Nov 2007 and 31 Dec 2008.
Initially the spread of infection was due to transmission among drug
users and other high-risk groups, as well as several outbreaks in
Riga (affecting a school and a restaurant), but in the 2nd half of
the year led to a community-wide increase in the number of cases.
Molecular analysis of 100 strains showed that 95 belonged to genotype
IA, of which 89 were identical and 6 were single nucleotide variants
of the same sequence.

Introduction
------------
The Latvian Public Health Agency (PHA) updates through this article
the information on epidemiological situation of hepatitis A in 2008
in Latvia. An increase in number of cases of hepatitis A has been
observed since November 2007. A total of 2817 confirmed cases of
hepatitis A were notified between 20 Nov 2007 and 31 Dec 2008, and
419 suspected cases were still under investigation on 31 Dec 2008.
The highest number of cases (678) was notified in October 2008. [The
distribution of confirmed and suspected cases of hepatitis A by month
of onset is illustrated by a figure in the original text.]

Methods
-------
Hepatitis A is a disease under mandatory notification in Latvia.
Clinicians should notify suspected and confirmed cases and
laboratories are required to report positive hepatitis A virus (HAV)
results according to the European Union (EU) case definitions (1). A
probable case is defined as a person with a clinical picture
compatible with hepatitis (discrete onset of symptoms and jaundice or
elevated serum aminotransferase levels) and with an epidemiological
link. A confirmed case is defined as any person meeting the clinical
criteria and with serum IgM antibodies against hepatitis A virus (IgM
anti-HAV) (1). Upon receiving notification reports from clinicians or
laboratories, all cases of hepatitis A are investigated by
epidemiologists from the Public Health Agency (PHA) local branch. To
characterise the HAV circulating in the outbreak, 100 serum samples
from the Latvian State Agency "Infectology Center of Latvia" were
sent to the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the
Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, RIVM) for
genotyping.

Results of epidemiological investigations
-----------------------------------------
The age of the cases ranged from five months to 86 years, with a
median age of 31.7 years. [The age and sex distribution of confirmed
cases of hepatitis A is illustrated by a figure in the original
text]. The significant proportion of cases among adults could be
explained by low hepatitis A infection activity in Latvia in recent
years and absence of naturally acquired immunity in their childhood.
The last biggest outbreak of hepatitis A occurred in 1988-1990 with
almost 20 000 cases registered during 3 years. Since then the number
of cases steadily declined and during the last 10 years was very low
-- an average of 100 cases per year. The lowest number of cases of
hepatitis A (n=22) was registered in 2007, the year before the
current epidemic.

The proportion of males amongst hepatitis A patients was 72 percent
(range 66 to 73 percent) in the 1st 6 months of the epidemic
(November 2007-April 2008), and 52 percent in the following period
(May-December 2008). The overall male to female ratio was 1.15 to 1,
with the highest rate of 1.55 to 1 in the age group 15-34 years. The
overall incidence rate per 100 000 population was 124. The incidence
rate amongst males was about 1.35 times higher than amongst females
[illustrated by a figure in the original text]. The difference in
infection risk between the sexes could be partly explained by
significant number of cases among male drug users (DUs).

Hepatitis A in drug users
-------------------------
During the observation period, 191 drug users (of whom up to 90
percent were injecting drug users, IDUs) were notified as hepatitis A
patients. The highest numbers were reported in July and August (23
and 27, respectively), but the proportion of drug users amongst all
cases was highest in the beginning of the epidemic -- up to 39
percent. The estimated number of problem drug users in Riga is 4757.
As the number of hepatitis A cases among DUs in Riga was 153, the
incidence rate in this group could be as high as 3216 cases per 100
000 in 2008.

Since September [2008], the number of cases among DUs and, in
particular, the proportion of DUs among all cases had declined. The
reason for this is still unclear although one of the explanations may
be that the epidemic in this group started earlier and therefore
peaked and declined earlier compared to the outbreak in the general
population. [Data illustrated by a figure in the original text.]

Geographical distribution
-------------------------
The majority of cases of hepatitis A (2132, 76 percent) occurred in
inhabitants of Riga, 199 in the population of the wider Riga region,
88 cases in Jurmala and the remaining cases were distributed among
other 6 cities and 23 districts in Latvia, which reported between one
and 66 cases each. [Illustrated by a figure in the original text.]

Clinical outcome
----------------
Of the 2817 confirmed cases, there were 17 deaths (0.6 percent). 91
percent of cases of hepatitis A were treated in hospitals. All death
cases were registered in patients with underlying diseases and / or
other risk factors (alcohol, drugs). An increase in mortality has
been observed during the epidemic, ranging from 0 in the period of
time November 2007-March 2008, to 0.77 percent in October-December
2008. [Data tabulated in the original text]. There was no difference
in mortality rates among cases of hepatitis A by sex.

Genotyping results
------------------
One hundred serum samples from Latvian patients were tested for the
presence of HAV RNA. All samples were positive and were further
processed for genotype analysis by sequencing of 460 nucleotides of
the VP1/P2A region. Sequences were compared to each other and to
sequences available in public databases. One of the 100 sequences was
of genotype IB, with a maximum match of 99 percent with 3 sequences
originating from North and West Africa. Of the 100 sequences 4 were
of genotype IIIA. The 4 sequences were identical and have as nearest
neighbors 20 sequences in the database that match at 99 percent.
These sequences mostly have their origin in Pakistan.

By far the largest group of sequences from Latvian patients belonged
to genotype IA. Of these 89 were identical, and 6 were single
nucleotide variants of this sequence type. These 95 sequences
represent the outbreak strain of Latvia 2008. In the databases only 2
strains were found with sequences matching at 99 percent or greater.
Both were isolated from patients in the Netherlands in 2004 and were
travel associated. In one case travel history involved Turkey.

For all 3 individual sequence types of the 3 genotypes there were
many sequences matching at 98 percent with various regions of origin,
several different transmission modes, and from an extended time
period. Therefore, if sequence matching is used for epidemiological
linking, sequences should be matching more than 99 percent.

The single IB and the 4 IIIA strains were most likely introduced in
Latvia by (returning) travelers, and spread to close contacts if at
all. This is a pattern that can be seen in many European countries
with a low level of hepatitis A endemicity. The IA strain that caused
the outbreak may also have been introduced by a traveler but more
importantly it was introduced into a group, in which it could spread
more widely than just close contacts, thereby causing an outbreak.
[The sequence data are tabulated in the original text].

Control measures
----------------
With the aim to contain the epidemic, the following measures have
been implemented:
All cases of hepatitis A have been investigated by epidemiologists of
the relevant local branches of "Public Health Agency." Family doctors
have been informed about contacts. Control measures, such as medical
observation of contacts and increasing of hygiene and restriction of
contacts between children from different groups, have been
implemented at places at risk -- children establishments, food
enterprises, as well as workplaces and households where 2 and more
cases of hepatitis A were registered.

Monitoring of cases of hepatitis A has been enhanced -- weekly and,
if necessary, daily data are available at the national and local
levels. Monitoring data are published on PHA website. Detailed
recommendations for different target groups (staff of food
enterprises, children establishments, and general public) have been
developed and distributed to different institutions at national and
local levels. Recommendations had already been available on the PHA
website. Survey data indicated that in October [2008], PHA
recommendations were available in 98 percent of schools.

Lectures for different targets groups (health professionals
association, school nurses, family doctors etc.) have been provided.

A special poster-sticker to stress the importance of hand washing has
been developed and distributed to schools.

A special survey to identify risk factors for hepatitis A has been
performed by PHA in schools. Local governments and administration of
the schools were informed about the results of the survey, its
conclusions, and recommendations.

Intensive collaboration with mass media has been in place. PHA press
releases on hepatitis A situation and recommendations have been
developed and distributed weekly. Only in November [2008] there were
53 publications on hepatitis A in national and local mass media, and
13 interviews on this topic on TV and 17 on the radio.

Although vaccination against hepatitis A has not been provided free
of charge, vaccination has been recommended to risk groups and
contacts. A significant increase in the number of people vaccinated
against hepatitis A has been observed since September 2008
corresponding to the spread of the epidemic.

Conclusion
----------
The ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A in Latvia has not yet been fully
understood, but a few working hypotheses may explain the spread of
the epidemic. The increase in the number of cases in the beginning of
2008 can be related to the initial spread of infection among DUs and
persons with low income level living in substandard hygienic
conditions, as well as to several outbreaks (a school in Riga, a
restaurant in Riga (2,3)). Increased circulation of the virus in
highly susceptible population led, in the 2nd part of the year, to a
community-wide increase in the number of cases that demonstrated the
typical seasonal activity of hepatitis A usual for endemic years in
the past. The modes of transmission involved vary, including
person-to-person transmission, contaminated food, and, possibly,
swimming in bathing waters in summer.
