A 3rd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is 92% more effective in reducing severe COVID-related outcomes than 2 doses of the same vaccine received at least 5 months previously, according to a large real-world study late last week in The Lancet. The study, conducted by researchers with the Clalit Research Institute in Israel and Harvard University, took place from [30 Jul 2021] through [23 Sep 2021], during Israel's 4th COVID-19 wave, when the delta (B1617.2) variant was overwhelmingly predominant.

The scientists reviewed data from 728 321 Israelis aged 12 or above who had received the 3rd Pfizer dose and matched them with the same number of people who had received the 2-dose series at least 5 months before. They found that, compared with people who received only 2 doses, those who received 3 doses of the vaccine had a 93% lower risk of COVID-related hospitalization, a 92% lower risk of severe COVID-19, and an 81% lower risk of COVID-related death 7 or more days after the booster. Booster-dose vaccine effectiveness was found to be similar across demographics. The study also found that infection rates began to drop for each age-group 7 -- 10 days after people in that group became eligible for a 3rd dose.

Study coauthor Ben Reis, of Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said in a Lancet news release, "This careful epidemiological study provides reliable information on 3rd-dose vaccine effectiveness, which we hope will be helpful to those who have not yet decided about vaccination with a 3rd dose."

In a Lancet commentary on the study, K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, wrote, "Although these reports strengthen the case for a booster dose of [the Pfizer COVID vaccine], there is no evidence yet to suggest that global policies related to other vaccines should be influenced by this experience."

Background
"Many countries are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19, driven predominantly by the delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2. In response, these countries are considering the administration of a 3rd dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose to address potential waning immunity over time and reduced effectiveness against the delta variant. We aimed to use the data repositories of Israel's largest health-care organisation to evaluate the effectiveness of a 3rd dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Interpretation
"Our findings suggest that a 3rd dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective in protecting individuals against severe COVID-19-related outcomes, compared with receiving only 2 doses at least 5 months ago."

Commentary: K Srinath Reddy. Boosters appear effective, but are they always needed? The Lancet. Published: 29 Oct 2021 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02388-6

The author of the commentary discusses safety concerns of a 3rd dose, and global vaccine inequity. "As countries discharge their responsibility to protect vulnerable individuals in their populations, they must ensure adequate supply to other countries. Global policy must weigh the risks of adopting booster doses ad libitum across the world at this stage of the pandemic."

News: EurekaAlert. https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/933198

"This study is the first to estimate the effectiveness of a 3rd dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine--BNT162b2 specifically--against severe outcomes with adjustment for various possible confounders, including comorbidities and behavioral factors. The study's large size also allows a more precise assessment of the vaccine's effectiveness across different time periods, different subpopulations (by sex, age and number of comorbidities), and different severe outcomes (which are rarer and thus require greater sample size).

"The results show that, compared with individuals who received only 2 doses 5 months prior, individuals who received 3 doses of the vaccine (7 days or more after the 3rd dose) had 93% lower risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization, 92% lower risk of severe COVID-19 disease, and 81% lower risk of COVID-19-related death. Vaccine effectiveness was found to be similar for different sexes, age groups (ages 40-69 and 70+) and number of comorbidities.

"The study also included a population-level analysis which found that infection rates began to drop for each age group 7-10 days after that age group became eligible for the third dose." - Mod.LK]

Abstract
Objective: To offer a quantitative risk-benefit analysis of 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among adolescents in England.
Setting: England.
Design: Following the risk-benefit analysis methodology carried out by the US Centers for Disease Control, we calculated historical rates of hospital admission, Intensive Care Unit admission and death for ascertained SARS-CoV2 cases in children aged 12-17 in England. We then used these rates alongside a range of estimates for incidence of long COVID, vaccine efficacy and vaccine-induced myocarditis, to estimate hospital and Intensive Care Unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID over a period of 16 weeks under assumptions of high and low case incidence.
Participants: All 12-17 year olds with a record of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in England between [1 July 2020] and [31 March 2021] using national linked electronic health records, accessed through the British Heart Foundation Data Science Centre.
Main outcome measures: Hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions, deaths and cases of long COVID averted by vaccinating all 12-17 year olds in England over a 16-week period under different estimates of future case incidence.
Results: At high future case incidence of 1000/100 000 population/week over 16 weeks, vaccination could avert 4430 hospital admissions and 36 deaths over 16 weeks. At the low incidence of 50/100 000/week, vaccination could avert 70 hospital admissions and 2 deaths over 16 weeks. The benefit of vaccination in terms of hospitalisations in adolescents outweighs risks unless case rates are sustainably very low (below 30/100 000 teenagers/week). Benefit of vaccination exists at any case rate for the outcomes of death and long COVID, since neither have been associated with vaccination to date.
Conclusions: Given the current (as at 15 Sep 2021) high case rates (680/100 000 population/ week in 10-19 year olds) in England, our findings support vaccination of adolescents against SARS-CoV2.

[The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing reports suggesting the coronavirus vaccine made by Moderna can cause heart problems in some adolescents, the company said on (Sunday 31 Oct 2021).

Moderna requested authorization from the FDA for use of its vaccine in children ages 12 to 17 years in June 2021. The adolescents would receive 100 micrograms of the vaccine -- the same dose given to adults 18 and above. But the agency has not yet made a ruling on the application, prompting speculation about reasons for the delay.

Moderna said more than 1.5 million adolescents worldwide have received its coronavirus vaccine, and the data thus far do not suggest an increased risk of myocarditis. But studies from Israel and the United States have linked both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to rare and transient cases of myocarditis, with a higher risk from the Moderna vaccine.

In studies from Israel and the United States, the incidence of heart problems among people who had received Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine is highest in males aged 16 -- 29 years. The risk appears to decline in children 12 -- 15, and is expected to be even lower in younger children, Dr Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee. said. Even with the heightened risk, myocarditis as a result of the vaccine is rare, mild, and resolves quickly. COVID-19 [the disease] is much more likely to cause myocarditis, Dr Offit noted, because the virus can infect and damage the lining of the heart.

The severity of India's 2nd COVID-19 wave took the world by surprise. Cases skyrocketed, at one point accounting for roughly half of the total infections reported globally. Then, almost as quickly, the numbers plunged. MedPage Today spoke with experts on the ground in India and in the US to better understand the dynamics of India's COVID curve, and to find out what lessons other countries can learn from its experience.

All of the physicians and public health experts who responded to our inquiries agreed that one of the primary reasons the virus dissipated so quickly after the 2nd wave was that it simply had nowhere left to go.

Not a wave but a 'sharp spike'
------------------------------
The "virus inferno" is how Bhramar Mukherjee, of the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor, refers to India's 2nd wave, which hit before the country had a chance to fully roll out vaccination.

Seroprevalence surveys at the end of June [2021] found that roughly 70% of the Indian population had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, said Mukherjee, which can only mean that those antibodies were the result of past infection. At that time, India had vaccinated only about 2% of its population. In the US, seroprevalence rates were closer to about 1 in 3 Americans prior to vaccination, she noted.

During the 2nd wave, the country witnessed a "very sharp spike and fall" which, as seen in other outbreaks, often occurs after the virus returns with a mutation that is more transmissible, in this case, of course, being the delta variant, she continued. At the same time, human behavior grew more lax, said Mukherjee.

Gagandeep Kang, of the Wellcome Trust Research Laboratory at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, and an adjunct professor at Tufts University in Massachusetts, agreed, noting that by January and February of this year [2021], "you could see that the masks were coming off or were inappropriately used."

When delta arrived, "hardly any household was spared", said Arvinder Singh Soin, of the Institute of Liver Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine in Medanta, India, in an email.

At this point, people weren't as willing to stay home. Some were in denial and others simply had pandemic fatigue, Mukherjee said. Kang recalled the "tens of thousands of people" at election rallies and the millions who took part in festivals and pilgrimages across the country, who then brought the virus back to their communities.

"So ... the virus is coming back with [a] vengeance and the human beings are letting their guards down. [The] juxtaposition of these 2 forces often leads to this huge spike that we see ... and I think that's exactly what happened," Mukherjee noted. Once people "exhausted" their networks -- meaning the infected people had exposed every person they could among friends, family, and colleagues -- then cases began to fall, Kang explained. By then the "sheer devastation," the fact that so many people lost loved ones, hit a nerve, Mukherjee said. "I think the proximity to death really scared them." How long that fear will last is unclear, she added, noting that one of the biggest Indian festivals, Diwali, is set for next week.

There are other uncertainties as well. While much of the country has protection against severe disease due to infection or vaccination, it's not clear when that protection will wane or by how much, Kang noted.

Apples to oranges
-----------------
There are other factors in play when looking at the impact of COVID in India. For instance, 40% of India's population is under age 18, and disease is usually milder in that younger age group, pointed out Mukherjee. One needs to know "if you're comparing apples to apples or apples to oranges."

India's 1st wave mostly impacted the poorer urban slums, not higher socioeconomic groups, explained Manoj Mohanan, of Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy in Durham, North Carolina. During this 1st wave, the number of people dying in India was lower, largely due to fewer elderly people living in slums, he noted. The 2nd wave hit those with more socioeconomic stability, and "that's when ... you started to see the number of deaths going up."

Researchers have also theorized that people in lower-income countries may have stronger immune systems as a result of their increased exposures to an array of diseases and infections, suggesting that this immunity has helped to keep COVID at bay. While cross immunity does happen, there hasn't been any "hard data" to support this theory, which is "somewhere between conjecture and wishful thinking," said Soin.

Lessons learned
---------------
If India has learned nothing else from the pandemic, the importance of syndromic surveillance has been made crystal clear, according to Kang. "Because if you understand what you're dealing with, then it becomes much easier to develop a strategy." She also noted the importance of developing pandemic protocols. Southern states had lower mortality rates among similar patients in Northern states because the South was more prepared, she said. Early in the pandemic, even asymptomatic patients were brought to hospitals, but by the 2nd wave, homecare protocols allowed symptomatic patients to be managed at home and to receive "oxygen concentrators," Kang noted.

Another possible mistake was enacting quarantines in India's slums, because it meant packing a lot of people into a confined space, Mukherjee pointed out. While effective in other places, "you really have to think about what works for India." The decision to restrict grocery stores' hours was also flawed, because it led to crowding. What officials should have done was keep the same hours, but restrict the number of customers, she said.

Second to vaccines, distributing free masks is probably the "best intervention" the country can invest in, she added, noting her strong support for mask mandates. One surprise was the number of volunteers who stepped up, Kang said. These young people were gathering data from media and government reports, identifying where beds and oxygen cylinders were available, and providing food to people who were quarantined. "The fact that so many young people were so altruistic gives me hope," she said.

A third wave
------------
Despite "hysteria" over a possible surge in July and August [2021], "our models actually never projected the 3rd wave," Mukherjee said; however, just because a "huge, towering wave" isn't expected in the next 4 -- 6 weeks doesn't mean that people shouldn't remain vigilant.

"Unless we're careful in the festival season and get fully vaccinated, we could be staring at a 3rd wave soon," Soin said, noting that uptake of 2nd doses of the vaccine has been lagging. He also emphasized his support for mandatory vaccination certificates for those on welfare, for domestic travel, in public spaces, and at work.

Lancelot Pinto, of P D Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre in Mumbai, said that there are "naysayers" who don't think India should invest in preparing for a possible 3rd wave. But when there's a disease with this many unknowns, it makes sense to prepare for a worst-case scenario, he told MedPage Today on a phone call. "Nobody had predicted delta. Right?"

Mathematical modeling has shown that there could potentially be a variant that evades the immunity that vaccines provide. And while some may say that these are "doomsday predictions" that will never happen, "I believe there's no harm in having a plan ready ... if things start escalating," he added. Even highly vaccinated communities have outbreaks, Mukherjee warned, pointing to Singapore as one example. What's needed is a "tiered system" in which if metrics reach a certain threshold, different interventions from a "dial-up, dial-down menu" can be drawn and implemented. "We have to be cautious for a period of time 'till we see strong evidence that this is over," she said.

While festivals have been ongoing for the past 3 weeks, Kang said that no uptick in cases has been reported anywhere. "So, not to say that it can't happen. But, so far, there are no huge indicators that things are going awry."

[It is estimated that about 460 000 lost their lives because of the pandemic in India. The more than 90% of the population who have immunity from natural infection will see it wane in the coming months. More than half of all Indians have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and almost 25% are considered to be fully vaccinated. The government is now vaccinating a solid 600 000 or more every day, while monitoring a caseload of about 150 000 covid-positive patients. Even though COVID cases are down, the country needs to maintain intensive surveillance and stay prepared for another wave.
