I have had recent experience with caseous lymphadenitis in the UK and sent
the ollowing letter to the Vet Record about 6 weeks ago. Unfortunately it
has not been printed, which seems a shame.

Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) was first identified in Great Britain in a herd
of goats in March 1990 (Harker 1990) and has subsequently spread to sheep
(Lloyd 1994). In countries where the disease is endemic, CLA is responsible
for serious economic losses. In western USA, CLA is the third leading cause
of economic loss to the sheep industry and in Australia it is identified as
one of the five most economically important diseases (Paton 1990). Losses
occur due to wasting (Renshaw et al 1979), death and partial or total
carcase condemnation associated with extensive internal abscessation. Other
losses can occur due to poor fertility, reduced hide value and poor wool
growth (Paton 1988).
CLA can also affect other mammals including horses, cattle (Brown & Olander
1987) and man (Peel et al 1997). The disease is characterised by
encapsulated abscesses in lymph nodes, lung tissue and other internal
organs. The lesions enlarge slowly and may burst to form a discharging sinus.
The causative organism, _Cornebacterium pseudotuberculosis_, spreads by
contact with discharge from superficial abscesses and in aerosols from lung
abscesses that have ruptured. It can survive on fomites such as wood, straw
and hay for up to eight weeks (Augustine & Renshaw 1986), in shaded areas
for up to 20 weeks and has been shown to survive for up to 8 months in soil
samples (Brown & Olander 1987). It can maintain infectivity in sheep dips
for 24 hours (Nairn & Robertson 1974). Low temperatures and damp conditions
prolong survival time (Augustine & Renshaw 1986). Infection can occur
through intact skin (Nairn & Robinson 1974) and superficial skin wounds. The
organism can also be inhaled or ingested (Brown & Olander 1987).
Contaminated shears, and other implements can spread infection. The
incidence of CLA increases with repeated exposure to infection at each
shearing (Paton 1988) and hence the prevalence of CLA increases with age.
Introduction of CLA into a previously uninfected flock will result in
visible abscesses in a substantial part of the flock 2 to 3 years later.
CLA is diagnosed using routine bacteriology from discharging abscesses.
Diagnosis in sheep with internal abscessation is difficult. There is no
reliable serological test developed for commercial use although several
groups have developed in-house tests (Kuria & Holstad 1989, Menzies et al
1994, Ter Laake et al 1992, Kamp E.A. 1997[personal comm.]).

In a recent investigation into an outbreak of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) in
a group of pedigree rams, submandibular swellings were noticed in three out
of eight rams, six weeks after shearing in February 1996. _Corynebacterium
pseudotuberculosis_ was isolated from swabs sent to the local VI centre. The
rams were treated with systemic antibiotics and within one week the visible
swellings had disappeared. The farmer's vet advised him to cull all eight
rams which had been isolated from the main flock for the previous six
months. However, the farmer discussed the matter further with a number of
sheep specialists, including members of the veterinary profession, and
decided to keep the rams for use on his commercial flock. Six months later,
in September 1996, just before the rams were due to join the commercial
flock, swellings were noticed in two of the eight rams. They were treated as
before, one ram recovered and the other was culled. It passed meat inspection.
In January 1997 the farm was visited to advise on how to maintain the
pedigree flock free from CLA (if they were not already infected). When we
attended the farm, one ram had a superficial swelling, again in the
mandibular region. It is interesting to note that lesions in these rams have
only ever been associated with the mandibular lymph node which is reported
to be an uncommon site for infection in sheep (Batey 1986, Seddon 1929).
Most of the rams had head wounds due to fighting which may explain this. The
farmer has not sold any of his pedigree sheep since CLA was diagnosed twelve
months ago. However, he has noticed that a number of sheep at pedigree shows
have had superficial swellings around the head and neck area. He expressed
concern that the breed societies allowed these animals to be entered for
sale or showing and questioned whether he should attempt to maintain his
pedigree flock "CLA free" when the risk of reinfection was possible at breed
society events and through buying in infected sheep.
We advised the farmer to use AI only in his pedigree sheep (as we have found
no reports of its transmission through semen) and not to buy in pedigree
replacements. The Norwegian College of Veterinary Medicine in Oslo has
offered to use their haemolysin-inhibition test on serum from the pedigree
ewes which will establish whether the flock is infected. Meanwhile, the
pedigree and commercial flock are kept separately, including separate
housing and shearing facilities. We assume that the commercial flock is now
infected.
Once diagnosed, some measures can be instigated in endemic flocks to reduce CLA
transmission within and between flocks, one of the most important is good
hygiene at, and after, shearing (Paton 1988, Paton 1996). The British
Association of Sheep Contractors do not have a policy for disinfecting
shearing equipment (personal comm.). In Australia it is common practice for
shears to be disinfected between sheep because of the risk of transmitting
CLA. Contractors in the UK consider that farmers would be unwilling to pay
for the extra time involved in disinfection. However, do farmers realise
that they may be importing disease when their sheep are sheared?
Commercial vaccines have been used effectively in Australia to reduce, but
not liminate, infection (Paton et al 1995). They have been combined with
clostridial vaccines (Eggleton et al 1991) and anthelmintics (Scwartzkoff et
al 1996). One company producing these vaccines has not attempted to license
the product in Europe because they do not think that there is a market for
it (personal comm.)
In 1995, just 3 cases of CLA were reported in VIDA (VIDA 1995) [VIDA is the
computerised database of diagnoses at the various MAFF Veterinary
Investigation Centres (= diagnostic labs). MHJ}. However, in the pedigree
breeds in the UK the disease is "known to be widely spread in particular
breeds in different parts of the country" (anon). This appears to contradict
apparent levels of detection using VIDA statistics. Commercial farmers will
not usually seek a veterinary diagnosis for superficial abscesses in sheep
and abattoirs only record abscessation when carcase condemnation occurs.
This may be contributing to the under-reporting of the disease.
If the disease continues to spread, abattoirs slaughtering a high proportion
of cull ewes will be the first to notice an increase in abscessation. This
has already been noticed by one abattoir in the South-West (Rodgers 1997
personal comm.). In the future, abattoirs with a large throughput of
finished lambs will have to trim an increasing proportion of carcases. It
should be noted that in countries where the disease is endemic, abattoirs
and other associated industries have adjusted their payments to farmers to
take account of losses due to CLA and thus the cost is ultimately passed
back to the producer (Paton 1990).
Allowing this disease to become endemic without any attempts at control will
reduce the health of our national flock and is a serious breach of animal
welfare. Breeders, commercial flock owners and the veterinary profession
need to be aware of CLA; its clinical manifestations, its insidious effects
on flocks and its importance to the health and welfare of the UK sheep
flock. Its potential economic effects on the UK sheep and related industries
have not been fully realised.
