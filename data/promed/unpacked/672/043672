In a dual posting dated 24 Apr 2000 [Leishmaniasis, dogs - USA (02)
Ellicott McConnell and Randall Ruble commented on the risk of leishmaniasis
in Pennsylvanian dogs and the absence of sandflies from the continental
U.S., respectively. Randall admitted he was not an entomologist and then
said, "Best of luck trying to convince someone that something doesn't
exist. Much easier to create fear than to allay it."
Allow me to temporarily uncut the string, cut previously and a bit
prematurely by another Moderator, to comment. Instead of the excellent
references on parasitic diseases provided by Ruble, try:
DG Young and PV Perkins. 1984. Phlebotomine sand flies of North America
(Diptera: Psychodidae). Mosquito News 44: 263-304.
Whereas there may not be sandflies in Pennsylvania, they certainly occur in
Georgia (see work by Andy Comer and others on Ossabaw Island, in which
these dipterans were associated with transmission of vesicular stomatitis
viruses), Colorado (come visit, we'll show you), and Texas (Calisher, C.H.,
R.G. McLean, G.C. Smith, D.M. Szmyd, D.J. Muth, and J.S. Lazuick. Rio
Grande--a new phlebotomus fever group virus from south Texas. Am. J. Trop.
Med. Hyg. 26:997-1002, 1977).
Kerr et al. found a focus of _Leishmania mexicana_ involving _Neotoma
albigula_ (white-throated woodrats), near Tucson, Arizona (Am J Trop Med
Hyg 1999, 61:378).
So, the comment "Best of luck trying to convince someone that something
doesn't exist. Much easier to create fear than to allay it." should be
completely ignored.
