for publication 2 Sep 2001.
During the summer of 2000, severe stunting, mosaic, bud necrosis, and
chlorosis symptoms were observed on peanut (_Arachis hypogaea_ cv.
Gilan) growing in fields in the Golestan Province of Iran.
Leaf extracts of peanut plants were infective [following mechanical
inoculation of diagnostic test plants, causing necrotic local lesions
on _Chenopodium quinoa_, _C. amaranticolor_, Gomphrena globosa,
_Phaseolus vulgaris_ cv. Talash, _Vicia faba_, and _Vigna unguiculata_
cv. Mashad; systemic chlorotic spots ... followed by systemic necrosis
in _Datura stramonium_, _D. metel_, and _Nicotiana rustica_; [and
chlorotic and necrotic spots ... followed by top necrosis in _Glycine
max_. [Symptoms identical to those on infected peanut in the field
were obtained on experimentally inoculated Gilan peanut.
Tomato spotted wilt [tospovirus (TSWV) was detected by [DAS-ELISA in
the original peanut plants [and in symptomatic test plants ... using
TSWV-specific antisera (polyclonal antibody As-0526 and As-0580, DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany).
TSWV is one of the most [damaging plant viruses in the world (2) and
has been reported on potato (3) and tomato (1) in Iran.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of TSWV infection of peanut
in Iran.

[TSWV can cause significant losses in many different crops worldwide,
especially in peanut (groundnut). It was first reported in tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) in Australia in 1919. It infects a vast
number of plant species. TSWV is transmitted by thrips in a persistent
manner. It is likely worldwide in distribution and has been reported
to occur and spread in over 65 countries. Its detection in Iran was
inevitable.
TSWV is the type species in the genus Tospovirus; other members are
Groundnut bud necrosis virus, Groundnut ringspot virus, Groundnut
yellow spot virus, Impatiens necrotic spot virus, Tomato chlorotic
spot virus, Watermelon silver mottle virus, and Zucchini lethal
chlorosis virus.
