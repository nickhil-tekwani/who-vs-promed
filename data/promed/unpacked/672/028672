The European Union on Monday agreed to lift a worldwide export ban on the
vast majority of British beef. A majority of the 15 EU Farm Ministers
meeting here voted to scrap the ban on deboned beef despite continued
opposition from Germany, an official who demanded anonymity said. The
decision came a long way in ending the "mad cow" crisis for British
farmers, who were badly hit by the ban imposed in March 1996. Estimated
losses because of the ban amount to over 2 billion pounds (3.3 billion
dollars). The crisis undermined confidence in beef throughout the 15 member
nations.
Germany was the lone holdout to maintain the ban, with France, Spain,
Austria and Luxembourg abstained. The other farm ministers voted for. The
move to significantly ease the ban was boosted early this month when a
majority of veterinary experts endorsed the beef export plan. Now, the
issues goes back to the Commission, which will send inspector to Britain
for a final examination of safety standards, opening the way for exports
early in the new year.
Monday's decision will be immediately followed by a campaign to put British
beef back on the plates of consumers throughout the 15-nation EU. Beef
exports though will need a final stamp of approval.
