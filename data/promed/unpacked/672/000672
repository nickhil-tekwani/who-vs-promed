Assistant Director, Inspection & Quarantine, Agriculture, Fisheries
and Conservation Department, Cheung Sha Wan, Hong Kong, Hong Kong (PR
China)

Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Start date: 29 Dec 2009
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 31 Dec 2009
Report date: 5 Jan 2010
Date submitted to OIE: 5 Jan 2010
Date event resolved: 29 Dec 2009
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: April 2009
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Hok Tau, Hong Kong
Date of start of the outbreak: 29 Dec 2009
Outbreak status: resolved (29 Dec 2009)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Species: wild species
Susceptible: --
Cases: 1
Deaths: 1
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: an Oriental Magpie Robin (_Copsychus saularis_)
carcass was found in a country park located at Hok Tau. Oriental
Magpie Robin is a common and widespread resident in Hong Kong.

Outbreak statistics
Species: wild species
Apparent morbidity rate: **
Apparent mortality rate: **
Apparent case fatality rate: 100.00%
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: **
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: an intensive surveillance system is in place
on all poultry farms, poultry markets, pet bird shops, park birds, and
wild birds in Hong Kong. This H5N1 infected wild bird was detected in
our ongoing surveillance programme on wild birds. No spread of the
disease was evident. As this was a dead wild bird, the date of end of
the event is the same as the finding of the bird (29 Dec 2009).

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected
animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Laboratory name and type: Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture,
Fisheries and Conservation Department (national laboratory)
Species: wild species
Test: immunohistochemical test
Test date: 31 Dec 2009
Result: positive

Species: wild species
Test: polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Test date: 31 Dec 2009
Result: positive

Species: wild species
Test: virus isolation
Test date: 4 Jan 2010
Result: positive

Laboratory name and type Department of Microbiology, University of
Hong Kong (Regional Reference Laboratory)
Species: wild species
Test: gene sequencing
Test: date
Result: pending

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Any occurrence of H5N1 is, of course, taken seriously because of the
untoward history of the disease in the special administrative region
of Hong Kong. There have been massive culls of poultry in between 1997
and 2003 resulting in the loss of about 3 million birds. In 2009, 11
wild birds including a Crested Myna were found dead and infected with
H5N1. In 2006 and 2007, there were several songbirds infected with the
virus, including another Oriental Magpie Robin. In 2004, the death of
a peregrine falcon raised concerns about how widespread the disease
was in this part of Southeast Asia. In 2003, ducks, geese, swans, and
other waterbirds at the Penfold and Kowloon nature park experienced a
die-off. A Grey Heron was also found dead due to H5N1 in the New
Territories. The deaths in wild birds were associated with new genetic
strains of the virus, which have subsequently spread across the world.
Thus, the surveillance and monitoring of the situation is warranted
because small songbirds like these can be a bridge between waterfowl
and domestic poultry. If migratory birds are also infected, the ante
becomes quite a bit steeper. It is highly unlikely in this case that
we are looking a widespread geographical transmission of this virus as
there have been many cases of wild birds in Hong Kong dying and
causing no further geographical spread.
