Vietnam: Dengue Fever Cases Continue to Increase
------------------------------------------------
Vietnam reported 9300 dengue fever infected people and 22 deaths from the
disease in the first 6 months of 2003. The figures represent year-on-year
increases of 2.5 times in terms of infected cases and 5.5 times in terms of
fatalities, according to a report released by the Vietnamese Ministry of
Health on Tue 24 Jun 2003.
In June alone, the dengue fever epidemic involved 61 cities and provinces
of the country, causing 1258 cases and 3 deaths. The localities with the
highest numbers of infected people include Ho Chi Minh City and the
southern provinces of Tien Giang, Dong Thap, and Ben Tre.

India (Kerala): Dengue Fever and an Undefined Fever Prevalent in Bangalore
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever, which caused over a dozen deaths in the city during monsoon
in 2002, has surfaced again following the rains. BCC health authorities
have reported nearly 30 cases over the past 15 days. Some private
practitioners are also reporting, seeing an average of around 6 cases per
week during the same period. No casualties [fatalities?] have been
reported. The incidence seems to be largely from the western side of the
city; areas like West of Chord Road, Basaveshwaranagar. "Every day there
are 2 or 3 cases being reported," says BCC chief health officer Dr
Jayachandra Rao.
The BCC health office issued a notice on Monday, warning about the disease
and asking citizens to prevent water collection in open containers. "Yes,
the disease is back. But unlike last year when most cases were seen after
the rains began, this year we saw a few cases ahead of rain," says
consultant physician and expert on dengue, Dr S.V. Chowti. According to
him, one serious case has been reported so far while several cases, where
blood platelet counts have fallen, have been noticed.
An [undiagnosed] viral fever too is prevailing in the city resulting in
students and employees staying away from workplaces. "Nearly 50 percent of
our trainee nurses have come down with a fever and have been sent home to
Kerala [see the following post - Mod.CP]. We have been seeing 10 to 20
cases over the past 2 weeks," says Dr H. Paramesh, medical director of the
Lakeside Hospital. It starts with a sniffle and develops into a fever where
temperatures are in the range of 103 to 104 degrees Celsius for 2 to 3
days. The patient subsequently experiences extreme tiredness for a few
days, he said. According to Dr B.C. Rao, a general practitioner, this type
of viral fever is quite a common feature during this season and in late
winter in Bangalore. For those with the viral fever the doctors are
prescribing rest, plenty of fluids, warm clothing, and non-oily food.

India (Kerala): Dengue Fever and an Undefined Fever spreading in Kerala
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever and [an undiagnosed] viral fever are spreading in Kerala at an
alarming rate, creating panic, claiming 104 lives in the last 6 months.
Since the onset of the monsoon this month, 19 persons had lost their lives
due to dengue fever and 321 confirmed cases had been reported, Additional
Director (Health) P K Sivarajan stated on Wed 25 Jun 2003. The official
death figure due to dengue fever in Kerala during the last 6 months was 24,
he said. He said the death of a 9-year-old boy at the government run SAT
hospital here yesterday had been confirmed to be due to dengue.
Though fever cases had been reported from all over Kerala, the worst
affected districts were Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur,
Kozhikode, Kannur and Idukki districts, he said. Sivarajan said a massive
cleaning and awareness campaign had been launched all over the state, since
mosquitoes were the carriers of dengue fever virus. Panchayats would
initiate vector and rodent control programmes.

Philippines: Dengue Fever Widespread in the Cordilleras
-------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) in the region said that an average of 61
confirmed dengue cases in the Cordilleras are being reported everyday in
the local papers here. Health experts have renewed their appeal for the
public to be vigilant and for residents to clean their surroundings,
especially during the rainy season, when dengue cases are expected to rise.
This [became apparent] as Dr. Elnoria Bugnosen of the DOH reported that
dengue cases were highest in the city during the months of January and May
2003. "We already have a reported 22 cases in the 6 sentinel hospitals in
the city for the past 6 months," Bugnosen said. Bugnosen stressed that
dengue is a preventable disease.
Only last week, the DOH declared a dengue outbreak in Paracelis, Mt.
Province, following some 107 cases of dengue fever recorded from Jan to May
2003. Regional Director Teresita Bonoan said that an upsurge in dengue
cases reported in the area was noted last month with 51 outpatients and
admittances. Bugnosen said that a team from the Regional Epidemiology and
Surveillance Unit (RESU) was also dispatched to Paracelis in close
coordination with the Provincial Health Office and Mt. Province Provincial
Disaster Coordinating Council. No casualties [fatalities?] have been
reported so far, but some patients remain to be in critical condition,
reports added. The DOH has also coordinated with the different line
agencies to conduct fumigation operations in identified areas in the city
where dengue is most likely to start, especially in schools. In addition,
Bonoan has ordered a massive clean-up drive in barangays all over the
Cordilleras.
Mayor Bernardo Vergara has also ordered the Baguio Health Department to
closely monitor dengue cases in the city, especially in schools. The mayor
added that he would ask City Budget Office to allocate P1-million [USD 18
700] for the campaign against dengue. Dr. Florence Reyes, BHD head,
revealed that their office has already stocked up on medicines for dengue
and chemicals for fumigation.
The City Surveillance and Epidemiology Unit (CESU) of the BHD reported
earlier that there were 25 cases of dengue admissions during the first
quarter of this year as compared to only 7 cases reported in the same
period last year. Dr. Cecilia Brillantes, CESU chief, however, said that
their office is "still on top of the situation."

Taiwan on Dengue Fever Alert
----------------------------
In a bid to prevent another outbreak of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne
viral disease, the Kaohsiung City Government yesterday called in the
military to disinfect a part of the city that was seriously hit by the
disease last year. Dengue prevention and control has become a priority for
the city government, which is still feeling the pain from the fight against
SARS. The outbreak of dengue fever in 2002 marked the nation's worst since
World War II. More than 5000 cases of the disease were reported nationwide
-- 3212 of them in Kaohsiung, making it the worst-hit area in the country.
Health officials attributed the record-breaking outbreak last year to
changes in weather patterns, including higher temperatures. This year, the
government decided to take precautions before it was too late. Health
officials in Kaohsiung said the situation has been closely monitored since
early May 2003, when the rainy season began.
Yesterday morning, more than 100 soldiers wearing protective suits carried
out fumigation in the districts of Chienchen, Kushan, and Lingya, where
risk factors for dengue transmission could exist due to recent heavy rains.
The crews focused on vacant lots, parks, and areas around traditional
markets. In addition, pesticides were applied ditches to prevent mosquito
larvae from hatching. If it doesn't rain, environmental officials said, the
effectiveness of pesticides could last for up to 2 weeks.
The latest statistics suggest that the city has seen no new local
infections since 28 Jan 2003. However, on 14 May 2003, a case of an
imported infection was reported. Chang Feng-teng, head of Kaohsiung's
Environmental Protection Bureau, yesterday called for [better] cooperation
between the government and local residents. Meanwhile, the city's
neighboring jurisdictions -- including counties of Kaohsiung, Pingtung and
Tainan -- also raised the levels of dengue control and prevention.
Taiwan is one of the most-affected countries in the Asian Pacific region.
Since 8 Mar 2003, however, there has no new case of dengue reported in the
country. Last week, the Center for Disease Control reminded Taiwanese
visiting Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Australia about
the spread of dengue in those nations. According to the center, about 1800
cases were reported in Singapore in the first 5 months of 2003. In the
Philippines, the number of cases of dengue had exceeded 4000, including 54
deaths, in the same period. In Vietnam, about 8000 cases were reported
between January and May. In Malaysia, as of the middle of March, there had
been 3410 cases, including 11 deaths.
Dengue fever broke out in Taiwan island-wide in 1915, 1931, and 1942, when
it was a Japanese colony. After World War II, the disease did not reappear
until the early 1980s. Symptoms of the disease, which is seldom fatal, are
similar to a severe case of flu, but the more severe dengue hemorrhagic
fever is potentially fatal.
