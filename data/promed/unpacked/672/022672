Australian pig farm hit by "mysterious disease"
-----------------------------------------------
The Australian Workers' Union has praised a pig farm on the Victoria-New
South Wales border for its handling of a mysterious disease outbreak.

Scientists say the disease spontaneously appeared at QAF Meat Industries
farms at Corowa and Bangawana. An unknown number of fetuses and piglets
were killed, but the New South Wales acting deputy chief veterinarian says
the virus does not affect adult pigs or humans.

[Though a number of resources have been checked, further information
regarding this disease or reason for the deaths of piglets and fetuses has
not been found. It raises the suspicion of Porcine Multisystemic Wasting
Syndrome (PMWS) or perhaps Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome
(PRRS). If there is authoritative information, ProMED-mail would appreciate
receiving it. Â­ Mod.TG]

[How does he know it is a virus? QAF Meat Industries farm at
Corowa is a 1 million pig operation, Australia's largest:

Australia is free of the 2 diseases mentioned above, so a definitive
diagnosis of the cause of this outbreak is essential. - Mod.JW]
