There is growing fear among residents of Abakaliki, the Ebonyi state capital, following an outbreak of Lassa fever in the state. At least one medical doctor in the state was said to have been confirmed hospitalized yesterday [29 Oct 2013] as a result of the outbreak. The victim, according to reports, is believed to have contacted the illness after treating patients infected by it last week [week of 21 Oct 2013].

The state chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association, (NMA), Dr Chidi Esike, in a chat with a Leadership reporter, stated that the victim has been rushed to Eroghowa Hospital in Edo state for treatment. "One of our medical doctors, is affected. It is mostly likely that he must have caught the virus while treating victims of Lassa fever in the state. From the report we got, the medical doctor is now responding to treatment", Esike said.

The President of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), Dr Jibril Abdullahi Donald, according to media reports last weekend [26-27 Oct 2013] cited the outbreak of the disease in the state as part of the reasons for calling off the association's nationwide strike. He said, "We felt in the interest of what is happening in the country, namely: the outbreak of cholera in Lagos and Gusau; the outbreak of Lassa fever in Abakaliki, it was high time we soft-pedaled and allow dialogue to continue, hoping that the government will play its own role in ensuring our agreement is implemented."

An outbreak of Lassa fever was first reported in Ebonyi state in 2008 in which lives of some people including 2 medical doctors and other health workers were lost as a result. Also, in 2011, 4 persons said to be residing at the Military cantonment, Nkwagu near Abakaliki also died of the disease.

[There was an error in the previous posting (archive no 20131018.2009142) regarding the location of Abakaliki. Abakaliki is the capital city of the present-day Ebonyi State in southeastern Nigeria. Before the creation of Ebonyi State in 1996, Abakaliki was in Enugu province. Enugu was the capital of the then East Central State. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 percent.

The reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the "multimammate rat" of the genus _Mastomys_ (see photograph at http://ec.europa.eu/research/rtdinfo/special_inco/03/images/art07_02_3759.jpg). _Mastomys_ rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes.

All these factors together contribute to the relatively efficient spread of Lassa virus from infected rodents to humans. Lassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact. This type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of an individual infected with the Lassa virus. The virus cannot be spread through casual contact (including skin-to-skin contact without exchange of body fluids). Person-to-person transmission is common in both village and health care settings. - Mod.CP]
