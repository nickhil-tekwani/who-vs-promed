People who purchased raw whole milk from Pot 'O Gold Dairy Specialties in Bear Lake, Warren county are asked to throw it out after it was linked to cases of salmonellosis, the Pennsylvania Department of Health announced [Fri 12 Oct 2018].

Raw whole milk was sold from 10 Sep 2018 to the present in glass, half-gallon containers with the Pot O' Gold label at 16 stores in Crawford, Erie, McKean, Venango, and Warren counties.

So far 9 cases of salmonellosis have been reported. It causes diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. While most recover in 4 to 7 days, salmonellosis can be more serious in older adults, infants, and those with chronic illnesses. Anyone who consumed the milk and became ill should consult their physicians. This is reportedly only linked to the raw whole milk product.

- Crawford county:
Buck and Kathy, Titusville
D&J Bakery, Cambridge Springs
Miller's Country Store, Cochranton
- Erie county:
Corry Lumber, Corry

[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60%) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54%) involved cheese (42% made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 (46%) involved fluid milk (82% involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp were responsible for 54% of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22%), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13%), _Brucella_ spp (4%), _Listeria_ (4%), and _Shigella_ spp (3%).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14%), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL
