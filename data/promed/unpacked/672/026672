A comment to moderator MPP regarding the comment about hirsute
vaccinees shaving the vaccination site and surrounding area to permit
a protective dressing to adhere.
I would not recommend shaving the site, but rather clipping excess
hair. We know from studying surgical site infections that shaving the
skin increases the chance of infection. This could be a particular
issue with vaccinia, and we would not want to increase the chance of
satellite lesions.
The issue of what type of semipermeable membrane dressing works best
for healthcare providers is also an important one. This type of
dressing (e.g., OpSite or Tegaderm) must be worn by healthcare
providers when they are working in healthcare facilities.

Moderator MPP suggests shaving around the inoculation site to permit
adherence of the protective dressing. Shaving can produce
micro-lacerations and abrasions of the skin. Might these not offer
more portals of entry for the vaccinia virus?

As a recent vaccinee who shared the same problem with the physician
(and strikingly similar descriptors), I would like to point out that
shaving with a blade will cause microabrasions of the skin and may
increase the risk for satellite lesions. I used an electric trimmer
around the site to improve adherence, and have made recommendations
to several vaccination clinics to be prepared for this.

I would NOT shave but would clip [the excess hair] simply based on
surgical site infection data. I think the raw area from shaving would
potentially lead to contact transmission surrounding the vaccinia
inoculation site; and a potentially expanded site due to
contamination of the shaved area, might not remain within the
confines of a Tegaderm for health care workers.

[Many thanks to our subscribers for raising questions about the
moderator comment to consider shaving the vaccination site to improve
adhesion of protective dressings following smallpox vaccination. The
above comments led me to do further research on the topic of current
recommendations for smallpox vaccination site preparation and care,
the issue of shaving surgical sites, and the association of
perioperative wounds at the surgical wound site. With respect to the
last issue, the literature clearly supports NOT shaving a surgical
wound site, as the microabrasions associated with the process of
shaving are a risk factor for increased wound infections (see refs
below). Thus, as pointed out by some of our subscribers, the
theoretical risk of satellite lesions from inoculation of the
microabrasions is of sufficient concern to warrant NOT shaving the
site prior to vaccination.
With respect to current recommendations for smallpox vaccination (as
published in: Wharton M, Strikas RA, Harpaz R, Rotz LD, Schwartz B,
Casey CG, Pearson ML, Anderson LJ. Recommendations for Using Smallpox
Vaccine in a Pre-Event Vaccination Program -- Supplemental
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory
Committee (HICPAC) MMWR, 26 Feb 2003/52 (Dispatch); 1-16), the
recommendations state:
"Optimal infection-control practices and appropriate site care should
prevent transmission of vaccinia virus from vaccinated health-care
workers to patients. Health-care personnel providing direct patient
care should keep their vaccination sites covered with gauze in
combination with a semipermeable membrane dressing to absorb exudates
and to provide a barrier for containment of vaccinia virus to
minimize the risk of transmission; the dressing should also be
covered by a layer of clothing. Dressings used to cover the site
should be changed frequently to prevent accumulation of exudates and
consequent maceration. The most critical measure in preventing
contact transmission is consistent hand hygiene. Hospitals should
designate staff to assess dressings for all vaccinated health-care
workers. When feasible, staff responsible for dressing changes for
smallpox health-care teams should be vaccinated; all persons handling
dressings should observe contact precautions. Administrative leave is
not required routinely for newly vaccinated health-care personnel,
unless they are physically unable to work as a result of systemic
signs and symptoms of illness; have extensive skin lesions that
cannot be adequately covered; or if they are unable to adhere to the
recommended infection-control precautions. Persons outside the
patient-care setting can keep their vaccination sites covered with a
porous dressing; hand hygiene remains key to preventing inadvertent
inoculation."
There is no mention of hair removal around the vaccination site
(either clipping or shaving) to facilitate barrier dressing adhesion.
Given this, it seems as though the most appropriate interpretation of
this situation would be found in the section related to indications
for administrative leave "...if they are unable to adhere to the
recommended infection-control precautions."
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/m2d226.htm>
In any event, the failure of the protective dressing to adhere should
be of significant concern to health care workers in contact with
patients who may have increased risk factors for severe disease,
above and beyond the general concerns about contact with others and
the possibility of contact vaccinial infection.
