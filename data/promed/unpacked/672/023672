Tony Frank's dogs are being called heroes after they stopped a
suspected rabid raccoon. "We had the dogs out after dinner for their
romp around," said Frank. "At some point, the neighbors' dog chased
the raccoon across the street into our yard and my dogs attacked it."

Frank's dogs Molly and Frank killed the raccoon. Franks then called
Cherokee County Animal Control. It picked up the raccoon and turned
it over to the county's Environmental Health Department which tested
the animal for rabies and discovered it was in fact rabid, the 3rd
such case in North Georgia in the last few weeks. Fortunately, Franks
said he knew what to do.

[This brief article deserves comments now rather than at the end of
the posting. This article does not tell us if the dogs were
vaccinated, or what the authorities did as far as quarantining the
dogs. Unvaccinated dogs with direct contact of a rabid animal are
generally euthanized as they represent a direct hazard to their
owners. We hope Frank's dogs were vaccinated. - Mod.TG]

After a Rock Hill man was exposed to rabies, health professionals at
DHEC are urging pet owners make sure that their animals are
vaccinated against the disease.

In a news release from the Department of Health and Environmental
Control (DHEC), officials said the man was exposed to rabies when he
was attacked by a raccoon as he tried to remove it from a trap. Sue
Ferguson with DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health said that the man
is receiving preventive inoculations, because the disease is fatal to
humans and animals once it reaches the brain.

"Anyone bitten, scratched or otherwise exposed to the saliva of a
rabid animal must undergo immediate measures to stop the virus from
reaching the brain," Ferguson said. She said for residents to "avoid
wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild."

Ferguson said that each year, about 400 Palmetto State residents are
required to have preventive treatment for rabies. Most exposures come
from being bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, she says.
Typically, wild animals carry the disease, but domesticated animals
can still contract it.

"Residents should make sure their pets are regularly vaccinated
against the disease. State law requires that all pets be vaccinated
against rabies," Ferguson said.

[4] 50 North Carolina church goes exposed to rabies

Close to 50 members of a Thomasville church are getting rabies shots
after they were exposed to bats on a mission trip.

The group from Memorial United Methodist includes 34 teenagers. They
spent the past week doing home repairs for underprivileged families
in Virginia. While on the trip, they stayed in an old elementary
school. Church leaders say bats had somehow gotten inside the building.

"It's just part of being in rural America, so there's really not a
lot to talk about," said Chris McCullough, leader of the mission group.

Everyone on the trip is getting a series of 4 rabies shots. Davidson
County health officials say while no one was bitten, it is very
important to seek treatment because the majority of human rabies
cases are from bat exposure.

Health officials in Ocean City said they've confirmed that a cat
found in West Ocean City has tested positive for rabies. The female
cat and a kitten were found in the 11 800 block of Ocean Gateway
(Route 50) near the Ocean City Animal Hospital and the WACS Center on
Tuesday [6 Jul 2010] night.

Authorities said the cat had a white underside with black and orange
markings down the head, back and tail. The kitten, about 8 weeks old,
was solid black except for a small white spot on its neck.

Police said the adult cat was tested Wednesday [7 Jul 2010] because
of its unusual behavior and tested positive on Thursday. The kitten
is still being tested.

Anyone who may have come in contact with either animal should contact
the Worcester County Health Department at 410-632-1100 and select option No. 8.

[6] Family in Nebraska exposed to rabid skunk

A domestic cat contracted rabies while defending kittens from a
skunk, forcing a Saline County family of 3 to get precautionary
immunization shots.

The skunk attacked the mother cat, and saliva was probably exchanged
or got into an open wound, according to health officials. Tuesday [6
Jul 2010], the cat started exhibiting neurological symptoms
associated with rabies, including sleepiness, fever, lack of
coordination and aggressiveness. Jane Ford of the district health
department said the kittens will be put to sleep because they are
likely infected with rabies.

There have been 31 animal cases of rabies in Nebraska so far this
year [2010], but that number may rise, according to health officials.

Animals looking to re-establish or aggressively defend their
territory after flood waters recede may contract the deadly but
preventable disease from other animals during fights. So far, most
cases are in skunks, but rabies has also infected a cow, bat and a
few dogs in the state.

Several people and a dog were exposed to a stray cat that was
reported to officials on 7 Jul 2010, according to the Norfolk
Department of Public Health. The orange, short-haired adult cat was
found in the 3200 block of Vimy Ridge Avenue.

Residents who may have come into contact with 2 rabid animals in
Norfolk and Newport News are being asked to contact health officials.

The cat was known to come into contact with people and other animals
on Vimy Ridge, West Tanners Creek Drive, Bapaume Avenue and Dunkirk
Avenue, a news release says. Health officials have begun treating the
people who have reported being in contact with the cat, the release
says. Without treatment, the disease can be fatal.

Officials are reminding residents to vaccinate their pets against
rabies and to keep them confined to their home or yard. Keep yards
free of food that could attract animals, and avoid contact with wild
animals. Report animal bites or scratches to health officials.

A Gold Hill woman's dog was to be euthanized after killing a rabid
fox this week, Rowan County Animal Control said.

The incident marks Rowan County's 9th rabies case of the year [2010].

Angela Fesperman, of Old U.S. 80, reported that her dog, a male lab
mix named Jake, had killed a baby fox. The dog was not current on its
rabies shots and was placed in quarantine at the Rowan County Animal
Shelter while the fox was tested for rabies.

Animal Control learned Tuesday [6 Jul 2010] the fox had tested
positive for rabies. The dog was to be euthanized at the owner's
request, Animal Control said.

This marks the 3rd rabies case involving a fox this year [2010],
according to Animal Control. Four of the cases involved raccoons, and
2 involved skunks.

[Each state has its own rabies regulations. However, it is general
practice that any unvaccinated animal encountering a rabid animal
will be euthanized, as the unvaccinated pet represents a potential
exposure to rabies to the owner. This loss of life can be prevented
by vaccination against rabies.

These reports emphasize that urban as well as rural animals are at
risk of encountering a rabid animal.

People who are bitten or scratched need to seek immediate medical
care for treatment of the injury and for post exposure prophylaxis
against rabies. - Mod.TG]
