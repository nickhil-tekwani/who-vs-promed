Suspected hemorrhagic fever in Germany
--------------------------------------
WHO has been informed that one man has been admitted to hospital in Berlin
suffering from suspected hemorrhagic fever. He had recently returned from
a trip to Cote d'Ivoire, where he had visited remote rural areas.
Diagnostic tests are being conducted in a German laboratory for a range of
viral hemorrhagic fevers and other relevant pathogens. WHO is in contact
with the German Ministry of Health and the WHO Representative in Cote
d'Ivoire.

[Readers will remember the single case of Ebola which was confirmed in Dec
1995 in Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa (refs. above). The patient survived. A
hunt for the reservoir was launched in 1996 after a Red Colobus monkey was
found dead in the Tai Forest there. The other hemorrhagic fever which is
endemic there is, of course, yellow fever. Lassa fever is endemic in
Guinea & Sierra Leone, which border Cote d'Ivoire to the west - Mod.JW
