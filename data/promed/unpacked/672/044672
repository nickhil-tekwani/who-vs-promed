Genetic Characterization of the 2003 Human Isolate of H5N1 Influenza Virus
--------------------------------------------------
The new avian influenza virus that has killed at least one person in South
China is genetically different from the avian influenza virus strain that
infected 18 people in Hong Kong and killed 6 of them in 1997. Like the 1997
virus, the new strain does not appear to contain sequences from human flu
viruses that would speed its spread from person to person, lessening fears
that a lethal pandemic flu may be imminent.
Malik Peiris, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong who is
studying the new virus, told "The Scientist" that the avian influenza virus
strain from the 9-year-old boy is completely sequenced. The 6 internal
genes of the virus, as well as the neuraminidase gene, are derived from a
different genetic lineage from that of the 1997 virus. Only the
haemagglutinin derives from the same lineage as 1997. "In addition, we also
can establish that the virus has not acquired any human influenza internal
genes," said Pieris.
Although similar, this year's hemagglutinin gene "has undergone change, so
that the 1997 and 2003 viruses, while related, can be distinguished
serologically. In addition to being antigenically different the 2003 virus
appears to be more pathogenic for ducks than its predecessor," Ian Gust
told The Scientist. "The factors which control infectivity seem to lie on
genes other than those coding for the H5 and N1 surface proteins." Gust, at
the University of Melbourne in Australia, is collaborating with the WHO
influenza research team.
Peiris says he is reassured by the fact that the bird virus has not
reassorted with a human influenza virus, which probably hampers its ability
to infect people. "However, it is not possible to say with certainty that
this virus will not transmit human to human, purely from genetic data. The
epidemiological data is important. The key will be to enhance surveillance
in humans to ascertain whether there are further human cases. So far, there
are none."
Although the Hong Kong death occurred less than 2 weeks ago, researchers
were able to move quickly with genetic studies because they set up an early
warning system after the 1997 outbreak and had already been studying the
recent infections in Hong Kong birds. "The precursors of these viruses are
all over Asia. It's not as though this thing came out of left field again.
We've been waiting to see when it would happen," said Robert Webster, of
St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.
