Agriculture: Focus on North China, Northeast pig disease
--------------------------------------------------------
"Grass root" information indicated that in the last few days, disease
among pigs continues to spread in the North and Northeast. Some pig
farmers indicated that the mortality rate is very high. At the same
time, some of the mid-size to large-size pig farms with better
disease prevention also have been affected. As pigs die off rapidly,
pig farmers are selling the sick or dead pigs cheaply in city and
village markets and black markets. The illegal sales have resulted in
high profits for those who sell illegally. The number of piglets and
sows have dropped. The recent drop in pork price will surely be
followed by a sharp rise soon. This outbreak is caused by multiple
viruses, like the outbreak in 2006. Currently, control measures have
not been able to contain the disease. In the North and Northeast, the
magnitude of the outbreak has been about 2 times than what was seen
in 2006. Unlike the outbreaks in Hunan and Anhui in fall this year
when early intervention effectively control!
led the outbreaks, control measures have not worked here.

Outbreak of blue-eared pig disease in parts of China
-----------------------------------------------------
China's agriculture ministry has announced that an epidemic of swine
disease that killed more than 80 000 pigs in 2007 has emerged in
parts of the country. An outbreak of pathogenic blue-eared pig
disease, also known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome,
has appeared in 5 areas of China, the Ministry of Agriculture said in
a statement posted on the central government website. But the overall
swine disease situation in China was stable, the ministry said on
Friday [23 Oct 2009], compared with 2007, when blue-eared pig illness
killed over 80 000 pigs, led to the culling of 235 000 others and set
pork prices rocketing. "So far this year, the overall swine disease
situation in China remains stable, and in particular, the scope of
highly pathogenic blue-eared pig disease has significantly shrunk,"
the statement said. Until 20 Oct 2009, just under 3300 pigs had died
from the disease and 7724 had been culled.

[Both above sources indicate that the disease involved is porcine
reproductive & respiratory syndrome (PRRS) which has caused serious
losses to the Chinese pig industry in 2006/7, penetrating Viet Nam as
well. Its current severity, however, seems to vary between the 2 sources.

On 22 Jul 2009, China submitted a "final report" on PRRS to the OIE,
stating the following: "The event is unlikely to be contained and is
now considered to be endemic. No more follow-up reports will be made,
but instead, information about this disease will be included in the
future 6-monthly reports".

According to the 2 6-monthly reports, submitted by China during 2008,
a total of 91 outbreaks of PRRS were recorded during 2008 in the
following 13 provinces (in brackets, number of outbreaks): Chongking
(18), Anhui (1), Guangdong (27), Guangxi (15), Guizhou (1), Hebei
(2), Henan (1), Hubei (2), Hunan (5), Jiangxi (13), Ningxia (4),
Shanghai (1), Sichuan (1).

The notification, and a map showing outbreaks reported during 2007,
is available at
