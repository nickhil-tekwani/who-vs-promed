Deadly malaria infects half a billion
----------------------------------------------
More than half a billion people -- nearly double previous estimates -- were
infected by the deadliest form of malaria in 2002, scientists reveal in a
report out today. They calculate that one in 3 in the world -- a total of
2.2 billion people -- are at risk from the mosquito-borne parasite
_Plasmodium falciparum_.
The discovery that malaria is far more prevalent than anyone had realised
is a jolt to public health chiefs the world over. The disease claims 1
million lives a year in sub-Saharan Africa alone, most of them children
under 5 years old. Of the 4 malaria parasites, _Plasmodium falciparum_ is
by far the most dangerous, especially to the undernourished, weak or very
young. It is prevalent throughout the tropics, and has developed resistance
to successive drugs.
Health experts said the new figures were alarming. "There is much more
malaria than has previously been estimated in Asia, than we recognised
before," said Joe Lines of London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
In 1998 the World Health Organisation put the global incidence of malaria
at 273 million cases. But that was an estimate, with no reliable data
available.
New research published in Nature from Bob Snow, of the Kenya Medical
Research Institute in Nairobi, and the Centre for Tropical Medicine at the
University of Oxford, calculates that in 2002 there were around 515 million
cases worldwide. In Africa in that year, there were 365 million cases: 1
million new infections every day.
"This is _Plasmodium falciparum_, the most deadly of the malaria
parasites," Prof Snow said. "We have worked very hard to get the credible
estimate for deaths from malaria in Africa that is largely used by the WHO:
it is about a million people each year. Outside Africa, we know
surprisingly little."
Control depends on safe water, efficient public health measures, education,
supplies of up-to-date drugs and bednets to protect against the
parasite-carrying mosquito. There is hope: geneticists have unravelled the
DNA of both mosquito and parasite, and have begun to look for weak spots
that could lead to weapons [against disease]. A new vaccine tested on more
than 2000 children in Mozambique during 2004 offered at least partial
protection against the disease, and confirmed that an effective vaccine is
at least feasible.
In January 2005, the British government, the US billionaire Bill Gates and
the Norwegian government promised more than 1.5 billion pounds [USD 2.88
billion] for new vaccines against childhood diseases, including malaria.
But malaria is both a disease of poverty and a cause of poverty; sick
people cannot work. Africa is already hit by a high incidence of HIV
infection and tuberculosis, and malaria alone is estimated to cost the
economy of the continent USD 12 billion (GBP 6.3 billion) a year. But that
too could be an underestimate.

[It is welcome to have a sound estimate of malaria morbidity and mortality.
Health statistics of notified cases have little meaning in resource-poor
areas, especially tropical Africa, where diagnostics are lacking and
notifications consequently of little meaning. In highly endemic areas with
high inoculation rates, populations are constantly infected, especially as
immunity is not sterile, so adults often have low-level parasitemia without
having malarial disease.
The statement that malaria is a disease of poverty and further contributes
to loss of life and productivity is well-taken, and the present data
provide fresh evidence that malaria is still a huge problem and that
progress in control has been slow over the past decades, especially in
tropical Africa and parts of Asia. - Mod.EP]
