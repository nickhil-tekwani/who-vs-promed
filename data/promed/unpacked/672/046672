Japanese encephalitis claimed 15 more lives in northern
India, as a health official on Sunday expressed surprise
that the recent outbreak -- which had appeared to be fading
-- was spreading again.
The outbreak has killed 1038 people, mostly children, in the
impoverished northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,
according to government figures. About 300 deaths have also
been reported in neighboring Nepal.
The disease is easily preventable by vaccinations, but many
medical facilities in the area are underfunded and
understaffed.
"Cases are now being reported from newer areas," said O. P.
Singh, Uttar Pradesh director general of health services.
Reported cases of the mosquitoborne illness had been
dropping with the end of the rainy season -- when there [was
no] more water for mosquitoes to breed in -- and officials
had thought it was coming under control.
"It is baffling, as new cases are being reported from
western part of the state (Uttar Pradesh)," Singh said,
adding that a team of specialists has been sent to the area
to study the problem.
Japanese encephalitis breaks out every year in eastern Uttar
Pradesh. This year has been exceptionally rainy, leaving
many pools of water and providing the perfect breeding
grounds for the mosquitoes that spread the incurable
disease.
Symptoms include blinding headaches, seizures, nausea, and
high fever. The disease is sometimes fatal.
Uttar Pradesh medical health facilities are severely
underfunded and understaffed, with the government claiming
it could not afford to provide vaccinations.
