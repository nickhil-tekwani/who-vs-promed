It was controlled by stamping out (killing 33 006 birds ) and declared as resolved on 13 Feb 2013. Earlier during 2012, 11 other outbreaks were reported in 2 clusters. One of them, similar to the current outbreak, in the north east; see summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012270_20120831_150429.pdf.
