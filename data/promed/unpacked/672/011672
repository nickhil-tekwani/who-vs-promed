[In response to ProMED-mail's RFI in posting 20160519.4229594:]

The annual festival of "Sajan Sawai" has been celebrated from 22-24 Apr near Saeed pur (8 kilometers [about 5 miles] from Tehsil Talhar, district Badin, Sindh [province]). Camels from most areas of Pakistan were brought here 4 days before this festival. Camel herders from Sindh say that the camels from Cholistan (Punjab province) area were suffering from flu-like disease.

After investigation it was observed that affected camels were suffering from mild cough, watery eyes, dyspnoea and muco purulent nasal discharges, high-grade fever of 105-108 F [40.5-42.2 C]. The morbidity rate was reportedly 20-30 percent; mortality, 2 percent.

[The currently available laboratory results include] _S. [Staphylococcus] aureus_, _E. coli_ and _S. [Streptococcus] pneumoniae_ isolates. No virus isolated yet, and no transmission to human reported.

The disease affected a huge area of Sindh province desert areas, coastal areas and arid zones.

[The media report, included in posting 20160519.4229594 is available at http://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/money-matters/120156-A-sinking-ship. It informed that "reports in local Sindhi press reveal that at least 22 camels have so far died in different villages in Kachho and other areas." No clinical observations nor pathological changes were included, leading to ProMED-mail's RFI.

Pakistan's dromedary camel population is estimated at 1 million (2014 OIE figures), ranked 6th after Somali (about 7 million), Sudan (4.8 million), Kenya (3 million, 2014), Ethiopia (2.5 million, 2014) and Mauritania (1.3 million, 2005). The total world population is estimated at 20-25 million.

We are grateful for the above information, kindly provided by an EpiCore member, and anticipate further findings, in particular gross pathology, histology and virological test results, which should include the viruses of PPR (peste des petits ruminants), influenza, IBR (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis), EHV (equine herpes virus) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). For further background on the said candidate agents, subscribers are referred to the commentary in the mentioned posting. - Mod.AS
