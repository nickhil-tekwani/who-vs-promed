An unusual amount of dead sharks have been washing up on north Oregon
coast beaches in the last few weeks. Most have appeared in a stretch
roughly 40 miles long, from Rockaway Beach to Fort Stevens, although
one showed up on the southern Washington coast.
Staff at the Seaside Aquarium have been keeping track of the reports
and taking the carcasses in; one appeared to be still alive when it
initially washed up.
Tiffany Boothe, education specialist at the aquarium, said 4 salmon
sharks and 4 soupfin sharks washed up in an approximate 4-week
period, from 22 Jul to 22 Aug 2007.
"It's the most we've ever seen in such a short period of time,"
Boothe said. "Usually, when they die, they sink to the bottom. But
the dead ones have been washing up on the beaches."
Why or how so many have been showing up on shore is a mystery, but
Boothe and others at the aquarium believe it probably has to do with
warmer waters this year [2007] bringing in more tuna. That, in turn,
will attract more fish-eaters.
"These sharks are fish-eaters," Boothe said. "We've had warmer waters
this year [2007], warmer than usual. I don't know if it's global
warming or not, but it's probably just because we've had nothing but
south winds, and the south winds warm things up. The tuna are
probably coming in because of that. They're about a mile offshore,
but that brings in the fish-eaters."
Boothe also thinks it's possible the shark carcasses are the result
of fishermen accidentally snagging them. "They could be by-catch,"
she said. "They get caught in their nets, and the fishermen throw
them over. They don't survive that because sharks are really quite sensitive."
Near the end of July 2007, the much-publicized salmon shark that
washed up in Rockaway Beach was next. Boothe wasn't totally convinced
that was a salmon shark, however. After seeing video footage of it,
she said it looked more like a Great White. "The snout looked all
wrong," she said. "And it was really big. I've never seen a big
salmon shark in person, and I didn't see this one in person. So I
can't say for sure. But to me it looks more like it was a Great White."
Cannon Beach video correspondent Dave Pastor took that footage, which
was aired all over Portland TV stations. Neither he nor the aquarium
know what happened to it after it washed up on Sunset Beach.
Another salmon shark washed up on Arch Cape on 6 Aug 2007, apparently
still alive for a small period of time. "It was about 4-5 feet long,
and they found it in a pool of blood," Boothe said. "It was alive
when it was 1st reported but it later disappeared. We don't know if
someone took it or if it washed back into the ocean."
On 15 Aug 2007, a soupfin washed up in Fort Stevens State Park, just
south of Astoria. On 18 Aug 2007, another dead soupfin showed up on a
beach somewhere north of Gearhart. Aquarium staff weren't sure as to
the exact location, as they never actually dealt with it themselves
and only recorded the report.
21 and 22 Aug 2007 saw a different salmon shark on both days washing
up at the Tolovana Beach area of Cannon Beach.
Possible sightings of sharks in Rockaway Beach led to a posted
warning earlier this month [August 2007], although this was unrelated
to the dead sharks washing ashore.
On 23 Aug 2007, a soupfin shark drifted in around Beard's Hollow on
the Washington coast.
Three of the sharks have wound up in a freezer at the aquarium,
awaiting donation to local schools for science labs.
"We've been really busy this summer [2007], and these are not our top
priority," Boothe said. "So we don't always get out and collect them."
Boothe said salmon sharks are related to Mako sharks and Great
Whites, and they are presumed to be only fish-eaters. "There's never
been any documentation of them biting a human," she said.
Boothe theorized the north Oregon coast could be experiencing the
same problem as central California's coast, where lots of dead sharks
have shown up.
"Scientists there have collected nearly a dozen dead juvenile salmon
sharks in the past month," [August 2007] she said. "Stanford
University and Long Marine Lab at UC Santa Cruz have performed
necropsies on the sharks they collected. Their findings were
puzzling. All of the sharks had a brain infection caused by a
bacterial disease called encephalitis, though they don't know the
source of the bacteria. They're not sure if they caught it somehow or
the bacteria were already in their systems."
Boothe said soupfin sharks can be found in temperate and subtropical
seas in the eastern Pacific, from Canada to Baja [Baja California,
Mexico]. "They are a highly migratory species with small schools
migrating toward the poles in the summer and then back toward the
equator in the winter," she said. "Soupfins can be found in the surf
or at depths over 1700 feet. Feeding on a variety of fish, the
soupfin sharks are not considered a threat to humans. They are highly
prized for their fins, which are the main ingredient in shark fin soup."

We hope that appropriate samples were taken and sent to a diagnostic
laboratory. - Mod.TG]

Mote that only the California sharks so far have been definitely
diagnosed with bacterial encephalitis.
We never did hear the final diagnosis of the cause of death of the
Florida sharks in the ProMED post listed below. If any reader can
help, please contact us. - Mod.JW]
