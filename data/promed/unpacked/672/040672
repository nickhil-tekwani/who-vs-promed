Health officials say people not washing their hands properly are contributing to an outbreak of hepatitis A in Ashburton. The Canterbury town has had 11 confirmed cases of hepatitis A, including 4 children aged under 5 years in the past 4 weeks. About 300 adults and children have now been vaccinated at 3 public health clinics.

Canterbury medical officer of health Ramon Pink says hand washing is key to preventing the spread of the disease. Washing and drying hands thoroughly after toileting, changing nappies and before preparing food are crucial. Dr Pink says the spread of other illnesses, such as whooping cough and the flu, are also reduced by thorough hand washing.

Hepatitis A symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin (jaundice), a lack of energy, no appetite, stomach upset and pain, fever, and general aches and pains. Anyone with a confirmed case of hepatitis A needs to stay away from work, school or early childhood centres until they are well and it has been at least 7 days after the onset of symptoms. People with hepatitis A should not prepare meals for others while infectious.

[Outbreaks of hepatitis A virus infection have been frequent in New Zealand. According to the GIDEON database (see: Hepatitis A - New Zealand: background 20060407.1048), 27.9 percent of adults in Christchurch were seropositive for hepatitis A virus infection in a recent seroprevalence survey.

Ashburton is a large town in the Canterbury Region on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located 85 km (53 mile) southwest of Christchurch and is sometimes regarded as a satellite town of Christchurch. Ashburton township has a population of 18 300, with an additional 12 400 living in the wider district. The town is the 3rd-largest urban area in the Canterbury Region, after Christchurch and Timaru.
