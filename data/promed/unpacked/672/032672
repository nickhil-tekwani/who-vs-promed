Avian flu cases and human to human transmission in St Petersburg denied
--------------------------------------------------
Experts at the State Epidemiological Surveillance Centre in St Petersburg
were unable to confirm the reported occurrence of 2 cases of person to
person transmission of an avian influenza virus in the city in 2004, as
reported yesterday by the Fontanka internet newspaper. No such cases have
been registered in the city.

[ProMED-mail regrets propagation of this erroneous report. The moderator's
comment to the preceding post also contained an inadvertent error. "H5N1"
in the sentence "The evidence for person-to person transmission of H5N5
avian influenza virus during the extensive outbreaks of avian influenza in
East Asia in 2004 is sparse" should have been "H5N1". The moderator
apologizes for this error. - Mod.CP]
