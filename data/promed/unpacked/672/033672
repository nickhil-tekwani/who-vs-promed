Health officials say at least 9 people have reported illnesses suspected to be salmonellosis after attending a recent local church barbecue that attracts about 5000 people each year. Sandy Plains Baptist Church in Shelby has hosted its barbecue fundraiser for about 50 years, Pastor Garin Hill said.

This year's event was Sat 7 Sep 2013, and people started reporting illnesses in relation to the barbecue Tue 10 Sep 2013, according to a Cleveland County Health Department news release. 6 Cleveland County residents and 3 Rutherford County residents have reported illnesses, and 5 people have been hospitalized, according to health officials.

"We don't know yet how the people got sick," said DeShay Oliver, coordinator of health services for the health department. "All of the illnesses have the common link of the barbecue fundraiser." The health department visited Sandy Plains Baptist Church to see how the food was processed, Hill said. "We hate to hear that anyone has gotten sick," Hill said. "The health department said we were following FDA standards as far as temperatures go, so we are still trying to figure out what happened."
