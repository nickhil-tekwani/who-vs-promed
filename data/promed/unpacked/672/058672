2348 New Cases of Foot-and-Mouth Detected
------------------------------------------
The Department of Livestock and Veterinary Services has detected about 2348
new cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Masvingo and Manicaland
Provinces, amid fears that the department has insufficient vaccines to
fight the outbreak, it was learnt this week.
In its monthly report, the department said in Zaka district, 38 new cases
of FMD had been reported at Svuvure, Mandoro, Zaka, Pangani, Nhema, and
Masavara dip tanks.

"In Mwenezi district, 151 cases were seen at Nuanetsi Ranch," the report
said. "In Chiredzi district, the disease is reported to have spread to all
parts of Sangwe communal area, where a total of 2159 cases were seen.
"In Manicaland, the disease has spread into Mutare district, where new
cases were at Muromo, Chipendeke, and Dzobo dip tanks."
The department said vaccinations were ongoing in Manicaland and Masvingo
province, where, at the time the report was compiled in January 2003, the
first booster vaccinations were being administered.
"Vaccine stocks on hand in both provinces are inadequate to complete the
exercise and more vaccine is required," the department said in its
report. It added: "Matabele- land North and South provinces are still
awaiting for vaccine for the second booster, which is long overdue in all
provinces."
The shortage of vaccines, partly the result of Zimbabwe's severe foreign
currency crisis, has prompted the South African meat industry to lobby its
government to provide financial assistance to Harare to fight FMD.
Fears that outbreak of the disease in Zimbabwe and Botswana could
contaminate regional animals has also resulted in South Africa banning the
importation of meat from Botswana and animal hides from Zimbabwe.
Meanwhile, the Department of Veterinary Services said there was some
improvement around the country in grazing areas affected by drought, except
in Matabeleland South and some parts of Masvingo, where livestock deaths
continued. More than 4000 cattle have died because of drought in
Matabeleland South alone.
The Department of Veterinary Services said it had received no reports of
illegal cattle movements in January 2003, attributing this to the large
fines being levied against offenders.
The department said in its report: "There has been a dramatic increase in
the level of fines for illegal movement of livestock, especially from the
FMD declared areas.
"This should act as a deterrent, especially for the person moving
truckloads of cattle."
