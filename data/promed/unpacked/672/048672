New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Runnymede, Surrey, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Nov 2020
Ended on: 12 Feb 2021
Epidemiological unit: not applied
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered-Killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Gray seal (_Halichoerus grypus_): Phocidae-Carnivora / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0
Harbor seal (_Phoca vitulina_): Phocidae-Carnivora / - / 4 / 1 / 3 / 0 / 0
Red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_): Canidae-Carnivora / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: carcasses of 4 common seals, one grey seal, and one red fox submitted to APHA [Animal and Plant Health Agency] laboratory during December 2020 for diagnostic PME [post mortem examination] as part of routine wildlife disease surveillance activities. 2 of the common seal carcasses were autolyzed so were safely disposed of without PME. Following histopathological examination of tissues from the fox and seals identified lesions indicative of acute systemic viral infection, further laboratory testing was performed at APHA. This testing resulted in the detection of H5N8 influenza virus infection. Gene sequencing identified this H5N8 influenza virus to be [99.9%] identical to avian-origin H5N8 viruses detected from the mute swans that had died and been tested from this wildlife rescue centre. In November 2020, 5 wild mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) that had been rescued and taken to a wildlife rescue centre died, were tested and found to be infected with H5N8 HPAI. Retrospective investigation of the deaths of 5 seals -- 4 common seals (_Phoca vitulina_) and one grey seal (_Halichoerus grypus_) -- and one red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) approximately one week later at the same wildlife rescue centre resulted in the finding of H5N8 influenza virus infection. These were all wild animals temporarily located at the wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre. Comorbidities were not investigated, and it is possible that other factors may have influenced disease severity. Infection of mammalian species is a rare event, with no prior authenticated cases of H5N8 infection in foxes. All laboratory investigations and testing were performed at APHA. Test results confirm both the H5N8 influenza virus being of avian origin and the source hypothesis as the mute swans at the rescue centre that were also H5N8 positive. There was no evidence of spread of infection from the wildlife rescue centre.

Control measures applied in wild: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; disinfection

The report from the UK is the 1st documentation of a spillover of HPAI H5N8 to wild carnivores. Recently, HPAI H5N8 infections were reported in humans in Russia (see ProMED post 20210221.8204014).

Several subtypes of AI viruses (H7N7, H4N5, H4N6, H3N3, and H10N7) have caused epidemics in harbour seals, but they do not appear to become established in this carnivore species. HPAI H5N8 was detected in 2 gray seals stranded on the Baltic coast of Poland in 2016 and 2017 (https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2512.181472). Red foxes have been shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1. - Mod.PMB]
