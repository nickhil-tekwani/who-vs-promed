Blood samples from patients in Colombo, Hambanthota, and Kalmunai
have shown positive for Chikungunya viral fever in tests which were
conducted by a team of doctors in the Molecular Medicine Unit in the
Faculty of Medicine of the Kelaniya University last week raising
concern and alarm that the viral infection is widespread in the
country.
The team that conducted the test comprised Dr Wimaladharma
Abeywickrama, Dr Arjuna de Silva, Dr Harsha Perera, and Dr Chandika
Hapuarachchi. Dr Abeywickrama said that, according to their test
results, it is confirmed that Chikungunya is prevalent in Sri Lanka.
First they had tested some blood samples from Colombo and Hambanthota
and subsequently they were requested to test another 10 samples from
Kalmunai. Out of those test samples from Kalmunai, 5 have proved that
they were infected by the Chikungunya virus. These results were
established last week in the collaborative research with the Nagasaki
University of Japan which had been their major collaborative partner
in research work on Dengue and other infectious diseases.
"Consequently, as it is a national requirement, government should
look into this matter and be helpful to identify the disease since we
have the facility to conduct tests in Sri Lanka," Dr Abeywickrama
told The Nation. According to Epidemiology Unit sources the Ministry
of Healthcare and Nutrition are awaiting the result of the test
samples which were sent to Thailand and India.
They are still in doubt to confirm that it is Chikungunya although
they were being informed of the test results by the Molecular
Medicine Unit of University of Kelaniya.
No specific drug is prescribed for this disease and there is no
vaccine currently available. Infected persons should limit their
further exposure to mosquito bites. Supportive care with rest is
recommended to relieve the pain. Saline and other relevant treatments
are given according to the prevalent symptoms.
Around 500-600 outdoor patients with suspected Chikungunya infection
visit the Colombo National Hospital daily, hospital sources said.

[This is a very extensive and intensive epidemic of chikungunya. It
would be interesting to know if the Sri Lankan government is mounting
an intensive mosquito vector control campaign. A map of Sri Lanka can
