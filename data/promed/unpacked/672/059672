CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections. Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that some precooked chicken products may be contaminated with _Listeria_ and may be making people sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 2 Jul 2021, 3 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 2 states (2 people in Texas and one in Delaware). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 6 Apr 2021 to 5 Jun 2021.

Sick people range in age from 60-95 years, with a median age of 89, and 66% are male. All 3 people were hospitalized, and one death has been reported from Texas. The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Listeria_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3-4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the month before they got sick. All 3 people were in a long-term care facility or hospital when they got sick. These facilities served many food items, including meals with precooked chicken.

Laboratory and traceback data
-----------------------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are identical. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

USDA-FSIS found the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ in 2 samples of precooked chicken products during routine product testing. Along with the epidemiologic data, this suggests that people likely got sick from eating precooked chicken. USDA-FSIS and state partners are collecting food purchase records from the long-term care facility and hospital to identify a common precooked chicken product that may be making people sick.

Public health actions
-----------------
Until we learn more, CDC is advising people at higher risk for severe _Listeria_ illness and facilities caring for them to take extra precautions: reheat precooked chicken to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C], and do not eat cold dishes made with precooked chicken unless the chicken was reheated before being used in the dish.

["Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. An estimated 1600 people get listeriosis each year, and about 260 die. The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and their newborns, adults aged 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems" (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/index.html).

A gastroenteritis can occur in non-high-risk individuals, but bacteremia, meningitis, and intrauterine infection may occur in high-risk individuals.

Outbreaks of _Listeria_ infections in the 1990s were primarily linked to deli meats and hot dogs. Now, _Listeria_ outbreaks are often linked to dairy products and produce. Investigators have traced recent outbreaks to soft cheeses, celery, sprouts, cantaloupe, and ice cream. Other high-risk foods are smoked fish and unpasteurized milk.

Although chicken is not generally considered to be a high-risk food, a prolonged outbreak (2013-2017) due to cooked chicken was reported in 2020 from the UK:

McLauchlin J, Aird H, Amar C, et al.: _Listeria monocytogenes_ in Cooked Chicken: Detection of an Outbreak in the United Kingdom (2016 to 2017) and Analysis of _L. monocytogenes_ from Unrelated Monitoring of Foods (2013 to 2017). J Food Prot. 2020; 83(12): 2041-2052. doi: 10.4315/JFP-20-188.

"Abstract: In England and Wales, Public Health England applies whole-genome sequencing to cultures of _Listeria monocytogenes_ recovered from human cases of listeriosis, foods, and food production environments. Following the routine inspection of a small retailer in February and March 2016, 2 unopened packs of cooked chicken produced by the same manufacturer were found to be contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ at levels of 340 and 20 CFU/g. A public recall of this product was issued in March 2016. Early in 2017, a less than 5 single-nucleotide polymorphism single-linkage cluster was detected between the _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from the 2 cooked chicken products and cultures from 5 cases of human listeriosis in England and Scotland with onsets of illness between March 2016 and February 2017. Epidemiological data provided further supportive evidence that this cluster was an outbreak linked to a manufacturer of cooked chicken whose products were supplied to the small retailer that initiated the outbreak investigation. Unrelated to this outbreak, 34 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates recovered from routine food monitoring of 2007 samples of cooked chicken during 2013 to 2017 were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. Previously undetected fewer than 5 single-nucleotide polymorphism single-linkage clusters were identified between cultures from cooked chicken and with those from 2 clusters and 2 sporadic cases of human listeriosis that were consistent with foodborne transmission. This analysis identified linkage of _L. monocytogenes_ clusters within specific food chains more readily than traditional manual tracing. Linking of data associated with _L. monocytogenes_ cultures from cases of listeriosis with those from unrelated food testing is a unique source of information for communicable disease risk assessment, epidemiological studies, and disease prevention and control. This report provides further evidence that should act as a reminder of the association between cooked chicken consumption and human listeriosis."

ProMED awaits more information regarding the relationship of the chicken between the 2 states. - Mod.LL
