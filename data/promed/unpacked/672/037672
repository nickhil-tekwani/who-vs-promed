The last week saw a remarkable increase in numbers of bluetongue
infection in livestock. An update can be found on the EU website:
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/table_11_2007/adns_310807_en.pdf>
It has to be noted that the authorities can't keep pace with the
developments, a recent update on the website of the Belgium FAVV
states that as of 30 Aug 2007, 1338 cases have been confirmed
<http://www.favv-afsca.fgov.be/crisis/sa-blueT/doc07/2007-08-30-KAART_v16.pdf>
The German figures have only been updated on 21Aug 2007, when 596
cases have been notified. Information given by the local veterinary
services indicate that numbers now have reached nearly 1400 cases.
For the 1st time a case of bluetongue has been confirmed in a cow on
a holding in Eastern Germany (Thuringia).
The situation is very different from last year [2006], as farmers are
describing the disease as more "aggressive". In addition, in 2006
most farms experienced single cases ,whereas this year in cattle
herds and sheep flocks multiple cases are occurring.

[I have edited the subscriber further comments but they can be
generally summarized as containing concern about the economic losses,
animal welfare, options for control including vaccination, and urge
coordinated government actions. - Mod.PC]

[In such a rapidly evolving situation, the animal health authorities
must feel like they have been hit by a major windstorm. There are so
many critical key activities they must accomplish including choice of
disease control tactics, definitively establishing the breadth and
scope of the outbreak, communicating with the public and responding
to questions from the responsible political structures, to name only
a few. So there is no wonder that updates lag behind the actual
situation as the report from our subscriber indicates.
It would be valuable to understand the likely course of events as the
efforts to develop a vaccine in time for this year's outbreak seem to
have fallen short and it will clearly be quite some time until the
first frost occurs stopping the _Culicoides_ activity and disease
transmission. - Mod.PC]
