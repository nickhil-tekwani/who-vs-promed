[Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 continues to spread in West Africa.

All outbreaks of HPAI reported from 1 Jan 2015 to date can be seen on the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/gq4ffym (click on the section of interest on the map, and zoom in).

In April 2015, Niger reported 1 outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in the region of Maradi, located some 664 km [about 413 miles] from the current outbreak. Based on information in follow-up report No 1 dated 27 Jan 2016, as of that date no new outbreaks had occurred. The epidemiological comment in that report stated that "The promoter of the farm has many activities with Nigeria (purchase of feed, of young chickens, for example)". The outbreak in Maradi is still showing as "continuing", and several control measures are being applied. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=17568.

The current outbreak of HPAI in Tillaberi was reported to have started at the end of February 2016, but it was confirmed 3 months later at the end of May 2016. Furthermore, even though the country is indicating that the outbreak was resolved 13 Apr 2016, the event is still active. In fact, the report indicates that certain sanitary measures such as "official destruction of animals products and official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste" are still to be applied. If, in fact, the outbreak was resolved 6 weeks ago, but disposal of dead birds is still to be accomplished, this should be of concern to both animal and human health.
