Experts Close In On What Killed Fish
------------------------------------
Monday [3 Jan 2011], officers with the Arkansas Game and Fish
Commission said an investigation into what killed nearly 100 000
fresh water drum fish has turned up the possibility of a virus or bacteria.

It was on Thursday (30 Dec 2010) when people started reporting the
dead fish lining the banks of the Arkansas River.

Game and fish officers said that during their investigation, they
discovered the dead fish covered about 17 miles of river from the
Ozark Lock and Dam downstream to River Mile 240, directly south of
Hartman, Arkansas.

The dead fish seemed to only be limited to fresh water drum fish.
Game officers said the type of disease will be determined by further testing.

The results are expected to be available in about 3 weeks.

[Most bacteria will grow in 24-48 hours. Viral cultures usually take
about that amount of time, but fungal cultures may take 14 or more days.

While there are a number fresh water diseases, none of them on my
reference list are specific to drum fish only. Sadly, this article
does not provide any clues as to why the wildlife officials believe
or suspect it is a bacterial or viral disease.

An authoritative report on the results would be appreciated.. - Mod.TG]
