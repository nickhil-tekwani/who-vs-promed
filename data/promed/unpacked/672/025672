Tests confirm 3rd anthrax case
------------------------------
Health officials have confirmed that anthrax has been found in a 3rd
heroin user in Glasgow. The male patient is in a critical condition
in the city's Royal Infirmary. Another patient there is also being
tested for the infection.

A man and woman in the city's Victoria Infirmary tested positive for
anthrax last week [week of 14 Dec 2009]. The man died on 16 Dec 2009.
Police and health officials believe contaminated heroin or a
contaminated cutting agent may be responsible.

Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in public health medicine, said: "I urge
all drug injecting heroin users to be extremely alert and to seek
urgent medical advice if they experience an infection. Drug injecting
is extremely risky and dangerous. The possible presence of a batch of
heroin contaminated with anthrax makes drug injecting even riskier
and even more dangerous. While this section of the community need to
be on their guard the risk to the rest of the population -- including
close family members of the infected cases -- is negligible."

The last previous death from anthrax in Scotland was in 2006 when [a
man] died after inhaling the spores. The 50-year-old craftsman, from
Stobs, near Hawick, made drums with materials such as untreated animal hides.

3rd Glasgow drug user has anthrax
---------------------------------
Traces of anthrax have fund in the blood of a 3rd Scotsman at a
Glasgow hospital. [Last Wednesday (16 Dec 2009) a] man with almost
identical symptoms died. A woman, also reported to being a drug
addict, also had traces of anthrax found in her blood, although she's
currently in a stable condition at the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow.

The 3 Anthrax cases were all found in Glasgow and medical staff
believe the infection stems from the use of contaminated heroin as
they all involved particular areas of the body which were injected
with the drug.

NHS officials for Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the man most
recently infected with anthrax is being currently treated at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary and is in a critical condition.

Doctors are also suspecting a 4th case, also admitted at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary, although confirmation needs to be done after tests.

According to a statement by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, health
care officials are investigating all the cases of any important soft
tissue infections experienced in heroin injecting users from now or
in the last 4 weeks.

Heroin is often produced in regions of the world where anthrax is
rather common in animals. In order to manufacture the drug, animal
bone meal is occasionally used as a cutting substance. Bone meal,
made from crushed and coarsely ground animal bones, is predominantly
used as an organic fertiliser.

[The Glasgow authorities have now admitted the possibility of a 4th
case. They are being naturally taciturn about the existence of cases
awaiting diagnostic confirmation. The total possible number is
fortunately limited and the status of the few remaining is awaited.
Hopefully there will be no others.

While contaminated bone meal is a natural suspect, colleagues with
more knowledge of recreational drugs than myself say that any
non-soluble residue would be noticed by the users and generate very
negative attitudes towards their suppliers. Also if bone meal were
used further back in the processing chain, the probability would
exist of many more sick heroin addicts than just these in Glasgow.
The results of the ongoing international investigations are awaited. - Mod.MHJ]
