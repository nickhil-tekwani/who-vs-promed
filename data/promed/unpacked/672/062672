[Effective 13 Nov 2014, a total of 804 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV including 342 deaths (case fatality rate 42.5 per cent) have been reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012. The newly reported laboratory confirmed cases today (13 Nov 2014) both come from Sakaka, which is located in Al Jawf province in the north of the country. One of the 2 newly confirmed cases was reported as a fatality -- a 29 year old expat male, without known pre-existing co-morbidities. Possible contact with suspected or confirmed cases in both healthcare environment and in the community or currently under investigation. The other newly confirmed case -- a 53 year old Saudi male had a history of exposure to animals. While one suspects the animal exposure referred to is to camels, the report does not specifically mention the type of animal exposure. Today's (13 Nov 2014) report included information on 2 new fatalities -- one being the newly confirmed case in a 29 year old expat male, and the 2nd in a 70 year old male from Alkharj (which is located in Riyadh province). This individual had been confirmed on 11 Nov 2014, at which time he was reported to be in critical condition, had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, and history of possible animal exposure and possible exposure to suspected or confirmed cases in the healthcare environment were under investigation.

[The newly laboratory confirmed case in the 11 Nov 2014 report is in Alkharj, which in located in Riyadh province. The newly reported fatality in a previously laboratory confirmed individual is a 56 year old Saudi male from Taif with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. I was unable to identify when this individual was announced as newly laboratory confirmed case. Interestingly, there was another 56 year old Saudi male from Taif reported as a fatality on 22 Oct 2014, whose initial report of laboratory confirmation was not identifiable from a review of previous reports.

The 5 newly reported recovered cases include a 75 year old Saudi male from Taif who, most likely, was the individual reported on 25 Oct 2014, at which time he was reported to be admitted to a hospital ward, had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities and a positive history of exposure to a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment; a 44 year old expat male healthcare worker from Riyadh who most likely was the individual reported on 26 Oct 2014, at which time he was reported to be admitted to a hospital ward, had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, and a history of possible exposure to a suspected or confirmed case of MERS-CoV; a 31 year old Saudi female from Riyadh who most likely was the individual reported on 4 Nov 2014 at which time she was admitted to a hospital ward, did not have a history of co-morbidities or a history of animal contact, and history of contact with known or suspected cases both in the healthcare environment and the community was noted to be under investigation; a 33 year old Saudi male from Riyadh who most likely was the individual reported on 5 Nov 2014 at which time he was admitted to a hospital ward, had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, and was reported not to have had any identifiable high risk exposures (no history of animal contact nor contact with suspected or confirmed cases in either the healthcare environment or the community). The 5th reported recovered case -- a 41 year old Saudi male, I was unable to identify when he had been reported as a newly laboratory confirmed case.

[5] Saudi Arabia camel breeding season - media report

Camel breeding, weather spread MERS infection: Saudi expert
-----------------------------------------------------------
Saudi Arabia's health experts have blamed the camel breeding season for new infections of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the country, local newspaper reported on [Thu 13 Nov 2014].

A total of 24 and 23 new confirmed MERS cases were registered in November and October [2014] respectively, compared with 10 cases both in August and July [2014], the command and control center of the Health Ministry said.

Dr Mohammed Halwani, associate professor of contagious diseases at the College of Medicine in Al-Baha University, attributed the case rise to the breeding season of camels.

"The newly-born camels have more viruses than the adults. People will [be infected by] the virus when they come into contact with them or inhale their nasal secretions," he said.

The virus has not been completely wiped out from the kingdom, Halwani said. "It has been in existence since it was discovered in late 2012."

The moderate weather in the country nowadays is another factor in the spread of the virus, the professor added. "In cold weather the virus spreads quicker."

Saudi Arabia has registered 802 MERS coronavirus cases since the virus was discovered, of which 447 have recovered, 340 died, and 15 are still receiving treatment [with the newly reported confirmations on 13 Nov 2014, the total is now 804 cases including 342 deaths and 447 recoveries. - Mod.MPP]

The oil-rich country has registered the highest number of MERS cases in the world, but the number of new cases has drastically declined thanks to tough measures taken by medical institutions.

[Since the last update on 8 Nov 2014 there have been a total of 6 newly reported laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 4 newly reported fatalities. There had been no reported cases, fatalities or recoveries on 8 and 9 Nov 2014. Of the 6 newly reported laboratory confirmations, one was reported as fatal case at the time of initial report, another was reported as a fatality 2 days after the initial confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. 2 of the 6 newly confirmed cases were in Sakaka (Al Jawf province), 2 were from Taif, 1 was from Alkharj, and 1 was from Riyadh. Of the 4 newly reported fatalities, 1 was in Sakaka, 1 in Alkharj (Riyadh province), and 2 were in Taif.

The media report above mentioned that October and November are breeding months for camels. Studies have demonstrated that it is the young camels (less than 2 years of age) that have been identified as the primary MERS-CoV shedders, whereas the older camels have antibodies to MERS-CoV, but are not usually active shedders of the virus. Of note is that of the 15 newly confirmed cases in November 2014, only 1 had a definite history of exposure to animals and another 3 were still under investigation for animal exposure.
