Bali Rabies' Toll Rises to 78 After 2 Children Die
--------------------------------------------------
This weekend, 2 children have died of rabies in Bali, bringing the
official death toll from the epidemic that broke out on the island in
November 2008 to 78. The latest victims were identified as a
13-year-old child and a 5-year-old child, both from Buleleng
district. The elder died on Saturday, and the younger died on Sunday
[23 Aug 2010].

Ken Wirasandi, the secretary of the rabies task force at Denpasar's
Sanglah General Hospital, said that the victims had exhibited clear
symptoms of rabies, such as acute fear of light and water, shortness
of breath and foaming at the mouth. While the official death toll is
now 78, unofficial estimates put the figure at 85, which includes 7
victims who died showing symptoms of rabies but were never autopsied.

The number of dog-bite incidents across the island is also on the
rise. On Monday [24 Aug 2010], a dog in Karangasem district bit 5
people, including a veterinarian called in to treat it. Two of the
victims were treated at Sanglah Hospital but none received a rabies
vaccine because the hospital has run out of stock. In Tabanan
district, 17 people have been bitten by dogs.

Rabies vaccines are running low across the resort island, with the
districts of Denpasar, Badung, Klungkung, Karangasem and Bungli
confirmed to be out of stock. Nyoman Sutedja, the head of the Bali
Health Office, said the situation was growing more serious, with the
number of dog attacks surging over the past several months. "So far
this year there have been 36 000 dog-bite incidents in Bali, up from
24 000 for the whole of 2009," Sutedja said. "This surge in the
number of cases has overwhelmed us." He added that his office had
initially predicted it would need 19 000 doses of rabies vaccine this
year, based on the 12 000 used last year. However, the projection
proved wrong and the year's supply of vaccines ran out in the 1st 6 months.


Sutedja said Bali had recently received 2600 doses from the World
Health Organization and would receive a further 15 500 next month, as
well as 18 000 from the central government. He said this would allow
his office to hand out relief batches of the vaccine to officials in
districts across the island.

The Bali administration has also allocated Rp 7 billion (USD 777 000)
to buy extra stock of the vaccine, which would take its total to 119
000 doses, Sutedja said.

[The rabies situation shows no signs of improvement. The number of
dog bites and human fatalities continue to rise, and the provision of
post-exposure prophylaxis remains inadequate. So far it has been the
indigenous population that has suffered and there have been no
reports of cases of rabies virus infection among visitors to the
island. However, tourists should be forewarned of the situation and
should take appropriate precautions.
