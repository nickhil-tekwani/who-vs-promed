Bocavirus cases in Bolivia
--------------------------
Ruben Torrez, the Epidemiologist of the Health Network of Santa Rosa de Yacuma in El Beni department, confirmed the death of a female child attributable to bocavirus infection, and reported that there was another case presenting with the same symptoms, but who remains alive. He also mentioned that there had been another death [possibly due to bocavirus infection] a month ago [early October 2013], but they were not able to confirm the cause of the infection.

Thus there have been 2 confirmed cases of bocavirus -- one resulted in death, while the other is still alive; this has occurred in Santa Rosa de Yacuma. Bocavirus is a new virus detected in 2005 in Africa, and now it has arrived in Santa Rosa in Bolivia, the physician pointed out.

The director of the Departmental Health Service (SEDES) of El Beni, Mauricio Rousseau Carageorge, confirmed only one death caused by this disease in Bolivia, because with the other case in a minor, there wasn't a report indicating the illness was a consequence of human bocavirus infection.

"We detected the disease one month ago [early October 2013], following the death of a female child. We have sent a team to collect samples and have identifed 2 more individuals as carriers [of this virus], another female child and a 43-year-old adult. In addition we have detected influenza A [H1N1], for which we put a block on the zone [Was the zone vaccinated? Was it quarantined? - Mod.MPP]," assured Rousseau.

[Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a DNA virus belonging to the family _Parvoviridae_. Since it was described 1st by Allender et al. in 2005, there have been several articles published with epidemiologic and virologic information in countries in the Americas (including Latin America), Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa. [There are 4 distinct genetic lineages of human bocavirus. - Mod.CP]

HBoV primarily affects children less than 5 years old (75 percent are less than 2 years old) and is associated with cough, fever and rhinorrhea and diarrhea. The role of HBoV as a cause of asthmatic crises has also been suggested. Not withstanding, the real importance of the HBoV in acute respiratory infections has been questioned for various reasons. In the 1st instance, the majority of studies have used molecular diagnostic techniques (PCR), for which a positive result in this context can signify an acute infection or simply a prolonged synthesis of virus particles, live or inactive (its excretion has been demonstrated up to 6 months following acute illness). In addition, various studies have reported a high prevalence of HBoV in asymptomatic patients (5-43 percent), high rates of co-infection with other viruses, and the presence of the HBoV in excrement, serum and urine.

On the other hand, new evidence supports the role of HBoV as a respiratory pathogen in children, suggesting that the high viral load is associated with respiratory symptoms and viremia, indicating systemic infection; while low viral loads in respiratory secretions may indicate asymptomatic excretion.

The presence of IgM specific for HBoV, combined with an increase in IgG, has been described as a sensible method to diagnose acute infection and has provided important evidence in clarifying the pathogenic role of this agent in acute respiratory infections. - Mod.JT
