Relief in Kerio Valley as cattle disease tackled [see comment]
--------------------------------------------------------------
The government has now diagnosed the disease outbreak which has killed more than 2000 livestock [which species? - Mod. AS] in Kerio Valley in the last 3 weeks. The test results from the Livestock Veterinary Laboratory referral facility in Nairobi revealed that the outbreak was that of peste des petits ruminants popularly known as PPR. The government will now roll out a massive vaccination of more than 150 000 livestock in the region to contain a further spread and already officers are on the ground to prepare for the exercise.

Dr Bernard Moenga, a Ministry of Livestock official in Charge of Veterinary Disease Control said the results for other samples collected by Regional Laboratory Veterinary Investigations team, turned out to be negative except for PPR. "We did not establish the Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), Rift Valley Fever (RVF) or East Coast Fever (ECF) as had been feared by farmers in the region," Said Dr Moenga.

The disease is suspected to have spread into the region from Ethiopia through Turkana County. Dr Moenga said the disease had been detected earlier in Turkana but was contained, only to re-emerge again in Kerio Valley, parts of Isiolo and Garissa. Livestock farmers have complained of heavy losses following the outbreak but Dr Moenga said they were ready to mitigate and stop any further losses.

Chadwick Chelimale and Jeremiah Biwott who are some of the affected farmers said the infected animals portrayed symptoms such as coughing, acute fever and excessive diarrhea which led to death within a week. The farmers have accused livestock officials of delaying to take action yet the losses were increasing. "We will now be able to treat the animals in order to avert more deaths", said Dr Moenga.

A Veterinary officer in Marakwet, Joseph Kiyeng, said the Ministry had started dispatching the PPR vaccines in the next few days. Dr Kiyeng said they had already started sensitizing farmers on how to prevent the disease. Farmers affected are in Central Pokot district, Marakwet East, Marakwet West, Pokot North, Baringo East and Baringo North.

The affected animals affected by PPR in severe would have symptoms such as acute and watery blood-stained diarrhea and respiratory distress which are common features; in later stages dehydration, emaciation, dyspnoea, hypothermia and death may occur within 5-10 days. It mostly attacks goats and sheep, cattle and pigs.

[The information in the above newswire, including its title "cattle disease", is rather confusing. It attributes a disease affecting "goats, sheep, cattle and pigs" to PPR - which, in fact, is an (OIE-listed) highly contagious viral disease of sheep and goats. The PPR virus does is not known to cause clinical disease in cattle and pigs (sporadically, cases were recorded in camels and in some species of small wild ruminants).

Though, based upon the described symptoms, it may be assumed that there is currently spread of PPR in Kenya, affecting sheep and goats only, the published involvement of other species, in particular cattle, as apparently affected by the said virus, is in need of official clarification. A clear diagnosis of the disease entity(ies) currently affecting the various mentioned species in Kenya is urgently required. In cattle, rinderpest should be excluded.
