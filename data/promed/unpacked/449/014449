The cases of dengue reported in Minas Gerais in the 1st 5 months of this
year [2008] reached 42 500. Last year [2007], there were 44 000
notifications of people [with dengue] infected by [virus carried by] the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Some municipalities in the eastern region and the
Mata zone suffered epidemics, mainly in April [2008], when the records
reached levels above those expected. In 2008, 7 deaths from the disease
were confirmed in the state, with 3 from DHF [dengue hemorrhagic fever] and
4 from complications.

In Belo Horizonte, the [dengue] notifications are following an increasing
pattern. The number of people who contracted the disease in the 1st
semester was higher than last year [2007]. [The number this year] is 8384
[dengue] patients versus 5235 in [2007]. In 2006, there were 664 cases and
in 2005, only 68. The patients also have suffered more serious forms [of
dengue], with 3 deaths in [the state] capital, 16 cases with complications
and with DHF.

The 3rd death in Belo Horizonte, was confirmed this week, with the death on
Friday [30 May 2008] of a 39 year old teacher of the state [education] network.

According to the manager of surveillance in health and information of the
Municipal Secretariat of Health, Celeste Rodrigues Souza, at this time of
year, with the low temperatures and the period of increased drought, there
has been a reduction in cases of dengue. The registry already registered a
drop in [dengue case] notifications and also a reduction the number of
people seeking attention at the health centers, urgent care units, and
hospital beds. This is an opportune moment for preventive action. "We must
invest in actions to prevent and eliminate the foci of the mosquito before
the rainy season," warned Celeste Souza.

Some actions [that have been] implemented this year [2008] to halt the
spread of the explosion of [dengue] cases, mainly in the Northeast region,
which had 4473 infected people, should be continued throughout the year.
This work was done in partnership with the Superintendency of Urban
Sanitation, and more than 1.5 million tons of garbage and materials that
serve as water receptacles for _ Aedes aegypti_ were collected.

Another action that should be done during the year is [action against
mosquito] invasion of closed buildings. Up to the present, 49 houses were
hit with fines. "These actions are justified in times of greater
transmission [and of dengue] cases, but we are reaching the conclusion that
in terms real impact and to avoid the disease we must extend these measures
over the entire year, " said Celeste Souza.

In epidemiological week (EW) 21 (18-24 May 2008), 98 cases of classical
dengue were reported to the Directorate General of Epidemiology (DGE); 90
per cent of the reported cases are from the regional health directorates
(DIRESA): Piura II (42 cases), Piura I (19 cases), Jaen (16 cases), and
Lambayeque (11 cases). The Loreto DIRESA has not provided reports this week.

The cumulative number of dengue cases reported to the DGE [for 2008] are
7391 through EW 21, of which 1566 cases were laboratory confirmed, 4256 are
probable [dengue cases], and 1569 were ruled out.

Concerning DHF, through EW 21 (2008) 21 cases were reported of which 12
were [laboratory] confirmed. No deaths have been reported to date.

In Lima, [in 2008] to the present week, 159 cases have been reported of
which 108 were discarded, 31 are under study (probable [dengue cases]) and
20 have been [laboratory] confirmed. All of the confirmed cases were
imported [from other parts of the country]. None of the confirmed cases
were contracted in Lima.

Concerning the dengue virus serotypes, all 4 virus types have been detected
in 2008, of which DEN 2 [virus] was circumscribed to Madre de Dios and DEN
3 [virus] occurred in Sullana, Loreto, Lambayeque, and Ucayali. Classical
dengue with hemorrhagic manifestations was attributed to the latter [virus].

An outbreak of dengue fever has hit the southern Shabwa province of Yemen,
affecting hundreds since mid-May [2008], health officials say. The number
of cases reported so far is nearing 1000, and 5 have died as a result.

Dengue is a mosquitoborne infection caused by one of the 4 dengue viruses.
A severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever, is most serious in
children. Symptoms appear 3-14 days after the infective bite and range from
mild fever to incapacitating high fever, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pain, and rashes.

Health officials in Yemen say its spread is largely due to ignorance, a
lack of awareness and the fact that it is being treated as a normal fever,
according to IRIN (UN Integrated Regional Information Networks).

Stagnant waters and rainfall are worsening the situation. Field teams are
distributing mosquito nets and spraying breeding areas and homes.

Dengue fever "crisis" looms in Thailand
---------------------------------------
Rising temperatures, longer rainy seasons, and increased urbanisation are
leading to an explosion of dengue fever cases in Thailand in what health
officials are calling a near-crisis situation. "At least 14 000 people have
been diagnosed with dengue in 2008 alone -- most since April [2008] when
the rains started early," said Wichai Satimai, director of the Department
of Disease Control. The 2008 outbreak marks a 72 per cent increase in
proven cases since last year [2007], according to the department.

Neglected disease
-----------------
"Dengue is the most important neglected communicable disease in Thailand
... it is all over the country," said Chawalit Tantinimitkul, a spokesman
for the World Health Organization (WHO), in Bangkok.

At the BNH [Bangkok Nursing Home] Hospital in Bangkok, one doctor said
dozens of cases had been admitted in May [2008] alone. "It is impossible to
cure dengue," the doctor, who wished to remain anonymous, told IRIN [UN
Integrated Regional Information Networks]. "We just monitor their blood
platelet levels and make sure they are properly hydrated and fed."

Health authorities are also reporting increases in the more dangerous form
of the disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome
(DSS), which are more likely to kill. In a written response to IRIN, WHO
called the spread "a major public health problem of international concern".
According to WHO, the disease was 1st detected in Thailand in 1949 when
about 2100 cases were reported. Since then there have been 2 major
epidemics -- in 1987 and 1998. The most recent outbreak has been more
severe because of increased population and warmer and wetter conditions,
said government officials.

Dengue is transmitted by the [_Aedes aegypti_] mosquito. Unlike malarial
mosquitoes, which live in rural or forested areas and breed in muddy water,
the [_Aedes aegypti_] mosquitoes breed in stagnant, clean water. Often
called Tiger Mosquitoes because of their stripy tails, they are active
during the day, unlike malarial mosquitoes. [The name "tiger mosquito" is
usually given to the _Ae. aegypti_'s close relative, _Ae. albopictus_,
which has also been identified as a dengue virus vector in Thailand. - Mod.TY]

Awareness campaign
------------------
Wichai said local authorities were being urged to take extra measures to
prevent the virus from spreading further. "We have enlisted the help of
more than 800 000 volunteers nationwide to help to get the word out about
this dangerous virus," he said. They are helping authorities hold awareness
workshops and conduct patrols to spot areas of standing water that are
potential mosquito breeding grounds.

"The government has also launched a major television campaign aimed at
educating the public about how to prevent the virus," he said. "We are
telling people to make sure that there are no containers where mosquitoes
can breed and to be careful of everything from flower pots to old tyres,"
Wichai said. "The rainy season has been coming earlier than normal, and
there are a lot of containers where mosquitoes can breed."

A WHO report, "Dengue/DHF Situation of Dengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever in
the South-East Asia Region", stated that the higher dengue infection rates
were a result of "demographic explosion" and "rapid growth of urban centres
with a strain on public services, such as potable water."

Bangkok's growing slums are especially susceptible to dengue outbreaks,
according to the WHO. Residents have poor access to drinking water and
often use ceramic jugs to collect rainwater. The jugs are ideal breeding
grounds for dengue mosquitoes.

According to Wichai, undernourished poor people are most vulnerable to
serious symptoms or death. "Their immune systems are weaker, and their
symptoms are worse ... especially for children under 9," he said. The
problem is only expected to get worse when Thailand's wet season peaks in
June and July, Wichai told IRIN. "It is not yet a national crisis, but we
are trying very hard to get things under control to prevent a crisis
situation."

[The number of dengue cases reported in Thailand is increasing with a total
of about 14 000 cases since the beginning of 2008, representing a 72 per
cent increase from the same period in 2007. A total of 10 901 dengue cases
and 12 deaths had been reported from 1 Jan 2008 to 19 Apr 2008 (see prior
PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Thailand (04) 20080428.1465).

Background information from a WHO report on the situation of dengue/dengue
haemorrhagic fever in the South East Asia Region can be accessed at
<http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section332_1103.htm>.

The following data are the reported cases and deaths due to dengue fever,
dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome available at Thai
Ministry of Public Health Surveillance website (please note that while the
URL links go to web pages in the Thai language, if one goes to the central
column of the page, there are links to the data files by year, with 2551
representing 2008. Clicking on the year will then provide a link to
download the respective files for dengue fever reports by province and
region, dengue hemorrhagic fever reports by province and region, and dengue
shock syndrome reports by province and region). The data below support the
above-mentioned concerns of an increase in reports of dengue fever and
dengue hemorrhagic fever cases and deaths in 2008 to date when compared
with data from the same period in 2007.

Reported cases of dengue fever (DF) 1 Jan through 31 May:
Number of cases in 2007: 5760 cases with 0 deaths
Number of cases in 2008: 7156 cases with 0 deaths
(see <http://203.157.15.4/surdata/disease.php?ds=66> for distribution of
dengue fever cases by province and region)
Reported cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) 1 Jan through 31 May:
Number of cases in 2007: 8859 cases with 1 death
Number of cases in 2008: 10 580 cases with 4 deaths
(see <http://203.157.15.4/surdata/disease.php?ds=26> for distribution of
DHF cases by province and region)
Reported cases of dengue shock syndrome (DSS) 1 Jan through 31 May:
Number of cases in 2007: 264 cases with 12 deaths
Number of cases in 2008: 260 cases with 12 deaths
(see <http://203.157.15.4/surdata/disease.php?ds=27> for distribution of
