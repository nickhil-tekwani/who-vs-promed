Beginning in June 2022, Marine Mammals of Maine (MMoME) -- a NOAA Fisheries authorized marine mammal stranding network partner -- has responded to an elevated number of stranded seals. Most of the seals were found dead. On [1 Jul 2022], the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed that samples from 4 stranded seals in Maine have tested positive for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1. All of these animals had recently died or required euthanasia. USDA is notifying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as state animal and public health officials. The finding will be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health.

The current rate of dead seal strandings in this area is approximately 3 times the normal rate for this time of the year. During elevated stranding events such as this, the Marine Mammal Stranding Network collaborates with NOAA Fisheries to further investigate. They consider environmental conditions, common factors contributing to past stranding events, and any potential human impacts. They also obtain information on the causes of illness and death in the seals. The Network will continue to collect and analyze as new cases are documented. Response, recovery and sampling protocols for seals are in place and being led by MMoME.

Seal mortality events have occurred in southern Maine previously. The most recent Unusual Mortality Event in seals occurred in 2018 due to phocine distemper virus. These events can last for several months to several years. They are challenging when the event involves infectious diseases with the potential for spread across wildlife species and domestic animals or humans. Learn more about unusual mortality events at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/active-and-closed-unusual-mortality-events.

NOAA Fisheries has established a coordinated response structure with MMoME, Atlantic Marine Conservation Society, and state and federal partners to manage this event. The response team is currently meeting on a daily basis to share information, support response logistics, and develop accurate public communications. The webpage will be updated on a regular basis as new information becomes available.

[Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common, although since April 2022 there have been several events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in wild carnivores (Order Carnivora). Most reports have been done in red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, Family Canidae), but skunks (Family Mephitidae) and raccoons (Family Procyonidae) have also been found infected.

Seals are also part of the Order Carnivora, although they are of the Suborder Pinnipedia (terrestrial carnivores are Fissipedia). In March 2021, there was a report of HPAI H5N8 in harbor seals. Several subtypes of AI viruses (H7N7, H4N5, H4N6, H3N3 and H10N7) have caused epidemics in harbour seals, but they do not appear to have become established in this carnivore species. HPAI H5N8 was detected in 2 gray seals stranded on the Baltic coast of Poland in 2016 and 2017 (https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2512.181472). - Mod.PMB
