ESR [Environmental Science and Research] is monitoring syphilis rates after the number of cases soared between 2002 and 2009.

There were 81 reported infectious cases [in 2013], up from 72 identified in 2011. Officials noted their statistics came only from family planning and sexual health clinics and did not include those treated by GPs and other healthcare providers.

The report said that between 2011 and 2013, cases were concentrated among men who had sex with men [MSM] living in the main population centres. The highest numbers were in Auckland and Christchurch. In 2013, 73 out of the 81 cases were men, with 86.3 per cent among MSM. The highest number of cases was in the 45-49 age group.

The report noted concerns that some women remained undiagnosed, as most cases were discovered from health checks and screening rather than because of symptoms.

[ProMED-mail previously reported on the increasing frequency of syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM) in New Zealand in 2013 (Syphilis - New Zealand: (CA) MSM 20130309.1579043). ProMED-mail has also posted reports of the recent increases in the incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis in many localities in the USA and other countries that is occurring mainly among MSM. 75 percent of P&S syphilis cases in the US are among MSM.

Cases among MSM have been characterized by high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behaviors. A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV-infected MSM, without resulting in an increase in HIV infections (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

The news report above says that the highest numbers of syphilis cases were occurring in the high populations areas of Auckland and Christchurch. The Auckland Region is on the North Island, with a population of almost 1.5 million (1/3rd of the nation's residents) in 2011, and is the country's largest urban area, which encompasses the Auckland metropolitan area, smaller towns, rural areas, and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Region). Christchurch is the largest city on the South Island, in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand, and the country's 3rd most populous urban area with a population of 366 000 in 2013 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch). - Mod.ML
