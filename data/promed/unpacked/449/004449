A Menominee County horse has died from a mosquito-borne illness. Public Health, Delta & Menominee counties, was notified on Thu 15 Oct 2020 of a horse in Menominee County having died from eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The horse became ill on 3 Oct 2020.

This is the 1st confirmed animal case of EEE in Menominee County this year [2020]. No other animal or human cases of EEE have been confirmed in Menominee County at this time; however, 35 confirmed cases in horses in 16 Michigan counties have been reported to date [Thu 15 Oct 2020].

Because conditions are favorable for EEE-carrying mosquitoes during the fall, people should take precautions against mosquito bites.

EEE cannot be spread between animals or between animals and humans, but humans can get EEE through the bite of an infected mosquito. Most (95-96%) cases of human EEE do not cause any symptoms, and less than 1% develop serious illness. However, EEE is potentially serious, and symptoms include fever, weakness, and muscle and joint pain. More severe illness can cause swelling of the brain and surrounding tissues.

Anyone can be affected by EEE, but persons over age 50 and under age 15 are at greatest risk for developing severe disease.

To protect your horses and other domestic animals (such as dogs, sheep, and goats), measures could include the following:

- Talking to a veterinarian about vaccinating horses against EEE
- Placing livestock in a barn under fans (as mosquitos are not strong flyers) during peak mosquito activity from dusk to dawn
- Using an insect repellant on an animal that is approved for the species
- Eliminating standing water on the property (i.e., fill in puddles, repair eaves, and change the water in buckets and bowls at least once a day)
- Contacting a veterinarian if an animal shows signs of the illness -- fever and stumbling -- which can progress to being down and struggling to stand

Although nighttime temperatures are starting to consistently fall below freezing, which should end our mosquito season, residents and visitors to our area are reminded to take actions to prevent mosquito bites.

More information about EEE can be found at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services website.

Additionally, domestic horses can be vaccinated for EEE through your veterinarian. If you see an animal that is exhibiting strange behavior or appears sick, avoid handling or consuming the animal and visit https://secure1.nystag.mi.us/ORS/Home to report your observation.

For questions regarding sick domestic animals such as horses, livestock, or pets, contact the Michigan Department of Agriculture at 517-373-1077.

A Benton County horse was confirmed last week [week of 5 Oct 2020] to have a mosquito-transmitted disease that can cause fatal infections in horses and humans. The 11-year-old quarter horse mare had eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. EEE is fatal in more than 90% of cases in horses. The horse was euthanized.

EEE can cause fatal infections in horses and humans and is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes. Horses and humans are considered "dead-end hosts" because they can't transmit the disease to other horses or people. Horses can be vaccinated for EEE.

But even though humans can't contract the disease from horses, cases in horses indicate there are infected mosquitoes in the area.

In humans, symptoms of EEE can include fever, muscle pain, headache, seizures, altered mental status, photophobia (light sensitivity), and meningeal irritation. These occur between 3 and 10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.

The horse did not have West Nile virus or rabies, according to Minnesota Board of Animal Health. It had no history of travel in the last year, nor current vaccinations for EEE.

Six states and Ontario, Canada, had confirmed equine cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in October [2020]. States or provinces with EEE confirmed in horses during October [2020] are Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ontario (Canada), Wisconsin, and South Carolina.

The Equine Disease Communication Center provides confirmed reports of horse diseases throughout North America. Following are the reports of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in horses across the country for 1 Oct through 27 Oct 2020. [Some cases in this summary may have been previously covered by ProMED-mail in more detail in other postings. - Mod.TG]

[Hopefully this EEE season is winding down. Some places have had hard freezes, which helps eliminate the mosquito vector. Other places, such as south Florida and Texas, have not had much cool weather. Consequently, those mosquitoes carrying the EEE virus could still be searching for your horse. If you have not vaccinated, please do so. It is never too late to vaccinate. Vaccinate early and often. Late October is not too late to vaccinate.

Please use horse-approved sprays to repel the insects. Clean up any areas harboring standing water -- old tires, flowerpot catch pots, water leaks, etc. -- where mosquitoes could breed. This is especially true if you live farther south as your EEE season may not be over. - Mod.TG
