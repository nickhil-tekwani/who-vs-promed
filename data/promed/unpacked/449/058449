Virus Has Been Spread All Over US By Birds
-------------------------------------------
The bird virus [West Nile virus that killed seven New Yorkers last year has
now spread all over the Americas, say U.S. researchers. They warn that the
Gulf Coast of the United States will probably see the next outbreak of West
Nile virus.
Despite the threat, U.S. authorities have so far failed to provide the
research funding to keep tabs on the virus in wild birds. The scientists say
that scrupulous monitoring of bird populations is needed, otherwise it won't
be possible to identify and spray high-risk areas with insecticide to kill
the mosquitoes that transmit the virus to people.
The infection is endemic to Africa, Asia and Europe, where it resides
harmlessly in many bird species but kills others, according to Bob McLean,
head of the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis. Humans usually
get the disease from mosquito bites when the population of infected city
birds is sufficiently large to infect enough mosquitoes. In 1997, 527 people
in Bucharest, Romania, were ill with West Nile virus, and 50 [ ? died.
There is
no specific treatment for the infection.
The virus may have reached New York last summer in a bird imported from
Israel. However, West Nile expert Zdanek Hubalek of the Czech Academy of
Sciences suggests it may have originally escaped from the Sloan-Kettering
Institute in New York, where in the 1950s a strain of the virus was given to
95 terminal cancer patients as an experimental [cytolytictreatment.
But there is evidence that the New York outbreak last summer, which killed
thousands of crows and caused encephalitis in 61 New Yorkers, seven of whom
died, resulted from a different strain. But what is certain, McLean says, is
that as early as last summer the virus had already spread to an alarming
extent in the New York area. "It had already infected more than half the
local geese and sparrows. That's scary," McClean says. And the discovery of
the virus in birds in New York, New Jersey and Delaware last month has
dashed hopes that it would not survive the winter. John Rappole and his
colleagues at the Smithsonian Institution Zoo in Front Royal, Va., have
calculated that the virus would spread far and wide from New York if there
were susceptible migratory birds congregating on mosquito-infested wetlands
nearby. In this month's issue of "Emerging Infectious Diseases", they and
Hubalek report that there are 77 migratory species there, including ducks,
starlings, terns and gulls, capable of carrying the virus. "The virus is
probably in every corner of North America by now" as well as parts of South
America, says Rappole. Another outbreak could occur anywhere there are
enough infected birds, possibly this summer. "We think the next outbreak
will be along the Gulf Coast, where northern migrants remain concentrated,"
Rappole says. "It is essential to capture and test healthy local birds to
know where West Nile poses a threat," McLean says. "Then mosquito spraying
can be targeted to protect people."
McLean's proposal to screen birds in the coming months have not yet been
funded. Eastern and Gulf states plan to test dead birds and "sentinel"
chickens; i.e. caged birds used as an early warning system. But this is much
less sensitive, McLean warns. Caged chickens are less likely to encounter
infected mosquitoes than free-range birds. But Stephen Ostroff of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta told New Scientist:
"Extensive screening of wild birds in the hope of finding the virus would
not be cost-effective."

[So far there are no confirmed reports that West Nile virus-infected
mosquito vectors or susceptible birds have been recovered outside the New
York/New Jersey/Delaware area. This report contains much unfounded
speculation. Human mortality in Europe is variable to low. The following
report,extracted fro MMWR, sets the record straight - Mod.CP

West Nile Virus Activity - New York and New Jersey, 2000
----------------------------------------------------------
In late August 1999, an outbreak of encephalitis caused by West Nile virus
(WNV) was detected in New York City and subsequently identified in
neighboring counties (1). In response, an extensive mosquito-control and
risk-reduction campaign was initiated, including aerial and ground
applications of mosquito adulticides [ ! throughout the affected areas. No
human WNV infections were found in New York City with an onset date after
the campaign was completed. Cases continued to occur among humans in
surrounding counties that did not undertake mosquito-control efforts until
later, suggesting that the campaign may have reduced human risk. In May
2000, CDC issued guidelines to direct national surveillance, prevention,
and control efforts (2) and provided funds to support these efforts in 19
State and local health departments where WNV transmission had occurred or
where transmission would probably occur based on known bird migration
patterns. This report presents the findings of surveillance activities.
From May 6 through July 8, 2000, State and local health departments
confirmed WNV infections in 26 birds from five counties in New York and New
Jersey. Twenty-one infections have been confirmed in American crows in New
York and New Jersey, four in blue jays, and one in a red-tailed hawk. The
first infected crow was found May 22 in Rockland County, and the most
recently infected crows were found July 6 and 8 in the same county.
Fourteen infected crows identified in New York were found in Rockland
(eight crows), Suffolk (three), Westchester (one), and Richmond (Staten
Island) (two) counties. Seven infected crows were found in Bergen County,
New Jersey. Rockland County also identified four blue jays with WNV
infection, and one infected hawk was found in Westchester County. WNV has
been detected by polymerase chain reaction molecular methods in mosquito
pools collected in Westchester County (_Aedes japonicus_) and in Suffolk
County (mixed _Culex_ species). No cases of human or equine infection have
been reported in the region or in surrounding states.

MMWR Editorial Note:
WNV is transmitted readily by mosquitoes. _Culex_ species were the primary
vectors of WNV during previous outbreaks and epizootics; however, WNV also
has been isolated from many species of _Aedes_ and _Anopheles_ (3). In New
York, WNV was isolated primarily from _Culex_ species mosquitoes during the
1999 outbreak; WNV also was detected in overwintering _Culex_ species in New
York City. These findings suggest an important role for these species in
the transmission of WNV in the United States. _Aedes japonicus_ was detected
recently in the United States, and research is needed to determine the
flight range and feeding behavior of mosquitoes and to better understand
the risk for transmission to humans.
The susceptibility of crows to infection and death is a sensitive
surveillance tool that is unique to the United States (4). No data exist
from which to infer the mosquito WNV infection rate associated with a small
number of dead crows in an area, or to infer the risk to humans. Data also
are lacking to infer where and how the dead crows acquired infection. Time
of year and reproductive status of the crow population may be used to
indicate whether transmission occurred locally. On the basis of the known
nesting habits of crows, the finding of infected crows in early summer
suggest local transmission in Rockland, Westchester, Suffolk, and Bergen
counties. Data from the U.S. Geologic Survey's National Wildlife Health
Center indicate that crows infected with WNV are likely to have high
viremias and also are likely to be sedentary approximately 4 days before
death, suggesting that they can be a source of WNV for mosquitoes in areas
where they are found (National Wildlife Health Center, unpublished data,
2000).
On the basis of the surveillance indicators described in this report and
the phased response plan (2), CDC recommends the following for those areas
where evidence suggests local transmission of WNV:
- Intensify local and regional _Culex_ mosquito larval control to prevent the
emergence of adult mosquitoes that feed on birds and may contribute to the
virus amplification/transmission cycle.
- Expand and intensify surveillance activities in and around areas where
WNV-infected birds are found. Additional surveillance data about the
species population densities, virus infection rates in mosquito vectors,
seroprevalence in resident wild birds (e.g., house sparrows), and
seroconversion rates in sentinel chickens will permit a more accurate
interpretation of dead bird surveillance data and the relative risk for
human disease.
- Continue active WNV surveillance to determine the presence of new or
expanding WNV transmission foci.
- Reinforce public education and outreach programs to reduce mosquito
breeding sites around the home and use personal protective measures.
Implement, if necessary, focal adult mosquito control to reduce the number
of virus-infected mosquitoes, thus reducing the immediate risk to humans.
Mosquito species that feed on birds probably are driving enzootic
transmission in 2000 and probably are the vector for human cases (5). Adult
mosquitoes should be controlled within approximately a 2-mile radius around
the area where a WNV positive dead bird or infected mosquitoes are found.
This radius depends on the length of time between transmission of the virus
and the execution of control; as the time period increases, larger areas
must be treated.
- Consider aerial spraying of adulticides in areas where WNV transmission is
sustained and further amplification is evident despite intensive local
mosquito control efforts.
- Monitor adult and larval mosquito control efforts to ensure that the
control programs are effectively reducing vector mosquito densities and
virus infection rates.
- Counties where WNV transmission occurred in 1999, but has not been
identified in 2000, should maintain active surveillance for WNV and
continue larval mosquito-control, such as controlling larval mosquito
habitats, particularly around homes in suburban and urban areas and
monitoring _Culex_ larval habitats regularly for mosquito breeding.
