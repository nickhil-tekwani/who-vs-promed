Wound botulism: increase in cases in injecting drug users, UK, 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------------
27 suspected cases of wound botulism in injecting drug users (IDUs) were
reported to the Health Protection Agency (England and Wales) between 1 Jan
and 25 Aug 2004 [1]. 25 of these were in England, and 6 were
laboratory-confirmed.
Of the confirmed cases, 3 occurred in London in Jan and Feb 2004, and the
remaining 3 in north east England in Jun and Jul 2004. Reports of suspected
cases continue to be received, especially from north east and north west
regions.
In comparison, 14 suspected cases of wound botulism among IDUs were
reported for the whole of 2003, 7 of which were confirmed by laboratory
tests. Between Mar 2000 and Dec 2002 there were 33 clinically diagnosed
cases in IDUs in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland: none was
reported before 2000 [2]. 20 of these 33 cases were confirmed in the
laboratory by either detection of _Clostridium botulinum_ neurotoxin in
serum, or culture of _C. botulinum_ from wound tissue or pus. During Sep
and Oct 2002 there was an outbreak of 8 cases possibly related to a
contaminated batch of heroin [3].
Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a wound,
germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. All of the wound
botulism cases detected so far in the UK have been among IDUs. Those IDUs
who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly
may be particularly vulnerable to infection.
Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with an afebrile,
descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing
the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early in
the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results of
microbiological testing.
In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement
are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxin
treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole.
As well as these cases in the UK and Ireland, wound botulism in IDUs in
Europe has previously been reported in Switzerland and Norway [4,5]. It is
suspected that this type of botulism is underreported. The authors would be
interested to get information on any suspected cases of wound botulism in
IDUs from other countries in Europe.
