Rare cattle disease hits 6 dairy herds
-----------------------------
A cattle disease so rare that most veterinarians have only seen it in
textbooks has been confirmed on 6 Southland dairy farms.
The disease, gangrenous ergotism, was 1st discovered on a dairy
property by Invercargill Veterinary Services veterinarian Merlyn Hay
in the latter part of the winter [2004], and, confirmed by diagnosis
at Gribbles Veterinary Pathology lab at Invermay. Subsequently, 5
more of the practice's dairy clients had the disease confirmed, with
other cases apparently also diagnosed in South Otago.
The disease is caused by a fungal toxin found in ryegrass seedhead.
It results in severe hind limb lameness, which progresses to gangrene
with severe sloughing of the skin and tissues around the hoof. Dr.
Hay said the disease was extremely rare, but this season, with a hot
dry summer followed by a cold wet winter, had resulted in ideal
conditions for the development of the fungus. "Normally, it is not
warm enough for the fungus to grow," Dr. Hay said. The toxin is
ingested by at-risk cows through silage or baleage containing a high
percentage of infected seedhead. Dr. Hay has been involved in all 6
affected farms and believes a lot of other cases may have gone
undiagnosed. "It's really unusual and often seen only in textbooks.
There is no treatment, and cows have to be euthanized." Dr. Hay
estimated that well over 100 cows could have been affected by the
disease. A lot of silage and baleage had been made this season that
contained a high percentage of seedhead, the ideal breeding ground
for the fungi, she said.
Gribbles diagnosis had found ergotised ryegrass in 2 out of 3
outbreaks checked. In all other cases, all of the suspect conserved
feed had been fed out before the disease was confirmed.
Dr. Hay recommended that, even though the disease might not rear its
head again for many seasons, silage-baleage should be cut earlier to
ensure higher quality and low levels of seedhead.

[Ergot is caused by a fungus known as _Claviceps purpura_ or
_Claviceps paspalum_. Essentially, ergot can be divided into 2
categories, the neurological form that causes animals to stagger (_C.
paspalum_) and the gangrene form (_C. purpura_). This form causes
vasoconstriction such that cattle may slough their ears, the switch
of their tail, or, even their hooves. It is very painful when they
slough their hooves. The animals will not walk to feed or water, and
euthanasia is the best option.
If the animal has the neurological form of the disease, they can
recover, but there is no treatment for the gangrene.
The fungus invades the seed head and forms a slerotia, which is
approximately twice the size of the individual grains in the seed
head. It is visible, and, if producers are aware that the conditions
for the fungus are right, they may be able to examine their hay
fields and avoid baling infected grasses. - Mod.TG]
