Scientists studying virus samples from the human outbreak of avian
influenza in Turkey have identified 3 mutations in the virus's sequence.
They say that at least 2 of these look likely to make the virus better
adapted to humans.
The Turkey outbreak is unusual, because of the large family clusters of
cases; the fact that many of those infected have only mild symptoms; and
the speed with which infections have arisen -- 20 cases, including 4
deaths, in less than 2 weeks. So scientists are urgently trying to
establish whether the virus is behaving differently in this outbreak from
previous ones in Asia. In particular, international teams are investigating
the possibility that the virus is moving between people. "With such a large
number of cases within such a short period of time, human-to-human
transmission is something that we've had to consider," says Maria Cheng, a
spokeswoman at World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters in Geneva.
As Nature went to press, samples from the first 2 teenagers in the country
to die had been sequenced by a WHO collaborating centre at the National
Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) in London. The results so far are not
comforting. The 1st mutation found, announced last week, involves a
substitution in one sample of an amino acid at position 223 of the
haemoagglutinin protein. This protein allows the flu virus to bind to the
receptors on the surface of its host's cells. This mutation has been
observed twice before -- in a father and son in Hong Kong in 2003, and in
one fatal case in Viet Nam during 2005. It increases the virus's ability to
bind to human receptors, and decreases its affinity for poultry receptors,
making strains with this mutation better adapted to infecting humans.
The same sample also contained a mutation at position 153 of the
haemagglutinin protein, Nature has learned. Cheng says this information was
not included in WHO statements, because "it is not clear what role this
particular change plays".
Finally, both samples from the Turkish teenagers show a substitution of
glutamic acid with lycine, at position 627 of the polymerase protein, which
the virus uses to replicate its genetic material. This mutation has been
seen in other flu sequences from Eurasian poultry over the past year. It
was also present in the one person who died during an outbreak of H7N7 in
the Netherlands in 2003, and in a few people in Viet Nam and Thailand. The
polymerase mutation is one of the 10 genetic changes that gave rise to the
1918 pandemic flu virus.
Like the 223-haemagglutinin mutation, it signals adaptation to humans, says
Alan Hay, Director of a WHO influenza laboratory at the NIMR. "There is
this glutamic acid/lysine flip," he explains. "Glutamic acid is associated
with flu-virus replication in birds, and lycine is in primates."
The Turkey strains are the first in which the polymerase and
receptor-binding mutations have been found together. They could make it
easier for humans to catch the virus from poultry. But they might also
favour human-to-human transmission. This is because the polymerase change
helps the virus to survive in the cooler nasal regions of the respiratory
tract, and the haemagglutinin mutation encourages the virus to target
receptors in the nose and throat, rather than lower down in the lungs. The
virus is thought to be more likely to spread through droplets coughed from
the nose and throat than from infections lower down. Hay points out,
however, that it is difficult to predict how the mutations will actually
influence the virus's behaviour. He adds that just 2 changes are unlikely
to create efficient human-to-human transmission on their own.
Establishing what effects these changes are having on the epidemiology of
the current outbreak is a top priority for research teams working in
Turkey. "We must learn more about the mild cases and be absolutely sure of
whether these viruses are behaving differently from those we have seen
elsewhere," says Hay. "It is early days in terms of what we know about the
viruses causing these infections."
Researchers are sequencing more strains from the Turkish cases, to see
whether they share the mutations and to check for further changes. Samples
were expected to arrive in London on Wed 18 Jan 2006, after being held up
for more than a week in Turkey because of the Eid-ul-Adha holiday period.
