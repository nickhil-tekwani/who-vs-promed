The World Health Organization (WHO) today published guidance intended to
help national governments establish mechanisms that will minimize potential
terrorist acts against food supplies.
The document, entitled "Terrorist Threats to Food: Guidance for Establishing
and Strengthening Prevention and Response Systems", is available at the
following website:
According to WHO, foodborne agents may be responsible for up to 1.5 million
deaths from diarrhoea-related conditions alone worldwide each year. In
industrialized countries, such as the USA, one person in 3 may suffer from a
foodborne disease annually. Major outbreaks of foodborne disease and related
food safety emergencies are all too frequently reported, sometimes affecting
hundreds of thousands of people and having enormous impact on trade. While
only a few cases of intentional contamination of food have been proven, the
risk of possible terrorist threats to food should be given serious
consideration by public health authorities and the food industry.
The document examines means of establishing basic prevention, surveillance,
and response capacities. Because both unintentionally and deliberately
caused outbreaks of foodborne disease may be managed by many of the same
mechanisms, the WHO recommendations concentrate on working with national
governments on integrating terrorism prevention and response measures into
existing national food safety and disease surveillance programmes.
Preventive measures by governments and the food industry are discussed.
Industry involvement is encouraged from the outset, as the food industry
possesses the primary means and greatest ability to minimize food-related
risks. Existing food safety management programmes can be enhanced, WHO says,
while putting in place appropriate security measures to protect food
production and distribution systems. The document provides suggestions for
specific measures for consideration by industry.
The document provides guidance on strengthening existing communicable
disease control systems to ensure that surveillance systems are sufficiently
sensitive to meet the threat of any food safety emergency. It emphasizes
that the establishment and strengthening of such systems will have a double
benefit -- not only will they help address the threat of food terrorism and
other emergencies, they will also increase governments' capacity to reduce
the increasing burden of foodborne illness.
The guidance document emphasizes the need to strengthen existing emergency
alert and response systems by improving links with all relevant agencies and
with the food industry. Many developed and most developing countries are not
yet adequately prepared to deal with a large-scale food safety emergency.
All countries should undertake preparedness and response planning to be able
to cope with food safety emergencies regardless of their cause. Also
described are the services of various technical programmes of WHO, as well
as other organizations, that may be of assistance to countries in addressing
this newly emerging public health concern..
Experts from national agencies in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Japan,
Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States of America, and from
organizations including the European Commission, the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, and the Industry Council for Development
contributed to the development of the document, which was prepared in
collaboration with the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health.

[Countries at significant risk are expected to have already undertaken basic
or even advanced measures to handle and prevent food-related bio-terrorist
activities. This publication may assist such countries in the
assessment/evaluation of the measures they have already undertaken, while
enabling other countries to establish their own defense, surveillance, and
alarm mechanisms.
Prevention instead of recovery from a situation becomes key to understanding
the necessity for such a guideline. The 50-page document Terrorist Threats
to Food is available at
