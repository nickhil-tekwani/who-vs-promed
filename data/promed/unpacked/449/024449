_Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae.polynesiensis_ in New Zealand
--------------------------------------------------
It appears that during insecticidal treatment on 28 Jan 2004 at sites
in Auckland's Whangaparaoa Peninsular to control _Ochlerotatus
camptorhynchus_ (the southern saltmarsh mosquito), an Australian
species that was discovered the previous week, larvae identified by
New Zealand Biosecure taxonomists as _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae.
polynesiensis_ were discovered.
During port inspections about 30 larvae were found in a used concrete
mixer being transported by ship from Futuna island via Auckland and
Noumea to Suva. As pupal skins (denoting emergence of adult
mosquitoes) and one live pupa were collected, it is possible that
some adult mosquitoes may have emerged while the ship was berthed.
Consequently the Auckland Regional Public Health Service staff have
set traps in the hope of catching any adults, and in addition
potential larval habitats have been chemically treated. Surveillance
will continue for 3 weeks to detect any breeding by these 2 exotic
mosquitoes.
The New Zealnd Ministry of Health chief technical officer, Sally
Gilbert, said that exotic mosquitoes had been intercepted on 24
occasions since January 1998. She said that both _Aedes aegypti_ and
_Ae. polynesiensis_ had been declared "unwanted organisms" in New
Zealand because of their vector potential. For example, _Ae. aegypti_
is a vector of yellow fever, dengue, Barmah Forest virus, and Ross
River virus, while _Aedes polynesiensis_ is capable of transmitting
Bancroftian filariasis, dengue, Murray River virus, and Ross River
virus.

[There are several recent press and media reports on the discovery of
_Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. polynesiensis_ in New Zealand, all based on a
government press release, but the source cited above covers the
situation best.
_Aedes aegypti_ has been reported previously from New Zealand, but I
think this is the first time that _Aedes polynesiensis_ has been
found in New Zealand. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Oc. camptorhynchus_
(previously in the genus _Aedes_) occur in Australia, while _Ae.
polynesiensis_ is found on certain Pacific islands.
It should be remembered that _Ae. aegypti_ occurs in many areas of
the world where there is no yellow fever, for example the Indian
subcontinent. I would have thought that a greater threat would be
dengue transmission.
Although the role of _Ae. aegypti_ in the transmission of Barmah
Forest virus and Ross River virus was mentioned in the press release,
and _Ae. polynesiensis_ was perceived as a potential vector of Ross
River virus and Murray Valley River virus, they are certainly not
regarded as major vectors of these viral infections.
Admittedly _Ae. polynesiensis_ is a vector of bancroftian filariasis
(the subperiodic form of _Wuchereria bancrofti_), but only on various
Polynesian islands.
_Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus_ was first found in the North Island of
New Zealand in 1998 (see the excellent report by Richard Russell,
archives 20020127.3417). In southern Australia this mosquito is a
major vector of Barmah Forest virus, Ross River virus, and Kokobera
virus, none of which, however, as far as I know, has been reported
from New Zealand. - Mod.MS]
