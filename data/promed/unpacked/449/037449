With another new case of [a] hantavirus infection in Los Santos province, the number of cases of this disease climbed to 75 this year, 2014, the highest registered since the disease was detected in the region in 1999.

The Regional Health Director, Nahir Cedeno, confirmed the presence of this new case in a 53-year-old patient from Canas, Tonosi district, who is hospitalized in the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital in Las Tablas.

In 2013, 9 cases of the hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome were registered, but in 2014, the number has gone up to 75.

[Cases of hantavirus infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) continue to mount in Los Santos province. The number of cases in the province has increased from 71 reported just 4 days ago (on 26 Dec 2024) to 74 reported on 30 Dec 2014. There is no indication about how many of these 74 cases were fatal.

Although not specified in the report above or the previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause HPS with hospitalizations in Panama. The Azuero region, including Los Santos province, is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from there. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
