Classical swine fever spreading in Spain
----------------------------------------
The Valencia authorities say 25 000 pigs have so far been killed in an
attempt to stop the Classical Swine Fever (CSF) virus from spreading.
Farmers complaining of a lack of proper information and coordination.
Yesterday the provincial government prohibited all transport of live pigs
for another 7 days. This decision came just after a decision of the Spanish
minister of Agriculture to allow limited transport again in some parts of
the province. This was to allow movement of weaners [weanling pigs to
empty farms and prevent overcrowding problems. Valencian authorities are
requesting EU recognition of Valencia as a single infected zone, thus
permitting pigs to be transported to abattoirs.
