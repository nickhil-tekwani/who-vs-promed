Canker outbreak reported in St Lucie County
-------------------------------------------
"Pandora's box has been opened" said a state agriculture official on Friday
[7 Jan 2005], as citrus canker was found in 7 trees in a subdivision in the
extreme north west corner of St Lucie County, and 45 more infected trees
were discovered in a grove just north of the St Lucie-Indian River county line.
According to Jack Hebb, the University of Florida Cooperative Extension
Service citrus agent for St Lucie, Indian River, Martin and Okeechobee
counties, it is bad and will only get worse.
Denise Feiber, public information director of the Florida Department of
Agriculture's Division of Plant Industry in Gainesville, confirmed that 4
grapefruit trees and 3 orange trees on 4 properties in Spanish Lakes
Fairways have tested positive.
Feiber said canker was 1st found [Wed 5 Jan 2005] on a "sentinel" tree, one
of 150 000 trees throughout the state's citrus-producing counties checked
regularly by US Department of Agriculture staffers. The other 6 trees were
discovered on Thursday and Friday.
"We're hoping this is an isolated incident," Feiber said. Within hours,
agriculture officials knew that it wasn't.
Mark Fagan, a state agriculture department spokesman in Fort Lauderdale,
confirmed late Friday [7 Jan 2005] that 45 canker-infected citrus trees had
been found in Cobb Grove in southernmost Indian River County. Fagan didn't
know how many trees in Cobb Grove would have to be taken out. "It depends
on where the [contaminated] trees are in the grove, whether they're all
together or spread out," he said.
Meanwhile, Hebb said, canker found in Port St Lucie appears to be
spreading. "We thought it was confined in one zone [north of Prima Vista
Boulevard, east of Airoso Boulevard and north and east of Floresta Drive],
but we're finding more and more of it every day to the north and south of
there."
According to Fagan, canker has been found on a total of 80 trees on 50
properties [in Port St Lucie]. Feiber said that 47 infected trees and 165
exposed trees have been removed in Port St Lucie.

[This is the 1st outbreak of citrus canker, caused by the bacterium
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_ [Xac], in St Lucie County. According
to the Florida Department of Agriculture, it is the 3rd-largest producer in
the state and is valued at USD 9 billion. Officials consider that
Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne were instrumental in spreading Xac to citrus
groves.
