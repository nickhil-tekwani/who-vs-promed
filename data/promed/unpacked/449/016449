Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi on [Wed 30 Jul 2014] directed the Health department to take all possible measures to check the spread of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE), which have jointly claimed 305 lives in Assam this year [2014].

The Chief Minister directed the Health Minister, Chief Secretary, and Health department officials to take all necessary measures for speedy control of encephalitis and provide necessary medical treatment to the people affected with vector-borne disease, officials said.

Gogoi also directed Principal Health Secretary to provide medicines and vaccinations against the disease and procure the necessary amount of medicines from outside the state.

The vector-borne AES has claimed 212 lives while Japanese encephalitis 93 in Assam this year [2014], a senior Health Department official said.

The total number of people suffering from AES was 1286, including 488 by JE, Joint Director Health Services-Malaria Dr BK Barua told PTI. After the doubtful patients tested positive through the ELISA test, they were declared as AES affected, he said.

Meanwhile, fogging was on in the vulnerable areas of the 24 of the 27 districts of the state affected by the killer disease, health department officials said.

The worst hit districts in Lower Assam were Sonitpur, Barpeta, Nalbari, Darrang, Kamrup (Rural), and Kamrup (Metro), while in the Upper Assam Tinsukia, North Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Dibrugarh, Dhemaji, and Golaghat, they said.

This report is confusing in that it differentiates AES and JE as clinical diseases, yet classifies both as vector borne. JE virus certainly is transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes. The cause of AES, however, has been a subject of debate and remains undefined (see ProMED-mail archives below), and Reye syndrome and heat stroke have been proposed as causal factors. This report does not indicate which vaccine will be administered in their campaign, but it is most likely to be JE virus vaccine. That vaccine will probably not be effective to prevent additional cases of early season AES, but will be helpful in preventing cases of JEV encephalitis that usually occurs later in the summer when that virus is transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes from wild birds. The vaccine is best administered just prior to the JE virus transmission season.

JEV was excluded as the etiological agent in these early season AES cases, classified as a suspected Reye syndrome-like encephalopathy by Dr Jacob John (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140625.2563561). One hopes that Dr John and his colleagues will be able undertake the additional studies that he called for, needed to define the pathophysiology of the disease and the mechanisms responsible for these cases.

With 5 more encephalitis deaths reported from the NBMCH [North Bengal Medical College and Hospital] during last 24 hours, the toll in fatal brain fever at the government hospital rose to 94 in past 29 days and total 135 lives perished in north Bengal in this monsoon, official sources today said [30 Jul 2014].

NBMCH sources said among the 94 casualties, 27 died of Japanese encephalitis and the rest from acute encephalitis [syndrome].

NBMCH officials today [30 Jul 2014] said among the 5 casualties one was a teenage girl. All the victims admitted recently with brain fever were residents of different districts of north Bengal.

The 5 more persons afflicted with high fever and admitted to the NBMCH today [30 Jul 2014] took the total number of patients undergoing treatment with encephalitis to 40. Of them 4 patients, including a child, were in critical condition.

Families of patients today [30 Jul 2014] staged a demonstration in front of NBMCH for opening the outside door late. Despite the government's standing order of cancellation of holidays for government employees engaged in health department, the outside door of the NBMCH was closed on Tuesday [29 Jul 2014] owing to Eid [religious holiday marking the end of Ramadan].

Meanwhile, a 60-year-old resident of Phoolbari, who had been admitted to nursing home in Siliguri with fever died yesterday [29 Jul 2014].

BJP's [Bharatiya Janata Party] West Bengal unit president Rahul Sinha today [30 Jul 2014] visited the hospital and criticised the alleged inadequate facilities to combat the killer diseases.

He also demanded that the government provide Rs 10 Lakh [Rs 1 million; about USD 16 400] each to families of the diseased.

Congress MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] Manas Bhunia also led a team of legislators to assess the situation. He also visited affected areas of Jalpaiguri district.

[As in the Assam report above, the causes of these cases are attributed to JE, presumably after laboratory tests, and to the generic term AES.

A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location West Bengal state can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2652476,323.

Cases in both Assam and West Bengal continue to climb. Health officials call for prevention of JE and AES. JE can be prevented through timely vaccination. However, until the cause of AES is defined, prevention will not be possible. - Mod.TY]
