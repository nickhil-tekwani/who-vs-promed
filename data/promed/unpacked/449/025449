Nearly 5000 salangane birds, which are raised by local people in Viet Nam's central Phan Rang city, were found dead and said to be infected with the avian flu strain H5N1, the local Tuoi Tre newspaper reported on Friday [13 Apr 2013].

According to Vice Chairwoman of Phan Rang City People's Committee Nguyen Thi Hue, from 28 Mar 2013 to 11 Apr 2013, about 4900 salangane birds out of the flock's 10 000 head raised by the Yen Viet Company Limited were found dead in Phan Rang City of Ninh Thuan province. Among the dying birds to be tested at the local Veterinary Department No. 6, 8 samples were found positive to the avian flu strain H5N1.

This is the 1st time human-raised salangane birds were found dead in Viet Nam because of the avian flu strain H5N1, so there are not yet specific measures to control the expansion of the disease, except those applied to the H5N1-infected poultry, said Nguyen Xuan Binh, director of the Veterinary Department 6.

Since the news about the deaths of the H5N1-infected salangane birds was reported, local veterinary agencies have brought samples of the young and grown-up salangane birds and their manure and nests to be tested, results of which will not be announced until 16 Apr 2013.

Meanwhile, strict supervision is being applied to 54 salangane breeding houses in Phan Rang City until final results of the tests are reported.

Preventive measures are also being implemented in other localities where salangane birds are breeding en mass, including central Khanh Hoa province, southern Tien Giang province, and Ho Chi Minh City.

Specifically, 12 salangane samples from Can Gio district (HCM City) are now being tested at the HCM City Veterinary Department, Phan Xuan Thao, head of the department told a Tuoi Tre reporter, adding that in 2012 and during the 1st quarter of this year [2013], the department had tested 94 samples from salanganes, and all results showed negative to the H5N1 virus.

Salangane birds are raised for the highly nutritious value of their nests. Currently in Viet Nam, one kg of salangane nests is sold for USD 125-158, depending on their quality.
