Subject: Two new Swine Fever outbreak in U.K.
Sources: MAFF and Pig Industry

After yesterday's news of a new classical swine fever outbreak in Norfolk,
a second new case of CSF has been confirmed today in the county of Suffolk.
Both infected herds are in the neighborhood of earlier outbreaks. They are
located in the UK's largest area of outdoor pig farming, so there are
opportunities for the virus to spread by a variety of fomites and vectors.
After a lull of 23 days since the fifth outbreak on 12 Aug 2000, there had
been increasing confidence official circles that the CSF virus had been
successfully eliminated. Now it is "back to the drawing board" and a new
infected area has been declared.

[A visit to Mike's excellent website informs us of a third new outbreak in
the epidemic area. I have clipped the following from the website:
"September 7, 2000: New outbreak confirmed (8th): near Iken, Woodbridge,
Suffolk, close to outbreak two days ago. Also 3000 pigs on two farms
outside the existing surveillance areas were slaughtered today as dangerous
contacts." -Mod.PC
