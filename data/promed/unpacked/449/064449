Mimivirus: Discovery of the World's Largest Virus
-------------------------------------------------
The world's largest virus, a giant virus that lurks inside amoebae and may
cause pneumonia in humans, has been discovered by scientists. "Mimivirus"
is the biggest virus found so far, and was discovered in a sample taken
from a water cooling tower in Bradford, UK, in 1992.

Amoebae, large single-celled organisms, are commonly found in
air-conditioning systems in large buildings, and often harbour various
bacteria and viruses inside them, which can go on to infect people working
in those buildings. A report about the discovery was published on 28 Mar
2003 issue of the journal Science [Bernard La Scola, et al. A giant virus
in amoebae. Science 28 Mar 2003: 2033].

It has at least 900 genes, an enormous number for a virus, and its size is
more like that of a bacterium. It can be seen using a good optical
microscope -- most viruses can only be visualised by electron microscopy.
In terms of DNA, it is approximately a fifth bigger than the virus
previously considered to be the largest in the world. Although it has been
linked to pneumonia in humans, it is in no way related to the SARS virus
currently sweeping the Far East.

The researchers from the National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris,
France, who examined the virus and coined the name Mimivirus, said that
blood samples from people with pneumonia had revealed antibodies for this
virus, suggesting that their immune systems had come into contact with it
at some point. They believe it is a virus because it lacks certain genes
universal to bacteria, but contains others known to have key functions in
viruses. The virus, while it has some genetic similarities to the family of
viruses [the _Poxviridae_] that includes smallpox virus, has now been
classed as the first of a completely new virus family, the _Mimiviridae_.

[The previously known largest viruses belong to the families _Iridoviridae_
and _Poxviridae_. The iridoviruses infect invertebrates and poikilothermic
vertebrates, whereas the poxviruses infect vertebrates and arthropods. The
immune response to mimiviruses in pneumonia patients indicates exposure to
antigen, but does not necessarily indicate a response to amplification of a
pathogenic agent. Further characterization of these novel viruses is
awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
