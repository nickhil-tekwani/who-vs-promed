Mumps outbreak in the Republic of Macedonia
-------------------------------------------
An increase of cases of mumps has been reported in the Republic of
Macedonia since last year [2008], including outbreaks in 12 different
towns. In the Clinic of Infectious Diseases (Medical Faculty,
University of Skopje) in January 2009 alone, there were 234 cases of
mumps reported, including 50 who were hospitalized, 20 with a
complication of orchitis [inflammation of the testes] and 18 with
meningitis. In the State Institute of Health, they are reporting 16
percent of the mumps cases have complications, and more than half are
teenagers between 15-19.

About one third of the cases have received one mumps vaccination and
some have received 2 doses. The vaccine was introduced as a school
requirement in 1982. Until 1997, only one dose of the vaccine was
required. The World Health Organization is now recommending 2 doses
of the vaccine. The vaccine was not available due to a shortage in
Macedonia from 1990-1994 and a lot of children at that time were not
vaccinated. In December of 2008, the vaccine recommendation was
extended to the age group 15-19.

The director of the Clinic of Infectious Diseases in Skopje, Zvonko
Milenkovic, said that government has requested that the WHO help them
with tests to determine if the vaccine is protective against the virus
that is circulating. What is happening in Macedonia, he said, is
similar to what happened to Western European countries like
Switzerland and England, and in the United States as well. In 1993,
UNICEF donated mumps vaccines to Macedonia, but in the past 6 years
all of the vaccines have been purchased from 2 companies, Pasteur and
GlaxoSmithKline.
