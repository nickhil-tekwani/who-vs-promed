French grain beset by unprecedented levels of yellow rust
---------------------------------------------------------
France's wheat and barley crops are facing "unprecedented" levels of yellow rust fungal disease this year [2014], Arvalis [technical institute for agriculture] said. The disease has infested plots of wheat, barley, and triticale, with the number of infections "exploding," in some cases even after treatment of the crops, Arvalis wrote.

The year [2014] has been "strongly marked by the rusts, particularly yellow rust, even with sustained fungicide application," Maggy Muckensturm, Cere'Obs crop-monitoring service, said. Grain farmers in France who had planned to apply 2 fungicide treatments to their crop will have had to spray 3 times.

France is the European Union's largest soft-wheat grower, and alternates with Germany as the top producer of barley.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Between seasons, the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge." Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or new "virulences" (ability to break down disease resistance conferred by specific host genes). Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

The aggressive Warrior strain has been spreading in Europe since 2009. Serious outbreaks are currently occurring in other European countries (ProMED-mail posts 20140523.2489629 and 20140122.2224928). It is also present in France and may be causing the problems reported above.
