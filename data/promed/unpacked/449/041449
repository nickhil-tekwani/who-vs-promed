I would like to draw your attention to an error in part (2) of the
ProMED-mail report dealing with the current outbreak of disease in
poultry in Jiansu province (see: Avian influenza (125): China (JS)
20081222.4031). It is stated that: "the avian influenza H5N1 Re-4
variant strain, highly homologous to the variant strain that appeared
2 years ago in Shanxi Province and different than the strain[s] which
first circulated in the south [of China]. Research by the national
reference lab shows that this virus [strain] has an extremely low
rate of transmission to mammals, and there has never been a human
case involving this virus [strain]."

On the contrary there has in fact been a human case of avian
influenza H5N1 infection with clade 7 (the clade that is currently
causing outbreaks in Jiangsu China).

[Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses are entrenched
among poultry in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The
highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 hemagglutinin has evolved into
many phylogenetically distinct clades and subclades that generally
correlate with antigenic differences that may be relevant for the
selection of candidates for H5N1 vaccines. These diverse lineages
have been largely separate geographically since 2005 although clade
2.3 viruses from China have recently circulated in other Southeast
Asian countries.

The phylogenetic tree for the hemagglutinin gene of highly pathogenic
avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses can be viewed at the WHO Web site --
"Towards a unified nomenclature system for the highly pathogenic H5N1
avian influenza viruses
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/nomenclature/en/index.html>).
A more palatable version is available in the New England Journal of
Medicine, Volume 358:261-273, 2008, "Update on Avian Influenza A
(H5N1) Virus Infection in Humans"
(<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/3/261>).

The geographic distributions refer to avian isolates, and the tree is
based on publicly available sequences. Clade 0 includes viruses that
were 1st recognized to cause human infections in Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region in 1997. Viruses from clades and subclades 0,
1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 7 have caused human disease.

ProMED-mail thanks the correspondent for drawing attention to the
error in the Chinese report. - Mod.CP]
