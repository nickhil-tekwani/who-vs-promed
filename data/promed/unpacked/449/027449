Searing summer temperatures in Russia have brought to careless strollers a
new threat apart from heatstroke--a proliferation of ticks carrying [a
deadly encephalitis virus. Already a score of people have died from the
disease and tens of thousands have consulted doctors after being bitten by
the ticks, blood-sucking arachnids which lie in wait in woods and
grasslands to fasten on to passing victims. The problem is well-known in
Asiatic Russia where vaccines are obtainable. Medical services admit that
such protection is non-existent in the rest of the country. Meanwhile
residents here [Moscow? and in Saint Petersburg, unaware of the danger,
stroll through the woods bare-headed, in shorts and short-sleeves, inviting
attack.
Cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been reported in the Saint Petersburg
region, from Karelia further to the north, and from Kostroma on the Volga.
There have also been eight deaths in Siberia. According to the latest
figures of the federal epidemiological service, the number of cases
recorded in May was already 60% greater than the year before. "This is only
the beginning," warned the head of the service Galina Lazikova.
In 1996, the last year of a tick plague, 166 people died after a tick bite,
which though painless can cause fever, meningitis or paralysis of the
nervous system, bringing death by asphyxiation. The ticks are most common
in June, Lazikova said, and with the period of encephalitis incubation
lasting from eight to 23 days, the worst would be known by the end of July.
Chief epidemiologist from the Novosibirsk region, Nikolai Mozheysky,
blamed the unexpected and early heat wave, which began in May and is still
going on, with temperatures in central Russia reaching 33C. "There is also
a fall in the population of rodents, the ticks' main prey, which could
explain why they are more prone to attacking people now," he added. Other
specialists say changed economic and social conditions are a key factor in
the spread of encephalitis.

[Central European encephalitis virus (CEEV), the geographic distribution of
which includes western Europe to the Urals is transmitted principally by
_Ixodes ricinus_ ticks. The very closely related Russian Spring-Summer
encephalitis virus (RSSEV), the geographic distribution of which includes
Siberia and areas to the west as far as the Urals, is transmitted
principally by _Ixodes persulcatus_ ticks. The distribution of these two
viruses is dependent on the distribution of the host tick species. An
excellent (Austrian) vaccine prepared with CEEV is available and may confer
protection against infection with RSSEV as well as against CEEV. There is
a Russian vaccine against these viruses but I know nothing about it other
than it is reported to be both safe and potent.
I doubt that being bare-headed is an added risk. Not many ticks fall from
trees onto people and whether one is wearing a hat or not would likely not
make any difference if an infected tick crawls from points south to one's
head.
Karelia is hard by the Finnish border to the east. If anyone in Finland
can contribute information regarding numbers of cases there, particularly
about increases in numbers of cases, we would appreciate hearing from them;
same with Sweden.
It is interesting that cases are increasing with increasing ambient
temperatures. Ticks usually feed in spring and fall, less so in between;
the usual bimodal distribution of cases is May-June and September-October.
The significance of this mention in this report of fever, meningitis,
paralysis, and death after tick bites is unknown. It may be indicating
"tick paralysis", which has a nonviral etiology.
That there has been a decrease in the number of rodents ("a fall in the
population of rodents") may have little or nothing to do with any of this.
Ticks that are hosts for these viruses feed on small mammals (including
rodents) and pass the virus transstadially to the adult stage. Humans are
fed on by adult ticks, so a decrease in the number of rodents would only
serve to decrease the risk to humans, not increase it. I'd go with the
changed economic and social conditions hypothesis. In any event, it is
clear that an education campaign is badly needed. As one who has had a
central nervous system infection with CEEV, I can assure our readers that
this infection is a serious one. - Mod.CHC
