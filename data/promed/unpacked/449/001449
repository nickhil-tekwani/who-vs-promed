Enterovirus Interference: Request for Information
--------------------------------------------------
In comments accompanying the posts on the outbreak of enteroviral meningitis
in the Primorsk Region of Russia, the Moderator [CP wrote that: "The use
of poliovirus vaccine to control an outbreak of aseptic meningitis is an
unusual procedure of dubious worth since there is no serological
relationship between echovirus 17 and poliovirus."
But in truth, enterovirus interference is an example of competitive
exclusion, not based on serology. You might ask those who worked with
poliovirus vaccine in the late 50's and early 60's about earlier Russian
efforts of a similar nature, but you will need someone with knowledge of
poliovirus literature before the 1966 Medline starting point, since the
reports were in the earlier 60's. However, there are reports subsequently on
enterovirus interference which suggest that the Russian effort has both
theoretical and experimental support. During a trial of poliovirus vaccine
in Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 1960's, poliovirus vaccine efficacy was
reduced due to enterovirus interference. The Russian report could, if the
conclusions are substantiated, be an instance of a similar [phenomenon but
with opposite effect. And with this in mind, it would be interesting to
pursue the matter and see what data were collected. Was there a way to
demonstrate an effect due to the poliovirus vaccine use? Since there are no
other presently used ways to deal successfully with control of enterovirus
outbreaks, knowledge from this effort would be useful.

[Dr. Feldman makes an interesting point. Some information from our Russian
colleagues on the background to the use of poliovirus vaccination in control
of aseptic meningitis would be welcome. In my comments I was reluctant to
give currency to the idea of interference in the absence of any supporting
data. Some years ago it was an accepted view that live poliovirus vaccines
would be ineffective in underdeveloped countries due to the prevalence of
unrelated enterovirus infections and consequent enteroviral interference.
The success of the WHO polio eradication programme has nullified this
hypothesis. - Mod.CP
