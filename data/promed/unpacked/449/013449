Rapid communications: identification of a rabid dog illegally
introduced from the Republic of the Gambia to Belgium and France
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
In March 2008, a 6-month-old stray female puppy was found injured in
the Republic of the Gambia. A Belgian resident holidaying in the
country took the dog to a local veterinary clinic to be treated. It
was operated upon, and on 15 Mar 2008 was given a 1st rabies vaccine
dose and micro-chipped. The dog was adopted by the Belgian woman, and
a certificate of good health was provided for it by a Gambian
veterinarian on 5 Apr 2008. The dog and its new owner took a flight
to Belgium on 6 Apr 2008 and arrived in Brussels, via Dakar, on the
morning of 7 Apr 2008. No serological control had been carried out
before leaving the Republic of the Gambia, and the owner had not
applied for legal authorisation to import the dog into Belgium. The
dog travelled in the cabin inside a travel box carried on the owner's
lap, with just the head exposed. The dog had been sedated before
departure and reportedly slept throughout the plane journey.
According to the owner, there were 2 possible human contacts during
the flight.

The dog was taken to a veterinary clinic in Brussels on 8 Apr 2008 to
be treated for a necrotic wound (possibly a bite). There was no other
animal or human in the practice at the time. The dog could not walk
properly, so it was walked around a nearby square a few times, for a
short period. There was no contact with other animals.

On 12 Apr 2008, the owner left the dog with an acquaintance in
Brussels for several hours. That person had 2 cats, but these never
came close to the dog as they were afraid of it. The cats were not
immunised against rabies.

On 13 Apr 2008, the owner drove to the Var district of France,
without stopping anywhere else in Belgium, taking the dog with her.
The dog had no contact with other humans or animals on the trip.
During the stay in the Var district, the dog did not leave its
owner's garden.

The dog presented with the 1st symptoms of rabies on 16 Apr 2008 and
was examined in several veterinary clinics, before dying in one of
them on 21 Apr 2008. A diagnosis of rabies was laboratory-confirmed
on 24 Apr 2008 by the National Reference Centre for Rabies at the
Institut Pasteur in Paris, France. The diagnosis was confirmed by
direct immunofluorescence and by the isolation of the virus in tissue
culture. The detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction] was also positive. The typing of the
virus, carried out by partial sequencing of the gene of the viral
nucleoprotein, showed it to be a lyssavirus genotype 1 (rabies
virus), African II lineage, originating from Western Africa and very
similar to strains circulating in Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Control measures
----------------
A risk assessment was carried out by the appropriate stakeholders in
Belgium on 25 Apr 2008. The at-risk period for transmission was
estimated to be from 1 Apr 2008 (the estimated start date of virus
excretion according to a hypothesis of 15 days of asymptomatic
salivary excretion) to 21 Apr 2008 (date of death). A list of
individuals and animals that had possibly come into contact with the
rabid dog in France, Belgium, and the Republic of the Gambia from 1
Apr 2008 was constructed by questioning the dog-owner and staff at
the veterinary clinics in which the dog had been treated. The dog had
difficulty in moving around following the surgical interventions on
its wound and had a very limited number of contacts with other
animals and humans. 19 persons who had been in contact with the dog
are being administered with anti-rabies treatment.

The following measures were also taken in Belgium:
- an active tracing of people and animals in contact with the puppy
was carried out. Persons and owners of animals that had close contact
with the dog were informed, assessed by local and federal animal and
personal health agencies, and vaccinated if necessary. This included
the owner, 2 passengers who were sitting in the same row as her, the
staff on board the aeroplane, the Belgian veterinarian and his staff,
and the friends of the owner in Brussels: in total, 13 persons in
Belgium;
- in accordance with Belgium's sanitary police legislation,
information and warning posters were displayed by the administrative
authorities and districts concerned;
- a press release was issued, giving appropriate information to the
public and with a reminder that the regulations in the European Union
and Belgian regulations on pet vaccination and import should be
followed;
- contact with the veterinarian and human health authorities in
Republic of the Gambia is in process so that appropriate measures can
be applied to the persons who were in close contact with the dog in
Belgium [Gambia? - Ed.LM].

Conclusions
-----------
In this event, the people at risk and the times at which they were at
risk were relatively clear. Possible human and animal contacts with
the dog and the travel itineraries in France and Belgium are known to
the French and Belgium health and veterinary authorities and
appropriate prevention and control measures have been taken. The risk
to people other than those already identified by contact tracing is
considered to be low.

The risk to passengers on the plane is also considered to be low, as
the owner is aware of no contacts with the dog during the plane
journey. There is currently no evidence of a transmission chain in
France or Belgium among domestic animals as a result of this event.

The delay between the vaccination of this dog and its entry into
Belgium and then France did not conform to the delay of one month
required by these countries. The criterion of having had a rabies
antibody titre 3 months before entry into these countries was also
not met for this particular dog.

[The following comment, received from a subscriber whose details are
known to us, relating to the recent rabies case in a stray dog
imported from Sri Lanka to the UK (ProMED-mail posting 20080426.1452)
are applicable also for the current, Gambian puppy, case:

"There was mention about a vaccine given in Sri Lanka for rabies
before travelling to the UK. I would be interested in hearing more
about the type of vaccine used. I am an expatriate in Southeast Asia
and recently discovered that there are several rabies vaccine
programs in my country of residence where there is endemic rabies:
one that is done locally which cannot be used for pets to be sent out
and one that is acceptable for transmigration of pets. It would be
interesting to see if there are any efficacy studies comparing such
vaccine strategies."

We share the subscriber's interest, relevant to both cases. We also
question the advisability of allowing the transfer of stray dogs,
collected in countries with endemic urban rabies, into rabies-free
countries, such as the case was in the recent UK event. - Mod.AS]
