Occurrence of _Togninia fraxinopennsylvanica_ on esca-diseased grapevines
(_Vitis vinifera_) and declining ash trees (_Fraxinus latifolia_) in
California.
A Eskalen, S Rooney-Latham, WD Gubler, Department of Plant Pathology,
University of California, Davis 95616. Plant Dis 2005; 89: 528, published
online as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0528C. Accepted for publication 3 Mar 2005.
Esca (black measles) and Petri disease (young esca) are 2 of the most
destructive diseases of grapevines in California and other grape-producing
countries. This disease is now known to be caused by multiple species of
_Phaeoacremonium_ including _P. aleophilum_, _P. angustius_, _P.
parasiticum_, _P. rubrigenum_, and _P. mortoniae_. The teleomorph of _P.
aleophilum_ was confirmed recently as _Togninia minima_ (Tul. & C. Tul.)
Berl. (1), but the teleomorph for the other _Phaeoacremonium_ species are
not known.
During the summer of 2004, plant specimens were collected from declining
ash trees surrounding vineyards as well as from grapevines that were
showing typical symptoms of esca including the presence of purple-to-brown
spots on berries and necrosis between the veins and on margins of leaves.
The specimens were cut into small pieces (15 cm), placed in plastic bags,
and thoroughly sprayed with 50 ml of sterile distilled water. The specimens
were soaked in water for 10 min at room temperature (25 ï¿½ 2 deg C).
Plant materials were then removed from the water and air-dried under a
laminar flow hood for future examination. Each wash solution was passed
through 5.0 and 0.45 micrometer filters attached to a sterile 35 ml
syringe. The 5 micrometer filters removed large fragments of plant tissues
and larger spores, while the 0.45 micrometer filters trapped spores of
_Phaeoacremonium_ spp. The 0.45 micrometer filters were inverted onto 1.5
ml Eppendorf tubes, and 1 ml of sterile distilled water was passed through
to wash out the trapped spores.
Aliquots of 200 microliters were spread onto potato dextrose agar amended
with 0.01 per cent tetracycline hydrochloride (PDA-tet). Colonies of _P.
mortoniae_ were identified on the plates after 10 days. Previously wetted
wood pieces (grapevine and ash) were examined for fruiting bodies with a
stereomicroscope. In this study, perithecia of _T. fraxinopennsylvanica_
were discovered for the first time on diseased grapevines in California.
Perithecia were embedded in decayed vascular tissue of ash branches as well
as pruning wounds, cordons, and trunks of grapevine cv. Riesling from
Mendocino County and cv. Thompson Seedless from Madera County. Perithecia
were black, globose to subglobose, and ranged in diameter from 183 to 276
micrometers. They were embedded and superficial and the lengths of the
perithecial necks ranged in size from 200 to 400 micrometers.
The asci were hyaline, clavate, and ranged in size from 16.7 to 23.2 x 4.7
to 5.6 micrometers. Ascospores were hyaline, ellipsoid to allantoid, and
ranged in size from 3.9 to 5.5 x 1.4 to 2.0 micrometers.
When plated onto PDA-tet media, ascospores formed colonies typical of _P.
mortoniae_. Perithecia, asci, and ascospore dimensions as well as
phylogenetic analysis of sequences from the internal transcribed spacer
region confirmed that the perithecia are in fact _T. fraxinopennsylvanica_
(Hinds) Hausner et al. (2) and that this fungus is the teleomorph of _P.
mortoniae_. Perithecia of _T. fraxinopennsylvanica_ were also produced in
vitro by crossing compatible isolates of _P. mortoniae_.
Furthermore, spore trapping studies show that propagules of this fungus are
present as airborne inoculum in infected vineyards during rainfall events
throughout the growing season.

[The gist of this piece is that _T. fraxinopennsylvanica_ is the sexual
stage (teleomorph) of _P. mortoniae_. Moreover, _Togninia_
(_Calosphaeriales_) is confirmed as the teleomorph (sexual stage) of
_Phaeocremonium_ by means of morphology, sexual compatibility and DNA
phylogeny. Petri disease (PD) is a serious disease of vines in most areas
where grapevines are cultivated.
