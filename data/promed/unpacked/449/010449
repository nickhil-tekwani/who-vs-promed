Acute neurological disorders in Niigata Japan: present situation
-----------------------------------------------
On 14 Oct 2004, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Tokyo, Japan,
was notified of an outbreak of acute encephalopathy of unknown etiology
among adults residing in the Murakami Health Center (HC) district, Niigata
Prefecture (2002 population: 81 861). Additional cases have subsequently
been reported from the Koide HC district. A total of 11 cases (Murakami-9,
Koide-2) developed illness between 27 Sep and 12 Oct 2004. The median age
of the cases was 71 years (range: 53 to 89 years); 7 were female. 9 of the
patients had varying degrees of renal dysfunction, of which, over half were
on dialysis treatment prior to illness onset.
Patients initially presented with symptoms such as lightheadedness, general
malaise, and difficulty ambulating. Vomiting or diarrhea was not observed.
Several days later, tremor-like involuntary movements or myoclonus
developed, followed, within 24 hours, by intractable status epilepticus.
Fever, headache, or stiff neck was absent in most cases. More than half of
the patients required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
for seizure control. One patient was placed on dialysis after admission. 4
of the cases have died, one has been discharged, and 6 remain hospitalized.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations have revealed elevated protein
levels without pleocyosis; bacterial and viral cultures have been negative
to date. CSF specimens have also tested negative for Japanese encephalitis
virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster
virus, and herpes simplex virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results
of serological tests of both CSF and sera are pending. Brain CT and MRI
studies have not yielded any common findings.
On 16 Oct 2004, a team from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases'
(NIID) Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) arrived in Murakami City
to assist city and prefectural health officials in the investigation of the
outbreak. Investigations are ongoing to describe the clinical and
epidemiological characteristics of cases, to determine the extent of the
outbreak, to identify potential etiologic agents and risk factors
associated with illness, and to develop appropriate control and prevention
measures.
Note: Recent attention has been paid to a species of mushroom,
_Pleurocybella porrigens_, as a possible causative agent. This mushroom,
primarily grown in the wild, has been a favorite dietary item in these
areas in Japan for many years and is prepared in various ways. No known
toxin, or cases of acute poisoning due to ingestion, have been previously
associated with this species. Although all of the cases consumed _P.
porrigens_ in varying quantities and frequencies prior to onset of illness,
there is no conclusive epidemiological evidence linking this food item with
disease occurrence at the present time. However, to better determine the
potential toxicity of this mushroom, representative samples from the
outbreak-affected areas will be sent to the National Institute of Health
Sciences for chemical analysis. In the interim, NIID will continue to
collaborate with clinical experts and public health officials toward
identifying and/or ruling out any potential infectious or non-infectious
etiologies.

[We appreciate Dr. Okake's sharing the authoritative report on the
situation in Japan. _Pleurocybella porrigens_ is also known as Angel's
wings. It is generally considered a desirable, edible mushroom. At certain
times and in certain conditions, it is extremely plentiful. It is usually a
snow-white-colored mushroom. - Mod.TG]
