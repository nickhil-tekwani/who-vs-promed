China on Sun 24 Feb 2019 confirmed 2 new outbreaks of African swine fever [ASF], one in the northern province of Hebei and the other in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, as the highly contagious disease spreads through the world's largest hog herd.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said the 1st outbreak is on a farm in the Xushui district of Baoding city, which has 5600 hogs, some of which died because of the swine fever, though it did not give a death toll. The farm has been quarantined and the herd slaughtered, it added.

The 2nd outbreak is in the remote Greater Khingan Mountains in Inner Mongolia, where 210 of the 222 wild boar raised on the farm died, the ministry said in a separate statement. The rest have been slaughtered, it said.

China has reported more than 100 [outbreaks] of the disease in 27 provinces and regions since August [2018]. The disease is deadly for pigs but does not harm humans.

[The described outbreak in farmed wild boar is China's 2nd since the start of the ASF event (reportedly, 1 Aug 2018). The previous outbreak, similarly located in China's extreme north east, dates back to early December 2018 (see archive no. 20181204.6179428). According to a press release of China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), the wild boar farm is located in the hinterland of Daxing'anling prefecture in Heilongjiang province (map at https://goo.gl/maps/cTpUiHmNYfD2); there is no pig breeding in the radius of 60 km (37 mi). After the outbreak, MARA and the Forest and Grass Bureau immediately dispatched a steering group to the local area. The local government has initiated an emergency response mechanism in accordance with the requirements. MARA's press release is available at http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yqfb/201902/t20190224_6172677.htm (in Chinese).

China's wild boar population and its potential ASF hazards were discussed in FAO's assessment document, published in early 2018 (ref 1, pages 8 & 10). According to a paper by Bai et al (ref 2), the number of free-range farmed wild boars raised foraging on mountain pasture in 3 north eastern Chinese cities in Jilin province between April 2015 and February 2016 was 500 000 farmed wild boars. No information from other provinces and periods on the number and size of such enterprises in China is available.

A previous posting, presenting FAO's weekly update of the ASF situation in China, Mongolia and Viet Nam (20190222.6331318) included the question "whether the 3 Asian countries addressed in the FAO update have been carrying out ASF surveillance in wild boars in their respective territories." We are grateful to FAO's senior animal health and production pfficer for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Eran Raizman, who informed us that no official information is available from the said countries on conducted ASF surveillance in wild boar. Following an FAO mission in April 2018 to Mongolia and meeting there with the Ministry of Tourism and Environment, FAO published a brochure on ASF that was given to herders-hunters in the provinces that border the Russian Federation and have big wild boar population.

Though ASF is not zoonotic, experts have recently warned of pollution and human health risks from the environmental aspects of the disease and its control. It was said that many pig farmers are throwing away the carcasses in rivers and reservoirs, or burying them underground, potentially contaminating the soil and water sources (https://www.theepochtimes.com/experts-warn-of-pollution-and-human-health-risks-from-spread-of-african-swine-fever-in-china_2810624.html).
