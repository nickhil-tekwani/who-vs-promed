Arizona: Early Detection of Influenza
-------------------------------------
A confirmed case of influenza in Tucson is the 1st in Arizona, and
the earliest influenza seen here [in Pima County] in more than 15
years, say county health officials. Whether that means we're in for
an especially bad influenza season -- after 2 very mild years -- is
unknown. But warnings of a potentially severe outbreak nationwide
have been issued, based on high influenza case numbers seen elsewhere
in the world this summer. The Tucson case occurred in a teenager
resident in north-central Tucson, said MacNeill. The patient did not
have to be hospitalized, but was tested and reported by a private
physician.
"We can see sporadic early cases of influenza that do not always mean
the season is getting under way," said Dr. Elizabeth MacNeill, Pima
County's chief medical officer "But 'early' for Southern Arizona
usually means November, not October. I've not seen influenza here
this early in 15 years." Arizona's influenza season more typically
begins in December, peaks in January or February, and shuts down by
April.
Although Arizona's first influenza report will not get as much
attention as its 1st reported human West Nile virus infection -- also
in a Pima County resident this month -- influenza is far more
dangerous, officials warn.
Every year, influenza and related pneumonia kill some 36 000
Americans -- including 1300 in Arizona during 2002. By contrast, the
U.S. death toll from the much-feared West Nile virus was 284 in 2002.
Along with Arizona, influenza has been reported so far this season in
New York, Florida, Louisiana, Colorado and Texas. However, only Texas
has been hit with a significant regional outbreak, according to the
CDC.
