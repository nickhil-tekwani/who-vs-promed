A quick note, I'm hoping you get comments from people more knowledgeable
than I.
With reference to the Balclutha syndrome: equine herpes does not present
with oral ulcerations, cold sores, etc. on mucosal membranes!
I would question the "expertness" of the equine expert called in. Horses
presented with oral ulcerations could have vesicular stomatitis, foot and
mouth disease or vesicular exanthema, but not equine herpes. Any of these
could have serious repercussions in New Zealand!!
The equine expert stating that many horses have blisters in their mouths in
New Zealand makes me wonder what's going on. Any horse in the US presenting
with such signs is cause for great alarm.
I hope others can shed more definitive light on this.
