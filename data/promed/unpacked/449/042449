Colombia returning large paddy shipments after detecting fungus
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Colombian Farming Institute (CFI) has announced that 1000 tonnes
of local paddy found to be contaminated with "an identified exotic
disease" will be returned to Guyana. However, the infection could
have occurred while in Colombia.

Minister of Agriculture [of Guyana], Robert Persaud, said that he was
aware of the situation and steps were being taken. "I have directed
the GRDB [Guyana Rice Development Board] to investigate the matter
notwithstanding the company's pronouncement that the shipment was
free of any impurities or fungi when it left Guyana. I have asked
that the Colombians, US and the Latin American rice research system
(FLAR) be involved," Persaud said.

The rice will be returned to Guyana following the discovery of a
fungus which corresponds to the _Tilletia_ type. The same fungus was
detected in 5493 tons of rice originating from the United States.
Fearing a possible spread of the fungus in their territory, Colombia
immediately ordered the rice transported back to its source.

The General Manager of CFI, Jaime Cardenas Lopez, said that it is the
organization's responsibility to ensure that imports do not put
Colombia's national rice production at risk. Hence, the infected
shipment worth USD 2.6 million is safely stored aboard a vessel at
port Barranquilla. Controlling such a fungus would increase
production costs and products would not be marketable if
contaminated. Colombia in December 2008 approved a tender to import
75 000 tons of paddy at zero duty to reduce the cost of the product
in the local market.

Colombia paddy shipment was fungus free, exporter says
------------------------------------------------------
General Manager of Saj Rice Group (SRG) Carlos Carbo yesterday [30
Mar 2009] said a consignment of paddy recently shipped by his company
to Colombia was free of any disease, fungus or quality issues when it
left the local shores. Carbo emphasized that paddy is subjected to
quality control procedures and tests from the "Rice Lab" before
leaving Guyana which is "an international laboratory that certifies
most of Guyana rice."

Quality checks, he noted, were carried out by GRDB. CFI, according to
Carbo, has stated that the shipment is infested with _Tilletia
barclayana_. However, Carbo said he has received information that the
presence of this fungus was never reported in Guyana. The Ministry of
Agriculture has confirmed this with support from CABI [Centre for
Agriculture and Biosciences International] and EPPO [European Plant
Protection Organisation].

Carbo stated that the a shipment of rice from the United States,
which arrived in Colombia 4 or 5 days earlier, was infected by
_Tilletia indica_, a similar fungus. This, Carbo said, gives strength
to the theory that the infection could have occurred after the
shipment arrived in Colombia.

Minister of Agriculture [of Guyana], Robert Persaud, has informed
that steps were being taken to address the issue. He had ordered the
GRDB to launch an investigation which is still ongoing.

[Black smut (also called kernel smut or bunt) of rice is caused by
the fungus _Tilletia barclayana_ (synonym _T. horrida_). It is
present in most rice growing countries, and despite the claim in item
2 above, there are reports in the literature of its previous
detection in Guyana (Carris et al. 2006, Ann. Rev. Phytopath. 44,
113-133). The fungus causes the endosperm of the rice grain to be
replaced partially or completely by a black mass of spores. Up to 15
percent of the kernels may be infected on highly susceptible
varieties, and yield losses of up to 25 percent have been reported
when infected seed was used.

Symptoms usually become apparent at crop maturity when spores push
through the glumes and may swell from the moisture of overnight dew.
Spores may settle on other plant parts forming a characteristic black
covering. Spores are spread with infected grain and plant material,
and by wind infecting ovaries of flowers. They survive in the soil
between crops and remain viable in stored grain for up to 3 years.
They also survive passing through digestive tracts of domestic
animals. Disease management includes preventative seed treatment, use
of crop varieties with reduced susceptibility, and cultural
techniques such as crop rotation and pathogen exclusion.

_T. indica_ causes karnal bunt, a serious disease of wheat. It is
morphologically similar, and both pathogens can be found as
contaminants on harvested or stored grain. Thus the claim in item [2]
that the species detected in the Guyana and US shipments were
different would need clarification by molecular methods. Additional
_Tilletia_ species occur on other non-economic grass hosts. Confusion
of species as contaminants in export grain and seed are said to have
hindered agricultural trade on previous occasions. It is difficult to
imagine how the rice could have become contaminated on board ships
after arrival in Colombia.
