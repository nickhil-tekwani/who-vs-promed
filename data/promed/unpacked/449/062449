Third Case of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in France
---------------------------------------------------------
A 19-year-old has become the third French victim to die of [variant
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (vCJD), the neurological disorder believed to
be transmitted by livestock stricken with its animal analog, the
so-called "mad cow disease" [bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE.
The victim died at his home in the greater Paris region, relatives
said on Thursday. His case had been diagnosed as terminal several
months ago, they added.

[The patient with the first case of vCJD in France, with clinical
onset in 1994, died in 1996. Circumstantial evidence and the early
date of onset of illness (only one UK case predated this first French
case) suggested infection via treatment with contaminated bovine
somatotrophin. The second victim, a 36-year-old woman with no known
risk factors, died in 1999. All 3 victims appear to have lived in the
Greater Paris Region.
By contrast, as of 28 Feb 2001, the number of definite or probable
cases in the UK stood at 95, of whom 6 were still alive. The UK
government Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) noted
that the trend in the number of vCJD cases in the UK showing a 20-30%
increase, year-on-year, was still being maintained.
The news of the third French victim's death comes a day after French
magistrates placed under official investigation a firm allegedly
distributing contaminated feed. A French company is accused of
illegally trafficking in meat-based animal feed. Feed products were
allegedly brought from France, Ireland and the Netherlands to Belgium,
where they were re-labelled. France banned bone meal from animal feed
in 1990 and further tightened its controls in 1996. "This discovery,
if confirmed, could explain the scientific mystery of how certain cows
born after the ban on animal derivatives in their feed could develop
mad cow disease," the Le Parisien newspaper commented.
