On 16 Aug 2022, the Centre for Healthcare Infections, Antimicrobial Resistance and Mycoses (CHARM) at the NICD [National Institute for Communicable Diseases] was informed of an increase in cases of multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (MDR-AB) infections in a neonatal ICU of an unnamed regional hospital in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.

The cluster involved 5 newborn babies with MDR-AB cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (n=3), blood (n=1), and endotracheal aspirate (n=1). All babies had underlying conditions and 4 of the 5 cases died.

At the time of the notification, an outbreak investigation was supported by the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Department of Health, including Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), Provincial, and District hospital outbreak teams, NHLS [National Health Laboratory Service], and NICD.

In the investigation, one dominant strain with 4 clonal isolates were found, indicating a possible common source and/or person-to-person transmission. The unit exceeded approved bed occupancy and was not adherent to staffing norms. Control measures included reducing bed occupancy in the unit, strengthening IPC, such as hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, decontamination of equipment, aseptic technique for procedures, retraining of staff, and surveillance. As of 26 Aug 2022, no further cases of MDR-AB infection were reported.

[A previous ProMED post reported in 2018 a similar _Acinetobacter baumannii_ outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Newark (NJ) University Hospital in the USA. This outbreak involved 4 patients and resulted in the death of 3 of these premature babies (Acinetobacter - USA (02): (NJ) fatal, neonatal ICU 20181128.6170088). No source for the outbreak was revealed. However, unspecified "major" infection control deficiencies were reported to have been found during an inspection in October 2018.

_Acinetobacter_ are aerobic Gram-negative coccobacilli commonly found in soil and water, which readily survive in a hospital environment. During nosocomial outbreaks, _Acinetobacter_ have been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment, including bed curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. Of the many _Acinetobacter_ species, _A. baumannii_ accounts for about 80 percent of reported infections.

Outbreaks of _Acinetobacter_ infections usually occur in healthcare settings, especially in critically ill patients in intensive care units (1). MDR-AB have also been reported to cause infections after natural disasters (such as earthquakes) (2), and in soldiers severely injured in the war in Iraq.

These organisms may colonize patients or cause a variety of infections, such as pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, burn wounds, traumatic and surgical wound infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and infective endocarditis. _Acinetobacter_ have been reported to spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from other patients who are either infected or colonized with these organisms. In addition, airborne spread of MDR-AB has been described in a burn unit (3).

Resistance of _Acinetobacter_ to multiple, commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, monobactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, severely restricts treatment options for infections caused by these organisms. The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include various aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes; plasmid-mediated, and/or chromosomal-linked beta-lactamases that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics; alteration of targets for antimicrobial drugs such as the penicillin-binding proteins, and antibiotic efflux pumps. These mechanisms are at times combined with absent or reduced expression of porin channels that limit penetration of antibiotics to their site of action (5).

Some _Acinetobacter_ isolates are susceptible only to the polymyxins such as colistin and sulbactam (4), although resistance to these antibiotics has also been reported. Sulbactam is a beta-lactam that is most commonly used in combination with ampicillin to inhibit certain bacterial beta-lactamases that would otherwise break down ampicillin. However, sulbactam itself exhibits antibacterial activity against _Acinetobacter_.

Attempts to reduce the frequency of nosocomial infections due to MDR-AB have involved restriction of antibiotic use and enhanced infection control interventions (1) that involve placement of patients colonized or infected with MDR-AB on contact precautions, cohorting, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys to look for other cases of MDR-AB and active-surveillance testing of patients with epidemiologic links to persons from whom MDR-AB have been recovered (6,7).
