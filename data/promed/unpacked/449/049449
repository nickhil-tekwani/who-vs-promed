Health authorities are investigating 2 _E. coli_ outbreaks in Ontario,
involving 6 people, but have not yet determined the bacteria source,
officials told CBC.ca Fri, 6 Oct 2006. Another 12 potential cases are
being investigated in the 2 cities of Hamilton and Sudbury.
Three people are sick with _E. coli_ infection in Sudbury and another 3
have been confirmed ill in Hamilton. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA) has not confirmed a link between the illnesses.
"A food source has not been confirmed as of now," CFIA spokesman Alain
Charette said. "The investigation is ongoing."

Contaminated produce may be to blame for 2 _E. coli_ outbreaks in the
province. Federal officials are reportedly investigating the outbreaks,
reportedly naming Romaine lettuce as a potential source of the problem, but
there may be others.
Six people are sick in Ontario: 3 in Sudbury and 3 in Hamilton. Another 12
potential cases are also under investigation in the 2 cities.

[It is not specifically stated that the _E. coli_ strain(s) involved is a
producer of Shiga toxin, but in the context of the posting, it is
probable. Likewise, because the onset of illness in these newly noted
Ontario cases is not stated, we cannot assess whether they occurred
simultaneously with the USA outbreaks.
Food ingestion histories are needed to confirm whether fresh produce
(romaine lettuce is mentioned) is linked to the cases, as well as genetic
analysis to determine whether these cases are related to the USA outbreak
strain spread by spinach, The USA strain affected one person in eastern
Ontario near Ottawa.
Neither Sudbury nor Hamilton is close to the Ottawa area. A map of the
province of Ontario can be found at:

located about 262 miles west of Ottawa, and Hamilton is located about 256
miles southwest of Ottawa. - Mod.LL]
