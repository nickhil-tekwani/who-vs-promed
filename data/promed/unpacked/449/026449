Yesterday, 27 January, the preliminary hearing of the official BSE Inquiry
took place. The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Phillips, who is chairing the
Inquiry, made a very detailed statement about its terms of reference, scope
and conduct.

Note particularly that transcripts of the proceeding will be taken in "real
time". He proposes to make full use of information technology, and stated
that "Throughout the Inquiry transcripts of the evidence will be posted
regularly on a dedicated web page."

The full text of his statement in now posted as Editorial Footnote [12 to
the IFST Position Statement on BSE which is on the IFST Web site at
