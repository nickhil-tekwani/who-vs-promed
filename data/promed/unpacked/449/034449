Comment on Reye's syndrome and Hong Kong
----------------------------------------
A single review of Reye's syndrome in Hong Kong has been published.

27 cases were treated at the Queen Mary Hospital during the period
1979 to 1985, a period of low activity for both varicella (chickenpox)
and scarlet fever; see graph:
http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/HK-VZ-SF.png.

Where a drug history was available, only 15 percent had received
aspirin prior to the onset of illness, while 60 percent had received
paracetamol. Influenza was presumed to be the underlying infection in
most cases, rather than varicella. [1,2]

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Berger for provision of this additional
information concerning the use of analgesics in treatment of pediatric
patients in Hong Kong.

Reye's syndrome is a very rare condition that causes serious liver
and brain damage. If it is not treated promptly it may result in
permanent brain injury or death. Almost all recorded cases of Reye's
syndrome have happened in children.

The exact cause of Reye's syndrome is unclear, but there is evidence
that 2 factors may contribute towards children developing the
condition. These are:
- Previous viral infection; most children who developed Reye's
syndrome were recovering from a viral infection, usually either
influenza or chickenpox.
- Aspirin: many children who developed Reye's syndrome had previously
received aspirin to treat the symptoms of their viral illness.

Due to the possible link between Reye's syndrome and aspirin, it has
been recommended that children under 16 years of age should not take
aspirin unless advised by a doctor. Since health warnings were issued
in the late 1980s about the risk treatment in children, the number of
cases of Reye's syndrome has fallen dramatically. There was an average
of 41 cases of Reye's syndrome a year in the UK and Ireland during the
1980s. The average number of cases a year fell to 9 during the 1990s.
In 2002, there was one confirmed case of Reye's syndrome, and up to
April 2009 only 3 suspected cases were recorded (see:
http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Reyes-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx).
