An uninhabited Scottish island where government scientists once conducted experiments with Anthrax has been hit by a fire. People who saw the fire on Gruinard Island from the mainland described the scene as "apocalyptic". They said the uninhabited island off Scotland's north-west coast was ablaze from "one end to the other" on [Sat 26 Mar 2022] evening.

The island was used for germ warfare experiments during World War Two. It was declared free of Anthrax by the Ministry of Defence in April 1990.

Kate Gearing and her daughter Nessie were at their home in Aultbea when they saw a glow in the sky, around 20:30 on [Sat 26 Mar 2022]. They could smell the smoke in the air from their house which is about 5 miles from the island. They got into the car to investigate, and drove along the coast until they saw the fire, which they said you couldn't miss. Nessie took pictures from the area around Gruinard beach. The 25-year-old described the scene as "apocalyptic," and said it looked like "hell fire". "There was a string of flames around the whole circumference of the island," she said.

Kate said the island off the north west coast was lit up by flames from one end of the island to the other. The most distressing thing about the scene, Kate said, was the noise of birds, which she thinks were nesting on the island. "We could hear birds crying, screaming, and then suddenly there was silence - but the flames went on, it was awful." She said thankfully the island is far away enough from shore not to be a danger to the mainland.

The pair returned on [Sun 27 Mar 2022], and said there were no obvious flames by the afternoon. However, there was still some smoke hanging in the air. Kate, a retired GP, said: "The island is pretty black now. There's just a few trees left standing, along the shoreline." "I'm just hoping there aren't any anthrax spores left around anywhere," she added.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the island did not fall under its remit because it is uninhabited. Earlier this week it issued a warning that the risk of wildfires was "very high" in central, southern and north-east Scotland. It urged people to think twice about using naked flames outdoors.

Anthrax is a lethal bacteria, especially when inhaled, and it proves fatal in almost all cases, even with medical treatment. Gruinard had long been uninhabited when, with World War Two on a knife edge, the government tasked scientists with finding a way of harnessing anthrax as a weapon - fearing the Nazis had developed a biological bomb. They had to find a testing site that was remote, uninhabited and isolated but accessible from the mainland.

Rumours began to spread on the mainland when sheep, cows and horses began dying strange deaths. The facts about what happened remained a mystery until the declassification of an MoD film 50 years later. It showed sheep being put in exposure crates facing the anthrax cloud. The film shows a small blast set off by remote control and then white powder moving on the wind. Within days all the sheep were dead. The experiment was deemed a success and the scientists returned to Porton Down - but the anthrax remained.

In an attempt to rid the island of anthrax spores, Porton Down instructed the heather be set on fire. It remained off limits and it was not until 24 years after the experiment that the warning signs even mentioned Anthrax. Porton Down experts checked the soil but the anthrax spores were "surprisingly resistant to degradation". In 1986, Gruinard was again a hive of activity as teams of scientists, vaccinated against anthrax and dressed in protective clothing, prepared to return the island to its natural state. They sprayed the soil with seawater and formaldehyde and it was again tested at Porton Down. Finally, on [24 Apr 1990], the MoD [Ministry of Defence] declared Gruinard anthrax free.

Government scientists carried out secret germ warfare testing during World War Two on Gruinard Island off the north west coast.

On [Sat 26 Mar 2022] night the uninhabited and since de-contaminated land was engulfed in flames.

Because of a Ministry of Defence operation that saw sheep exposed to lethal bacteria in tests to find a way of creating a biological weapon, it is also known as Anthrax Island. Dr. Thomas Smith, an expert in wildfire emissions and associate professor at the London School of Economics, has warned it is possible any remnant contamination with either toxic chemicals or bacteria could be transported in the smoke plume of such a fire. "Given the unique situation of this island regarding its history is that wildfires are known to 'volatilise' chemicals from the vegetation and soil such as those used in fertilisers," Dr. Smith told STV News. "We know that the smoke from wildfires can contain toxic elements such as mercury and arsenic, especially when fires burn over contaminated sites or places with a naturally high toxicity. There is also evidence that wildfire smoke can carry microbes such as bacteria and fungal spores, sometimes over many kilometres."

The island, which has remained uninhabited, was finally classified as anthrax-free in 1990 after a campaign by a group known as the Dark Harvest commandos to highlight the contamination of the soil during the 1980s.

A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesperson said: "Gruinard Island was decontaminated and deemed safe in 1987. "As part of the sale of the island in 1990, the MoD agreed to undertake further work, if necessary, within 150 years of its sale."

Both the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency told STV News that the blaze on Gruinard was outwith their remit. However, NHS Highland's public health team is aware of the fire and a spokesperson for the health board confirmed it was looking into the incident. "NHS Highland is aware of the fire on Gruinard Island (an anthrax site de-commissioned following de-contamination in 1990) and is working closely with The Scottish Government and other partner agencies," a spokesperson told STV News.

On [Sat 26 Mar 2022] night, the sky above Gruinard Island was lit up by flames in a sight eyewitnesses described as "apocalyptic". Gairloch Marine Wildlife said: "Those that visit regularly Gruinard Island (Anthrax Island) will be a familiar sight but it's never looked like this before. Muirburn or Arson? We don't know yet, but sad and destructive for the wildlife either way."

Anthrax is lethal, particularly when inhaled, and kills in almost all cases even if the victim receives medical treatment. The scientists from the Ministry of Defence's biological research centre Porton Down developed a biological weapon using anthrax spores following the experiments on Gruinard Island. The bacteria can remain active for decades and it took years before the island was finally decontaminated.

The blaze follows a wildfire warning across parts of the country from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters said the risk was "very high" as temperatures reached the high teens.

[It is possible that there might still be viable spores but the disinfection was very thorough and formaldehyde was injected deep into the peaty soil. Plus this fire may ignite the peat which would further discourage any spores. And remember any spores borne up in a hot smoke column will be further diluted in the travel downwind.

At the time of the Porton experiments in the early 1940s, it was rarely mentioned that there was an anthrax outbreak on a farm about 3 mi [5 km] away across the bay. It was isolated and with no other explanation than it resulted from spores blown across from one of the exploding mortar bombs. The island sheep corrals were heavily contaminated and to a depth of about one meter [3 ft], which was why it took time and much effort to be decontaminated. But as peat is acidic any surviving spores are long gone, thus the negative demonstrator soil samples. Sheep are grazed on the island and if there were an emergency there is an old building where a shepherd could spend the night, if he could not get back to the mainland harbour. - Mod.MHJ
