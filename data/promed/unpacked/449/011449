W135 invasive meningococcal infections imported from Sub-Saharan Africa to France, January to April 2012
-----------------------------
Authors: Parent du Chatelet I, Barboza P, Taha MK.

From January to April 2012, 16 cases of W135 invasive meningococcal infection were reported in France. Of these, 8 were linked to a recent travel history to Sub-Saharan Africa. These cases were reported in France concomitantly with the meningitis epidemic season in Sub-Saharan Africa. Considering the high number of travellers between France and West-African countries belonging to the so-called meningitis belt, the French recommendations for travellers stress the importance of vaccination before travelling to these countries.

In mid-February 2012, 2 W135 invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases were reported in 2 French regions (Pays de la Loire and Rhone-Alpes) in persons having recently returned from Senegal. The 1st case had arrived in France on [12 Feb 2012] and was hospitalised 3 days later. The 2nd case arrived on [19 Feb 2012] and was hospitalised on the same day. No connection could be established between the 2 cases but they had both visited the same region in Senegal (near Mbour) and they were both working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

In France, the annual mean incidence of IMD varies between 0.9 and 1.5 cases per 100 000 population. Cases are mainly due to serogroup B and C meningococci (65 percent and 27 percent respectively for the last 10 years). Serogroup W135 is rare in France; sporadic cases were reported in the 1990s (less than 5 cases per year) and they mainly belonged to the clonal complexes ST-11 and ST-22 (French National Reference Centre for Meningococci (NRCM), unpublished data). However, this serogroup underwent a clonal expansion in France and other European countries in 2000, during the 1st reported multinational outbreak of serogroup W135 _Neisseria meningitidis_ infections belonging to a particular clone of the ST-11 clonal complex. This outbreak started among pilgrims to Mecca and their contacts [1] and then affected Sub-Saharan countries (mainly Burkina Faso) [2,3]. Following a peak of incidence in 2002 with 42 reported cases, the incidence of W135 (ST-11) IMD cases decreased in France and the W135 cases were most frequently due to isolates belonging to the clonal complex ST-22 representing in 2011 less than 3 percent of the cases with known serogroup (14/542) (NRCM, unpublished data).

Investigation of W135 meningitis cases in 2012
----------------------
In 2012, the epidemic meningitis season, which coincides annually with the dry season between December and June, had already started in the so-called meningitis belt when the 2 W135 cases imported from Senegal were notified. Therefore we collected information regarding recent travel for all the W135 IMD cases that occurred in France since the beginning of the year [2012].

Between [1 Jan 2012 and 1 Apr 2012], a total number of 16 IMD cases were notified in France. This is an important increase if compared to the previous 5 years when only 4 to 8 W135 cases were reported each year during the 1st 5 months.

All 16 cases reported this year were laboratory-confirmed through isolation of _N. meningitidis_, positive PCR or detection of _N. meningitidis_ antigens. The median age of cases was 45 years (range: 2 months to 89 years) and the M:F ratio was 9:7. None of the 16 cases had been vaccinated with a tetravalent A/C/Y/ W135 meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine.

For 8 of the 16 cases, a link to Sub-Saharan Africa was identified: 2 had returned from Senegal in February [2012], one had arrived from Mali 4 days before the disease onset and one arrived from Senegal 15 days before the disease onset. The other 4 cases did not travel during their incubation period but a recent travel history was found for their close contacts: to Benin for one case, to Mali for 2 cases and to Senegal for one case with dates of return to France within the 3 weeks before the disease onset of the case. The purpose of travel was visiting friends and relatives for 6 cases or contacts and working for NGOs for two.

Considering an incubation period of 10 days, the dates of arrival in France and onset of the disease, 3 of the 8 cases could be considered as imported. The remaining 5 cases may have been infected by asymptomatic contacts carrying an imported strain. However, strains were not investigated among contacts.

Among the 8 cases, 4 cases presented with meningitis, 2 with pneumonia and septicaemia, one with arthritis, and one with pericarditis. No death was registered among the cases.

As of 24 May 2012, no other W135 IMD case has been notified since 1 April 2012.

All 8 'possibly import-related' W135 IMD cases were caused by the same strain, characterised at the NRCM in Paris by multilocus sequence typing, PorA variable regions (VR1 and VR2), penA and fetA genes. The antigenic formula was W135:2a:P1-5,2, the genetic typing showed porA VR1=5, VR2=2, fetA=F1-1, penA=1, and the strains were ST-11.

Conclusions
---------
The increase of serogroup W135 meningococcal disease incidence in France in early 2012 was concomitant to the meningitis epidemic season in Sub-Saharan Africa. From [1 Jan 2012 to 15 Apr 2012], almost 15 000 meningitis cases have been reported in West Africa to the World Health Organization. In some countries (e.g. Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Niger) the serogroup W135 was predominant among cases for which _N. meningitidis_ has been identified whereas serogroup A was predominant in other countries like Chad [4]. Serogroup W135 has increased in Niger in 2010 [5]. No laboratory results were available from Senegal.

The French NRCM typed 8 isolates from Cote d'Ivoire. These bacteria were isolated in February 2012 in 3 different districts of the country. All the isolates from France and Cote d'Ivoire shared the same tested markers (porA VR1=5, VR2=2, fetA=F1-1, penA=1, ST-11) (unpublished data). Eight other cases of W135 cases were also isolated in France during the same period but they reported no travel history during the previous 3 months. All these isolates also showed different markers (unpublished data).

Further investigations are required including typing isolates from other countries within the meningitis belt and comparing results with isolates from the previous years in order to help understanding this recent re-emergence of W135/ST-11 isolates. A long-lasting establishment of this serogroup in sub-Saharan African countries may prompt re-considering the vaccination strategies in the belt upon the introduction of the conjugate vaccine against serogroup A [6].

In the meantime, specific surveillance should be enhanced in Europe and recommendations for travellers who have contacts with population in high-incidence countries should be updated taking into account that non-pilgrimage-related travel is rarely associated with transmission and that the purposes of travel described above for the cases themselves or their asymptomatic contacts were visits to family members and friends or work for NGOs [7]. Since there are frequent travellers between France and West-African countries belonging to the meningitis belt, the French recommendations for travellers insist on the importance of vaccination with a quadrivalent A/C/Y/ W135 vaccine (preferably a conjugate vaccine) when travelling to these countries [8].

From [1 Jan 2012 to 17 Apr 2012] (epidemiologic week 17), outbreaks of meningococcal disease have been reported in 42 districts in 10 of the 14 countries of the African Meningitis Belt [with enhanced surveillance for meningococcal disease, which includes Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan and Togo]. These outbreaks have been detected as part of the enhanced surveillance.

The 10 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Sudan) reported a total of 11 647 meningitis cases including 960 deaths resulting in a case fatality ratio of 8.2 percent. The outbreaks were mainly caused by the W135 serogroup of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) bacteria.

In response to the outbreaks, the Ministries of Health implemented a series of preventive and control measures which included enhancement of surveillance, case management, sensitization of the population, strengthening of cross border collaboration and provision of vaccines through the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control (ICG).

The ICG released a total of 11 000 vials of antibiotic (Ceftriaxone) and 1 665 673 doses of vaccines to 6 countries [Table: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana, where Nm serogroup W135 is said to have caused the epidemic; and Chad and Sudan, where Nm serogroup A is said to have caused the epidemic] most affected by the epidemic, upon requests. The vaccines released include 919 023 doses of polysaccharide ACW/ACYW vaccine, 746 650 doses of meningitis A conjugate vaccine and 81 418 doses of polysaccharide AC vaccine.

The ICG is working with manufacturers and partners to ensure the stockpiles of the appropriate vaccines are maintained in sufficient quantities, for responding effectively to epidemics in the future. ICG partners include WHO, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

The emergency stockpile was established with the support of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). The vaccination campaigns were conducted with the support of MSF, UNICEF, IFRC, the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), and the United Nations through its Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation closely, in collaboration with partners and Ministries of Health in the affected countries.

[The sub-Saharan region of Africa is plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis. This region, known as the "African Meningitis Belt," stretches from the east to the west coast of Africa, and includes Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan and Togo (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to June), and every 8-12 years large outbreaks occur (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization: Meningococcal meningitis fact sheet: http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf).

The following is extracted from the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: (YO), susp. 20110524.1581:

"Epidemic thresholds are used to confirm the emergence of an epidemic in order to step up control measures, that is, mass vaccination and appropriate case management. For definitions of epidemic thresholds, see http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/6618.doc.

"To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). In 2009, meningococcal serogroups A and W135 were involved in outbreaks in Nigeria (see ProMED mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria (03)20090509.1731). These serogroups cause meningitis that is potentially vaccine-preventable. However, in 2010, a new strain (serogroup X) of meningococcal meningitis emerged in Burkina Faso that led to huge outbreaks in that country, with 46 percent (6/13) of the regions in the country being at epidemic level. Serogroup X is one of those for which no vaccine exists. Niger, which borders the Yobe State of Nigeria, also experienced cases due to serogroup X in 2010 and experienced an epidemic of meningitis due to this strain in 2006 (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa (02): WHO meningitis region. 20100426.1343)."

There are at least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_ based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135. Capsular polysaccharide or protein conjugate vaccines are available to immunize against disease caused by serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains.

The meningococcal protein conjugate polysaccharide vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved immune response in infants, provide long-lasting immunity, and prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_, thus reducing transmission of this microorganism person-to-person (see http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf). A preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and more enduring impact on attempts to control the yearly recurrences of this disease in Africa that causes considerable morbidity and mortality, especially among children (see http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19745499/102).

There is no polysaccharide vaccine for disease caused by serogroup B. Because serogroup B polysaccharide resembles the human neural cell adhesion molecule, the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic. A new protein-based, 4 component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine has been developed that is hoped will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).
