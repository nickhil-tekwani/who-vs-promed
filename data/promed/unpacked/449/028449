The Fish and Wildlife Service is investigating the deaths of
thousands of young white pelicans at the Chase Lake National Wildlife
Refuge in central North Dakota, a year after thousands of adult birds
abruptly left the refuge.
At least 8000 white pelican chicks may have died over the past 2
months, spokesman Ken Torkelson said.
"The difference is, last year the adults left first," Torkelson said.
"This year, the young have died and the adults have no reason to
stick around."
Severe storms or a disease outbreak may have caused the mass die-off
at the rookery, said Marsha Sovada, a biologist at the U.S.
Geological Survey's Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in
Jamestown.
"Because of weather and some apparent disease or disturbance of some
sort, we've seen a reduction of birds," Sovada said.
The Fish and Wildlife Service said an inspection of the refuge last
week indicated only about 500 chicks left from a nesting period that
could have produced as many as 9000 of them. The check also showed
all but about 2000 adults had left, from a population estimated at 18
850 in late May 2005.
Officials had hoped the refuge would return to normal after nearly 30
000 adult pelicans took off in 2004, leaving their young behind. A
check in late May indicated the pelicans were back, but officials
still could not pinpoint what caused last year's exodus. Now, they
have another mystery to solve.
The white pelican, one of the largest birds in North America, breeds
only once a year, and males and females take turns caring for their
young. The birds have a wingspan of nearly 10 feet and live about 25
years.
The white pelican colony at the 4385-acre Chase Lake National
Wildlife Refuge north of Medina has been the largest in North
America, peaking at 35 466 birds in 2000.
The pelicans normally stay at the Chase Lake refuge through
September, raising their young and feasting on crawfish, small fish
and foot-long salamanders from small ponds known as prairie potholes.
Samples have been sent to the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison,
Wisconsin, to try to find out what killed the young birds at Chase Lake.
Torkelson said that will take some time. "They have to rule out a lot
of diseases before they can pin down the correct one," he said.
The chicks that remain at the refuge are more than a month old, still being
cared for by adults, Torkelson said. "Typically, 2 hatch but only one
survives," Torkelson said. The chicks remaining at the refuge appear to be
healthy, Sovada said.
Biologists have attached backpack-like electronic tracking equipment
to 8 pelicans at Chase Lake to monitor their movements when they
leave the colony. 2 other pelicans were to be fitted with the
equipment.
Sovada said the pelicans fitted with tracking equipment are foraging
in the area, but have not returned to the rookery at Chase Lake.
Sovada said large die-offs of pelican chicks have been reported this
week at Medicine Lake National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Montana
and at Waubay National Wildlife Refuge in northeast South Dakota.
"I don't believe they are experiencing an exodus, but they are seeing
significant deaths of pelican chicks," Sovada said. "It could have no
relation to what's happening at Chase Lake."
Pelican nesting colonies in Montana, South Dakota and Minnesota also have had
high chick mortality rates in the past 3 years, Torkelson said.
He believes some of the pelicans will be back next year at Chase
Lake, but perhaps not in great numbers.
"I'd be surprised if zero came back and I'd be surprised if 30 000
came back," Torkelson said. "I think it will be somewhere in between."

[Previous investigations into breeding disturbances and die-offs in this same
area have been inconclusive. Nevertheless, as technology progresses, perhaps
there will be answers. The previous postings on this subject below give an
excellent summary of the earlier investigations.- Mod.TG]
[It is puzzling that no progress on diagnosis has been possible for similar
outbreaks dating back to at least 1998 -- see refs. below. - Mod.JW]
