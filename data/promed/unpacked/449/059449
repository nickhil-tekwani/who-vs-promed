Thank you for notifying abuse@oz.net of the problems caused by one of
our users. The user in question was contacted this afternoon and
admitted to spamming. As a result, his Internet access through oz.net
has been terminated effective immediately.
We do hope that this incident has not created an unreasonable hardship
for you, and apologize again for the spam you received from our user. If
you have any further comments, complaints, or issues, please send them
to abuse@oz.net or to sysop@oz.net. Thank you, and again, our apologies.
