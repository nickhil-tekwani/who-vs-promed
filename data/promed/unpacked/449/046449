Patient Diagnosed with Coronavirus Dies
---------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health announced the death of a patient diagnosed with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The case is the 3rd in its kind in the Sultanate after a full year from the 2 previous incidents.

In a statement that was released today [8 Jan 2015], the Ministry said that it continues its efforts to monitor and control the disease through the epidemic monitoring system in-force and the readiness of all referral hospitals to handle these cases.

The Ministry called on those handling animals, especially camels, to remain cautious. It advised those suffering from respiratory symptoms, such as flu, to follow healthy practices.

[As stated in the above release from the MOH Oman, this is the 3rd laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Oman since September 2012 (when the MERS-CoV isolation was announced -- see ProMED-mail post Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate 20120920.1302733). The 2 previous cases were reported in November and December 2013 respectively. Both cases had fatal outcomes. In addition, 2 other Omanis were diagnosed, treated and died in the UAE, one in November 2013, the other in March 2014 (see prior ProMED-mail posts referenced below). One of the cases diagnosed and treated in the UAE had a history of hospitalization in Oman prior to his admission to a hospital in the UAE. It was unclear if there was exposure to patients with a severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) while hospitalized in Oman. While these are small numbers of cases, the observation that all 3 reported cases to date had very severe clinical presentations has one wondering about the level of suspicion for MERS-CoV infections on the part of clinicians in Oman.

Studies have demonstrated MERS-CoV nucleic acid in Omani camels, and sequencing revealed these were closely related to human MERS-CoV sequences from the same geographical areas (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (41): Oman, animal reservoir, camel 20140426.2432011).

More information on the epidemiologic investigation on this case, such as demographics, possible high risk exposures (including possible exposure to other individuals with SARI), and travel history, would be greatly appreciated.

[There have now been 6 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2015. Three of these 6 cases (50 percent) were reported to be in Riyadh, where there have been approximately 172 cases reported since mid-March 2014. As of today's announcement (8 Jan 2015), there have been 831 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 358 deaths (case fatality rate 43.1 percent), reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012. The case reported today does not have a history of identified high risk exposures, but does have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, suggesting there may have been recent contact with the health sector.
