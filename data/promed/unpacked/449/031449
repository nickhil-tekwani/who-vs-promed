LASSA FEVER - SIERRA LEONE
==========================

Found the following while reading an internet healthcare news listing.

Lassa fever has killed nine people in eastern Sierra Leone. Physicians say
the outbreak is the worst on record there. Dr. Simon Mardel of the British
aid agency Medical Emergency Relief International (MERLIN) told Reuters by
telephone from Kenema that 74 sufferers had been admitted to hospital there
in February -- the highest number on record.
"This is clearly the worst (Lassa) epidemic -- and I mean epidemic in the
real sense -- in Sierra Leone to date. There has definitely been a rapid
deterioration recently," Mardel said.
The Lassa fever ward opened May, 1996 but there were 10 cases in February
199[7] and the annual average is usually around 35.
Lassa fever, spread by rat urine and feces or between humans, causes fever,
minor hemorrhaging, vomiting, chest pains and low blood pressure. It killed
about one in four people infected in 1996.
The disease is endemic in eastern Sierra Leone but Mardel blamed the surge on
poverty caused by almost five years of civil war and a rise in the rat
population.
"People don't have the mechanisms to destroy the rats or protect their food.
The human element of transmission has also increased because of overcrowding
and, as a result of the war, there is less access to health care," he said.
The only known cure, Ribavirin, a costly drug previously donated by the
United States is no longer produced there. "We have only one week's supply
left," Mardel said. "We are now looking for another source, maybe China or
Russia."
