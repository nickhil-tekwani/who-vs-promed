Health officials issue reminder to wash cantaloupe in wake of outbreak
State health officials issued a reminder to consumers to thoroughly wash
the outer skin of cantaloupes after an outbreak of _Salmonella_ poisoning
sickened at least 39 people in five Western states.
The poisoning, caused by an uncommon type of the bacteria known as
_Salmonella poona_, struck people in California, Oregon, New Mexico, Nevada
and Washington.
Nineteen people in 13 California counties across the state became ill
between April 14 and May 1, officials said Tuesday. The normal number of
cases reported is fewer than 4 per month.
In California, the outbreak mostly involved children 9 or younger. Most had
consumed tainted cantaloupe cut at home, although a few had eaten
cantaloupe that was precut and sold at supermarkets.
"Cantaloupe meat can become contaminated when it is sliced through
contaminated rind without prior scrubbing with soap and hot, running
water," state health director Diana Bonta said. "Consumers should handle
cantaloupe as they would handle raw meat: they should wash their hands
before and after handling the fruit and refrigerate unused cut portions
immediately." Cantaloupe has also been implicated in previous outbreaks of
[salmonellosis], including one involving 400 cases of _Salmonella poona_
[infection] in 1991.
_Salmonella poona_ causes the same illnesses as other types of
_Salmonella_. Symptoms -- which include fever, abdominal cramps and
diarrhea -- generally occur one to three days after eating tainted food and
will last two to five days.
