Virus that causes grapevine red blotch disease identified
---------------------------------------------------------
New DNA sequencing technology has been used to identify the virus that causes red blotch, a disease that discolors grape leaves in fall and lowers sugar levels in grapes.

"The most urgent research need now is to determine how the virus spreads," said Deborah Golino, University of California (UC). "Due to the distribution of the virus in many parts of the United States and evidence that it can be transmitted by grafting, we suspect that red blotch disease is widespread wherever grapes are grown."

She reported that red blotch disease has been identified among both young and mature vineyards. The virus, [preliminarily] called grapevine red blotch-associated virus or GRBaV, likely can be found in all types of grapevines, including rootstock, table, and raisin grapes, but was 1st detected in wine grapes because they are carefully monitored for sugar content. A virus almost genetically identical also was found in Canada.

Golino said that the Foundation Plant Services' vineyard block used for producing disease-free scion and rootstock vines, has been partially tested and appears to have a very low level of red blotch. Only 3 of the 1600 vines tested to date were found to have the virus. Testing of all of the vines in the Foundation vineyard, the source of the majority of grapevine nursery stock in California, is slated for completion in the months to come. "Growers need clean plant material."

[Grapevine red blotch (GRB) has been identified recently as a syndrome that affects fruit ripening in the US. It does not appear to be a new disease, but is likely to have escaped detection because its symptoms resemble leafroll disease (associated with several viruses within the family _Closteroviridae_; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Symptoms of GRB appear in autumn when leaves normally would turn shades of yellow. They may include irregular red(ish) blotches on leaf blades, pink or red veins, occasional reddening of leaf blades, as well as slow accumulation of sugars or failure to mature in fruits. It is not known if there are any effects on fruit yield or plant longevity. Symptoms differ from leafroll disease in that the leaf margins do not roll downwards.

The disease has been shown to be graft transmissible. The new virus is thought to be a likely member of the family _Geminiviridae_, but final taxonomy still requires complete characterisation. The virus has been detected in the host before appearance of symptoms and also in dormant canes. Like many viruses (and viroids) of mainly vegetatively propagated hosts, the new virus may have been spread widely with host varieties and therefore may be present outside the US as well.

Disease management of grapevine viruses may include phytosanitation such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. As stated above, use of certified clean planting material, including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting, is essential.
