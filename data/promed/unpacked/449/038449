Case Count Update
-----------------
As of 15 Dec 2014, a total of 111 persons infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis have been reported from 12 states. Since the last update on 4 Dec 2014, 24 additional ill persons have been reported from Connecticut (1), Maine (1), Maryland (5), New Hampshire (2), New York (7), Pennsylvania (7), and Rhode Island (1).

Illness onset dates range from 30 Sep 2014 to 12 Nov 2014. Ill persons range in age from younger than 1 year to 83 years, with a median age of 34 years. 64 percent of ill persons are female. Among 74 persons with available information, 19 (26 percent) have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 17 Nov 2014 might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks. Please see the Timeline for Reporting Cases of Salmonella Infection [http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/reporting_timeline.html] for more details.

Investigation
-------------
Collaborative investigation efforts of state, local, and federal public health and regulatory agencies indicate that bean sprouts produced by Wonton Foods, Inc. are the likely source of this outbreak. In interviews, 48 (66 percent) of 73 ill persons reported eating bean sprouts or menu items containing bean sprouts in the week before becoming ill.

Wonton Foods, Inc. continues to cooperate with state and federal public health and agriculture officials. On 21 Nov 2014, Wonton Foods Inc. agreed to destroy any remaining products while they conducted a thorough cleaning and sanitization and implemented other Salmonella control measures. On 24 Nov 2014, the firm completed the cleaning and sanitation and resumed production of bean sprouts. The firm resumed shipment on 29 Nov 2014.

Contaminated bean sprouts produced by Wonton Foods, Inc. are likely no longer available for purchase or consumption given the maximum 12-day shelf life of mung bean sprouts.

CDC recommends that consumers, restaurants, and other retailers always practice food safety for sprouts Children, older adults, pregnant women, and persons with weakened immune systems should avoid eating raw sprouts of any kind (including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean sprouts). Cook sprouts thoroughly to reduce the risk of illness. Cooking sprouts thoroughly kills any harmful bacteria.

[Given the limited shelf life of these bean sprouts, it is not likely that cases will continue to occur but some reporting of previous cases may well increase the overall numbers. The cases remain localized to the northeastern USA except for a Montana case which was infected in the northeast as well.
