Macau health authorities have acted to prevent huge quantities of
vegetables from being imported to the enclave after six cholera cases were
detected.
Tough measures were announced [27 Jul 1998] to confiscate "unreasonable"
quantities of imported vegetables. Since Saturday, Marine Police at the
Barrier Gate near the border with Zhuhai have been carrying out checks on
vegetables after the cholera outbreak,
considered the most serious in recent years.
Many housewives living in the northern district near the mainland border
take consumer products - including wine, soap and beer - to Zhuhai for sale
each day, returning with vegetables and fresh fish for sale and their own
consumption.
