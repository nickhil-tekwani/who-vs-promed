An outbreak of cholera in Opuama and Tsekelewu communities in the
Warri North Local Government Area of Delta State has reportedly
claimed about 5 lives, causing panic in the area. The epidemic, said
to have broken out last weekend, has been linked to bad drinking
water and an offensive odor from the shallow stream in the area.
Chairman of the Egbema Community Development Committee, Mr Evans
Abulu, who confirmed the incident via telephone, said: "There is this
cholera outbreak in Opuama and Tsekelewu and environs. It happened
about 2 days ago (Fri, 23 Dec 2005) and 5 persons have died. We are
working seriously so that we can send some health officers down
there."
Opuama and Tsekelewu had experienced a similar cholera outbreak in
2002, which claimed some lives before it was brought under control.
Another incident in Oshimili South Local Governmenet Area in Dec 2004
had also claimed over 17 lives, including that of a 70-year-old man.

[2] Cholera - Zambia (Lusaka)

The number of cholera cases in Zambia has almost quadrupled since Nov
2005, reaching 900, with the bulk of infections being in the capital,
Health Minister Sylvia Masebo said. Masebo said cases had shot up
from 233 -- of which 7 were fatal -- in Nov 2005 to the latest figure
as a result of the onset of the rainy season, which has helped the
water-borne disease to spread.
"About 90 percent of the cases have been recorded in Lusaka. We are
urging people to avoid unnecessary gatherings to prevent the further
spread of the disease," Masebo said Tue, 27 Dec 2005. She added that
an updated fatality figure was not yet available.
Masebo said the government had opened up cholera centers where those
affected have been quarantined.

Heavy rains have exacerbated a cholera outbreak in Zambia, where at
least 6 people have died and more than 1000 cases have been recorded.
Zambia's ministry of health confirmed on Wed, 28 Dec 2005, that 1144
cases of cholera have been reported since the outbreak began in Aug
2005, with the numbers rising sharply in the last week.
A ministry of health official told IRIN the epidemic was mainly
concentrated in urban areas. "Most of the cholera cases are from [the
capital] Lusaka. Cases are increasing everyday due to the sanitation
and water problems we have at this time of the year [during the rainy
season]," the official noted.
Apart from the 6 confirmed cholera-related deaths, a further 6 deaths
were still to be confirmed.
The health and local government ministries were in crisis talks in a
bid to prevent a repeat of the 2004 cholera epidemic, which claimed
over 100 lives. In 2004, the government closed large markets, such as
Soweto in Lusaka, and restricted movement from areas affected by
cholera.

At least 3 people have died and over 10 are undergoing treatment due
to a fresh outbreak of cholera at Kaiso Landing Site on Lake Albert
in Buseruka sub-county, Hoima district.
According to Kaiso LCI Chairman Henry Irumba, the 3 were buried on
Wed, 28 Dec 2005. Irumba asked the District Director of Health
services, Dr Joseph Ruyonga, to intervene. He attributed the outbreak
to unsafe water at the lake and lack of facilities to purify water
for drinking.
By the time of filing this story, the District Director of Health
Services was not in office, and his number could not be reached. But
the District Health Inspector, Mr Christopher Asiimwe, said they
would dispatch a health team to conduct health education and also
treat the patients.

The cholera epidemic in Bwaise has increased due to flooding. The
(LC2) chairperson Bwaise 3 Parish, Kawempe division, Hajati Nuruh
Balinda Nakanjako, has said people living along the water channels
dump garbage in the channels and others empty their toilets into the
channels. "Bwaise 3 is mostly affected because this is where garbage
from different places gathers, causing floods," Nakanjako said.
She was speaking during a project to clear the Nsooba drainage at
Katoogo zone. Nakanjako criticised Kawempe division authorities for
not fulfilling their promise of clearing the channels every 3 months.

Guinea-Bissau's government has declared that the worst of the cholera
epidemic, which ravaged the country in the second half of 2005, is
over -- for now.
"The cholera threat in our country is passing but we have to remain
vigilant if we want to avoid a resurgence in Guinea-Bissau," said
Public Health Minister Antonia Mendes Teixeira, at the country's
biggest hospital on Tue, 27 Dec 2005.
She said that the last 3 weeks have brought no new cases of the
disease, which according to a new health ministry report, affected 25
111 people and killed 399 since the epidemic began in June 2005.
Nevertheless, special medical teams deployed to each of the country's
health districts to help stem the tide of the disease will remain in
place.
