This notice identified the contaminant:
"....an ongoing investigation revealed the presence of _Methylobacterium thiocyanatum_, an alpha proteobacterial class, aerobic Gram negative rod. The microbe is a common airborne organism and is a rare cause of human infections. The species can cause infection in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Sensitivity analysis is still pending.

A literature search suggests that _Methylobacterium spp_ are susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin (see below) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and have various levels of susceptibility to the beta-lactam antibiotics (due to beta-lactamase production) with high sensitivity to ceftriaxone, ceftrizoxime and imipenem. However, the drug resistance patterns suggest that _M. thiocyanatum_ are resistant to aztreonam and ciprofloxacin. Antibiotic sensitivities of the _M. thiocyanatum_ isolated from Synvisc-One lot 7RSL021 are being determined at present.

This recalled lot was distributed in the USA between 25 Oct 2017 and 7 Nov 2017.

Several variables were noted in some areas: People were affected by change of climate ad weather; cold/warmth could trigger some response pain in joints, possibly people were subject to arthritis and other muscle/joint diagnoses lately.

I've seen several cases of visible inflammation along with cuts and or a harsh bruising, also with patients describing as pain around joint regions. I would not rule out common dermatology issues.

Could this possibly be a result of an allergic reaction triggered when a medicine [injected into the joint] reacted negatively to extreme weather temperatures?

[ProMED-mail thanks Joshua Rogers for his comments and the many other Epicore Global Surveillance Project members who responded with information. We await more information regarding the adverse reactions noted in the initial posting.

Most recalls of food or medications related to contamination by microbes are not reported by ProMED-mail unless human infections result, except for botulism because of the substantial health risk.

Lai and colleagues [1] have reported on human infections caused by unusual _Methylobacterium_ species. All 5 of the 6 infections were hospital-acquired and were intravenous catheter-related (the community-acquired infection was thought to be a primary bacteremia) and all had a favorable outcome. Two of the 6 including the community-acquired isolate were identified as _M. thiocyanatum_. A 2nd single case report of _M. thiocyanatum_ human infection was found in the Spanish literature [2] and was also related to an intravenous catheter.
