The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has established a policy to vaccinate pigs raised in pig farms against classical swine fever [CSF] following the spread of this epidemic livestock disease. It is thought that the inoculation will be limited to areas where CSF outbreaks have been confirmed, mainly on domestic pig farms.

CSF returned to Japan in September 2018, when confirmed after its absence for the previous 26 years. The virus was initially spreading in the Chubu region; most of the cases concentrated in Gifu [one of the 9 prefectures included in Chubu]. However, the confirmation of CSF earlier this month [September 2019], also in the Saitama prefecture in domestic pigs, led to the decision to apply vaccinations to domestic pigs to prevent further spread of the disease.

[Since the start of the CSF epizootic in Japan, a total of 966 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE, by far most of them in wild boar, which further infected domestic pigs. This was recorded on 41 farms and a slaughterhouse.

The 2 recent outbreaks, on a farm in Saitama and a slaughterhouse in Yamanashi, were reported to the OIE (follow-up report no. 35) on 13 Sep 2019. Links to all 36 reports and an interactive OIE map presenting all CSF outbreaks in domestic pigs and wild boar are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27871.

Wild boar are vaccinated by oral vaccine baits; information on the efficacy of this operation will be useful. Until now, the use of CSF vaccine in domestic pigs was prohibited in Japan. The above reported change of policy is dramatic, reflecting the severity of the situation, more than a year after the commencement of the event. - Mod.AS
