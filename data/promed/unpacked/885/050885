Chagas disease exists only on the American continent. It is estimated that
16-18 million people are infected by _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (the parasite that
causes Chagas disease) and that 121 million people (25% of the population
of Latin America) are at risk of acquiring the infection. There are 2
stages of the human disease: the acute stage which appears shortly after
the infection and the chronic stage which may last several years and
irreversibly affects internal organs such as the heart, esophagus, colon
and the peripheral nervous system.
Chagas disease is an endemic parasitic disease in Chile where vectorial
domiciliary transmission is effected by triatomine insects. There are 2
main species of triatomines responsible for the vectorial transmission of
Chagas disease in Chile: _Triatoma infestans_ which is a domestic insect
and the most important vector, and _T. spinolai_ that does not have a good
vectorial capacity and is found only in sylvatic environments more than
500m above sea level. The other means of transmission is through infected
blood transfusion. The important progress made towards interruption of
transmission of Chagas disease in Chile has already been reported.
Entomological and sero-epidemiological data from 1997 support the fact of
the elimination of transmission of Chagas disease and an independent
commission will be appointed to certify this.
According to WER this data ranks Chile as the second member country of the
Southern Cone countries initiative after Uruguay that would accomplish the
goals set by the ministries of health of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Paraguay and Uruguay for the interruption of vectorial and transfusional
transmission of Chagas disease.
