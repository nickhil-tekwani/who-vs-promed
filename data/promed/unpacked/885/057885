Comment on temperature control in smallpox therapy
----------------------------------------------------
I have never seen a case of smallpox and hope to retain my inexperience. I
have been struck, however, by several points in literature reviews. The
rash first "appears on the mucosa of the mouth and pharynx, face, and
forearms," and "except for the lesions in the skin and mucous membranes and
reticulum cell hyperplasia, other organs are seldom involved" (1). The
ceiling temperature of smallpox virus [variola virus on chick allantoic
membrane is 37.5-38.5 degrees Celsius (2). "The seasonal occurrence of
smallpox...was highest during winter and early spring" (1).
Is it possible that variola virus is a temperature sensitive virus at
clinically safe levels of fever? Smallpox is a febrile illness, but would
maintaining skin temperature (in addition to core temperature) at 39 to 40
degrees C be a useful adjunct to other therapy? Should nursing care include
dressing the patient in thermal underwear, warm socks, gloves, a ski mask,
and eye patches; furnishing ample blankets or even active warming;
providing heated mist to inhale; and avoiding antipyretics in an attempt to
deny the virus superficial sites that are cool enough for optimal replication?
These speculations do not alter the need to maintain appropriate
vaccination and evaluation of candidate antiviral drugs at the center of
any strategy to respond to a reintroduction of smallpox. However, if it
were helpful, keeping the skin, conjunctivae, and upper airway as warm as
tolerated would be a measure that could be applied immediately at home by
anyone at risk while the authorities were carrying out the mobilization,
delivery, and administration of more specific measures.
