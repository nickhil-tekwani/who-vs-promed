[1] Indonesia - 72nd case and pet bird contact

Indonesia: Woman may have been infected by pet eagle
-----------------------------------------------
A Jakarta housemaid who had looked after a pet eagle has died from
bird flu, marking Indonesia's 72nd confirmed death from this virus
infection, a health ministry official said on Wednesday [4 Apr 2007].
Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country, has had more deaths
from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza than any other nation. An
additional 20 people confirmed to have the virus have [survived].
Muhammad Nadirin of the Health Ministry's bird flu center told
Reuters that 2 tests on the 23-year-old housemaid from south Jakarta,
who died on 1 Apr 2007, confirmed she had bird flu. "Her master keeps
an eagle at home; she took care of the bird," Nadirin said. He said
authorities had yet to determine whether the eagle had the virus,
although a number of fowl in the area had suddenly died.
Humans who contract bird flu have generally had contact with infected
fowl. The virus is endemic among fowl in many parts of Indonesia,
where millions of people keep a few chickens or other domesticated
birds in their yards.
Although avian flu still mainly affects birds, experts fear that if
the H5N1 strain mutates into a form easily transmitted from person to
person, it could sweep the world, killing millions. Human deaths have
been reported in countries from Asia to the Middle East and Africa,
with the global toll approaching 200 [As of 4 Apr 2007, the WHO has
confirmed 288 cases and 170 deaths. - Mod.CP].

Kuwait: 4 Bangladeshi cullers suspected to have contracted bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Preliminary tests for bird flu infection were positive on 4
Bangladeshi workers who had been culling infected chickens in Kuwait,
a medical source said on Wednesday [4 Apr 2007], but they have not
been officially confirmed. These would be the 1st cases of bird flu
affecting humans in Arab nations of the Gulf.
"The 1st test on the 4 men was positive," the source told AFP,
requesting anonymity. "We have taken blood samples for a 2nd test to
reconfirm the initial results. We expect the outcome within hours. If
the outcome is reconfirmed as positive, we will have to send blood
samples to the World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory in Cairo
for a final confirmation," the source said.
The Health Ministry spokesman Ahmad Al-Shatti told AFP an official
statement would be made on Thursday [5 Apr 2007], after tests results
were reviewed, as to whether the 4 were indeed infected. The ministry
said specimens "have been sent to the World Health Organization (WHO)
reference laboratory in Egypt for confirmation. "These measures are
in line with recommendations by WHO for guidelines for the diagnosis
and announcement of bird flu cases in humans," he said.
The 4 workers were admitted to Kuwait's infectious diseases hospital
with flu-like symptoms on Tuesday [3 Apr 2007]. The men have been
isolated in a special ward and were still at the hospital on
Wednesday [4 Apr 2007].
Since the outbreak of bird flu in [poultry] in Kuwait, 22 people have
been admitted to hospital on suspicion of being infected but later
discharged after confirming they were healthy.
The Bangladeshis were part of official teams culling and burying
hundreds of thousands of chickens in Wafra, south of Kuwait City on
the Saudi border. Kuwait has culled about 1.7 million birds, most of
them egg-laying chickens in 4 commercial poultry farms, since
confirming in February 2007 an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the
bird flu virus, which is dangerous to humans. A total of 106 cases of
the strain have so far been confirmed in birds.
In November 2005, the Gulf state announced the 1st case of a bird
infected with the H5N1 strain, a flamingo at a seaside villa. The
H5N1 strain, the most aggressive form, has killed 170 people
worldwide, according to WHO, and seen millions of birds destroyed.

[In general, despite the high level of exposure to bird flu
infection, those involved in culling operations have only rarely
become infected. Therefore, it is unlikely on the basis of past
experience that any of these 4 Bangladeshis will be confirmed as
human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP]
