In a letter, the St. Gallen cantonal doctor Dr. Markus Betschart [appealed] to all doctors in the canton that when asylum seekers present with scabies and bacterial infections as skin problems they should be especially observed.

"GPs increasingly treat asylum seekers, and we want to make them aware of scabies and the treatment options," explained Betschart in his letter.

An accumulation of scabies was confirmed by GP Reto Gross, who regularly deals with refugees from the reception center Altstaetten. In 2015 dozens of cases have been treated. And he sees only a fraction of the asylum seekers, who seek out various other doctors in the region.

Scabies is a parasitic skin disease that is caused by the scabies mite (_Sarcoptes scabiei_). The female mites burrow into the skin, where they leave droppings and lay their eggs, resulting in irritation.

Scabies is transmitted by intimate physical contact, such as when you sleep in the same bed, but also in unhygienic conditions. "For an infection you have to come very close," says Gross. He knew of no cases of employees in the processing center having been infected. The scabies mites also like to embed themselves in clothes and linens.

The skin disease [produces] an itchy rash. Particularly affected are hands, nipples, armpits and genitals. It is especially unpleasant at night. The problem arises when the patient scratches a great deal, when the bubbles can open and become infected. "Because I've seen severe cases," says Gross.

Treatment for scabies is a cream [that contains a pyrethroid insecticide]. "You take a shower, apply the cream all over your body and leave it for 8 hours, preferably overnight," says Gross. In addition, clothes and bedding must be washed to at least 60 degrees [centigrade] to kill the mites.

Scabies mites are not the only 'bugs' to be combatted; bed bugs are also plaguing asylum seekers. The Migration Office of St. Gallen has developed a containment strategy: "If we accept asylum seekers from the federal government, we [require them] to leave all their clothes. These we freeze for 48 hours," says Urs Weber, Head of the St. Gallen Department of Migration Centres.

[Scabies mites do not transmit any infections. However, an epidemic of scabies signals very poor hygienic conditions with limited access to personal hygiene like washing and clean clothes.

Other vector-borne diseases are a concern in such conditions. Human lice may transmit _Rickettsia prowazeki_ (typhus), _Bartonella quintana_ (trench fever), and _Borrelia recurrentis_ (louse-borne relapsing fever). These infections have not been seen in Europe since the end of World War II, but there are now reports of relapsing fever in asylum seekers (see proMED reports below). The surge of scabies among asylum seekers and indeed the reports of louse-borne infections in the same group underline that if these conditions continue there is a risk of outbreaks. The coming winter will aggravate the situation. - Mod.EP
