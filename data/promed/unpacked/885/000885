(1) Epidemiology
Further to the recent ProMED-mail post on the hand, foot & mouth disease
(HFMD) situation in Japan: our official publication (IASR) provides back
ground information on HFMD in Japan. See Vol. 19.7 (No.221), 1998. The full
text, figures and tables are available on our website
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/19/221/tpc221.html>.
Up-dated information on HFMD (and other notifiable infectious diseases in
Japan) are also shown on our website <http://idsc.nih.go.jp/index.html> in
English; click Disease Trends (IDWR- Infectious Disease Weekly Report) and
Infectious Agents Report (IASR- Infectious Agents Surveillance Report).
Our up-dated surveillance data show that the disease trend of HFMD is large
in 2000, following on a large scale epidemic in 1995, [which was the
largest in the last 10 years. About 3000 pediatric sentinels from all of
Japan reported 17 510 cases of HFMD in 28 weeks. Public health laboratories
isolated 34 strains of enterovirus 71 (EV71), 25 of Coxsackie virus A16
(CA16) and 4 of others such as CA6, CA9, Coxsackie virus B5 (CB5) and
echovirus 25 (Hand-foot-and-mouth disease; extracted from Vol.19 No.7,
1998).
The trend of HFMD cases during the period from 1982 through 1997 in this
country according to the National Epidemiological Surveillance of
Infectious Diseases is shown in Fig. 1. A large-scale epidemic occurred
recently in 1995. Although the peak of the epidemic is usually seen in
summer, this figure indicates the occurrence of HFMD also from autumn to
winter. The incidence of HFMD during 1993-1997 by prefectures is shown in
Fig. 3. The incidence differed from one prefecture to another every year;
nevertheless this disease is seen usually in all districts. As seen in Fig.
4, HFMD patients aged 2 years or less accounted for half of all patients.
The initial clinical diagnoses of the patients from whom the [predominant
viral agents of HFMD, CA16, EV71, or CA10, were isolated at prefectural and
municipal public health institutes (PHIs) were recorded (Table 1).
For those yielding CA16, HFMD was the most frequent [diagnosis accounting
for 89%, followed by herpangina 3.3%. For those yielding EV71, HFMD was the
most frequent [diagnosis accounting for 83%, followed by meningitis 11%,
and herpangina 1.2%. By contrast, for those yielding CA10, herpangina was
the most frequent [diagnosis accounting for 79%, HFMD being infrequent
accounting for 16%, and meningitis 2.6%. From the monthly isolation of each
virus after 1982 (Fig. 2), it is apparent that isolation of either CA16 or
EV71 was frequent, in agreement with the high prevalence of HFMD patients,
but the frequency of CA10 isolation [did not reflect the incidence of
HFMD. The epidemics occurring 3 years ago [and in 1995 were caused by
CA16; EV71 was isolated mainly in 1997 (see p. 153 of this report).
(2) Complications of HFMD
There was an HFMD epidemic of slightly smaller scale than usual in Osaka
City, in 1997. In this epidemic, 3 sudden deaths of children [associated
with HFMD or EV71 infection were reported (see IASR, Vol. 19, No. 3,
1998). The viruses isolated at Osaka PHI were subjected to nucleotide
sequencing at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). The
nucleotide sequences were compared with those of previous isolates. The
EV71 strains isolated in the past one or two years in Japan were grouped
largely into 2 [groups: the major and minor genotypes. The EV71 strain
isolated from a fatal case in Osaka City was identified as the minor
genotype. The EV71 strains isolated last year in Sarawak also resembled the
minor genotype (see p. 152 of this issue).
According to the reports to IASR, encephalitis was diagnosed in 14 of 2337
cases from which EV71 was isolated during the period from 1982 to 1997. In
1993, a fatal case complicated with encephalitis in the course of HFMD was
reported in Toyama Prefecture (see IASR, Vol. 14, No. 11, 1993). Recent
reports published or presented at academic meetings demonstrated serious
complications of HFMD; a case of localized encephalitis presumably due to
EV71 infection (serodiagnosed) in Okayama Prefecture in 1995 (Infection and
Immunity in Childhood, 10: 19-22, 1998), 7 cases of encephalitis presumably
due to EV71 infection (serodiagnosed) in Shiga Prefecture in 1997 (Annual
Meeting of Japan Pediatric Society, 1998), and 15 cases of acute cerebellar
ataxia in Osaka Prefecture in 1997 (Annual Meeting of Japanese Society of
Child Neurology, 1998).
Since May 1998, deaths seemingly due to HFMD or EV71 infection have
increased among infants and young children in Taiwan (see p. 160 of this
issue). NIID and its counterparts in Taiwan are exchanging information and
[developing a joint research project on the viral agents. According to
Taiwanese health authorities, HFMD or suspected cases registered as fatal
ones numbered 50 and severe ones 248 as of June 24. The ages of these cases
peaked at 1 to 3 years and ranged from 0 to 15 years. The health
authorities decided on intensifying general public health measures,
discouraging holding events for children (e. g., camping), intensifying
surveillance, and starting active epidemiological investigations. The
Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare immediately [reported the
incidence of HFMD in Taiwan as well as in Malaysia and Japan to the Japan
Medical Association on June 8, 1998. HFMD is fundamentally a mild disease,
healing spontaneously, with a good prognosis, and accompanied very rarely
with serious complications. Nevertheless, careful monitoring of the
incidence of HFMD in the coming summer in Japan and of the virus agents
(CA16 and EV71) seems to be very important. The Infectious Disease
Surveillance Center provides information on the incidence of HFMD and virus
isolation by prefectures on a homepage
