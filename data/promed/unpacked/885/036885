Bacteria-tainted oysters from Galveston Bay have sickened 368 people, state
health officials said as they released updated figures on the nation's
worst outbreak from raw oysters. Of those made ill by the _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ bacteria, 66 cases have been confirmed by laboratories,
said Doug McBride, a Texas Health Department spokesman.

The rest are clinical cases that meet the definition for the illness, he
said. The latest figures were released Thursday as experts prepared for a
national conference to study the outbreak and seek remedies.

The Pacific Northwest last summer recorded 209 lab-confirmed cases of
illness caused by the same bacteria in oysters harvested in that region.

Galveston Bay was closed to oyster harvesting on June 26. Officials say
most of the illnesses in the outbreak were in Texas, but cases were
confirmed in Florida, Oklahoma, Georgia, Tennessee, Colorado and California.

The illness can be fatal for someone with an immune deficiency. A few have
required hospitalization, officials said. Most who became ill suffered
flu-like symptoms such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever and
headache.
