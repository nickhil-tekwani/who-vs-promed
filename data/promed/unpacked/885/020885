CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in many states and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Animal Care Program (USDA-APHIS-AC) to investigate an outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections linked to hedgehogs purchased from multiple breeders. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA "fingerprints" of salmonellae are obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE.

Contact with hedgehogs can be a source of human salmonellosis. The bacteria are shed in their droppings and can easily contaminate their bodies and anything in areas where these animals live and roam. You should always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching hedgehogs or anything in the area where they live and roam. Adults should supervise hand washing for young children.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
As of 5 Sep 2012, a total of 14 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium have been reported from 6 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Indiana (1), Michigan (3), Minnesota (2), Ohio (2), and Washington (5). The outbreak strain has been rarely seen in the past.

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 26 Dec 2011 and 13 Aug 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than 1 year to 62 years, and 50 percent of ill persons are 10 years of age or younger. 62 percent of ill persons are female. Among 10 ill persons with available information, 3 (30 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. All 10 ill persons interviewed reported contact with hedgehogs or their environments before becoming ill. Some ill persons specifically mentioned contact with African pygmy hedgehogs. Investigations are ongoing to determine the type and source of hedgehogs that might be linked with illness. Ill persons with available purchase information reported purchasing pet hedgehogs from multiple breeders in several states.

USDA-APHIS-AC [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Animal Care] is currently conducting traceback investigations of hedgehogs purchased from USDA-licensed breeders linked to ill persons. In addition, state health departments have tested environmental and hedgehog samples collected from ill persons' homes. 2 environmental samples from areas where hedgehogs lived or were bathed in patient households yielded the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium.

[A hedgehog (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog) is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae and the order Erinaceomorpha. There are 17 species of hedgehog in 5 genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and New Zealand (by introduction). There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas. Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (order Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated rodent porcupines and monotreme echidnas.

The name hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English heyghoge, from heyg, hegge ("hedge"), because it frequents hedgerows, and hoge, hogge ("hog"), from its piglike snout. Other names include urchin, hedgepig, and furze-pig.
