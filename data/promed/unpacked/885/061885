Macau
--------
Dengue fever cases hit 415: disease past its peak and under control,
say health authorities
-----------------------------------------
The number of people confirmed to have dengue fever in Macau had risen
to 415 since the first cases were reported late last month, the
enclave's Health Services Bureau said yesterday. The bureau insisted,
however, that the situation was under control.
Macau first reported the disease on 30 Aug 2001 when it confirmed 14
cases & 19 suspected ones -- the first time dengue fever had been
officially recorded there. The 415 confirmations were reported between
30 Aug & 17 Sep 2001, bureau director Dr Koi Kuok-ieng said.
Dr Koi said the situation was "now under control", claiming the
incidence of cases "passed its peak earlier this month". He also said
the Government had not released daily updates "because we did not want
to alarm the population". He said the outbreak was a "normal type",
stressing there had been no reported cases of the more serious
haemorrhaging dengue fever. He said 61 people were still being treated
at Macau's 2 hospitals, the others had recovered and had been
discharged.
Dr Koi could not say how many of the cases might have been imported
and how many were contracted locally. Another Health Services Bureau
official said 415 confirmed cases within a population of 440 000 was
"still quite small".
Hong Kong
---------------
In Hong Kong, authorities sought to ease worries about a possible
dengue fever outbreak. As of 30 Aug 2001, no locally contracted case
had been reported, with all 8 cases imported, the Department of Health
said. Anyone returning from a dengue-infected area and falling sick
within a month should consult a doctor and give a complete travel
history, it said.
A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said
efforts to rid Hong Kong of dengue-carrying mosquitoes had paid off.
Mosquito breeding grounds had been targeted in a campaign that will
run until 3 Nov 2001.
