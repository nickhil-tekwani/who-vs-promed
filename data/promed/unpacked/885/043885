Horse Stabled at Tennessee Walking Horse National
Celebration Tested Positive for Rabies
Nashville, September 8, 2006
Officials with the Tennessee Department of Health
are notifying persons who attended the Tennessee
Walking Horse National Celebration in Shelbyville
of a confirmed case of rabies in a horse stabled
on the grounds during the event. The horse was
not involved in any of the Celebration competitions.
The horse originated from Missouri and was a
3-year-old gelding (neutered male horse),
buckskin (cream to tan) in color with a black
mane and tail. The horse was described as
�small,� standing approximately 14 hands (or 56
inches) at the withers, which is the area near
the base of the mane. During the event, the horse
was ridden on the grounds by owners and was
stabled in barn number 50 on the Celebration
grounds. Illness was first noted in the horse on
[23 Aug 2006]. Over the next few days, the horse
developed severe neurological signs, and as a
result was euthanized. Persons directly involved
in the care of the horse are being contacted and
are being assessed for possible rabies exposure
and the need for rabies post-exposure treatment.
�Rabies is transmitted mainly through bite wounds
from an infected animal. In some cases it may be
transmitted through fresh open cuts in the skin
or onto mucous membranes such as the eyes, mouth
or nose from the saliva of a rabid animal,� said
Public Health Veterinarian John Dunn with the
Tennessee Department of Health. �However,
attending an event where a rabid animal was
present, petting a rabid animal or contact with
the blood, urine or feces of a rabid animal does
not constitute a risk for transmission.�
The Tennessee Department of Health is requesting
that persons who attended the Tennessee Walking
Horse National Celebration between 23
Aug [2006]and 31 Aug [2006] call its Public
Information Line 1-866-355-6129 if they possibly
had contact with this horse and any of the
following occurred during their visit to the Celebration.
If an individual:
was bitten by a horse;
had contamination of a fresh open wound with saliva from a horse; or
had saliva from a horse come in contact with
eyes, nose, mouth or other mucous membranes.
The Tennessee Department of Health Public
Information Line (1-866-355-6129) will be
available beginning at 10 p.m. tonight.

[Letter to Walking Horse National Celebration attendees]
10 Sep 2006
Dear Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration attendee,
You are receiving this letter to notify you about
a confirmed case of rabies in a horse stabled on
the grounds during the 2006 Tennessee Walking
Horse National Celebration. We received your name
and address from Celebration officials. If
persons were bitten or came in contact with
saliva from this horse (described below) from
August 23-31, 2006, while attending the
Celebration, they may have been exposed to rabies
and are requested to contact the Tennessee
Department of Health for an assessment. Tennessee
Department of Health and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention officials do not currently
consider other horses present to be at risk
unless they were bitten by the infected horse or
had gross contamination of a wound or mucous
membranes with the infected horse�s saliva.
Rabies is a viral infection that nearly always
results in fatal encephalitis (brain infection).
Humans may be exposed to rabies primarily through
the bite of a rabid animal or when the virus is
introduced into fresh open cuts in the skin or
onto mucous membranes such as the eyes, mouth or
nose from the saliva of a rabid animal. Attending
an event where a rabid animal was present,
petting a rabid animal or contact with the blood,
urine or feces of a rabid animal does not
constitute a risk for transmission. If a person
is exposed to rabies, a series of shots
(post-exposure prophylaxis) is highly effective in preventing the disease.
The horse that developed rabies was from
Waynesville, Missouri and was infected with a
bat-variant of the rabies virus. The horse was
likely infected due to random contact with a bat
before coming to Tennessee for the Celebration.
The horse was not involved in the Celebration
competition, was a 3-year-old gelding (neutered
male horse), buckskin (cream to tan) in color
with a black mane and tail. "Buck" or "Bucky" was
described as "small," 14 hands or 56 inches tall
at the withers (i.e., the highest area of the
shoulders at the base of the neck). He was
stabled on the north side of Barn 50 in stall No.
12, the 3rd stall from the west end (see map,
over). A bright blue curtain labeled "4J Land and
Cattle Company" covered the outside porch of the
barn. The potential for contact by the public was
very limited when the horse was in its stall, but
there may have been opportunity for public
contact when the horse was taken for rides on the
Celebration grounds. The horse was first noted to
be ill on August 28. Over the next few days, the
horse developed severe nervous system signs and,
as a result, was euthanized. Persons directly
involved in the care of the horse are being
assessed for possible rabies exposure and the
need for rabies post-exposure treatment.
If you or someone else was bitten by a horse, had
contamination of a fresh open wound with saliva
from a horse, or had saliva from a horse come in
contact with eyes, nose, mouth or other mucous
membranes, personnel are available to answer
additional questions at the Tennessee Department
of Health Public Information Line 1-866-355-6129.
Thank you,

[Although the number of people exposed is likely
small, it illustrates the fact that horses can be
a source to people. Rabies vaccination for horses
is cheap insurance for those around horses. � Mod.TG]
