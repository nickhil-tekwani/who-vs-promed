Afghanistan: hepatitis E outbreak in Laghman province
-----------------------------------------------------
Health authorities have detected an outbreak of hepatitis E in
Afghanistan's eastern Laghman province, a spokesman of the UN Assistance
Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) said on Mon 26 Feb 2007. An outbreak of 33
cases of viral hepatitis E has been identified in Farashghan village of
Dawlatshah district of Laghman province, Adrian Edwards told newsmen at a
weekly press briefing. 17 cases of the epidemic were detected in December
[2006], and 16 others were identified in January [2007], he added.
Hepatitis E is an acute illness of fever and jaundice caused by
contaminated water, the spokesman added. Only 40 per cent of Afghans have
access to safe drinking water.
The UN Children's Fund has donated materials to conduct a health education
campaign to inform the villagers about how to prevent the disease though
home treatment of water and sanitation measures.
