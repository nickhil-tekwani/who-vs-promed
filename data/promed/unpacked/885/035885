Between 8-19 Aug 2015, 8 cases (5 confirmed and 3 suspected) of meningococcal disease were reported from the UK (Scotland) and Sweden following attendance at the World Scout Jamboree (WSJ), Yamaguchi, Japan from 28 Jul-8 Aug 2015. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W was isolated from blood samples of 2 of the cases. ECDC reported the rapid risk assessment of this event on 21 Aug 2015 http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/Meningococcal-disease-scouts-EU-August-2015.pdf.

In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) requested the Scout Association of Japan on 14 Aug 2015 to alert the WSJ participants to visit a hospital as soon as possible if they develop any signs or symptoms of meningococcal disease. At this moment, no cases linked with WSJ have been reported in Japan. For further information on this event, please see http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/en/id/997-disease-based/sa/bac-megingitis/idsc/ias.

In Japan, 7-21 cases of meningococcal meningitis have been annually notified since 1999 to March 2013. In April 2013, meningococcal meningitis and meningococcal sepsis together were newly classified as "invasive meningococcal infection." Since then, a total of 60 cases have been reported to the national surveillance system up to December 2014. While not included as a routine vaccination, meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) was approved for licensure in July 2014 in Japan.

for the recent epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease cases and serogroup in Japan.

[ProMED-mail thanks Hajime Kamiya for this information.

A total of about 34 000 [mostly young] people [Boy Scouts and their leaders] from some 150 countries and territories converged on the Kirara-hama beach in Yamaguchi, Japan for this event from 29 Jul through 8 Aug 2015. While no cases have been reported from countries other than Sweden and Scotland in relation to this event thus far, it is likely that we will be hearing reports from other countries (perhaps including Japan). However, we are getting late in the game for disease related to contact at the WSJ. Serogroup W, the putative infecting agent, is included in the standard meningococcal vaccines, and prior immunization will provide protection to those who were immunized. Immunization should be considered for the unimmunized Scouts.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis would be important for close contacts of the cases (e.g. roommates), but this information may not be available for the great majority of the Scouts. The Swedish health agency urged all returning participants to seek preventive treatment as a precaution.
