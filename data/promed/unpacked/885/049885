A comment
---------
In the Eurosurveillance article reproduced in the ProMED-mail post archived
as Mumps - Israel: Yeshiva students, 2009 20100106.0059, it was concluded
that: "The 2 main characteristics of the current outbreak in Jerusalem are
the predominance of male adolescents in religious boarding schools and the
fact that most cases (74 per cent) are appropriately vaccinated for their
age. The male predominance is striking, and requires further study."

A cultural note that would explain the male predominance: only males study
in orthodox yeshivas (and Israel's religious institutions are almost
exclusively orthodox), thus only males are spending almost all their time
together, 24/7, in the infectious environment. They would likely have also
been the only ones in contact, or at least very close contact, with the
infected visiting American yeshiva students mentioned, as well.
