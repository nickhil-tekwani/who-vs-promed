Cyclosporiasis illnesses are reported year-round in the United States. However, during the spring and summer months there is often an increase in cyclosporiasis acquired in the United States (i.e., "domestically acquired"). The exact timing and duration of these seasonal increases in domestically acquired cyclosporiasis can vary, but reports tend to increase starting in May. In previous years the reported number of cases peaked between June and July, although activity can last as late as September. The overall health impact (e.g., number of infections or hospitalizations) and the number of identified clusters of cases (i.e., cases that can be linked to a common exposure) also vary from season to season. Previous US outbreaks of cyclosporiasis have been linked to various types of fresh produce, including basil, cilantro, mesclun lettuce, raspberries, and snow peas.

States reporting cases: 13

CDC, along with state and federal health and regulatory officials, monitor cases of cyclosporiasis in the United States in the spring and summer months to detect outbreaks linked to a common food source. However, many cases of cyclosporiasis cannot be directly linked to an outbreak, in part because of the lack of validated laboratory "fingerprinting" methods needed to link cases of _Cyclospora_ infection. Officials use questionnaires to interview sick people to determine what they ate in the 14-day period before illness onset. If a commonality is found, CDC and partners work quickly to determine if a contaminated food product is still available in stores or in peoples' homes and issue advisories.

Latest information
This is the 1st monthly report on the number of domestically acquired cyclosporiasis illnesses with onset on or after 1 May 2022. Cases continue to be reported.

As of 28 Jun 2022, 61 laboratory-confirmed cases of cyclosporiasis in people who had no history of international travel during the 14-day period before illness onset have been reported to CDC by 13 states since 1 May 2022.
- The median illness onset date is 31 May 2022 (range: 3 May-20 Jun 2022).
- At least 6 people have been hospitalized; no deaths have been reported.

ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi

[June and July are the typical peak season for cases of cyclosporiasis in the USA, but because of the self-limiting nature of the disease and limitations of diagnostic testing, the number of cases can vary widely from year to year. There have been no FDA investigations of foodborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis yet this year (2022), and the last major recall of produce for _Cyclospora_ occurred in June 2021 with Dole brand fresh blueberries. However, clinicians need to be alert to the possibility of cyclosporiasis in apparent foodborne gastrointestinal illnesses, since cases and possible outbreak clusters will be missed if clinicians fail to consider this diagnosis in the 1st place and thus fail to order the appropriate stool tests for _Cyclospora_ oocysts by microscopy or PCR. See https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/health_professionals/dx.html for a detailed description of diagnostic methods. - Mod.LXL
