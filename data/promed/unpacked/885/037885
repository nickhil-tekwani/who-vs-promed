BANANA WILT - UGANDA

The banana disease fusarium, locally known as todura, has cropped up
and attacked sweet banana plants in western Uganda, local
agricultural officer has said. Todura, also known as yellow wilt in
Uganda's western Mbarara district, one of Uganda's largest banana
production bases, has many forms and resides in the soil.
The Daily Monitor reported on Tuesday [13 Mar 2007] that the disease
affects several varieties of banana: Kabalagala or Sukari Ndiizi and
Bogoya, Musa, Kayinja, Kisubi, and plantain or Gonja. Infected plants
usually do not mature and develop yellow leaves that later wilt,
wither, die, and drop off progressively from the stem base upward.
Lillian Nyangoma, an agricultural officer in Biharwe sub-county in
the Mbarara region, said that since there is no known cure for this
wilt, farmers are being advised to use local methods that will permit
the plants to continue to grow and produce fruit, even as they lose
some of their leaves. "Since the disease cannot be cured, we advise
farmers to keep animal and human urine for 2 weeks, and when it
ferments, apply it to the roots of the plant. By doing this, the
plant keeps growing. We also encourage farmers to inter-grow other
varieties of banana which aren't affected by this disease," Nyangoma said.
Commercial farmer David Bogere from Katojo village in the same
sub-county said that farmers there have been working hard to get rid
of all the banana diseases, but that Todura has stymied them. "At
first we used to see it and ignore it, but it has affected us a lot,
and we no longer have the sweet bananas in plenty," he said. Bogere
said Todura had been sighted in all the banana plants in the area
that produce sweet bananas. "We can identify the disease. Now most
affected plants turn yellow, and the fruit does not grow and if it is
affected at a young stage, it will never have fruit at all. The fruit
also develops a bad smell," he said.
Todura wilt has affected commercial exploitation of sweet bananas and
other plants like pawpaws [papaya], tomatoes, eggplant and potatoes.
In recent years, the price of sweet bananas has shot up from 200
Ugandan shillings (11.5 U.S. cents) to 500 shillings (28.7 U.S.
cents) for a cluster of Sukari Ndiizi, while the price for a cluster
of Bogoya has risen from 500 shillings to 1000 shillings (57.4 cents)
in most parts of western Uganda. Banana and milk production form the
basis of the livelihoods of most farmers in western and central
Uganda and a big section of the population.

[If any reader can explain why fermented urine should have any effect
on this disease, we would like to hear from him or her. Since ProMED
currently lacks a plant moderator, I reproduce here a comment by a
previous one. - Mod.JW.
"[There is confusion in the nomenclature because the same name is
being applied to 3 different diseases. 2 pathogens have been
identified: the bacterium, _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_
(Xpm), and the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_ (Foc),
which is frequently seen in Uganda and is prevalent in other African
countries. The third disease is matooke disorder, the etiology of
which remains unknown [matooke is a cooking banana & a staple food in
Uganda - Mod.JW]. This report is not unexpected given the
distribution of diseased banana plants in Uganda.
There are 2 names in use for the wilt disease caused by Foc; Fusarium
wilt & Panama disease. The disease was first reported in Australia in
1876 and has since been reported in all banana-producing regions
except islands in the South Pacific, the Mediterranean, Melanesia,
and Somalia. There are 4 races of Foc, 3 of which are banana
pathogens. An excellent account of the disease can be found at the
