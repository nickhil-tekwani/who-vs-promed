Measles outbreak sees new MMR warning to parents in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Children and adults who have not had the MMR 2 vaccine are being urged to do so

The NHS [National Health Service] in Wales has issued a stark warning over the importance of the MMR vaccine following a 4th case of measles in the space of a month.

In the last month there have been 4 cases across Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Powys, one of which was hospitalised.

Public Health Wales says measles is a serious and highly contagious viral disease that can cause complications and can even prove fatal.

Dr Christopher Johnson, Acting Consultant in Health Protection for Public Health Wales, said 2 doses of the safe and effective MMR vaccine offer protection and anyone who hasn't had the vaccine is urged to get it free from their GP [general practitioner].

Dr Johnson added: "People may not think measles is serious but it is extremely easily spread and can even prove fatal.

"There is a vaccination programme for babies and toddlers but older children and adults can receive the vaccination at any time from their GP.

"If you are not sure if you have had your MMR, speak to your GP and ensure you protect yourself, your family and vulnerable members of the community such as babies who are too young to have the vaccine.

"Children should receive their 1st dose of the vaccine at 12 months of age and the 2nd at around 3 years and 4 months of age. However, we know in some areas vaccinations rates are dropping and I would urge any parent to prioritise the vaccination for their baby and any other members of the family who may not be protected."

Most measles sufferers develop a fever, cough, red eyes, a blocked nose and a blotchy rash.

It is also important if you think you may have measles to phone your GP or local hospital before attending. Those with symptoms are asked not to socialise with children, or other vulnerable individuals including infants, pregnant women, and those with a weakened immune system for around 10 days after symptoms start.

More information about measles is available from the Public Health Wales website: http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?orgId=457&pid=25444 [including a figure and table of incidence of measles from 1996-2012 by year of occurrence and age of patient - Mod.LK].

After overseas trip [to Europe], Wake [North Carolina] resident could have spread measles at home
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wake County public health officials said Tue [2 Aug 2016] that a local resident has contracted measles.

The unidentified patient showed symptoms of measles after returning from travel in Europe, officials said.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms begin with a fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, followed by a rash that typically appears 1st on the face, along the hairline or behind the ears and then spreads to the rest of the body.

People with measles are usually contagious for the 4 days before the rash starts, the day it 1st appears and the following 4 days. Public health officials said area residents might have been exposed to measles at the following locations:

[See source URL for locations where possible exposure may have occurred.]

Complications from measles can include pneumonia, diarrhea and ear infections. Severe complications can be fatal. Infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems are more at risk of complications from measles, officials said.

Immunization is the best protection from measles. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing a person from contracting the disease.

"If you put 10 people in the room who are not vaccinated and expose them to a case of measles, 9 of them would become sick, so that kind of tells you the importance of getting vaccinated," said Kimberly McDonald with Wake County Human Services.

Anyone experiencing symptoms of measles who hasn't been vaccinated is advised to call a doctor immediately.

2 measles cases confirmed as originating from a domestic departure area at Taipei Songshan Airport
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two cases of measles infection have been confirmed to have originated from a domestic departure area at Taipei Songshan Airport, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged the public Wed [3 Aug 2016] to be on alert if they have traveled to places where either of the 2 patients have visited between 26 Jul and 1 Aug [2016].

A 42-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman were confirmed to have contracted measles 1 Aug [2016], and their specimen tests suggest that the cases are a cluster infection, the CDC said.

The man departed for Kinmen 15 Jul [2016], returning to Taipei the following day, but developed fever, coughing and measles from 24-31 Jul [2016], when he sought medical attention. The woman, an airline ground staffer, worked at the same place where the man was infected 15 Jul [2016] and sought medication 30-31 Jul [2016] for the same symptoms.

Yen Che-chieh director of the CDC's northern district control center, said that as both patients had been in the same area of the airport between 1 p.m. and 1:20 p.m. 15 Jul [2016], they might have been infected by another source as yet unidentified.

Follow-up investigations show that 328 people have since been in contact with the 2 measles patients, with one of the women's co-workers having been infected 31 Jul [2016] and is now recovering at home.

Sixteen of the 328 people remained free of symptoms while 311 others are being watched for any signs of infection. The tracking will continue until 12 Aug [2016].

The 42-year-old drives to work and has not traveled much since then, but the 25-year-old takes public transport to and from work. The CDC advised people taking the MRT between the Nangang Exhibition Halls and Songshan Airport, and those who have taken the No. 620 and No. 270 buses to monitor their health.

They are advised to impose an 18-day health management program on themselves and, if they suspect they have been infected, should wear a surgical mask and see a doctor.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can spread through the air, or through contact with an infected person's saliva or nose and throat discharge.

[Measles is highly contagious. Certainly if an infected individual mingles with unvaccinated non-immune individuals in a public area such as an airport, secondary infections may occur. Measles remains a common disease in many parts of the world, including areas in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. Worldwide, about 20 million people get measles each year. To assure protection:
- Infants 6 months through 11 months of age should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine.*
- Children 12 months of age and older should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.
- Teenagers and adults who do not have evidence of immunity** against measles should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days.
*Infants who get 1 dose of MMR vaccine before their 1st birthday should get 2 more doses (1 dose at 12 through 15 months of age and another dose at least 28 days later).
**Acceptable presumptive evidence of immunity against measles includes at least one of the following: written documentation of adequate vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of measles, or birth in the United States before 1957.
