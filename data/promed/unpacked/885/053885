[A 10-year-old] resident in Sukarame district, Bandar Lampung city, Lampung province, tested positive for avian flu and had to receive intensive care at Dr H Abdul Moeloek general hospital in Lampung.

"I can confirm that a resident in Sukarame district tested positive for avian flu and is now receiving medical treatment," said Head of Banda Lampung Health Agency Dr Edwin Rusli in Bandar Lampung on [Sat 21 Jan 2017].

He added the resident is still in intensive care in a special isolation room for avian flu patients in the hospital. Edwin added that agency had also given special treatment to the areas where the patient contracted the disease.

Edwin also hopes the residents will always clean the locations where they keep their poultry.

The patient's mother, 36, said her son did not eat a dead chicken but he held it instead.

[The report does not specify the subtype of avian influenza, but Indonesia is among the countries that have reported the highest number of human cases of avian influenza A/H5N1 since 2003 (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2016_12_19_tableH5N1.pdf]. However, no human cases were reported during 2016. Avian influenza A/H5 viruses are endemic in Indonesia. Any further information on the epidemiological factors and exact subtype of the identified virus would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA
