Austrlia (Queensland): 4 Confirmed Cases in City of Townsville
--------------------------------------------------------
Public health officials have discovered dengue fever mosquitoes breeding in
23 houses after checks in Railway Estate, West End and Heatley this week.
Director of Environmental Health for Queensland Health John Piispanen said
yesterday that 336 houses had been inspected by Queensland Health and
Townsville City Council environmental health department officers following
4 confirmed cases of dengue fever in the city. "We are aware that 2 of
these cases were imported from Vanuatu where the people had gone for
holidays, but we are very concerned that 2 cases have also been acquired
locally," he said.
Mr Piispanen said there were 17 to 20 different types [?] of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito responsible for spreading dengue fever. Most were daytime
biters who lurked under tables and bit people on the ankles. He said a
surface spray under furniture and in dark places inside houses would
usually eradicate them. "We want people, especially in these suburbs to be
very vigilant about the issue. We want the people of Townsville and
Thuringowa cities to clean up pot plants, bird baths and even tarpaulins,
in fact anything that can hold water can be a breeding place for these
mosquitoes."

Costa Rica: Concern at High number of Dengue Fever Cases
--------------------------------------------------------
SAN JOSE: The Costa Rican Health Minister warned of the possible [begining]
of an epidemic of dengue fever in the country's Pacific coastal area, where
1230 cases of the disease have been reported this year. Health Minister
Maria del Rocio Saenz said that her concern was based on the relatively
high number of cases registered prior to this month's onset of the rainy
season, when breeding conditions are more favorable for the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito that transmits the disease.

Costa Rica: Number of Cases Continues to Rise
---------------------------------------------
Costa Rican Health Minister Maria Del Rocio Saenz warned on Wed 15 May 2002
that an outbreak of dengue fever may hit the country as it did in 1997. She
said a total of 1230 cases of dengue fever has been registered so far this
year, compared with 1928 cases in 2001. The Health Minister said there are
conditions for a possible outbreak of an epidemic like the one in 1997,
when 14 000 cases were registered. In the Central Pacific region alone,
there are 70 000 people who risk infection by the epidemic.
Saenz urged people to eliminate water deposits that could favor the
reproduction of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the dengue fever vector.
Saenz said the country will soon carry out a fumigation campaign to
eliminate mosquitoes. The dengue season usually peaks in July and August,
when heavy rains provide many places for mosquitoes to lay their eggs.

Nicaragua: Decreasing Trend in Last Few Weeks
---------------------------------------------
MINSA [the Ministry of Public Health] announced a preventive plan which
includes house-to-house visits. More people are sick with dengue this
summer than in 2001. According to MINSA statistics, as of the end of Apr
2002 (week 18), 399 cases of classical dengue and 59 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been confirmed, 6 more than last summer.
Nevertheless, Juan Jose Amador, Director of Epidemiology, MINSA, said that
even though in the first months of summer this year there have been more
cases of dengue/DHF than in the same period last year, in the last few
weeks there has been a decreasing trend. During 2001 hundreds were sick
with dengue. The disease reached a historically high level for the country,
and there were 20 deaths due to the disease.
According to MINSA statistics, this year there have only been 2 deaths.
Managua, Chinandega, and Masaya have reported the majority of cases.
Nevertheless, Leon leads the list in terms of the number of reported cases
of DHF, 26, followed by the capital [Managua] with 6 [cases of DHF]. Amador
explained that this time MINSA had organized preventive plans to control
dengue at a cost approaching 2 million cordobas [approx. US $141 143.26; 1
USD = 14.1700 Nicaraguan cordobas on 16 May 2002 exchange market -
Mod.MPP]. He detailed a plan to visit and sanitize 600 000 houses in the
country in 2 months.
At present, MINSA has begun working on disinfestation in Mateare and Ciudad
Sandina. Amador said that almost 100 brigade workers have gone
house-to-house inspecting [for mosquito breeding sites - Mod.MPP] and
explaining to the residents the necessary attention that must be paid to
containers that capture and store water. In addition, the brigades are
conducting mosquito and larvae reduction activities around the households.
Amador said that in 6 weeks they hope to sanitize 240 000 [households] in
the Department of Managua.
