The United Resistance Coordination of Merowe in the Northern State announced that the number of deaths from Rift Valley fever has risen to 79, while the number of recorded cases has reached 1962, including 3 cases of nervous system complications. A total of 4578 miscarriages and deaths have been recorded among livestock.

The Coordination calls on the Sudanese Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Animal Resources to declare an epidemic of Rift Valley fever and to open the door for international and voluntary organisations to intervene and assist.

In a statement on Wednesday [14 Oct 2020], the Merowe activists expressed their regret about "the Ministry of Health's concealment of the Rift Valley fever epidemic despite taking samples since 19 Sep [2020]." They warned the Northern State government against being lax in dealing with the disease so that it would not spread to other areas. They further called on people from Merowe and others from Northern State living in Khartoum to join the protest vigil in front of the Ministry of Health in Khartoum today [Thu 15 Oct 2020].

On Wednesday [14 Oct 2020], the Northern State Ministry of Health briefed the state government, headed by Governor Amal Ezzeldin, on the overall health conditions and the official and popular efforts made to confront fevers in the localities of Merowe and Ed Debba. According to the Ministry, the total cases of fevers in Merowe and Ed Debba in the Northern State reached 1493, including 63 deaths.

Doctor Abuzir Idris, Director General of the Ministry of Health in the Northern State, confirmed in a press conference held on Wednesday [14 Oct 2020] in Dongola that "the health situation in the state has stabilised."

He indicated that after 2 weeks from now, field surveys for the disease will be made, and after 3 months, field vaccination for the disease will be considered in accordance with the plan and guidelines of the World Organisation for Animal Health.

In the past, "fevers accompanied by bleeding" turned out to be chikungunya, a mosquito-borne fever that can cause death. Dozens of people died in Kassala 2 years ago as a result of chikungunya infections. Last week, 41 cases of chikungunya were reported in West Darfur. [Chikungunya virus infections are not classified as hemorrhagic fevers, and deaths from the infection are rare. One wonders if the cause of these reported deaths was laboratory confirmed as chikungunya virus infection. - Mod.TY]

Rift Valley fever - key facts:
- Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans.
- The majority of human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals.
- Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes.
- To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF virus has been documented.
- The incubation period (the interval from infection to onset of symptoms) for RVF varies from 2 to 6 days.
- Outbreaks of RVF in animals can be prevented by a sustained programme of animal vaccination.

[In a 14 Nov 2019 report, the WHO stated that RVF [Rift Valley fever] is endemic in Sudan. There have been 3 outbreaks affecting humans previously documented in 1973, 1976, and 2008. During the outbreak in 2008, a total of 747 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, including 230 deaths. The report indicated that following heavy rains on 13 Aug 2019, flooding caused flash floods in 17 of the 18 states, including Abyei area in West Kordofan State. These floods favored vector abundance, distribution, and longevity. The 2019 RVF outbreak started on 19 Sep 2019 and affected states impacted by the floods (see Rift Valley fever - Sudan (07): (RS,RN) human, livestock, WHO 20191120.6787770). Now RVF transmission is active currently (2020) in the Northern State with both humans and livestock affected.

Surveillance and responses to RVF outbreaks require a One Health approach since both humans and animals are affected and environmental change, in this situation extensive flooding, has promoted vector abundance. Effective vector control over extensive geographical areas is difficult to achieve and is expensive. Maintenance of herd immunity through vaccination of animals can be a successful preventive measure prior to the occurrence of cases. - Mod.TY]

[RVF was reported to had caused RVF in humans and animals in Sudan in May-July 2019; the most recent cases during 2019, affecting sheep and goats in Sudan's River Nile State in September 2019, were reported to the OIE (ProMED-mail archive no. 20191107.6765712). According to Sudan's annual OIE report (2019), 4 outbreaks were reported, affecting 3700 susceptible sheep and goats, of which there were 94 clinical cases and 20 deaths. No vaccinations have been reported for 2019.

Sudan's local media reported recently about abortions and deaths among animals; no official confirmation nor details of investigations or their results have become available. Imports of livestock (cattle, sheep, goats) from Sudan to Saudi Arabia have been discontinued until further information becomes available.

The areas regarded at RVF risk in Sudan due to ecological (particularly precipitation) conditions, during October 2020, are Kassala, White Nile, South Darfur, West Darfur, South Kordofan, North Kordofan, and North Darfur. - Mod.AS
