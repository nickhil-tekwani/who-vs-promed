[With these additional strains, 5 HPAI subtypes have now been identified in China: H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N6 and H5N8.

The detection of HPAI H5N3, within the commendable surveillance efforts on China's live bird markets, is unusual. Most H5N3 strains known to be detected (in wild or domestic birds) were designated as of low pathogenicity. It would be interesting to obtain details on the tests performed on the current isolate from a duck. No HPAI H5N3 could be found among earlier postings in the ProMED-mail archive. A Danish report on H5N3 (2006) was eventually found to be H5N2 (see ProMED- mail report 20060623.1740).

According to the HPAI H5N1 report provided by China, the following control measures were applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.

Given that these 16 H5N1 outbreaks were associated with the live bird and local trade markets, it would be both interesting and useful to know how the quarantine and zoning measures are actually being applied to manage these cases.

The OIE uses the following definitions:
- Quarantine: means that infected establishments are placed under quarantine with a standstill on the animals therein until all sanitary measures considered necessary to eradicate the disease have been completed.
- Zoning: means a delineation (by regulatory means) of free, surveillance and/or buffer, and infected zones within the country for disease control purposes.

It would also be useful to know how the control measures of "dipping and spraying" are applied since these measures are generally used to control parasites and potential vectors.

In addition, during this week, China sent follow-up repots for their H5N2 and H5N6 high pathogenicity events.

For the H5N2 event, 10 outbreaks have been reported. See follow-up report No. 3 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000016061_20141024_184114.pdf. See also the event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=14553.

For the H5N6 event, 25 outbreaks have been reported. See follow up report No. 2 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000016060_20141024_193420.pdf. See also event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=15957.

Finally, regarding their low pathogenicity AI H7N9 event, only 43 outbreaks have been reported through July 2014.

See the last official follow up report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015547_20140709_121859.pdf. However, animals and human cases continue being reported; see ProMED mail report 20141020.2882752 and 20140919.2788651. - Mods.CRD/AS
