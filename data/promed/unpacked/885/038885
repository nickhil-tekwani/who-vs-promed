A total of 81 Bangladeshi pilgrims were taken to hospitals in Madina
Mon 31 Oct 2011, with food poisoning after eating a meal at an
unlicensed caterer. They received medical treatment at King Fahd,
Uhud, and Al-Ansar hospitals, and samples of the food they had eaten
were sent for analysis.

Dr Abdul Hameed Muhammad Shahat, medical director of King Fahd
Hospital in Madina, said that around midnight on the date, the
emergency unit received 26 pilgrims, most of whom were elderly. They
were suffering from abdominal pains associated with diarrhea and
vomiting. The pilgrims were all treated and discharged, except for one
who had to be hospitalized.

Dr Ali Karbooji, medical director of Uhud Hospital, said that the
hospital received 19 Bangladeshi pilgrims who were admitted to the
hospital with food poisoning. "Most of them were discharged while some
were kept at the hospital until they were stable." Dr Fareed Al-Nuzha,
medical director of Al-Ansar Hospital, said that 36 pilgrims were
admitted and treated.

[Madina (or Medina) is a city in the Hejaz region of western Saudi
Arabia and the capital of the Al Madinah Province. It is the 2nd
holiest city in Islam, and the burial place of the Islamic Prophet
Muhammad.

Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, is one of the greatest religious
observances in Islam. Hajj is expected to fall between 4-9 Nov 2011.
The exact dates of Islamic holidays cannot be determined in advance,
due to the nature of the Islamic lunar calendar. Estimates are based
on expected visibility of the hilal (waxing crescent moon following a
new moon) and may vary according to location.

The etiology of this cluster of foodborne illness is not stated but
with knowledge of the incubation period, the presence or absence of
fever, the food(s) ingested and the length of the illness one can
generate a differential diagnosis. - Mod.LL]
