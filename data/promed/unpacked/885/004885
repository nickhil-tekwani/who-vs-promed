Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was detected in a bovine foetus with malformations consistent with Schmallenberg disease for the 1st time. The calf was born on 17 Apr 2013.

The calf originated from a beef herd in southern Norway (Aust Agder County) and was submitted by the national Food Safety Authorities for post mortem examination at NVI. SBV was detected in the brain stem of the calf by PCR.

SBV is spread between animals by biting midges (_Culicoides_ spp.) and was detected in these vectors in the southern part of Norway in autumn 2012. Furthermore, serological examinations of bulk milk samples have demonstrated that antibodies against SBV are widespread in dairy cattle in southern Norway. SBV can cause brief illness in ruminants. Animals that are infected early in pregnancy may have stillborn or malformed offspring with severe deformities.

This is the 1st time that SBV has been detected in animals in Norway.

It may be assumed that similarly deformed calves will be born in other farms in southeastern Norway, as well as in other SBV-affected counties in Europe, due to infections of pregnant cows which had taken place during the 2nd half of 2012. Such unfortunate calves may be expected until mid 2013. - Mod.AS]

Scientific studies on SBV
-------------------------
1. Studies co-financed by the Commission at the rate of 50 percent of eligible costs for the period 1 Apr 2012 to 31 Dec 2013 for the following Member States: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and UK.

2. The results of these studies are expected to be published in April 2014.
- Progress reports with preliminary results were provided in March 2013.
- Some of the results presented here are preliminary and have not yet been published in scientific journals.
- EFSA has not yet conducted any assessment of the available results.

3. The outcome of the studies must be made available to the Commission, all Member States, and EFSA and presented at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.

4. Overview of ongoing studies:
a. Pathology:
(1). Pathogenicity at different gestation stages
(2). Pathogenicity in non-pregnant animals
(3). Immunity
(4). Impact and risk factors

b. Epidemiology
(1). Horizontal transmission
(2). Vectors
(3). Semen and Embryo
(4). Other species

c. Diagnostic
(1). ELISA
(2). RT-PCR

5. Conclusions:
(1). The EU has demonstrated its capacity for rapid response to SBV in terms of scientific investigation and research.
(2). Preliminary results from studies co-financed by the EC and Member States confirm assumptions used in the EFSA assessments.
(3). Further information will be made available towards the end of 2013.
