Abstract
--------
Objective: To determine how the severity of successively dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design: Retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting: Community- and hospital-sequenced COVID-19 cases in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GG&C) Health Board.

Participants: All sequenced non-nosocomial adult COVID-19 cases in NHS GG&C infected with the relevant SARS-CoV-2 lineages during analysis periods. B.1.177/alpha: 1 Nov 2020-30 Jan 2021 (n = 1640). Alpha/delta: 1 Apr-30 Jun 2021 (n = 5552). AY.4.2 delta/non-AY.4.2 delta: 1 Jul-31 Oct 2021 (n = 9613). Non-AY.4.2 delta/omicron: 1-31 Dec 2021 (n = 3858).

Main outcome measures: Admission to hospital, ICU, or death within 28 days of positive COVID-19 test

Results: For B.1.177/alpha, 300 of 807 B.1.177 cases were recorded as hospitalised or worse, compared to 232 of 833 alpha cases. After adjustment, the cumulative odds ratio was 1.51 (95% CI: 1.08-2.11) for alpha versus B.1.177. For alpha/delta, 113 of 2104 alpha cases were recorded as hospitalised or worse, compared to 230 of 3448 delta cases. After adjustment, the cumulative odds ratio was 2.09 (95% CI: 1.42-3.08) for delta versus alpha. For non-AY.4.2 delta/AY.4.2 delta, 845 of 8644 non-AY.4.2 delta cases were recorded as hospitalised or worse, compared to 101 of 969 AY.4.2 delta cases. After adjustment, the cumulative odds ratio was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.76-1.27) for AY.4.2 delta versus non-AY.4.2 delta. For non-AY.4.2 delta/omicron, 30 of 1164 non-AY.4.2 delta cases were recorded as hospitalised or worse, compared to 26 of 2694 omicron cases. After adjustment, the median cumulative odds ratio was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.22-1.06) for omicron versus non-AY.4.2 delta.

Conclusions: The direction of change in disease severity between successively emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern was inconsistent. This heterogeneity demonstrates that severity associated with future SARS-CoV-2 variants is unpredictable.

[The conclusions indicating lack of predictability of severity of new variants should be somewhat reassuring as this heterogeneity in severity is better than continually increasing severity. But larger studies are needed. - Mod.LK]

[2] Booster dose for BA.4/5
Date: Tue 23 Aug 2022

[A version of this article appears in print on 24 Aug 2022, Section A, Page 15 of the New York edition with the headline: White House Plans Campaign for Latest Booster Shot Soon After Labor Day]

Biden Administration Plans for Booster Shot Campaign in September [2022]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A top F.D.A. regulator cited compelling data for redesigned coronavirus vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

The Biden administration plans to offer the next generation of coronavirus booster shots to Americans 12 and older soon after Labor Day, a campaign that federal officials hope will reduce deaths from COVID-19 and protect against an expected winter surge.

Dr. Peter Marks, the top vaccine regulator for the Food and Drug Administration, said in an interview on Tuesday [23 Aug 2022] that while he could not discuss timing, his team was close to authorizing updated doses that would target the versions of the virus now circulating.

Even though those formulations have not been tested in humans, he said, the agency has "extremely good" data showing that the shots are safe and will be effective. "How confident am I?" he said. "I'm extremely confident."

This week, both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech finalized their submissions to the F.D.A. asking for emergency authorization of booster shots aimed at BA.5 and another subvariant of omicron that together account for most coronavirus cases in the United States.

Federal health officials say they are eager to offer the updated boosters as quickly as possible, pointing to a death toll that now averages about 450 Americans per day and could rise in the coming months as people spend more time indoors.

"We have really got to do better to protect the American public," Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, said in an interview on Tuesday [23 Aug 2022]. "We are in the middle of a BA.5 outbreak here, and we are nowhere near where we want to be."

The Biden administration has struggled to convince Americans of the need for successive vaccinations. Only about 2/3 of the population has been inoculated with the primary series of 2 shots, and far fewer have received booster doses.

Some outside scientists have said the government is moving too fast to clear redesigned shots, arguing that the existing vaccines provide strong protection against severe disease.

"Deaths are concentrated in unvaccinated people and people with serious health conditions," said John P. Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine. He said the extra protection that the new shots would provide against infection could be "weak to nonexistent."

Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, said that although he supported new boosters, many people had immunity because of recent infections. "Even if we get this out in the next 10 days, how many people are left who haven't gotten omicron?" he said.

Other scientists said that the government's plan made sense given how the virus had changed and the evidence that immunity wanes over time. Dr. Marks said that if regulators waited for additional data or recommendations from outside experts, the virus might evolve further and "we may have lost a bunch of individuals who could otherwise be sitting around at the dinner table together."

In a sign of impending action from the F.D.A., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scheduled a 2-day meeting of its advisory panel of experts on the matter for [1 and 2 Sep 2022]. The C.D.C. director, Rochelle P. Walensky, would then make a final decision on whether to roll out the new doses. Shipments to states could begin as early as next week, according to officials familiar with the plan.

The government plans to offer the new Pfizer booster to everyone 12 and older while limiting the new Moderna shot to adults. People who have already received the initial 2-shot series of either vaccine would be eligible. So would those who have received the initial shots plus one or 2 booster shots. The new booster campaign could be broadened to younger children later.

Dr. Marks suggested that the biggest obstacle to the effort was the level of complacency that had set in, even as the pandemic continued to exact what he called an "unacceptable" death toll.

He said the F.D.A. might recommend that people who had recently received a COVID vaccine dose wait "a few months" before getting the new shot, even if they were otherwise eligible. He said the C.D.C. might weigh in on whether people who were recently infected with the virus should also wait.

As of mid-August [2022], the federal government had bought more than 170 million doses of the updated version of the vaccines. This month [August 2022], the C.D.C. laid out detailed plans to offer the shots, warning that the supply would be "sufficient but finite" and saying that doses should be "directed to providers with expected demand among eligible patients."

The new shots combine the original vaccine with components aimed at the BA.4 and BA.5, omicron's recent subvariants. Officials argue that the new formulations will deliver a stronger boost to the immune system than the existing vaccines provide.

Unlike earlier shots, the redesigned formulations have not been tested widely on humans; instead, the companies have submitted data from mice trials. Some vaccine experts have complained that animal data is too preliminary and say regulators should wait for results of human clinical trials.

But Dr. Fauci said using animal data was "not anything different than we always do" in updating the flu vaccine each year. Dr. Marks said other evidence included the extensive track record with the existing vaccines and a series of earlier human trials with variant-specific formulations.

"I take great issue with those who say, 'Oh, you're just approving this with mouse data,'" he said. "We're authorizing this with the totality of the evidence that we have."

Moderna and Pfizer have both submitted clinical data from human studies of redesigned shots targeting the original version of the omicron variant. Britain last week authorized that version of Moderna's vaccine, but U.S. regulators asked for formulations aimed at omicron's newer subvariants.

Researchers are still working to answer key questions about the protection that the new vaccines deliver, including the levels of antibodies the shots generate in humans and how those antibodies protect people. Moderna began human trials of its new vaccine this month [August 2022], and Pfizer plans to do the same later in the month [August 2022]. Initial data from those trials is expected later this year [2022].

Dr. Moore, the virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, said the administration's plans could backfire if the fall or winter [2022] brings a wave of disease despite the new boosters, potentially reducing overall confidence in COVID-19 vaccines.

"My issue all along has been: Is there enough data to really justify the effort?" Dr. Moore said. "The potential downside is, if the public thinks that this omicron-containing booster is some kind of magic bullet that will give them superstrong protection from infection, is there a risk that they will change their behavior to increase their exposure?"

The F.D.A. will decide whether to authorize the retooled doses without seeking a recommendation from its outside advisory panel of experts, a step it usually takes before making new vaccines available. Critics have complained that regulators have bypassed the panel at crucial steps.

Dr. Marks defended the decision, saying a late June [2022] meeting of the advisory panel on the need to revise the vaccines had given regulators "everything we needed." The committee voted overwhelmingly then in favor of updating the vaccines to work better against omicron or its subvariants, but it did not consider specific formulations.

[see Eric Topol's tweet (Eric Topol @Eric Topol) for a summary of potential merits and disadvantages for Fall administration of the BA.4/5 bivalent booster. In addition, he states "To the minuses, I would add the uncertainty of how various COVID infection and vaccination histories will affect the various desired protections (severe disease, hospitalization, transmission, long COVID) of the various formulations.

When comparing with flu vaccines, it should be remembered that people are offered a choice of formulations, not as complicated as the current COVID vaccine controversy, but SARS-CoV-2 is more complicated than influenza." - Mod.LK]

[3] Physical activity

Regular physical activity tied to lower risk of COVID, poor outcomes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate physical activity -- or 75 minutes (1.2 hours) of vigorous exercise -- weekly was linked to a lower risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, severe illness, and death during periods dominated by the beta and delta variants, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis published yesterday [22 Aug 2022] in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. [Ezzatvar Y, Ramírez-Vélez R, Izquierdo M, et al. Physical activity and risk of infection, severity and mortality of COVID-19: a systematic review and non-linear dose-response meta-analysis of data from 1 853 610 adults. British Journal of Sports Medicine Published Online First: 22 Aug 2022. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2022-105733]

A University of Valencia researcher in Spain led the analysis of 16 studies that assessed the link between regular physical activity and one or more COVID-19 outcomes in 1 853 610 adults published from November 2019-March 2022. Average participant age was 53 years, and 54% were women.

The included research included cross-sectional, case-control, prospective cohort, and retrospective observational studies from Africa, Asia, North and South America, and the Middle East.

No additional benefits seen beyond target
-----------------------------------------
Compared with their sedentary peers, adults who engaged in moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes or vigorous exercise for at least 75 minutes per week were at lower risk for COVID-19 infection (-11%), hospitalization (-36%), severe COVID-19 (-44%), and COVID-related death (-43%). The relative risks (RRs) for regular exercisers were 0.89 for infection, 0.64 for hospital admission, 0.66 for severe illness, and 0.57 for COVID-related death.

The dose-response relationship between physical activity and severe illness and death was nonlinear. No additional benefits for any outcome were seen beyond the physical activity targets.

The researchers noted that regular physical activity has been associated with the reduction of risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and may boost immunity and anti-inflammatory responses and reduce the negative effects of stress.

"Another possible explanation for our findings is the level of cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness of the individuals, as both likely play a pivotal role in explaining the protective effect of physical activity on COVID-19 hospitalisation, severity, and mortality," they wrote.

The team added that the goal is to ensure that people of all backgrounds have equitable access to physical activity, because those with low socioeconomic status or who live in low- or middle-income countries may face barriers such as limited resources, residence in communities with poor access to parks or low walkability, and costs associated with participation in organized sports.

"These findings may help guide physicians and healthcare policymakers in making recommendations and developing guidelines with respect to the degree of physical activity that can help reduce the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes at both the individual and the population level, especially in high-risk patients," the authors concluded. "Given the heterogeneity and risk of publication bias, further studies with standardised methodology and outcome reporting are now needed."

["What this study adds - Regular physical activity is related with lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and lower likelihood of adverse COVID-19 outcomes (including hospitalisation, severity and mortality), although due to limitations of the studies, our findings need to be interpreted with caution.

Greatest benefit is provided by achieving at least 500 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)- min per week of physical activity, which is equivalent to 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. ...

These findings may help guide physicians and healthcare policymakers in making recommendations and developing guidelines with respect to the degree of physical activity that can help reduce the risk of infectivity, hospitalisation, severity and mortality of COVID-19 at both the individual and the population level."

Any level of physical activity is good for the body. The level needed to help fend off severe COVID could stimulate individuals to do more. Currently, the recommendation from the American Heart Association includes the results above plus additional exercise:
"- Get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week.
- Add moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity (such as resistance or weights) on at least 2 days per week.
- Spend less time sitting. Even light-intensity activity can offset some of the risks of being sedentary.
- Gain even more benefits by being active at least 300 minutes (5 hours) per week." - Mod.LK]
