A health warning from the World Health Organization was recently released regarding the types of antibiotics that can cure gonorrhea [see http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/246114/1/9789241549691-eng.pdf]. Health officials warn they're running out of ways to treat the sexually transmitted disease.

"It's mutating. It's scary so you just have to protect yourself and use condoms," said Community Health Network Ob/Gyn Dr. Rachel Leland. Gonorrhea is getting trickier to treat. The disease has outgrown so many drugs, there's only one left. "So gonorrhea has really specialized in adapting itself to be drug resistant. Syphilis is an STD [sexually transmitted disease] that's been around for a long time and it's still sensitive to the very 1st antibiotic, penicillin."

"Gonorrhea used to be treated with penicillin, but now over the years every drug that we try it kind of changes itself," Leland said. Health officials all over the world have been advised to treat gonorrhea the same way. "So current recommendations through the CDC is a dual therapy. One is an injection and one is an antibiotic you take by mouth. And combating gonorrhea 2 ways instead of with one drug, we're able to treat most gonorrhea infections," Leland said.

The World Health Organization says it's a risk the one remaining treatment could stop working in about 5 years. For now Dr. Leland says she hasn't noticed any drug resistant gonorrhea in her office but she's noticed more patients are getting gonorrhea multiple times.

The STD can be especially dangerous for women as it could affect fertility. So as the chances increase for gonorrhea treatment failing Dr. Leland is taking her message back to the basics, practice safe sex. "So it's scary to think of an STD not having a treatment. But what always comes 1st to my mind is let's try to prevent these STDs so I don't have to worry about drug resistance."

Current recommendations suggest anyone under 25 years old should get screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia yearly. Other than that you should get tested if you are not in a mutual monogamous relationship. If there are any local cases of gonorrhea that are drug resistant those test results will go to the local health department and the CDC for further testing.

[_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ has developed resistance to each of the antibiotics as they were used successively to treat gonorrhea. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is now the treatment regimen recommended by CDC to treat gonorrhea -- a single dose of 250 mg of intramuscular ceftriaxone plus 1 g of oral azithromycin, to improve treatment efficacy and potentially slow the emergence and spread of resistance to cephalosporins (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm). The use of dual therapy with azithromycin is also recommended because of the frequency of coinfection with _Chlamydia trachomatis_ for which azithromycin is efficacious.

Extensive clinical experience indicates that ceftriaxone is safe and effective for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea at all anatomic sites, curing 99.2 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal and 98.9 percent of pharyngeal infections in clinical trials (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm). No clinical data exist to support use of doses of ceftriaxone greater than 250 mg (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm).

Use of azithromycin as the 2nd antimicrobial in the dual regimen is preferred to doxycycline (a tetracycline) because of the convenience and compliance advantages of single-dose therapy and the substantially higher prevalence of gonococcal resistance to tetracycline than to azithromycin (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm). In addition, clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of azithromycin 1 g for the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea. - Mod.ML]
