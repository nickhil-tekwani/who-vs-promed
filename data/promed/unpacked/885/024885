MEDNET 99 SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY
*******************************
A ProMED post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

The 4th World Congress on the Internet in Medicine was held at
Heidelberg, Germany from 18-21 Sep 1999. It was an exciting occasion
that gave an overview of developments in telemedicine, cybermedicine,
telepreventive medicine & telehealth. I was Chairman of the Scientific
Programme Committee, & I invite those interested to check out the
summary I made of the major presentations in the web journal Health
Informatics:

Next year the Congress, MEDNET2000, will be held in Brussels. I hope
many of you will be able to attend.
