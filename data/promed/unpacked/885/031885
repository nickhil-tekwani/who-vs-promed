Human West Nile virus cases in North Dakota have increased 105 per cent in the last 2 weeks, according to the state Department of Health.

With fall activities such as football and hunting starting, the department warned residents that the virus continues to pose a threat until the 1st hard freeze occurs.

Minnesota has not seen such a steep rise in reported human cases, with only a 36 per cent increase since 3 Sep [2013], according to that state's Department of Health.

As of Wednesday [18 Sep 2013], North Dakota reported 76 human cases of West Nile virus, 37 more than on 3 Sep [2013]. There have also been 9 blood donors, 1 horse, 6 birds and 20 mosquito pools that have tested positive for West Nile virus. None of the blood donors showed symptoms.

Most of the new human cases are spread throughout the state, though Burleigh, Cass and Richland counties did have the most positive with 7, 13 and 9 respectively.

Minnesota reported 49 human cases and 13 infected blood donors who had no symptoms.

[It is not clear from the above report if these cases were febrile disease only, or neuroinvasive disease. In the USA as of 17 Sep 2013, there have been 890 human cases. Of these, 407 cases are neuroinvasive disease with 33 deaths, and 483 cases are non-neuroinvasive disease (see the CDC report at http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsMaps/preliminaryMapsData/histatedate.html). ProMED-mail normally does not report West Nile virus human infection cases in the USA and southern Canada because the virus has become endemic there, and posts reports only when significant clusters of cases occur, such as in the situation of North Dakota. North Dakota has had 60 reported cases as of 17 Sep 2013, but that total reached 76 cases on 18 Sep 2013, as indicated in the above report. Since 70-80 per cent of the individuals who become infected with West Nile virus do not develop any symptoms, the total number of individuals who have been infected in North Dakota is much higher, perhaps reaching nearly 400. Since there is no commercially available West Nile virus vaccine for humans, the avoidance of mosquito bites is the best preventive measure that can be taken.
