1st report of _Globodera pallida_ in Japan
------------------------------------------
Until recently, the only species of potato cyst nematode know to occur in Japan was _Globodera rostochiensis_ (EPPO A2 list). But in August 2015, mature _Globodera_ females and cysts were observed on the roots of potatoes resistant to the Ro1 pathotype of _G. rostochiensis_ in a field in Hokkaido.

Females adhering to potato roots were white or pale yellow, and were clearly distinguishable from _G. rostochiensis_ females, which are brilliant gold. Laboratory analysis (morphology, PCR-RFLP [restriction fragment length polymorphism], sequencing) confirmed the presence of _Globodera pallida_.

This is the 1st report of _G. pallida_ in Japan. Pathotype identification and screening for resistance to _G. pallida_ among potato cultivars in Japan are under way.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PCN symptoms on potato include stunting, yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material (such as seed potatoes). Disease management may include exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host species, use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races (pathotypes), and nematicides. Control measures can be combined to keep nematode levels below economic thresholds.
