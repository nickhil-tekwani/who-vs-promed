Officials said on Friday [14 Jul 2017] that a new polio case has been detected in a toddler in Southern Afghanistan where the Taliban banned vaccination campaigns.

"The virus has been detected in an 18-month-old baby girl in Shah Walikot district of Kandahar province,'' said Dr Hedayatullah Stanekzai from the national anti-polio initiative in the Health Ministry in Kabul.

He told DPA that this was the 2nd polio case in Kandahar this year [2017] and that it was detected in an area under Taliban control. Shah Walikot is one of 4 districts in which the Taliban have banned vaccination campaigns, he said.

"Besides Shah Walikot, the Taliban have banned vaccination runs in Khakrez, Miansheen and Spin Boldak districts."

The head of the national campaign against polio, Najibullah Safi, said that the Taliban demanded to put their own people in the groups of vaccinators instead of government employees.

The militant group usually considers the vaccinators to be spies of the Afghan government or of international spy agencies.

According to Stanekzai, 120 000 children have gone without polio vaccinations this year [2017], mainly in the south and east of the country, where officials are striving to get children vaccinated at least 8 times a year.

According to the Health Ministry, 5 polio cases have been detected in 2017 so far, 2 in Kandahar, 2 in Helmand and one in northern Kunduz province, all of which are either heavily embattled or already controlled by the insurgents.

The contagious, crippling disease mainly affects children under 5 years. It cannot be cured, but it can be prevented with vaccination.

[When I first read this report, I wondered whether this might be a "ghost" report (an older report that is recycled in the current media web search archives), as I could not find any other articles addressing this case, and the report was coming from an African media blog site. I scoured the web looking for other reports on this case and could not find any. As the above report mentions there have now been 5 confirmed cases from Afghanistan this year (2017), with 2 in Kandahar, this is consistent with previous statistics for the year. Noteworthy is that in the last global update (Poliomyelitis update (18): global (Pakistan, Syria) 20170713.5172112), there was mention of a positive environmental sample for WPV1 in Kandahar, taken on 7 Jun 2017, perhaps reflecting the local circulation of the WPV1 that may well be responsible for this present case of polio reported above.

The fact that the case comes from a district where vaccinations have been banned is an unfortunate situation, as the virus will have many susceptibles in the area to facilitate its continued circulation. I suspect that the Nigeria media is closely following the polio situation globally, as the country shares similar challenges with an area of civil unrest where the childhood population is abused and neglected through withholding needed and available preventive medical services such as vaccination.
