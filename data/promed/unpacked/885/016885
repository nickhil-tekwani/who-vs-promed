A Chinese restaurant in Ottawa has been fined after dozens of people became ill from eating rice, including 25 children. A doctor with Ottawa Public Health says lab tests found the bacterium _Bacillus cereus_ in a fried rice dish served to the children.

Carolyn Pim said 6 children who were sent to hospital had symptoms including dizziness and vomiting, which are consistent with foodborne illness associated with the bacterium. She added that the bacterium most commonly causes illness when food isn't kept hot [enough] after being cooked. The children had been at a Mandarin-language day camp.

The Ottawa Public Health investigation found that 44 people in total became sick after eating at Lotus Chinese Take-Out.

[_Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning is the general name used for the illness. However, the organism has 2 recognized types of foodborne illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis (vomiting) between 0.5 and 5 hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of _Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is caused by a high molecular weight protein, while the emetic or vomiting type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is caused by a low molecular weight and heat-stable protein. In some outbreaks, there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the emetic types of illness [as in the above report].

The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, rectal tenesmus (a feeling of constantly needing to pass stools despite an empty colon), moderate nausea that may accompany diarrhea, seldom vomiting, and no fever. Symptoms develop within 6-15 hours and can persist for 24 hours. This syndrome is rather mild and tends to mimic the symptoms of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. The diarrheal syndrome is caused by enterotoxins that are produced during growth of _B. cereus_ in the small intestine.

Generally, symptoms are transient and mild, possibly contributing to underreporting. Large numbers of cells are needed to cause illness and can occur when the food product (often rice) is held at a temperature inadequate to prevent growth. Despite the illness's usually mild symptoms, fatalities have been described associated with liver failure (Mahler H, Pasi A, Kramer JK, et al: Fulminant liver failure in association with the emetic toxin of _Bacillus cereus_. N Engl J Med 1997; 336(16): 1142-8; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199704173361604.) - Mod.LL
