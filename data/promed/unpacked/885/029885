Cairns is currently experiencing an outbreak of dengue-3 virus infections.
The outbreak was brought to the attention of the Tropical Public Health
Unit last week, but had been "cooking" for several weeks previously. By
the time we established it was dengue, 8 locally acquired cases were found.
All were within a small hostel or guest house. An amazing cluster! To
date, 21 cases have been confirmed, with most having a history of having
stayed or visited the hostel. Some of the cases are
from people working or staying at nearby places. The virus appears to be
rather virulent, with 7/21 cases hospitalised.
No DHF has occurred, though. Mosquito control efforts include media
pounding, house-to-house source reduction and, with great emphasis,
interior fogging with residual pyrethroid insecticides. The goal at this
time is to keep the virus confined to the area near the hostel.
While there has been movement of viremic people to different areas of
Cairns, there is no evidence of local transmission elsewhere at this time.
What do I want for Christmas? A confined and subsequently squashed dengue
outbreak, along with a dash of The MaCallan scotch whiskey.
