More than half of the pigs at a Vietnamese slaughterhouse had antibodies to H1N1 pandemic influenza virus (pH1N1), according to a study today [30 Dec 2011] in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses.

The study involved specimens from virologic and serologic surveillance in 2009-10 on pig farms (38 swabs and 1732 sera) and at a pig slaughterhouse (710 swabs and 459 sera) in northern Viet Nam. Researchers screened the sera with an influenza A ELISA assay and then tested positive sera with hemagglutination inhibition tests for antibodies. The team found a maximum pH1N1 seroprevalence in the slaughterhouse of 55.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 38.1-72.1 percent) at the end of December 2009, 2 weeks after human cases in the area peaked. Farm-level seroprevalence was 29 percent (95 percent CI, 23.2-35.7 percent), and on seropositive farms, within-herd seroprevalence ranged from 10-100 percent.

The authors conclude, "Our findings suggest extensive reverse-zoonotic transmission from humans to pigs with subsequent onward transmission within pig herds."

[The findings are not surprising, retroactively adding Viet Nam to the list of countries which experienced (generally, mild or subclinical) infections with the "Influenza A (H1N1) 2009" virus in swine (and odd other species) exposed to infected humans during the 2009/2010 epidemic. In line with OIE's policy (see http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-packs/pandemic-h1n1-2009/), 23 of those countries submitted official notifications to the OIE qualifying this as an "emerging disease" on their notification forms. For the detailed list and for additional background information, please refer to ProMED-mail posting 20110924.2897.
