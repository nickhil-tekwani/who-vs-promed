Hundreds of fish are dying in Lake Norman and biologists said they're
not sure why.

On Monday morning [26 Jul 2010], biologists from the North Carolina
Natural Resources Commission collected some of the dead fish as part
of their investigation into the trend.

Since last week [week of 19 Jul 2010], 611 striped bass have died.
Biologists said they think the deaths could be related to the recent
heat wave.

Duke Energy uses the lake's water to cool its nuclear power plant.
Since the water is hotter now, Duke has to go deeper to get to cooler
water. Biologists said that means less oxygen for the striped bass,
which flock to deep waters to search for food.

"That bubble of oxygen goes away. They're trapped and have nowhere to
go and end up dying," said Brian McRae, a fisheries biologist with the
NC Natural Resources Commission.

McRae said the drinking water is still safe, and that he's not
concerned about the fish population overall because every year, the
Resource Commission stocks the lake with more than 162 500 striped bass.

However, some money from local fishermen is now gone. The taxes they
pay with purchases of rods, lures, licenses, and permits go toward
stocking the lake with the fish that are now dying.

Similar trends have happened twice before. Last year [2009],
biologists said about 300 bass died, and in 2004, 3000 died. The
reasons for those incidents are still unclear.

Duke Energy said it is addressing the problem, working closely with
biologists, and using underwater cameras to monitor fish activity.

[The heat wave that has blanketed the Eastern Coast of the USA has
caused similar occurrences all across the Eastern seaboard. Many of
these waters have never had such prolonged heat to warm them this
much. The temperature is a slow increase and a gradual drop in oxygen,
until the level is reached that fish are suffering and cannot recover.
It is then we see dead fish on the shores and belly up in the waters.

If the power plant is using the water to cool the plant and taking
more of the deep cool water, then this plus the heat wave is likely
causing the deaths of the fish. A few necropsies on the fish should
confirm it is not a disease. - Mod.TG]

Hundreds of dead fish recently showed up in the upper portion of the
Haw River in Alamance County.

Haw River Assembly Riverkeeper Elaine Chiosso says the incident may be
related to a recent 1.45 million gallon spill of wastewater from the
City of Greensboro.

The witness did not report the kill for a couple of days, which
Chiosso says is a bad thing for public health. She notes that there
was an overall lack of adequate reporting, and thinks the state needs
to be more active in letting citizens know if there's a potential
hazard.

The Haw River flows through Alamance and Chatham Counties.

[This article is very incomplete. While any large fish kill should be
reported in a timely fashion, there is no indication here there was
any follow up, or what was in the wastewater. It could be chemicals,
it could be sewage, or even a combination.

It is surprising there has not been more of a notice here or a follow
up investigation. - Mod.TG]
