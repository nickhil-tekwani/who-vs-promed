Mumps outbreak worries Massachusetts officials
----------------------------------------------
Massachusetts health authorities are on high alert for cases of mumps, the
painful viral illness that has reemerged in Maine and Maritime Canada in
recent months, despite decades of vaccinations. Before the outbreak, Maine
had not reported a case in at least 20 years. Now mumps has spread across
the state, reaching its southernmost county and making nearly 75 children
and adults sick statewide since September [2007].
Disease trackers suspect that the Maine outbreak was imported from Canada,
where 1140 people have fallen ill this year [2007], 14 times the average
for recent years. Most of the cases have been reported by 3 eastern
provinces -- Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.
Specialists in Massachusetts are watching the migration of mumps with
increasing concern, knowing that many of the patients in Maine and Canada
are college students, a group particularly susceptible because they are
mobile and live in tight quarters, an ideal combination for disease
transmission.
"We are exploring every possible mumps case," said Dr Alfred DeMaria,
director of communicable disease control for the Department of Public
Health in Massachusetts, where only 3 cases have been reported this year.
"We're going to be especially vigilant after the holidays," he said,
because Boston students may have contact with students from Maine schools
during the break.
The resurgence of mumps illustrates the hardiness of a virus, the
limitations of a vaccine, and the realities of a world so hooked on air
travel that germs can spread from one country to another in a matter of
hours. Specialists said they believe that is exactly what happened with
mumps. Like measles, it was a common childhood scourge that appeared headed
for extinction in the United States. But in 2005, a strain widely
circulating [not terribly common, clinically. - Mod.SH] in the United
Kingdom, where vaccination rates are significantly lower than in North
America, was imported to a New York state summer camp. Within a year, that
same strain was identified as the culprit in a Midwest outbreak. And it is
being blamed for the cases in Canada this year.
"Mumps is essentially endemic in the rest of the world," said Dr James
Alexander, a medical epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). "Canada and the United States were the 2 countries
where mumps was close to being eliminated."
The virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person's
saliva, meaning it can travel through a kiss or on utensils, towels, or
tissues. It causes severe swelling of salivary glands and is heralded by
fever, headache, body aches, and glandular tenderness where the jaw forms
an angle. Rarely fatal, it can result in significant complications,
including inflammation of the testes, brain swelling, meningitis, and
sterility. A vaccine introduced in 1967 led to a steep decline in mumps in
the United States, but within 2 decades, the virus had reemerged.
"Mumps has undoubtedly been with us for millennia, and it's not likely to
disappear just because we develop an effective vaccine," said Dr Kenneth
McIntosh, a disease specialist at Children's Hospital Boston. One pivotal
lesson derived from the return of the mumps in the late 1980s: a single
dose of vaccine did not provide enough of a shield. It was then that
disease specialists began recommending that children receive 2 doses and
that schools bar students who were not vaccinated.
As Canadian specialists began investigating this year's outbreak, they
quickly homed in on the vaccination history of patients, unearthing
important clues. Nearly 73 per cent had received only a single dose of
vaccine, while 19 per cent had no vaccination at all. Those who received at
least one dose generally had milder cases. "I like to compare this disease
to a heat-seeking missile," said Jeannette Macey, an epidemiologist with
the epidemiologist with the Public Health Agency of Canada. "If there are
people in the population who are not protected, it's going to find them."
In Maine, authorities are collecting comparable data, but they know already
that many of the adults who became infected probably only got a single dose
earlier in life. At the University of Southern Maine, where many of the
students are older, at least 10 people have fallen ill, a spokeswoman said.
Disease specialists from Maine and the federal CDC are also continuing to
investigate exactly where the virus came from, running sophisticated
genetic testing and conducting extensive interviews. "It's not surprising
that Maine would have cases," said Dr Dora Mills, director of Maine's CDC.
"New Brunswick is adjacent to Maine, and Nova Scotia might as well be,
because there are several boats that go back and forth every day."

[There has been a considerable increase in the number of mumps cases
reported in Maine since the initial report on 20 Nov 2007. The case count
of 7 confirmed and 24 suspected cases of mumps has risen to at least 75
confirmed cases. It may be that as time progresses the State of Maine will
be required to instigate a comprehensive vaccination campaign to provide
protective immunity to those in the population who have previously received
a single vaccinations or none, to contain this outbreak - Mod.CP]
