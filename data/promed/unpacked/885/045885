Pet owners are concerned over the death of a Welsh corgi after consuming oil-cake fertilizer.

Oil cake refers to the residue remaining after oil is extracted from a plant source. It is known to contain nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and kalium, and is used widely in gardens and on farms.

The problem, however, is castor beans, used as a primary component for making oil cake fertilizer, contain ricin, a toxic substance capable of hurting both animals and humans.

Ricin is 1000 times more toxic than potassium cyanide. A small dose of 1 mg is enough to kill a full-grown adult.

Controversy over oil cake fertilizers was sparked after a report in 2016 recounting the fate of a pet dog killed after having consumed oil cake. [History is repeating itself. - Mod.TG]

Last May [2021], a 7-year-old Welsh Corgi died 2 days after playing in a neighbor's grassy yard. The veterinarian in charge suspected the dog consumed the oil-cake fertilizer spread on the grass.

Manufacturers selling these fertilizers, however, still fail to warn consumers of these risks.

Despite government instructions to include warning labels on packaging, many manufacturers either fail to include the labels or make them difficult to recognize.

["_Ricinus communis_ L. (that is, castor bean, mole bean, Palma Christi, wonder tree, African coffee tree, Mexico weed) is an ornamental plant introduced from the West Indies. It produces oil used for industrial and medicinal purposes.(1,19) The residual plant material from the oil extraction, castor bean cake, is largely used as fertilizer. The plant contains ricin, a phytotoxin (lectin), considered one of the most potent plant toxins and is listed as a Category B bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.(15) All parts of the plant are toxic, but the highest levels of ricin can be found in the hard tick-like seeds, which need to be crushed or broken to release the toxic component.(20) The toxic lectin inhibits protein synthesis, leading to cell death, and can affect different species of domestic mammals and poultry, but also humans.(3,7,13)"

There is no information provided as to why the dog ate the fertilizer. Was the pet hungry? Was the smell enticing to the dog? Had the dog never been exposed to such a smell/taste? There are many reasons why the dog could have chosen to eat the fertilizer. However, we do know this is not a single event, as evidenced by the journal articles cited above. - Mod.TG
