_Salmonella_ Stanley and _Salmonella_ Newport in imported peanuts
-------------------------------------------------
Following an international outbreak of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype
Stanley associated with consumption of a specific brand of imported
peanuts in Australia (1,2) and Canada (3), a request for information was
sent via Enter-net on 8 Oct 2001 to ascertain whether any other countries
had any cases that may be associated with this product.
To date, 7 cases have been identified in Australia and Canada; no other
countries have reported cases associated with this product. _S._ Stanley
has been isolated from an unopened packet of this product in Australia,
whereas in Canada both _S._ Stanley and _S._Newport have been isolated from
unopened packets. The peanuts originate from and are produced in China, and
are distributed via Singapore. If found in the United Kingdom (UK), these
peanuts are more likely to be sold through specialist stores.
At the request of the Food Standards Agency (FSA), local sampling was
undertaken by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) and environmental
health departments of local authorities in London and the northwest to
determine whether any of these imported peanuts on sale are contaminated
with _Salmonella_ spp. To date, 3 samples of garlic-flavoured in-shell
peanuts from the same batch with a best before date of 28 Jun 2003 have
been found positive for _S._ Newport or _S._ Stanley by the PHLS London
Food, Water and Environmental Laboratory and Preston PHL. A further 2
samples of the same product and batch have been found positive for
_Salmonella_ spp. by Chester PHL. Molecular typing of these food isolates
together with recent human isolates is in progress in the PHLS Laboratory
of Enteric Pathogens (LEP).
The UK importer has initiated a recall of the product. As a protective
measure, the FSA has advised consumers of what products to avoid, and has
issued a food hazard warning asking local authority enforcement officers to
ensure that these products are removed from sale (4,5).
From 1 Jan 2001 to 30 Sep 2001, LEP has reported on 78 and 138 human
isolates of _S._ Stanley and _S._ Newport, respectively, in England and Wales.
