Lower seed potato and tomato yield in Himachal
----------------------------------------------
Plentiful monsoon rains and foggy conditions have damaged the high-variety
seed potato and tomato crops in Himachal Pradesh's Lahaul Valley [Lahaul
and Spiti district]. Horticulture experts say lack of sunshine has led to
the spread of late blight disease. They say the seed potato yield would
come down by 25-30 per cent this time and the tomato production would be
down by a quarter.

The landlocked Lahaul Valley is known for producing the country's
disease-free, pest-resistant seed potato varieties, with more than 90 per
cent of the produce going to potato-growing states like West Bengal, Bihar,
Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. The overall crop damage is up
to 30 per cent, late blight wiped out a large quantity of the crop.

Harvesting is almost over and the produce is now being transported to town
where the buyers come to buy the seed potatoes. Prices of seed potato will
be higher due to less supply. Most of the crop will head for propagation,
the main demand coming from West Bengal and Gujarat.

The Lahaul Seed Potato Growers Cooperative is run by farmers of the valley
and has more than 2000 members. They cultivate potatoes over 900 hectares
[2225 acres] and improved varieties of potato seeds have brought prosperity
to the region.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen
can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato it
affects leaves as well as tubers, and in tomato it causes lesions and
rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease can spread rapidly within
a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions,
epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material, wind, and water. Disease management
requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen
reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting
material (potato seed tubers, tomato transplants), and fungicide sprays of
crops. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen
strains has been observed and commercial crop cultivars vary in
susceptibility to PLB. Development of resistant cultivars is being
counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen with new and more virulent
strains emerging frequently.

In the region of India and its neighbours PLB has been extraordinarily
rampant since 2008 (ProMED-mail posts listed below). While emergence of a
new strain with increased fungicide resistances cannot be excluded,
infected seed potatoes have been recognised as an important factor in these
outbreaks. Seed tuber certification programmes have reduced PLB impact on
potato industries in other countries are being developed in India
(ProMED-mail post 20100505.1458).

The infected seed tubers reported above have resulted in local loss of
income, but they also pose a high risk of much larger losses in areas were
they will be planted, unless they can be reliably treated with fungicides
and certified to be pathogen free. The report above raises the question
whether infected seed tubers from this area may have been the source of
previous PLB outbreaks in India, and whether it will be possible to prevent
disease spread with the current crop.
