Latest information on Avian Influenza
-------------------------------------------
H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has moved westwards;
outbreaks have been confirmed in Turkey, Romania and Croatia.
Sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Russia, resulting in some
deaths/culling of domestic poultry. Resurgence of the disease in
China's main farming areas is also a concern. Human fatalities have
been confirmed or suspected in Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Countries in Europe, the Near East and Africa have started
implementing various preventive measures.

Country situation:

Eurasia:

Croatia (as of 2 Nov 2005)
--------------------
The 1st case was a swan found on 19 Oct 2005. So far, more than 35
mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) have been found dead in Zdenci
Municipality, Viroviticko-Podravska County (19 Oct 2005); Zdenci
Nature Park (21 Oct 2005) and surroundings (24 Oct 2005); Nasice (22
Oct 2005); Baranjsko Petrovo Selo Village; and near Slavonski Brod
City (27 Oct 2005), and the presence of HPAI H5N1 virus was confirmed
in some cases. A swan, ringed in Hungary, was found dead and tested
positive for the H5N1 strain.

Romania (as of 31 Oct 2005)
---------------------
On 4 Oct 2005, deaths of chickens and ducks occurred in a backyard
farm in Ceamurlia de Jos Village in the Danube delta, and HPAI H5N1
virus was confirmed in duck samples. Deaths of more than 100 birds
(ducks, domestic geese and 40 swans) were also discovered in the
suburbs of Maliuc Village, and tests were positive for HPAI H5N1. A
few swans in Maliuc and a wild duck in Ceamurlia de Jos also tested
seropositive. In mid-October 2005, a swan found dead near CA Rosetti
Village, 10 km from the border with Ukraine was seropositive. A heron
found dead in Vaslui County, on the Prut River shore, 700 meters from
the bridge border with Moldavia, tested positive for antibodies and
H5N1 virus. On 31 Oct 2005, a swan was found dead in Lake Razim, and
a goose was found in Vadu Oii, Constanta County on the Black Sea.
They tested positive for avian influenza (AI). A subsequent survey
[included] 424 samples [which] were taken from areas where dead birds
had been found; the results were all negative. Virus-free 20-day-old
chickens are to be sent to the 2 quarantined villages as sentinels.

Russia (as of 3 Nov 2005)
-----------------
In early October 2005, an outbreak of H5N1 occurred in an industrial
poultry farm in Kurgan Region, which resulted in the culling of more
than 460 000 birds. Outbreaks were also suspected/confirmed in 2
settlements in Altai Territory (12 Oct 2005); in chickens, geese and
ducks in Yandovka settlement in Tula Region (17 Oct 2005); in
chickens in Ioujnii Village, Tambov Region (21 Oct 2005); in chickens
in Sunaly Village, Chelyabinsk Region (22 Oct 2005); in Morshansk,
Morshanskogo, Tambov Region (24 Oct 2005); in Pokrovka Village, Altai
Territory, Sunaly, Chelyabinsk Region and Streltsy Settlement, Tambov
Region (26 Oct 2005); in Novichiha Settlement, Altai Territory and in
chickens and ducks in Rozovka Settlement, Omsk Region near the border
with Kazakhstan (27 Oct 2005); in Polovinnoe Village, Kurgan Region
(29 Oct 2005); in Grjaznova Village, Altai Territory and in Shatrovo
Village, Chelyabinsk Region (31 Oct 2005); [in] Shatrovo, Chelyabinsk
Region (1 Nov 2005), Morshanska, Tambov Region (2 Nov 2005) and
Novosanzharovka, Omsk Region (3 Nov 2005).

Turkey (as of 21 Oct 2005)
----------------
On 1 Oct 2005, deaths of 1700 turkeys out of 1800 occurred at a
free-range farm next to the Manyas Lake between the Kaziksa and Salur
Villages in Balikesir Province, and HPAI H5N1 virus was confirmed.
The northeast side of Manyas Lake is the Kuscenneti National Park.
All birds on the farm were slaughtered, and a local crisis center has
been established. The authorities placed a quarantine zone with a 3
km radius around 2 villages and a 10-km surveillance zone outside the
quarantined zone. Some 500 000 birds on the farms in the surveillance
zone are being closely monitored.

Europe:

UK (as of 23 Oct 2005)
-------------------
On 21 Oct 2005, HPAI H5 virus was found in a dead parrot imported
from Suriname and kept in quarantine with birds from Taiwan Province of China.


South, Southeast and East Asia:

China (as of 3 Nov 2005)
------------------
HPAI H5N1 has been discovered in chickens and ducks in Tengjiaying
Village, near Hohhot, Huhehot Municipality, Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region (14 Oct 2005); in chickens and geese in Liangying Village,
Tian Chang City, Anhui Province (20 Oct 2005); in chickens and ducks
in Wantang Village, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province (22 Oct 2005) and
in chickens in Badaohao, Jinzhou Municipality, Liaoning Province, and
20 wild birds, mostly magpies, were also found dead in the Heishan
County (26 Oct 2005). About 222 000 birds have died or been culled,
and 14 249 927 were vaccinated in Inner Mongolia, Anhui, Hunan and
Liaoning with monovalent inactivated vaccine, subtype H5N2.

Thailand (as of 1 Nov 2005)
---------------------
During October 2005, outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 were reported in
KamphaengPhet, KanchanaBuri, NakhonPathom, NonthaBuri and SuphanBuri
Provinces. A total of 29 175 poultry have died, and 68 223 have been
culled. The outbreaks were all in the central poultry zone, one of
the 5 which have been established for effective movement control and
farming management. A sample from wild sparrows out of 300 taken from
birds in Ban Khao Ngaem Village, Ratchaburi Town, Ratchaburi Province
in the central zone tested positive for the H5N1 strain. On 31 Oct
2005, an outbreak of H5N1 was confirmed in chickens in Kalasin
Province in the northeastern zone. In addition, 4 chickens died in
Sam Chuk District, Suphanburi Province, and HPAI was suspected.

The 7-year-old son of a Thai farmer from Kanchanaburi Province tested
positive for avian influenza. The father, a 48-year-old farmer, died
on 19 Oct 2005. He and his son slaughtered and ate his neighbor's
sick/dead chickens. A 50-year-old woman from near Bangkok tested
positive for H5N1. She kept her backyard chickens.

Thailand has developed rapid response teams to identify possible
human infection with the AI virus, get patients to hospitals and
confirm any diagnosis with laboratory testing. The system is designed
to contain a potential outbreak of AI in humans in a zone and prevent
spread throughout the country. Approximately 900 000 volunteers are
conducting a door-to-door survey searching for cases of HPAI.

Viet Nam (as of 1 Nov 2005)
-----------------------
On 3 Oct 2005, 400 ducks were found dead in Dong Thap Province and
tested positive for H5N1. On 18 Oct 2005, an outbreak of HPAI was
reported, with deaths of 110 ducks out of over 300 raised by a local
farmer in Hong Dan district, Bac Lieu Province. The flock was located
in the vaccination zone but was not vaccinated yet. Some 3000
poultry, mainly ducks, in Viet Yen and Yen Dung districts, Bac Giang
Province died between 25 and 30 Oct 2005. Samples were tested
positive for H5N1 virus. The nationwide AI vaccination campaign is
[being undertaken] in 48 provinces out of 64 provinces/cities in Viet
Nam. 77.6 million doses of AI vaccines, including both H5N1 and H5N1
[probably should read H5N2] vaccines, have been administered for
eligible birds. The 1st vaccination campaign is planned to be
completed in early December 2005.

A 24-year-old girl died on 23 Oct 2005, and a 26-year-old man on 26
Oct 2005, in a hospital in Dong Hoi, Quang Binh Province after
showing symptoms similar to AI, but no testing has yet been done.
They ate a goose and a chicken egg about one week before sickness.
Japanese and Vietnamese researchers analyzed the genes of the
virulent H5N1 avian influenza virus taken from a 14-year-old
Vietnamese girl who became infected in February 2005, but recovered.
Their laboratory examination showed that the virus had a genetic
mutation that makes it resistant to Tamiflu.

Bans on poultry farming, trade of live birds and slaughter of poultry
in major cities, including Hanoi, Hai Phong, Vinh and Ho Chi Minh
City as well as the sale of raw blood pudding made from ducks and
geese have been proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development. Rural farmers may raise poultry but need to register.

Indonesia (as of 27 Oct 2005)
---------------------
From 8 Oct 2005, deaths of hundreds of domestic poultry were
reported in Kediri. Around 30-50 poultry died daily. On 26 Oct 2005,
more than 25 chickens died in Padang Sambian Village near Denpasar in
Bali Island, with clinical signs similar to AI. Cases of HPAI may
increase again in the wet season from November to April.

A 21-year-old man from Lampung Province in Sumatra tested positive
for the virus. The man had direct contact with dying chickens in his
household shortly before the onset of illness. On 9 Oct 2005, his
nephew, a 4-year-old boy from Lampung Province, preliminarily tested
positive for H5N1. A man and his son were hospitalized on 12 Oct 2005
with suspected AI. A 23-year-old man from Bogor, south of Jakarta
died from H5N1 on 30 Sep 2005. On 27 Oct 2005, the Agriculture
Minister said that bird flu had spread to residential areas as almost
all chickens infected by the virus were found in housing areas, not
in the farms. The ministry will mobilize 500 - 1000 veterinary
students and volunteers to help locate sick chickens.

Cambodia (as of 27 Oct 2005)
------------
The National Animal Health and Production Investigation Centre
(NAHPIC) and the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh conducted a survey
in Prey Veng Province. The team investigated 2 communes where H5N1
antibodies had been detected in ducks. They interviewed 250
households with poultry and took 267 blood samples. The samples were
tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and 63 samples in 8
flocks out of 267 were found positive. The presence of antibodies
does not mean that the ducks are sick and shedding virus but shows
past contact with the virus. Of the 8 flocks, 60 to 100 percent sera
were positive, but only 3 flocks faced high mortality. This result
confirms that ducks can be infected without signs or mortality. At
the same time, 5 negative flocks had high mortality, indicating the
presence of other disease with high mortality.

Other strains/strain not yet confirmed:
---------------
Germany (as of 25 Oct 2005)
---------------------
On 24 Oct 2005, a total of 25 geese and ducks were found dead at a
lake popular for migratory birds in Rhineland-Palatinate State. The
preliminary test on a wild goose was positive for influenza A.

Canada (as of 31 Oct 2005)
---------------------
A survey of 4800 wild migratory ducks conducted during last summer
[2004] found evidence of H5 in 28 migratory ducks in Quebec Province
and 5 in Manitoba Province.

Japan as of (2 Nov 2005)
---------------------
On 31 Oct 2005, antibodies to AI virus were detected in chickens by
AGID and HI tests at an open-type farm with 82 046 chickens in
Ibaraki prefecture, within the quarantined area of a previous
outbreak in August 2005. No virus was isolated. All the birds at the
farm have been culled. AI infection was also reported on the same day
in a duck farm in Osaka Prefecture. AI H4 strain was diagnosed.

Other AI viruses (non-HPAI-H5N1) were reported in Sweden (LPAI H5),
Columbia (LPAI H9) and Iraq (in Erbil, H9).


Other information:

Ukraine (as of 4 Nov 2005)
-----------------
Deaths of chickens have occurred in Myrolyubivka Village,
Dnipropetrovsk Region. Turkeys and geese were not affected.

Republic of Korea (as of 2 Nov 2005)
---------------
Some 1000 out of 1200 ducklings died at a poultry farm in
Dopyung-Dong, Jeju Island on 1 Nov 2004. About 10 died at the same
farm on 21 Oct 2005 but tested negative for avian influenza.

Greece (as of 29 Oct 2005)
-----------
On 17 Oct 2005, an outbreak of AI H5 was reported at a small farm
with about 20 turkeys and some chickens on Oinousses Island, Chios
Prefecture. The birds started to die on 13 Oct 2005. One of the 9
samples taken from the birds tested positive for H5 antibodies.
Preventive measures have been applied in Oinouses, Chios and Psara.
Samples taken from around the country have been tested, and all but
the single case in Oinouses were negative. Samples sent to
VLA-Weybridge, UK tested negative. On 29 Oct 2005, the Government
lifted precautionary measures in the eastern islands after final
tests gave a negative result.

Macedonia (as of 1 Nov 2005)
-----------
A total of 1000 chickens and turkeys were found dead in 2 southern
villages, and more than 10 000 chickens were slaughtered in the
village. Samples sent to UK tested negative.

Iraq (as of 27 Oct 2005)
--------------
In mid October 2005, deaths of birds were reported in chickens in a
poultry farm near Khabat, Kurdistan. Samples were taken from the
chickens, and the preliminary analyses were positive for AI. Further
testing was done in Egypt, and H9 virus was confirmed. Between 12 and
27 Oct 2005, hundreds of dead birds were reported in Dora, Sha'ab and
al-Ghazelyia districts in Baghdad. Samples have been sent to the WHO
regional laboratory in Cairo for testing.

Iran (as of 26 Oct 2005)
---------------
Deaths of thousands of migratory birds have been reported in
Azerbayjane Gharbi Province along the Aras River. Bacterial
toxication is suspected as the cause. Samples have been sent to the
OIE reference Laboratory for testing. [This outbreak has, in the
meantime, been diagnosed as botulism. - Mod.AS]

Additional countries (as of November 2005)
-------------------
Deaths of birds were also reported in Albania, Azerbaijan, Brazil,
Bosnia Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Georgia, Hungary,
Kosovo, India, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Philippines, Portugal,
Singapore, Tajikistan, Venezuela and Yemen.

2. Where we are now:

Africa may face serious risk. After the confirmed outbreaks of HPAI
in Romania, Turkey and Croatia, the risk of AI spreading to the
Middle East and African countries has markedly increased. Wild birds
seem to be one of the main AI carriers, but more research is urgently
needed to fully understand their role in spreading the virus. One of
the concerns is the potential spread of HPAI to northern and eastern
Africa. The situation in eastern Africa is a major concern, where
veterinary services, due to various constraints, could have more
difficulties to implement efficient disease control campaigns based
on slaughtering infected birds and/or vaccination. The 5 countries
concerned and the international community have to make every effort
to ensure that AI does not become endemic in Africa. If the virus
were to become endemic in eastern Africa, it could increase the risk
of the virus evolving through mutation or reassortment into a strain
that could be transmitted between humans. The countries urgently need
international assistance to build up basic surveillance and control
systems. The full text is available at:

includes, among other things, the chapter "How to stop bird flu" and
instructions for the shipment of suspected samples to 3 reference AI
laboratories, in Weybridge, UK; Geelong, Australia; and Ames, Iowa, USA.

Additional useful information is in included in Annex 2, which is a
4-page (16-18) table titled "Situation by Countries (as of 5/11/2005)
sorted by date of the latest information by country." The table
includes data from 29 countries which have, since Dec 2003, detected
cases of avian influenza caused by H5N1 and other strains of high and
low pathogenicity. The data pertaining to the March 2005 outbreak of
avian influenza in chickens in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK, North Korea), includes the identity of the causative
virus strain. This piece of information has become available
following the completion, in September 2005, of the analysis made by
the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory
for HPAI) showing that the AI strain which caused the said outbreak
was H7N7. This was initially published in FAO/AIDE update No. 34, 10
Sep 2005, available at
