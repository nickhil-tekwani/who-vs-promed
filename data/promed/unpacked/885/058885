After the dengue virus, bacterial scrub typhus disease, seen in Nagpur for the 1st time, is taking its toll on residents of the city and surrounding areas. Around 90 cases have been reported so far, out of which 15 people have died over the [past] week and another 15 are battling for their lives.

According to the medical college and hospital, over 60 affected people are admitted there, out of which 15 are on ventilators and battling for their lives. The patient who died on Friday evening [8 Nov 2019] was identified as of Nandanwan area of east Nagpur.

Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is a disease caused by bacteria called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. It spreads among human beings through bites of infected "chiggers" (larval mites). The most common symptoms of scrub typhus include fever, headache, body aches, and sometimes rash.

Dr Abhimanyu Niswade, the dean of the government medical college and hospital, said that the number of its patients is increasing rapidly in the city, while most of the patients in the hospital are from other districts of the region, and a few are from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh states.

A senior government medical college official called for opening an emergency service for the disease at the hospital with experts and equipment. Admitting that the city was facing such a new disease for the 1st time, Niswade said: "However, we are giving proper treatment to the patients."

[Nagpur is a city located precisely at the geographical center of India and is the winter capital of the state of Maharashtra. Nagpur, with a population of 2.4 residents (2011), is the 3rd largest city in Maharashtra after Mumbai and Pune and is said to be the 5th fastest growing city in the world from 2019-2035 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur). It can be found on a map in the northeastern part of Maharashtra state at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nagpur,+Maharashtra,+India. Maps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=6771530,142.

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).

Illness in humans develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness. Because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf).
