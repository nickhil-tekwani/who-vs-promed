A comment on p38 MAP-kinase inhibitors and treatment of SARS
------------------------------------------------------------
Two publications have described the effect of the p38 MAP-kinase
(mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor SB203580 on mouse hepatitis
virus strain 3 (MHV)(McGilvray ID, et al. J Biol Chem 1998; 273(48):
32222-9 and Banerjee S, et al. J Virol 2002; 76(12): 5937-48). In the
latter paper the authors state that MHV activation of the p38 MAP-kinase
pathway results in phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor
eIF4E, which in turn contributes to a high level production of virus.
SB203580 reduced MHV particle production by a factor of 3.
Although there is as yet no direct evidence to suggest that the SARS
coronavirus uses the p38 MAP-kinase pathway, phosphorylation of eIF4E is
likely to prove a conserved coronaviral mechanism for directing cellular
protein synthesis towards production of viral particles. SB203580 also has
potent anti-inflammatory activity: (see: Ermert M, et al.
Cyclooxygenase-2-dependent and thromboxane-dependent vascular and bronchial
responses are regulated via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in control
and endotoxin-primed rat lungs. Lab Invest 2003; 83(3): 333-47).
These findings suggest p38 MAP-kinase may prove a useful target for the
control of SARS symptoms and possibly also to limit replication of the
virus. Perhaps p38 MAP-kinase inhibitors could have application in in the
treatment of SARS? I gather that 3 such compounds (SB281832, BiRB0797, and
Ro320-1195) have gone through phase II clinical trials for treatment of
asthma and/or rheumatoid arthritis and that pharmacokinetics and potential
toxicities of these compounds must therefore have been characterized.

Use of salicylate in treatment of SARS - possible contraindication
------------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up to my earlier posting [see part 1 above] concerning the
possible utility of p38 MAP-kinase inhibitors in the treatment of SARS, I
have located a number of references [see: (1) and (2) below] where p38
MAP-kinase has been reported to be ACTIVATED by salicylates.
Assuming that, as in the case of mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV),
activation of p38 MAP-kinase contributes to SARS virus replication, these
results suggest that salicylates should NOT be given to SARS patients. In
view of the antipyretic effects of ASA (acetylsalicylic acid, aspirin) this
drug is likely to be in widespread use among early-stage SARS patients. It
could be a factor contributing to the severity of the syndrome. For this
reason I believe it imperative that ASA use among SARS patients be assessed
as rapidly as possible in order to determine whether it has contributed to
the severity of individual cases.

[Normally ProMED-mail does not post reports on development of drugs,
vaccines, or treatment protocols, but the possible contraindication to the
use of ASA in treatment of SARS patients identified by Professor
Pulleyblank deserves wider consideration. - Mod.CP
Of course these ideas are highly speculative but they may represent one
rational place to start looking for antiviral agents active against the
SARS coronavirus. Most currently used antiviral agents exploit pathways
that are distinct from those in the uninfected host, for example reverse
transcriptase in HIV or thymidine kinase in herpesviruses. The possible
link of the MAP-kinase pathway with aspirin is intriguing -- salicylates
are contraindicated in influenza infection because their use has been
linked to Reyes syndrome. - Mod.LM]
