Pig disease hits Southern Vietnam
-------------------------------------------
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome
(PRRS), commonly known as blue-ear disease, has
recently stricken dozens of pigs in Vietnam's
southern Long An province, according to local
newspaper Labor on Monday [30 Jul 2007].
Specimens from some out of over 60 pigs raised by
2 households in the province's Can Giuoc
district, have tested positive to PRRS, China's
Xinhua news agency quoted the newspaper as saying here.
Local residents said infected pigs in the central
region are being transported to such southern
provinces as Long An, Bac Lieu and Ca Mau. Now,
thousands of pigs in the central localities of
Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Da Nang and Hue, are being infected with PRRS.
Local veterinary agencies are intensifying the
culling of infected pigs to prevent the disease
from spreading, and establishing checkpoints
along main roads to control the transport of the
animal. The state offers raisers financial
assistance of USD 0.60 for each kg of infected pigs culled.
PRRS is characterized by reproductive failure of
sows and respiratory problems of piglets and
growing pigs. It occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world.
The reproductive failure is characterized by
infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions,
stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that
often die soon after birth from respiratory
disease and secondary infections, according to
the World Organization for Animal Health.

Porcine disease spreads in central provinces
-------------------------------------------------------
Pigs in Thua Thien -- Hue province have fallen
prey to blue ear disease, which has been sweeping
through central Vietnam, according to the Animal
Health Department. The department reported the
outbreak Friday [27 Jul 2007] following reports
of some 30 000 other pigs that have been infected
Quang Ngai province since June [2007]. Thua Thien
-- Hue is the 3rd area �- after neighboring Quang
Ngai and Danang -� to register an influx of the disease.
The department has tested samples from over 1400
pigs that were reported sick in Phu Vang and
Huong Thuy district [13 Jul 2007]. The pigs were
positive for blue ear, or Porcine Reproductive
and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). Symptoms include
high fever, respiratory prob�lems, constipation and diarrhea.
Local agencies have begun working with residents
to cull and destroy the sick pigs in Quang Ngai.
On Tuesday [24 Jul 2007], Minister of Agriculture
and Rural Development Cao Duc Phat sent a message
to central-run cities and provinces asking them
to take pre-emptive actions against blue ear
disease. Phat also said that unaffected regions
should set up checkpoints to stop the transport
of diseased pigs and pork products to prevent the spread of the disease.
PRRS in pigs is caused by the Lelstad virus and
causes blue ears, loss of appetite, high fever,
miscarriage and premature delivery among sows.
Coughing, respiratory problems and death occur in extreme cases
Viet Nam has also been hit by another porcine
disease. Some 26 people have reportedly
contracted a pig-borne disease called
Streptococcus suis, a bacteria that has killed 2
of the 26 so far. [See PRO/MBDS postings on
Streptococcus suis in humans in Viet Nam listed below - Mod.MPP.]
The sickness usually manifests high fever, nausea
and vomiting, followed by meningitis,
hemorrhages, toxic shock and even comas in severe cases.

[The most recent report on PRRS from Viet Nam to
OIE was submitted 20 Apr 2007 and reported on the
initial 7 outbreaks identified (see prior
PRO/MBDS reports referenced below, and
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5248>
for the full report to OIE). At that time,
outbreaks were identified in Hung Yen, Bac Ninh,
Bac Giang, Thai Binh and Son La Provinces -- all
located in the northern region of Viet Nam. The
current outbreaks reported in the above newswire
are occurring in Thua Thien Hue, Quang Ngai and
Danang Provinces, all located in the Central
region of Viet Nam and in Long An Province in the Southern region of Viet Nam.

[An epizootic with rather similar nature has been
spreading in neighbouring China since mid-2006,
initially regarded as a multifactorial syndrome
called "Pig High Fever Disease", later as "highly
Pathogenic PRRS". According to Chinese
scientists, the PRRS virus there is of type II
(with a North American strain as a prototype). On
the other hand, media reports from Viet Nam (not
scientific sources) repeatedly mention the
Lelystad virus (PRRS type I) as the causative
agent. In view of the potential international
impact of the syndrome in China (where 25
provinces have reportedly been affected) and its
alarming spread in Viet Nam, the involvement of
international organisations such as the FAO and
OIE and of international reference laboratories
seem essential, with priority given to final
diagnosis, including the exclusion of various
other potential pathogens, and comparison between
the Chinese and the Viet Namese PRRSV isolates. - Mod.AS]
