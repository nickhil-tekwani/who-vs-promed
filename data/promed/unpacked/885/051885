[2] Skunk, feline - Tennessee
Date: Sun 18 Jul 2010

A skunk found at the Whispering Oaks apartment complex on Old Rock
Creek Road has tested positive for rabies, prompting the Tullahoma
Public Works Department to advise residents to be aware of the
circumstances.

Wayne Limbaugh, public works director whose department oversees the
city's animal control operations, said the skunk was found last Friday
[18 Jul 2010] and test results came back this week revealing the
animal had rabies. He said a cat and 3 kittens found in the area had
apparently come in contact with the skunk and had contracted rabies.
They were euthanized, he added.

Limbaugh said skunks tend to be less active during daylight hours, and
just seeing one is an indication the animal could be rabid. He added
that rabid animals tend to appear disoriented.

Authorities from Waller County are warning pet owners to get their
animals vaccinated for rabies after a dog was found with the disease.

Sheriff Glen Smith reported the rabies test on the dog confirmed it
was infected with rabies typically found in skunks. The dog had been
exposed to a skunk several months ago and recently became sick. The
owners took their dog to a local veterinarian, who prescribed a rabies
test.

According to the Texas state health records, this is the 1st case of
rabies in a dog found in Waller County in over 20 years.

[If the dog was exposed several months ago, one wonders why it was not
reported, why the animal was not vaccinated, and how many people have
been exposed to the dog? How many people are undergoing post exposure
prophylaxis and why was this not reported? - Mod.TG]

[4] Skunk, human exposure - Iowa

Health officials issued a warning to the public on Tuesday [20 Jul
2010] after they said an Iowa family brought home a baby skunk that
later tested positive for rabies. The family found a baby skunk and
brought it into their home to raise as a pet, officials said. When the
skunk became ill several weeks later, a vet was called who found the
skunk had rabies.

Officials said the northwest Iowa family's experience is evidence that
"not all cute creatures are cuddly." Officials said the skunk was
likely infected with rabies before it was brought into the home.

"This is a classic example of a good-hearted person trying to help a
wild creature," said Dr Patricia Quinlisk, Iowa Department of Public
Health medical director. Unfortunately, even the cutest of wild
animals can carry a variety of diseases that are harmful to humans and
other animals. In Iowa, skunks are the reservoir for the rabies virus
and all Iowa skunks should be considered potentially rabid."

All 5 family members are receiving the rabies vaccine. In addition,
more than 20 other family members and friends who came in contact with
the skunk are being tested for rabies, and at least 6 others are
receiving rabies shots.

Officials said the family dog did not have a rabies vaccination and
will have to be put into quarantine for 6 months, or euthanized.

According to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental
Control, 3 Anderson County residents are being treated after they were
exposed to a rabid skunk. The incident happened earlier this month
[July 2010] when 2 dogs became involved in a fight with an adult
female skunk, according to Sue Ferguson with DHEC's Bureau of
Environmental Health.

"One of the 6 baby skunks that were removed from the property near the
Anderson city limits began acting aggressively and was submitted 16
Jul 2010 and tested positive for rabies," Ferguson said in a prepared
release. "The dogs had been vaccinated and are under quarantine for 45
days."

Anyone bitten, scratched, or exposed to the saliva of a rabid animal
must undergo immediate measures to stop the virus from reaching the
brain. Once the rabies virus reaches the brain, the disease is fatal
to animals and humans, so 3 people, 1 man and 2 women are undergoing
the preventive inoculations.

A Haltom City neighborhood is on alert after the city's 1st confirmed
case of rabies in nearly a decade. A bat found in the 5000 block of
Doyle tested positive for the virus, but not before biting a family's
pet dog.

[A woman] worries about her 2-year-old daughter getting hurt. The
Haltom City mother had to make a difficult decision, to protect the
little girl she loves. Skippy, the family's Jack Russell Terrier mix
had to be euthanized. Although [the] pup was vaccinated, out of fear
for her family, she decided to play it safe.

The dog was attacked by a bat Tuesday night [20 Jul 2010]. The only
way to test an animal for rabies is to look at their brain, so you
cannot test an animal before death. "The most important thing is to
keep all domestic pets, cats, dogs, ferrets, vaccinated for rabies at
all times, it could save their life." Brackeen said, "and it's the law."

All mammals can contract rabies, but the 5 most common carriers of the
virus are bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. By law, your pet
must be vaccinated by the age of 4 months.

"People don't realize that rabies is fatal in humans and it's a very
scary disease." Brackeen said. "rabies incubates anywhere from 3 weeks
up to a year so there was no way to know when he would show symptoms
if he would at all."

A raccoon exhibiting the signs of rabies attacked a Money Island woman
Wednesday night [21 Jul 2010], then escaped into the dark.

The victim said she opened her door and the raccoon rushed in,
snarling and attacking her. She suffered a puncture wound on the calf
of one leg and scratches before the animal attacked her dog and her
cat. Her 7-year-old grandson was in another room and was not harmed.
"It was vicious," the victim said. "It was skinny and sickly looking
and had its back arched. I don't remember how I got it out of the
house."

She called state police while it was still in her house, but says was
asked by the police dispatcher what she wanted them to do about it.
The victim was told to call the township's animal control officer, but
he couldn't be reached until the following morning. She said she
called nearby neighbors to warn them about the raccoon. [If the animal
is still in the house at the time of the telephone call, it seems
police should have come out and assisted in killing the animal to be
sure it could be tested. - Mod.TG]

Both her dog and cat had been vaccinated for rabies and the victim
said she had been treated recently after being attacked by a rabid cat
in Vineland. "I'm supposed to be good until 2012," she said. [Despite
having been given post exposure prophylaxis against rabies recently,
the victim should still contact her physician, regarding rabies and
have the wound examined.- Mod.TG]

"When I told the dispatcher I would have got better treatment in
Vineland, she told me then I should call Vineland." [Seems as how some
sensitivity training may be in order for the dispatcher. - Mod.TG]

Ron Sutton, of RS Animal Control, said on Thursday morning [22 Jul
2010] that his son was on the road and would leave a trap near the
victim's house. The younger Sutton told the victim it would be
senseless to leave a trap since the animal was no longer around. The
elder Sutton said in most cases the animal goes off somewhere and dies
and the carcass never is found. He also said its behavior my have been
due to distemper, not rabies. [When differentiating between rabies and
distemper in raccoons, it is not appropriate to make an assumption of
distemper when a human, and 2 pets have been attacked. The risk is too
high. It seems animal control officers need to learn some more about
rabies and communication tactics. - Mod.TG]

The victim is concerned that the raccoon may have bitten an animal
that wasn't vaccinated and there may be other cases of rabies, or
whatever the animal was suffering from,

The Oneida County Health Department has confirmed that 2 children and
1 adult have been exposed to rabies in the City of Rome.

A non-domesticated kitten reportedly bit a 9-year-old child and
subsequently tested positive for rabies. The animal has been confirmed
as part of a litter of kittens, many of which are still roaming the
North Rome area, all of whom may be rabid.

"We have a big problem with this," said County Public Information
Officer Ken Fanelli. "(Stray) cats are all over the place and this is
what happens." He confirmed that people who have been exposed to a
rabid animal can be given post-exposure vaccinations and a globulin
(antibody) injection to protect them against becoming infected. Any
person bitten by an animal should wash the wound thoroughly with soap
and water and seek medical attention immediately.

Rome Police Detective Commander Tim Bates was not aware of the
incident, but became alarmed as his family had a stray kitten in their
bushes Wednesday night [21 JUL 2010]. He lives further north in Rome.

[10] Feline, human exposure - Florida

Authorities are investigating a confirmed case of rabies in rural
Santa Rosa County. A domesticated cat that bit and scratched an
elderly woman in Allentown on Friday, 16 Jul 2010, has tested positive
for the rabies virus, according to Santa Rosa County Public
Information Officer Joy Tsubooka.

Santa Rosa County Animal Control Officers and the Sheriff's Office
have gone door-to-door in the rural Penton Road area, notifying
residents of the infection and asking those with pets for proof of
current vacation. Any unvaccinated cat or dog, including strays, will
be taken to Santa Rosa County Animal Services and quarantined for 10
days, Tsubooka said. 6 humane traps have also been set in the area.

The victim reported the bite after the cat exhibited unusually
aggressive behavior, a common sign of rabies...

It is Florida State law that every owner of an animal, 4 months of age
or older, must vaccinate their animals against rabies by a licensed
veterinarian with the US approved rabies vaccine. Local animal control
officers can impound any animal that does not have a rabies tag and/or
a rabies certificate signed by a licensed veterinarian. If a pet is
impounded, the owner will be responsible for obtaining the proper
vaccination within 72 hours and will have to pay any impound fees.
Violators can incur fines up to USD 500.

A dog was euthanized after coming into contact with a rabid fox, Rowan
County Animal Control reported. This is the county's 10th rabies case
of the year [2010]. This is the 4th fox found to be rabid in the
county this year.

in the same area where their dog, Massry, a female Doberman, was kept.
On Friday [23 Jul 2010], the fox was submitted for rabies testing.
Massry was not current on her rabies vaccination and was held in
quarantine at the Animal Shelter until the owners were notified of the
test results.

[The couple was] informed of the positive results. The dog was
euthanized at the owner's request, a report said.

[Regardless of the state, it is responsible animal ownership to have
your pet vaccinated against rabies. While some states may vary in the
requirements, most require vaccination by the age of 4 months and
either annually or every 3 years, depending upon the type of vaccine
used and what the state law is.

If you are bitten, wash the wound with soap and water and seek medical
attention for the wound. If the animal is a wild animal, seek
assistance from animal control or even the police department. The
animal should be tested if possible. If not, then post exposure
prophylaxis against rabies is necessary.

Each state has slightly different regulations regarding vaccinated
pets that have been exposed. Please check with your veterinarian
regarding the laws regarding your pets in the event of an exposure. -
