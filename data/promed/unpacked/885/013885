VULTURE DIE-OFF - INDIA (GUJARAT)

A total of 38-40 white-backed vultures [WBVs] have been reported dead
since 18 May 2005 from the Mahua vulture colony in the Bhavnagar
District of Gujarat. 140-142 WBVs were spotted in this colony during
a vulture census conducted by GEER Foundation in Gujarat.
A few days before this incident, there was a mass mortality of birds
in 50-60 poultry farms around the colony. There is a report of more
than 100 000 - 150 000 poultry deaths due to the highly infectious
viral disease, ranikhet [Newcastle disease].
The vulture colony is situated very close to these poultry farms, and
after their death, these ranikhet-affected poultry were not buried
but were thrown in an open area nearby. Our information tells us this
is a airborne disease, so this is very likely the reason that
vultures were affected with ranikhet in this area.
We request the attention of forest officials and other officers in
this matter and hope that detailed investigations will be done very
soon.

[If it was the virus affecting the chickens, the vultures may have acquired it
through consumption of the carcasses [rather than by airborne spread]. It could
also be that the vultures' demise is unrelated to the poultry.
Previously, in ProMED-mail post 20030513459, it was reported that
"the catastrophic decline of griffon vultures in south Asia is being
caused not by a mysterious disease, as had been thought, but a common
painkiller given to sick cattle." I am not aware that this drug is
also used on poultry, but perhaps in India, it may be. Clearly, this
more recent die-off needs more thorough investigation.

[Ranikhet disease is one of the names given to Newcastle disease (NCD),
a paramyxovirus infection initially reported from Java in 1926, followed
soon by outbreaks in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in the UK, Ranikhet in India, and
Colombo in Sri Lanka. Other names given to NCD over the years include fowl
pest, pseudofowl pest, and avian pneumoencephalitis. - Mod.AS]
