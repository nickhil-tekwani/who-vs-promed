The same discovery was reported by Andre J. Nahmias twelve years ago (see
Nahmias et al. Lancet 1986;i:1279-80). There must be something new in the
news.

[Re the Feb 12 post concerning an amplification of HIV genome in a serum
from 1959 from [ex- Zaire. I certainly do not share the view of Ho et al.
on the age determination of the ancestor virus. Other phylogenetic data
indicate the virus is around 100 000 years older than the epidemic, i.e.
the virus has been with man on the African continent in an endemic form
almost as long as _Homo sapiens_ has existed. The new developments
resulting in the epidemic are social in character, i.e. break down of
thousand year old social structure over a very short period, creation of
mega cities etc. and in the West, conglomerates of homosexuals with high
promiscuity, epidemics of intravenous drug abuse etc. Since you have no
good collection of sera from the 16th century, even if you are David Ho you
can certainly not date back the age of the virus to early 1950's with any
degree of credibility. This whole science deviates from the important
question i.e. what initiated and drives the epidemic.
