Notes from the Field: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae Producing OXA-48-like Carbapenemases -- United States, 2010-2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Lyman M, Walters M, Lonsway D, et al.]

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are bacteria that are often resistant to most classes of antibiotics and cause health care-associated infections with high mortality rates (1). Among CRE, strains that carry plasmid-encoded carbapenemase enzymes that inactivate carbapenem antibiotics are of greatest public health concern because of their potential for rapid global dissemination, as evidenced by the increasing distribution of CRE that produce the _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase [KPC] and the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase [NDM]. Newly described resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, such as plasmid-mediated resistance to the last-line antimicrobial colistin, recently detected in China [ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance - China: colistin, plasmid-encoded, humans, animals 20151122.3810204], and resistance to the newly approved antimicrobial, ceftazidime-avibactam, identified from a U.S. _K. pneumoniae_ carbapenemase-producing isolate, highlight the continued urgency to delay spread of CRE (2,3). Monitoring the emergence of carbapenemases is crucial to limiting their spread; identification of patients carrying carbapenemase-producing CRE should result in the institution of transmission-based precautions and enhanced environmental cleaning to prevent transmission [http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/cre/cre-toolkit/index.html].* The OXA-48 carbapenemase was 1st identified in Enterobacteriaceae in Turkey in 2001 (2), and OXA-48-like variants have subsequently been reported around the world. The 1st U.S. reports of OXA-48-like carbapenemases were published in 2013 and included retrospectively identified isolates from 2009 (3) and 2 isolates collected in 2012 from patients in Virginia who had recently been hospitalized outside the United States (4). Although there are limited additional published reports from the United States (5), CDC continues to receive reports of these organisms. This report describes patients identified as carrying CRE producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases in the United States during June 2010-August 2015.

CDC received reports of 52 CRE isolates producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases collected from 43 patients in 19 states during June 2010-August 2015 (Figure); 7 of these isolates were identified retrospectively from 6 patients. Eight isolates from 4 patients were part of 2 different clusters in the United States during 2014. The number of patients from whom CRE isolates producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases were identified ranged from one in 2010 to 11 per year in 2013, 2014, and 2015. 35 patients (81 percent) had OXA-48-like carbapenemase identified from _K. pneumoniae_ isolates, 7 (16 percent) from _Escherichia coli_ isolates, one (2 percent) from an _Enterobacter aerogenes_ isolate, and 1 (2 percent) from a _Klebsiella ozaenae_ isolate; 2 of which were isolates of different species from a single patient. Isolates with both New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase and OXA-48-like carbapenemase genes were obtained from 5 patients (12 percent). The most common sources were urine (22 patients [51 percent]) and respiratory specimens (9 patients [21 percent]).

The median age among 35 (81 percent) patients for whom age was reported was 70 years (range = 29-91 years). Among 29 patients for whom a travel history was available, 19 (66 percent) had traveled internationally during the year before specimen collection, and 16 (55 percent) were hospitalized outside the United States for greater than or equal to 1 night; these percentages increased to 76 percent and 64 percent, respectively, when cases associated with the 2 domestic clusters were excluded. India was the most frequently reported destination among patients with international travel (11 of 19 patients) and international hospitalization (9 of 16).

CRE producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases have demonstrated the ability to spread in other countries (6) and cause outbreaks in health care settings. Factors potentially contributing to the spread of these organisms include the high transfer efficiency of the plasmid containing OXA-48-like genes (6) and challenges in identifying these organisms. These challenges in identification occur because of the limited testing for CRE resistance mechanisms in U.S. clinical laboratories and the different susceptibility profiles of these organisms compared with other carbapenemase-producing CRE, making them difficult to differentiate from CRE that do not produce carbapenemases (organisms producing OXA-48-like carbapenemases might be susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins). The modification of the CDC CRE surveillance definition in January 2015 to include organisms that are resistant to ertapenem or that possess a carbapenemase gene should improve sensitivity for detecting OXA-48-producing CRE (7).

Although clusters of CRE expressing OXA-48-like carbapenemases suggest transmission has occurred in the United States, the majority of identified patients were reported to have had exposure to health care outside the United States. This is consistent with recommendations in the CDC Health Advisory from February 2013 (8), which sought to prevent transmission of isolates producing non-_K. pneumoniae_ carbapenemases by improving their detection in patients recently hospitalized outside the United States. Recommendations include determining the mechanism of resistance for any CRE isolated from such patients and considering CRE screening of these patients on admission.

[Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that destroy the carbapenems, as well as frequently most other beta-lactam antibiotics. Other resistance mechanisms, which include reduced affinity of penicillin-binding protein (PBPs) for carbapenems, increased efflux of the beta-lactam antibiotics, or decreased permeability of the outer membrane due to loss of outer membrane porin channels, may be combined with high-level production of the carbapenemase. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases such as KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.); NDMs (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases such as NDM-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, etc.); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases). Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, as is OXA-48 in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, which can facilitate spread of resistance genes among organisms of the same species or even different bacterial species. The plasmids frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline.

OXA-type beta-lactamases hydrolyse the isoxazolylpenicillin oxacillin much faster than penicillin G. There are over 100 different variants of OXA-type beta-lactamases, some of which exhibit carbapenem-hydrolysing activities. Although many of the OXA-type carbapenemases show only weak carbapenemase activity, carbapenem resistance may result from a combined action of an OXA-type carbapenemase and a secondary resistance mechanism such as overexpressed efflux pumps or outer membrane porin deficiencies, as has been found in OXA-48-producing _K. pneumoniae_ (http://aac.asm.org/content/48/1/15.full.pdf+html). Enterobacteriaceae producing OXA-48-group carbapenemase do not have characteristic susceptibility patterns, which makes their recognition difficult (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884727/). OXA-48 has been found to be weakly inhibited by clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam (http://aac.asm.org/content/48/1/15.full). - Mod.ML
