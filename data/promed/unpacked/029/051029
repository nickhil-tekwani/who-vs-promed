Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, has cautioned horse-rearing farmers against possible outbreak of equine herpesvirus disease in Punjab. For the last 2 months, a large number of horses with nervous form have been presented at the university hospital for the complaint of this disease.

The disease is present in almost all the parts of the state with most of the cases being reported from Malwa region of Bathinda, Faridkot, Mukatsar Sahib, Mansa, and Moga, etc., which is the major equine-rearing belt of the state.

The unusual thing about the outbreak is presence of only nervous signs and absence of any respiratory form or abortion in pregnant mares as described in herpes infections literature. A large number of horses belonging to police, ITBP, BSF, and other paramilitary and military forces in north India are at risk of the disease and, hence, should be vaccinated against this disease. The information was shared by Dr Ashwani Kumar, HoD, Veterinary Medicine.

He discussed symptoms and said that there may be sudden onset of hind-quarter paresis of various degrees, adding that animals show inability/difficulty to get up. Animal faces ataxia or staggering of gait due to hind-quarter weakness. Recumbency is noticed in some horses, he said.

The experts have asked to vaccinate all the unexposed horses/mares immediately. "Give booster doses to all vaccinated pregnant mares. Vaccinate young foals for the 1st time at 9 months, with a booster dose after 4 week and 6 months. Vaccinate adult horses initially with 2 doses 3-4 weeks apart and then annually."

[Equine rhinopneumonitis (ER) (also known as infection with equid herpesvirus) is a collective term for any one of several contagious, clinical disease entities of equids that may occur as a result of infection by either of 2 closely related herpesviruses, equid herpesvirus-1 and -4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4). Infection with EHV-1 is listed by the WOAH. EHV-1 and EHV-4 are endemic in most domestic equine populations worldwide.

Primary infection by either EHV-1 or EHV-4 is characterised by upper respiratory tract disease of varying severity that is related to the age and immunological status of the infected animal. EHV-1 also causes the more serious complications of abortion, perinatal foal death, or paralytic neurological disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy). EHV-4 has been associated with sporadic cases of abortion, but not the large outbreaks associated with EHV-1. Like other herpesviruses, EHV-1 and -4 induce long-lasting latent infections and can be reactivated following stress or pregnancy. Most horses are likely to be re-infected multiple times during their lifetime, often mildly or subclinically. Detection of viral DNA or anti-EHV antibodies should therefore be interpreted with care. The above and additional information is available in WOAH Terrestrial Manual, chapter 3.6.9., "Equine rhinopneumonitis (infection with equid herpesvirus-1 and -4)," at https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.06.09_EQUINE_RHINO.pdf.

The suspicion of herpesvirus infection in the described horses, presenting neurological signs without respiratory involvement, underlines the need for laboratory confirmation. Horse diseases with neurological symptoms, including equine encephalosis and West Nile fever, should be excluded. Information from knowledgeable sources about the evolvement and final diagnosis of the event will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
