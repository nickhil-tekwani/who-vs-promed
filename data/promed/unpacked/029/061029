OFFICIALS WARN OF LEGIONELLA SPREAD
A fifth person has been struck down in the Moonee Ponds [legionellosis
outbreak, prompting calls last night by State health officials for anyone
in the area with lingering flu-like symptoms to seek urgent medical help. A
spokesman also warned there could be more cases of the deadly disease,
which has already killed one woman and hospitalised four others.
An Essendon man, 79, was last night battling for his life in the John
Fawkner Hospital, while a woman, 49, also admitted to hospital earlier this
week with the disease, was still in a stable condition.
A woman, 73, died on June 30 and two others were hospitalised early this
month after contracting the disease, which infected two office building
cooling towers adjacent to Puckle Street, Moonee Ponds.
The bacteria were located in the cooling towers of the Australian Taxation
Office building in Gladstone Street and the Caseready Meats tower in Young
Street.
One of the infected women worked at the tax office, while another was a
contract worker at the city tax office, but lived in Moonee Ponds.
The three other, elderly, victims contracted the disease after shopping in
the area.
The spokesman said microbiological tests from cooling towers on three other
buildings in the Moonee Ponds shopping centre had not been completed.
Victoria's Chief Health Officer, Graham Rouch, called on anyone living,
shopping or working in the Moonee Ponds area, with sustained flu-like
symptoms, to contact a doctor. "Legionnaire's disease cuses flu-like
symptoms such as headache, fever, chills, muscle aches and pains, followed
by respiratory problems and pneumonia developed over three or four days,"
Dr Rouch said.
"Infection is acquired through breathing in very fine droplets of water
which contain the bacteria.
"The incubation period for legionnaire's disease is up to 10 days and it
may then take several more days for symptoms to become apparent."
Dr Rouch said the two latest victims had contracted the disease in the same
outbreak, before the cooling towers had been cleaned and disinfected. But
he said none of the cases had yet been positively linked to either the tax
office or meat works.
Unions have claimed the tax office failed to decontaminate an air
conditioning tower at the Moonee Ponds office.
