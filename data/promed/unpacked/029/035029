Medics are rallying to help 46 Ukrainian refugees who were placed in an emergency rest centre in Banteer yesterday evening [16 Apr 2022]. A number of refugees complained of feeling unwell upon arrival. It is believed they had been struck by an outbreak of a vomiting bug - or a possible case of food poisoning.

Medical assistance was called immediately, and help was present on site overnight. A number of people are understood to have been taken to hospital by ambulance. The HSE's Public Health Unit has been mobilised, and the centre currently has restricted access while the matter is being addressed.

[Clusters of vomiting disease in a population is certainly suggestive of norovirus infection. The virus is named after the city of Norwalk, Ohio, where an outbreak occurred in 1968.

Norovirus is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide throughout the year, with peak activity in winter months, when it has been called winter vomiting disease. Infection is characterized by non-bloody watery diarrhea, vomiting, low-grade fever, and abdominal cramping pain, lasting 1-3 days, affecting all ages, but it can be severe, even deadly, in the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions. Transmission occurs via direct contact with people shedding _Norovirus_ in feces or vomitus or into the air during vomiting; transmission may also occur indirectly through environmental or food contamination with their feces or vomit, especially in closed settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, cruise ships, and hotels (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/norovirus/229110-ANoroCaseFactSheet508.pdf).

The ease of its transmission, a very low infectious dose (18 or more viral particles), a short incubation period (12-48 hours), environmental persistence (on surfaces for several weeks and in water for months), lack of durable immunity following infection, and little cross-protective immunity against different genotypes of the virus enables norovirus to spread rapidly in confined populations. - Mod.LL
