Malaria claimed 185 lives in the state from April 2010 to March 2011,
which is the highest annual number of casualties from the disease
reported in the last 7 years.

Of the 185 casualties, Mumbai alone accounted for 137. These are the
figures from the latest epidemiology report on malaria released by the
state health's department in April this year [2011].

The state registered only around 60-65 deaths in 2003-04. Pune
district has been immune to the mosquito-borne disease, with just 4
deaths in 2010-11. Notably, Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad did not
report a single malarial death last year [2010].

"There is a perceptible rise in malaria cases this year [2011], which
can be attributed to the huge construction activities in Mumbai and
the rest of the state. Besides, a consolidated surveillance has also
resulted in enhanced detection of malaria cases in 2010-11," said V.
D. Khanande, joint director of the state health services, adding that
a central government team recently evaluated the state's pre-monsoon
preparations.

As many as 138 605 positive cases were recorded in the state in
2010-11, which is again high as compared to 85 435 cases recorded in
the previous year. In 2007, 67 850 cases were registered, and 67 333
cases were registered in 2008. To control the growing mosquito menace,
the state health department had to seek technical support and
expertise from the Union government.

S. B. Nadoni, senior regional director, regional office, Union health
and family welfare, said: "Efforts to reduce the mortality rate last
year [2010] met with little success. In fact, Maharashtra reported
more cases and deaths. The state even sought the Centre's intervention
in curbing the menace in greater Mumbai and other parts of the
state."

According to Nadoni, the components of the national malaria control
strategy include the use of long-lasting insecticides, bed nets,
indoor residual sprays, early diagnosis and treatment of cases,
management of the environment, forecasting, prevention and control of
epidemics.

Avinash Bhondwe, former president of the Pune unit of the Indian
Medical Association (IMA), said: "The number of malaria, dengue and
chikungunya cases reported by the state health department is just the
tip of the iceberg. A majority of the cases remain under-reported."

[ProMED has been following the report on malaria in Mumbai closely.
We fully agree with the statement by Avinash Bhondwe, former president
of the Pune unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), that: "The
number of malaria, dengue and chikungunya cases reported by the state
health department is just the tip of the iceberg."

As pointed out in previous postings, we believe that the transmission
is driven more by continuous transmission in slum areas than
construction sites.

The reported death of a sailor infected at anchor at Mumbai (Malaria
- India (04): (Mumbai) 2010, falciparum, fatality 20110119.0225) and
the report of over 100 fatalities raise the question of whether
visitors, including merchant ships, should be advised to use malaria
prophylaxis in Mumbai. See the ProMED HealthMap at
