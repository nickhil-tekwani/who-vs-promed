The deaths of 6 children suspected to be suffering from symptoms of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis [JE] in a span of 48 hours has set off alarms in the [Bihar] health department.

[In Muzaffarpur], 4 deaths from the Kejriwal Maternity Clinic and 2 from SKMCH [Shri Krishna Medical College And Hospital] have been reported from the intensive care unit (ICU) of the paediatrics wards. Currently, 11 children suspected to be afflicted with AES are undergoing treatment at Kejriwal Maternity Clinic. Blood samples of these children are being sent to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMI) in Patna for proper investigation.

This summer [2018], 35 kids suspected to be suffering from AES and JE were admitted to SKMCH and Kejriwal Maternity Clinic. Most of the children hailed from Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, and Motihari. They had complained of trembling and heavy bouts of fever. They are being treated accordingly following the line of treatment suggested by the health department, said Lalita Singh, the chief medical officer of Muzaffarpur.

The deputy superintendent of SKMCH, Sunil Kumar Shahi, said: "This summer [2018], 17 kids suspected to be suffering from AES and JE were admitted and 13 children were confirmed of carrying the AES virus. Till Thursday afternoon [14 Jun 2018], 4 deaths have occurred. The rest have been treated and discharged."

The Deputy Superintendent added, "4 kids with suspected AES are undergoing treatment in the ICU of SKMCH."

Lalita said she has alerted all PHCs [primary health centers] in the rural areas to refer suspected cases of AES to SKMCH and Kejriwal Maternity Clinic.

Anganwadi [help provide basic education for children under 6 and enroll women to undertake prenatal care] and Asha [accredited social health activist] workers have already advised people residing in countryside areas to look after the health and hygiene of their children properly. These activists have already conducted door-to-door visits in vulnerable villages to spread awareness about the virus. Parents have been advised not to let children sleep on an empty stomach and provide kids with sweets and glucose drinks at night to keep the AES virus at bay.

[It is not clear how many of these cases are Japanese encephalitis (JE), if they are laboratory confirmed, and how many are AES. Bihar state is into the transmission season for JE virus and the occurrence of AES cases of undetermined etiology.

The deputy superintendent of SKMCH stated that 13 children were confirmed of carrying the AES virus. There is no virus classified as AES virus although unnamed enteroviruses have been suspected, raising the question of what was confirmed. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, and lychee fruit consumption. Scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_) has recently been implicated in many AES cases. A retrospective study by Murhekar M et al (https://academic.oup.com/jme/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jme/tjy042/4955586) indicates that scrub typhus may be responsible for the majority of AES cases.

Avoidance of mosquito bites as is usually recommended is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult. Control of vector mosquitoes is logistically difficult and expensive. There is no mention in the report above that the cases had been vaccinated. - Mod.TY
