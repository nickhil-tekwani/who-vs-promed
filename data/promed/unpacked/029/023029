Rift Valley fever is decimating the herds in Mananjary. Nearly 500 zebu [humped cattle] have died in a few weeks. The farmers of the herds are at a loss. They have lost, in a blink of an eye, their zebus, who represent their wealth.

This acute hemorrhagic viral disease kills the zebus early every day in this district, "this morning [14 Apr 2021] 3 zebus have died. Yesterday [13 Apr 2021] we counted 7 [deaths] in different enclosures, and at the slaughterhouse," said Dr Moez Tajdin, the veterinarian from Mananjary.

This viral disease has decimated 425 zebus in this district since the end of March [2021] that marked the start of the disease according to a report from the local veterinary services. In Fokontany of Ambalamainty, commune of Anosiparihy, each enclosure has counted 8 dead zebus a day. These figures have lessened by 2 in Fokontany, for the moment, added the source. Teams from the Mananjary Veterinary Services have been mobilized to deal with the epidemic. "We are visiting each commune to establish a plan of prevention," said the veterinarian. The zebus are not the only victim; 2 ewes have aborted.

Apart from the treatment of ill animals, the authorities of Mananjary are instructing herders to separate their ill animals from the fit and well ones and to forbid the movement of ill [infected] animals.

But nothing has been gained. Confusion from the important loss of their animals makes the herders more resistant to follow this advice. The veterinary officers are trying to intercept ill animals in the slaughterhouse.

At the same time, this disease is spreading to more and more zones. At Manakara, at 160 km [about 100 mi] from where the disease started in the region of Vatovavy Fitoviny, 20 ill zebus have been noted on the last time [this place was visited].

These cases give rise to suspicion. The existence of Rift Valley fever at Manakara has not, as yet, been confirmed. A part of Vatovavy Fitovinany, the disease is raging, equally, in the regions of Diana and Atsimo Andrefana. More than 800 animals have been affected by the disease in these 3 regions since the beginning of the epidemic.

The Veterinary Service affirms that they have observed the deaths of humans from this disease. The deaths of 5 people who presented symptoms of Rift Valley fever virus have died in different villages in the district of Mananjary. Last week, victims presented with headaches and stomachaches. The victims had consumed meat before they died. Officials from the Mananjary Health district have not confirmed the occurrence of human deaths from this disease as of yesterday [13 Apr 2021]. Health teams are now visiting villages affected by [touched by] the disease to identify [human] cases of this disease, which above all affects animals, can be transmitted to humans by the consumption of milk and undercooked or raw meat [from infected animals]. Those people in contact with infected animals have also been warned.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) has been reported in Madagascar earlier this year (2021) (see Rift Valley fever - Madagascar: (TL) livestock, OIE 20210405.8288655) and previously in 2008 and 2009. That recent report indicated that 22 sheep and 110 goats had RVF. The above report indicates that more than 800 animals have been affected and the outbreak is expanding to new areas. It is not clear if these animal cases have been laboratory confirmed. The human cases are suspected as RVF. The increased surveillance for animal and human cases is prudent. - Mod.TY
