2 comments / questions on West Nile virus vaccinations:
1. At the Toronto Zoo, we have a group of 18 green-naped lorikeets,
and each was vaccinated for West Nile virus 3 times in 2002 (1 ml
Fort Dodge WNV vaccine IM) with no apparent problems. However, when
we boosted them with a similar single dose this year, we lost 4
birds. The deaths occurred on days 2, 3, 10 and 10 after vaccination.
2 birds were found dead, while 2 others were found lethargic and
dyspneic, and died despite supportive care. Blood samples from the
latter 2 birds showed marked anemia and markedly elevated granulocyte
counts.
On necropsy, there were no significant gross lesions. Histologically,
there were very few red cells, and massive erythrophagocytosis,
primarily in the liver. In the first 2 birds the phagocytized
erythrocytes were whole or barely broken down, while in the last 2
birds there were more typical red inclusions and pigment formation.
Bacterial culture from all 4 birds revealed no significant pathogens,
and a PCR viral/chlamydial panel on blood was negative.
It all looks like some form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, possibly
induced by the vaccination.
2. We also have a group of Loggerhead shrikes, and each was
vaccinated for West Nile virus 3 times this spring (0.5 ml Fort Dodge
WNV vaccine IM). Subsequently, we have had little evidence of
breeding this year (as compared to excellent breeding in the previous
2 years). Obviously, there are many possible causes for this, but
concern has arisen that the vaccination may have been responsible.
Anyhow, we just wanted to raise awareness regarding these issues, and
wondered whether anyone else has had similar experiences.

[Currently the only vaccine against West Nile Virus is manufactured
by Fort Dodge and is approved for use in equines. Use in other
species is extra-label. For this reason, there are no research data
to help answer the questions or shed light on any of the observations
noted here.
Since the vaccine is being used in an extra-label fashion, what basis
was there for vaccinating the birds 3 times? There has been some
serology work done by some veterinarians in zoos and possibly with
the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians. At the time of this
posting, we were still awaiting responses from some veterinarians
involved in this serology effort.- Mod.TG]
