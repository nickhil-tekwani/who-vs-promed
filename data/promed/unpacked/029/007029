Epizootic hemorrhagic disease has been confirmed in Harrison County after a deer collected from the Brushy Fork area tested positive for the virus. Another sample from a deer collected along US [route] 50 near Salem was sent Thursday [5 Sep 2019] for testing, a state Division of Natural Resources (DNR) biologist has confirmed.

Samples collected from dead deer in Marion and Monongalia counties also were sent for testing, and results are expected in about a week, according to Steven E. Rauch, wildlife biologist at the DNR's District 1 Office.

The District 1 Office is headquartered in Farmington and covers 12 northern counties, including Harrison, Marion, Monongalia and Taylor.

Although reports of dead deer also have come from Taylor County, a suitable sample for testing has yet to be collected there, Rauch said.

A sample has to be relatively fresh to be used for testing and must be overnighted to a lab at the University of Georgia. Many times, reports of dead deer come in too long after death or on a weekend when no one is available at the lab to accept an overnighted sample, Rauch said.

In Harrison County, reports were largely coming from the Clarksburg, Bridgeport and Nutter Fort area, so DNR staff tried to pull a sample from near that area, he said.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease does not pose a risk to humans, according to Dr. Erika Alt, staff veterinarian and Cervid Program manager for the state Department of Agriculture.

Rauch said he does not expect substantial impacts to deer populations in the long-term. "We don't expect any long-term effects on the population," Rauch said. "In Harrison County, we're getting numerous calls, but in the grand scheme of things, it's localized."

On [22 Aug 2019], the DNR reported in a news release that an outbreak of the virus had been identified in deer in Summers, Monroe and Greenbrier counties.

The virus does not present in West Virginia every year, but previous outbreaks were reported in 1996, 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017, according to the news release. There were confirmed cases in Harrison County during the 2017 outbreak, Rauch said.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus does not normally have a major impact on the deer population, but may cause local reductions of 20% or less in a deer herd, according to the DNR news release.

"The disease disappears with the 1st frost, because the spread of the virus is dependent on small midges called _Culicoides_ that are killed by cold temperatures," said Gary Foster, the DNR's assistant chief in charge of game management, in the news release.

Hemorrhagic disease in white-tail deer also can be caused by blue tongue virus, but no cases of blue tongue virus have been detected in West Virginia thus far. Blue tongue virus is also not transmissible to humans, Alt said.

While epizootic hemorrhagic disease is not a concern for people when consuming venison, it is never recommended to consume an animal that appears obviously ill "for the reason we don't know what made it sick," said Dr. Mark Povroznik, United Hospital Center's chief quality officer and chairman of infection control.

"There are a number of natural diseases that can affect the white-tail deer. When the population goes unmanaged, disease can begin to unfold. This can be due to parasites or viruses that can spread more easily. Some would make the deer unsafe for human consumption," Povroznik said.

Chronic wasting disease also can impact deer, and while "there is no conclusive evidence that the causative agent of chronic wasting disease can infect humans ... it is recommended to not consume meat from a positive animal or sick animal," Alt said.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease is not related to chronic wasting disease, which has been detected only in Berkeley, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral and Morgan counties in West Virginia, according to the DNR news release.

"Just like cattle and other mammals, deer can be infected with brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis. Thankfully, West Virginia is a brucellosis- and TB-free state as related to cattle because of effective eradication programs," Alt said. "For bovine tuberculosis, when field dressing an elk or deer, hunters should look for tan or yellow pea-sized lumps in the wall of the rib cage or in the lungs. If these lumps are present, the hunter should immediately stop handling the carcass, attach a game tag and contact the local fish and wildlife agency."

Deer with brain abscesses -- more likely seen in bucks as a result of fighting or antler shed that can allow bacteria to enter and form an infection near the skull -- are not suitable for consumption, Povroznik said.

Deer also can get bacterial infections from wounds, including a gunshot that wasn't fatal, an arrow that left a non-fatal wound or skin wounds from antler fights. Some animals heal, but others go on to have chronic infections, Povroznik said.

"The meat surrounding the infected area should be cut away; the remainder is still edible," Povroznik said. "Be careful. If not removed carefully, the infected area can contaminate other exposed meat, which would not be safe to consume."

Hunters also should always take precautions against ticks while outdoors to prevent Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses, Povroznik said.

Landowners and hunters are urged to report sick or dead deer to their DNR district offices in Farmington, Romney, French Creek, Beckley, Point Pleasant, and Parkersburg.

Minnesota's mysterious run as a Midwestern state ostensibly free of a deadly deer virus has come to an end with lab confirmation that a group of wild whitetails in central Minnesota were stricken by epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD).

The outbreak in Stearns County is believed to have killed up to 20 or more deer. Only 2 carcasses suitable for testing and tissue samples from both deer tested positive at National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) announced the results Wednesday morning [11 Sep 2019].

"All of our neighboring states have been dealing with EHD for years,'' said DNR Wildlife Research Manager Lou Cornicelli. "So it was [always] a question of [when] it would show up in Minnesota."

The rapidly progressing disease is carried by biting midges, also known as gnats and no-see-ums. It isn't contagious from deer to deer, and the seasonal risk goes away after the 1st frost, but EHD has potential to significantly reduce local deer populations on a short-term basis, state wildlife officials said.

Just one week ago [4 Sep 2019], the Minnesota Board of Animal Health said EHD killed 2 farmed deer in Houston County. The owner submitted samples because of their suspicious deaths. The virus 1st showed up on a Minnesota deer farm last year [2018], killing 6 animals. But wildlife researchers have never detected an outbreak in the state's wild herd.

"There's no good reason why it hasn't shown up here before," Cornicelli said. Cornicelli said the DNR urges public reporting of deer deaths, especially when numbers of deer die in proximity to each other for unexplained reasons. Deer stricken by EHD often die near water because fevers caused by the disease make them thirsty.

The agency was alerted to 12 to 20 dead deer at different Morrison and Stearns county sites over Labor Day weekend. On Tuesday after Labor Day [3 Sep 2019], DNR crews found 8 to 12 carcasses. The agency said the 2 dead deer testing positive for EHD were found in the St. Stephen area.

The agency also checked out a separate recent report of multiple dead deer on private land in Houston County, but those carcasses were decomposed and not suitable for testing when they were checked by the DNR.

Michelle Carstensen, a DNR wildlife health group leader, said EHD previously has hit hard in Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota and Iowa. Some of the worst outbreaks were in 2012, she said, but Minnesota went unscathed. States further south, including Missouri and Florida, also are prone to EHD.

"It can cause massive numbers of deaths," Carstensen said. "It pops up locally, and it would be newsworthy if it finally landed here."

Researchers say EHD can be worse in dry years because deer are more likely to congregate around water. It also can peak during humid periods late in the summer or early fall if whitetails are in abundance in those areas. Outbreaks remain active until rain disperses the deer, wind disburses the midges or frost kills them.

The virus causes mouth ulcerations, swelling of the head and neck and lung hemorrhaging. Most deer die within 36 hours of showing signs of the disease. The virus is not known to cause disease in humans.

Carstensen said EHD has killed hundreds of deer in Iowa this year [2019]. She was notified late last week [5-6 Sep 2019] by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources that EHD was the suspected cause in 589 deer deaths reported as of [29 Aug 2019], with more reports streaming in. The mortalities were spread across 20 counties, mostly to the south.

Dale Garner of the Iowa DNR told Carstensen in an e-mail that the number of cases grew by 48% in the span of one week. The major area of activity has been in Warren County, squarely south of Des Moines.

In the Houston County deer farm case, the state Board of Animal Health said the 2 deer dying of EHD were part of a herd of 60 tame whitetails. "The owner reports no additional mortality and is actively working to repel and reduce biting midges from their property," Board Assistant Director Linda Glaser said.

[The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ biting fly or midge. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated vector in North America. A deer must be bitten by a midge carrying the virus to become infected. The disease is not transmitted directly from one deer to another but must go through the insect vector. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers of deer is that they are single epizootics which do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer occur almost annually, and the disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October) and have ceased within 2 weeks of the onset of frost, which kills the midge.

Experimentally, the disease can be transmitted to susceptible deer by the inoculation of virus-laden material from infected deer by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or oral routes.

Clinical signs: Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are very similar, although molecularly they are not the same disease.

White-tailed deer develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A constant characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and fear of humans, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate, and fever (affected animals frequent bodies of water to lie in to reduce their body temperature) Eight to 36 hours following the onset of observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate and die.

Pathology: The gross and histological lesions of EHD have been characterized by, as its name implies, extensive hemorrhage. The hemorrhages range from pinpoint to massive in size, and involve different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs appear to be exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved being the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and intestinal tract. Extensive hemorrhaging is the result of interference with the blood-clotting mechanism together with degeneration of blood vessel walls.

Generalized edema and increased pericardial fluid are consistently found in EHD. These changes also reflect the widespread interference with normal blood circulation.

The virus can be recovered from a variety of tissues of animals which have succumbed to EHD. These include blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart and muscle.

Diagnosis: A combination of case history, characteristic signs and lesions, and the isolation of the virus is necessary for a diagnosis of EHD. Useful aids in obtaining a diagnosis are the epizootic nature of the disease, its seasonal occurrence, its spectacular hemorrhagic lesions and the extensive edema. Because of the similarity of its symptoms to other diseases, such as bluetongue and malignant catarrhal fever, the isolation and identification of the virus is essential.

Methods to be used for virus isolation are inoculation of cell cultures, inoculation of susceptible sheep or deer combined with serologic monitoring, and intravenous inoculation of embryonating chicken eggs.

Treatment and control: There is no known effective treatment or control of EHD. Theoretically, an oral vaccine could be developed for administration through a supplementary winter feeding program, but this is presently impossible, impractical and unwarranted.

Significance: Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant effect upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers drastically. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers of deer is that they are single epizootics which do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer occur almost annually, and the disease appears to be enzootic in these areas.

Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild ruminants. The EHD virus can infect domestic animals, most commonly hoof stock, but rarely causes disease.

The edibility of the venison is not impacted by the disease. There is no evidence that humans can contract the EHD virus either from the midge or from handling and eating venison.

Pets and wildlife cannot be infected either by midges or from EHD-infected deer carcasses.
