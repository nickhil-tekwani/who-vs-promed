[The last outbreak in Romania occurred in Tulcea in November 2007 with
a single farm that included 80 susceptible birds and 31 cases, all of
whom died. Prior to that there was a major outbreak in May 2006, which
included 109 farms involving the loss of approximately 200 000
backyard and commercial type chickens. The outbreak covered most parts
of the country but did not include Tulcea, according to the OIE WAHID
