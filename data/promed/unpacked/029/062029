US CDC/ArboNET Report (2006): 2006 West Nile Virus Activity in the
United States (Reported to CDC as of 13 Jun 2006)*
-----------------------------------------------
*Currently, West Nile virus (WNV) maps are updated weekly to reflect
surveillance reports released by state and local health departments
to CDC's ArboNET system for public distribution.
As of 13 Jun 2006 avian, animal or mosquito WNV infections have been
reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Arkansas,
California, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri,
New York, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
Human cases have been reported in Colorado, Mississippi, and Texas.
Maps detailing county-level human, mosquito, veterinary, avian and
sentinel data are published each week on the collaborative USGS/CDC
West Nile virus web site: <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov/>
State / Neuroinvasion* / West Nile fever** / Other*** / Total**** / Deaths
Colorado / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0
Mississippi / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0
Texas / 2 / 0 / 0 / 2 / 0
Totals: 4 / 0 / 0 / 4 / 0
* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally notifiable
diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC [further explanations of
neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever are
available at the URL above].
"Other clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases that occurred and have been reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments since 1 Jan 2006.
ArboNET is the national, electronic surveillance system established
by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other
mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease
activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 4 cases, 4 (100 percent) were reported as West Nile meningitis
or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 0 (0 percent) were reported
as West Nile fever (milder disease), and 0 (0 percent) were
clinically unspecified at this time. Please refer to state health
department web sites for further details regarding state case totals.
