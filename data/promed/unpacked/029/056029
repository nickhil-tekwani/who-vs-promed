[1] Pandemic "tornado" phase
Date: Fri 2 Apr 2021

After a year of waves and surges, the pandemic is entering a "tornado" phase in America. After more than a year of pandemic, after months of an aggressive vaccination campaign, the United States should finally be better positioned to protect itself against the coronavirus. Nearly all of our long-term-care residents are vaccinated. Tens of millions of other people have been vaccinated, and tens of millions more have some level of immunity from previous infection. With more people protected, a new surge could behave differently, but early signals from the states with rising case numbers suggest that this will not universally be the case.

Just look at Michigan, the leading edge of this new surge. Cases are going up quickly, and hospitalizations are moving in lockstep just as they have in past surges. This is a bit of a surprise. Given that so many older, more vulnerable people have been vaccinated, one might expect a divergence in the number of cases and hospitalizations. For the immunized, this disease is essentially harmless. Washington State, for example, has reported just 100 cases and as few as 8 hospitalizations among its 1.2 million fully vaccinated people. But for the vulnerable and unvaccinated, COVID-19 is as devastating as it has always been.

The United States is entering a new phase of the pandemic. Although we've previously described the most devastating periods as "waves" and "surges," the more proper metaphor now is a tornado: Some communities won't see the storm; others will be well fortified against disaster, and the most at-risk places will be crushed. The virus has never hit all places equally, but the remarkable protection of the vaccines, combined with the new attributes of the variants, have created a situation where the pandemic will disappear, but only in some places. The pandemic is or will soon be over for a lot of people in well-resourced, heavily vaccinated communities. In places where vaccination rates are low and risk remains high, more people will join the 550 000 who have already died.

Cases are rising sharply in several different cities, but the patterns look different. In Michigan, some smaller, whiter counties have vaccination rates twice as high as in Detroit, where rising cases are concentrated and the vaccination rate among the city's mostly Black population is still low. According to national survey data, in line with political divergences over masks and social distancing, vaccine hesitancy is now highest among Republicans and white evangelical Christians. In Philadelphia, zip codes that are relatively whiter but have lower educational attainment have experienced the most case growth over the past 30 days. Baltimore's outbreak is growing too, but the data are messy.

In these places, and in other hot spots around the country, the rise in cases is an acute crisis that public-health officials should battle with all the available tools, as my colleague Zeynep Tufekci noted this week. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky spent her weekly press conference on Mon 29 Mar 2021 pleading with the American people, noting "the recurring feeling I have of impending doom." She asked the country to "work together to prevent a 4th surge," and compared the pandemic's path here to the experience of Germany, Italy, and France, where cases have spiked dramatically in the past few weeks.

But the United States might chart its own, very unequal track in the coming weeks. Three distinct factors are now shaping this country's pandemic experience.

1st, the United States did a terrible job preventing transmission of the disease. The country's level of excess death -- the margin over the number of deaths expected in a typical year -- has been high, signaling that the pandemic's true toll has been even steeper than the officially tabulated COVID-19 deaths. Most other countries did not experience the same levels of consistent transmission. A year of unchecked spread means that our 30 million reported cases are a fraction of the total number of people who have been infected. Most estimates place the number closer to 100 million, and possibly tens of millions more.

So unlike in Germany, for example, which fairly effectively suppressed the virus, tens of millions of people in the U.S. have some level of immunity. While reinfection may be more common with some current or future variants, it has been rare so far. That high level of past infection should now help reduce transmission of the virus via population immunity.

2nd, the U.S. is vaccinating people quite efficiently. It has given out the largest absolute number of doses in the world, and trails only a few much smaller countries (Israel, the U.K., and Chile among them) in the percentage of the population that's been vaccinated. Almost 3/4ths of the U.S. population over 65 has received at least one dose of the vaccine, with nearly half now fully inoculated. On a percentage basis, the U.S. has immunized nearly 3 times the number of people that Germany, Italy, and France have, and in 2 months, the U.S. will almost certainly have a very large percentage of vaccinated adults.

3rd, the virus has had staggeringly unequal effects on the American population. For a person of a given age, the risk for certain racial and ethnic groups is several times that of a white person. Native American, Latino, Pacific Islander, and Black communities have suffered large and deadly outbreaks across the country. Our heterogeneous population and racialized economic hierarchy have exposed many people of color to higher levels of risk at home and at work. The same factors -- as well as, perhaps, distrust of the medical establishment -- are holding down vaccination rates in poorer places with less access to care, so some communities have both higher risk and fewer fully protected people.

This all makes for an extremely messy and volatile near-term situation. The 1st 2 factors mean that some places will see the pandemic's worst pressures fade. The timing is great for those places, such as California, because they will have a chance to get more and more people vaccinated. But where the virus is already spreading quickly, the danger is still high, and the days are running out to slow transmission via vaccination.

In these places, it's still unclear whether previous disease or new vaccination will shift the pandemic's darkest pattern. In every previous surge, a rise in deaths has lagged behind a rise in cases by a few weeks. Perhaps this time, deaths will not rise to the level that they did in the past. Or low vaccination rates combined with possibly more deadly variants could mean that in some communities, the toll of this surge will match that of the winter's [2020-2021].

In Michigan, both hospital admissions and cases are moving swiftly toward the height of the winter peak. So far, the fatality numbers have not turned upward. Now we can only wait to see whether deaths will follow hospitalizations at the pace of past surges or whether something has changed.

[This new phase of COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths sadly will reflect the inequities in healthcare and vaccination. More must be done to eliminate these inequities, caused in large part by discrimination, differences in healthcare access and utilization, educational, income and wealth gaps, occupation, and housing (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/race-ethnicity.html). - Mod.LK]

[2] Variants
Date: Thu 1 Apr 2021
Source: U Texas [abridged, edited]
https://news.utexas.edu/2021/04/01/undetected-coronavirus-variant-was-in-at-least-15-countries-before-its-discovery/


The B117 variant of the virus responsible for COVID-19 has been spreading for longer than previously known, researchers have found.

A highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant was unknowingly spreading for months in the United States by October 2020, according to a new study from researchers with The University of Texas at Austin COVID-19 Modeling Consortium [an interdisciplinary network of researchers and health professionals building models to detect, project, and combat COVID-19].

Scientists 1st discovered it in early December 2020 in the United Kingdom, where the highly contagious and more lethal variant is thought to have originated. The journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, which has published an early-release version of the study [see below] provides evidence that the coronavirus variant B117 (501Y) had spread across the globe undetected for months when scientists discovered it.

"By the time we learned about the U.K. variant in December 2020, it was already silently spreading across the globe," said Lauren Ancel Meyers, the director of the COVID-19 Modeling Consortium at The University of Texas at Austin and a professor of integrative biology. "We estimate that the B117 variant probably arrived in the U.S. by October of 2020, 2 months before we knew it existed."

Analyzing data from 15 countries, researchers estimated the chance that travelers from the U.K. introduced the variant into 15 countries between 22 Sep and 7 Dec 2020. They found that the virus variant had almost certainly arrived in all 15 countries by mid-November 2020. In the U.S., the variant probably had arrived by mid-October 2020.

"This study highlights the importance of laboratory surveillance," Meyers said. "Rapid and extensive sequencing of virus samples are critical for early detection and tracking of new variants of concern."

In conjunction with the paper's publication, consortium members developed a new tool that decision-makers anywhere in the United States can use in planning for genetic sequencing that helps to detect the presence of variants. To help the U.S. expand national surveillance of variants, the new online calculator [https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/dashboards/variants/] indicates the number of virus samples that must be sequenced in order to detect new variants when they 1st emerge. For example, if the goal is to detect an emerging variant by the time it is causing one out of every 1000 new COVID-19 infections, approximately 3000 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens per week need to be sequenced.

"Health officials are looking for better ways to manage the unpredictability of this virus and future variants," said Spencer Woody, a postdoctoral fellow at the UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. "Our new calculator determines how many positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens must be sequenced to ensure that new threats are identified as soon as they start spreading."

He explained that the calculator has a 2nd feature. "It also helps labs figure out how quickly they will detect new variants, given their current sequencing capacity."

"We created this tool to support federal, state, and local health officials in building credible early warning systems for this and future pandemic threats," Meyers said.

Abstract
"A fast-spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant identified in the United Kingdom in December 2020 has raised international alarm. We analyzed data from 15 countries and estimated that the chance that this variant was imported into these countries by travelers from the United Kingdom by 7 Dec 2020 is over 50%.

The United Kingdom has detected a variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent coronavirus disease (COVID-19), from samples initially collected in Kent on 20 Sep 2020 and London on 21 Sep 2020 (1). The variant was associated with increased transmissibility and includes deletions at amino acid sites 69 and 70 of the spike protein (2). In mid-December 2020, the UK government tightened measures in London and southeastern England to mitigate transmission of the fast-spreading virus variant (3). On 5 Jan 2021, England initiated a national lockdown that included closing all schools and nonessential businesses until mid-February 2021 (4). By 20 Dec 2020, restrictions for travelers from the United Kingdom had been implemented by around 40 countries (5). The new variant (501Y) has subsequently been reported worldwide, including in the United States (6), Spain, Sweden, and France, and might be spreading without detection in countries with limited virus sequencing capacity (5).

Using data from 15 countries, we estimated the probability that travelers from the United Kingdom introduced this 501Y variant into each of the countries and estimated the extent of local transmission. Our estimations were based on the changing proportion of infections caused by the 501Y variant identified in the United Kingdom (2) and population mobility from the United Kingdom to each country, determined from Facebook Data for Good (https://dataforgood.fb.comExternal Link). The highest risk for importation from 22 Sep through 7 Dec 2020 was in Ireland. By 22 Oct 2020 (a month after the variant was 1st detected in the United Kingdom), the chance that 10 of the 15 countries would receive one imported case from the United Kingdom was at least 50% (Figure), except for Romania, Portugal, Cyprus, India, and the United States, although by 1 Nov 2020, this risk threshold was exceeded for all of these countries.

Using COVID-19 hospital admission data, we further estimated the local prevalence of the 501Y variant in 11 of the 15 countries, assuming that the 501Y variant is 50% more transmissible than the circulating 501N strain (see Figure at URL). The variant seems to have ascended fastest in Ireland before slowing in mid-November 2020 and is expected to be spreading rapidly in many of the other countries. As of 7 Dec 2020, the expected prevalence of the variant and the expected proportion of coronavirus disease cases were highest in Cyprus (prevalence 13 cases, 95% CI 0-79 cases/100 000 population; proportion 6% of cases, 95% CI 0-38% of cases) (see Figure at URL; Appendix Figures 1, 2).

These projections suggest that countries with substantial population movement from the United Kingdom were likely to harbor cases of the 501Y variant by late October 2020. Our conclusions were based on several key assumptions. The mobility data, which include around 3 million trips from the United Kingdom to the 15 countries we analyzed, might be demographically biased by the user profile of Facebook, a major social media company with about 2.8 billion monthly active users in the 4th quarter of 2020 (7). We assume that all introductions during this early period occurred via asymptomatic travelers from the United Kingdom and ignore possible importations from other countries or by symptomatic case-patients traveling to seek healthcare. A sensitivity analysis suggests that these assumptions may cause a downward bias in the estimated rates of global expansion (Appendix Figure 3). Furthermore, we assume a 10-day lag between infection and hospitalization on the basis of estimates from the United States (8) and Europe (9) and estimate the daily prevalence of the 501Y variant by using the method introduced in (2), under the assumptions that the 2 variants (501Y and 501N) share the same natural history (2) and symptomatic proportion (10,11). Should future studies reveal substantial epidemiologic differences between the variant and wildtype, then these estimates can be readily updated by using the full equations provided in (2)."

The importance of sequencing to public health is becoming increasingly evident. COVID-19 is only the most recent example of this. What is new are the new tools developed to rapidly analyse this information to elucidate the epidemiology of the virus, allowing decision makers to more effectively address virus spread. - Mod.LK]

Open Forum Infectious Diseases, Volume 8, Issue 3, March 2021, ofab065, https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab065.


Abstract
"Background
Limited clinical data suggest around 16% prevalence of bacterial superinfections among critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods
We reviewed postmortem studies of patients with COVID-19 published in English through 26 Sep 2020 for histopathologic findings consistent with bacterial lung infections.

Results
Worldwide, 621 patients from 75 studies were included. The quality of data was uneven, likely because identifying superinfections was not a major objective in 96% (72/75) of studies. Histopathology consistent with a potential lung superinfection was reported in 32% (200/621) of patients (22-96 years old; 66% men). Types of infections were pneumonia (95%), abscesses or empyema (3.5%), and septic emboli (1.5%). 73 percent of pneumonias were focal rather than diffuse. The predominant histopathologic findings were intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltrations that were distinct from those typical of COVID-19-associated diffuse alveolar damage. In studies with available data, 79% of patients received antimicrobial treatment; the most common agents were beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors (48%), macrolides (16%), cephalosoprins (12%), and carbapenems (6%). Superinfections were proven by direct visualization or recovery of bacteria in 25.5% (51/200) of potential cases and 8% of all patients in postmortem studies. In rank order, pathogens included _Acinetobacter baumannii_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_. Lung superinfections were the cause of death in 16% of potential cases and 3% of all patients with COVID-19.

Conclusions
Potential bacterial lung superinfections were evident at postmortem examination in 32% of persons who died with COVID-19 (proven, 8%; possible, 24%), but they were uncommonly the cause of death."

[The role of bacterial superinfection in the morbidity and mortality of viral pneumonia is often debated. It is difficult to distinguish colonization from infection and to separate the pathologic consequences from those of the underlying viral pneumonitis and noninfectious complications such as ARDS or pulmonary vascular congestion. The tongue-in-cheek adage that "pathologists know everything but too late" is not true if their findings can inform subsequent clinical cases. In this postmortem study, there was evidence of superinfection in nearly 1/3rd of cases and was thought to be the cause of death in 16%. _Acinetobacter baumannii_, which is frequently highly resistant to antimicrobials, played a surprisingly large role, though the distribution of pathogens is likely to reflect local flora. The role of fungal superinfection was described in a recent post. - Mod.LM]
