Ongoing outbreak of _Shigella flexneri_ serotype 3a in men who have sex with men in England and Wales, data from 2009-2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Bong ML, Modi A, Tostmann A, et al]

Cases of _Shigella flexneri_ infection in the UK usually originate from travel or contact with travellers from higher incidence regions such as Indian subcontinent, North and East Africa, and South America (1). Following analyses of laboratory data, an increase in UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ cases was detected in London in November 2010. A subsequent rise in UK-acquired cases was also noted in Manchester in May 2011. The initial cases reported were predominantly of serotype 3a and mostly among men who have sex with men (MSM) aged between 30 and 50 years, some of whom were HIV positive. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PGFE) performed on initial stool specimen showed that some of the isolates were indistinguishable, however preliminary investigation failed to identify a common venue or point source (2,3).

In response, a national outbreak control team was formally established in September 2011 to investigate and manage the outbreak of _S. flexneri_. Enhanced surveillance was initiated in order to:
- describe the epidemiology of _S. flexneri_ infection in individuals who had no travel history or who had travelled to countries with low risk for infection;
- estimate the proportion of UK-acquired cases or cases associated with travel in low-risk countries that are explained by transmission in MSM;
- identify risk factors for transmission of _S. flexneri_ between MSM.

Sexual transmission of shigellosis was first described in the USA during the 1970s (4). Since then, several outbreaks of sexually transmitted shigellosis, predominantly in MSM, have been reported (5-8). In 2006, an outbreak among MSM in London coincided with a similar outbreak in Berlin suggesting that travel plays a role in introducing _Shigella_ species to populations at risk (9,10).

Outbreak investigation
----------------------
National enhanced surveillance of _S. flexneri_ was conducted from September to December 2011 inclusive, in order to describe and monitor the epidemiology of the outbreak. The population under surveillance consisted of UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ infection cases and reported cases associated with travel in low-risk countries.

Low-risk travel-associated individuals were defined as individuals who returned to the UK in the 4 days before onset of illness after travel to countries with low risk for shigellosis (Europe, North America, and Australia). High-risk travel-associated diagnoses were defined as individuals who returned to the UK in the 4 days before onset of illness after travel to countries with high risk for shigellosis (South America, Asia, and Africa) (1). A confirmed case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed case of _S. flexneri_ with a specimen date between 1 Sep and 31 Dec 2011 with no recent travel or who reported recent travel to low-risk countries. A probable case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed case of _S. flexneri_ with an unknown travel history.

Cases among people who had traveled to high-risk countries or secondary cases of _S. flexneri_ who were contacts of high risk travel-associated cases were excluded.

All laboratories were asked to notify _Shigella_ isolations and to send stool specimens to the national reference laboratory (Gastrointestinal Infections Reference Unit, Health Protection Agency - Colindale, London) for serotyping, PFGE analysis and sensitivity testing. Weekly updates on laboratory-confirmed _S. flexneri_ diagnoses were forwarded to the respective regions for further follow-up. Increased awareness and guidance for health professionals and people at risk of infection was issued through HPA [Health Protection Agency] briefings, information leaflets and press releases (11).

_S. flexneri_ diagnoses reported by the national laboratories between 2001 and 2011 were also analyzed to provide context to the current outbreak and to produce historical time trends.

Results
-------
During the enhanced surveillance period between September and December 2011, 145 _S. flexneri_ diagnoses were reported of which 37 (25.5 percent) were non-travel related. 31 cases were confirmed as being UK-acquired whereas 6 reported diagnoses were likely to be secondary cases linked to a symptomatic contact with recent travel to a high-risk country. 86 cases (59.3 percent) were associated with travel to high-risk countries and the travel history was unknown for 22 individuals (15.2 percent). No low-risk travel-associated cases of _S. flexneri_ were reported during the enhanced surveillance period.

The UK-acquired cases were predominantly male (n=26) whereas travel-associated _S. flexneri_ diagnoses were equally distributed between both sexes: 11 male cases with UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ reported MSM activity in the week before developing gastroenteritis. 3 individuals refused to disclose their sexual orientation. 10 of the 31 reported UK-acquired cases were serotype 3a, 7 were serotype 1b, 5 were serotype 2a, 3 were serotype 6, and 1 case was reported for serotypes 1a, 1c, 2b, and 3b. The serotype was unknown for 2 reported cases. More than half (n=5) of the infections in MSM were caused by serotype 3a, 4 by serotype 1b, 1 by serotype 2a, and 1 by serotype 6.

In depth interviews with 7 MSM cases showed that they all had one long term partner and attended regular medical examinations. However, all cases reported having a casual sexual partner in the week preceding illness. These interviews revealed lack of awareness about shigellosis and of the risks associated with unprotected oral and oral-anal sex.

Trends in _S. flexneri_ diagnoses reported between 2001 and 2011 (n=3352) showed a gradual increase in the number of cases with no or unknown history of travel since 2001, with a similar trend in both sexes until 2008 (Figure 2 - [for figures see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). However, from 2009 onwards, numbers of diagnoses rose far more rapidly in men. Data analysis revealed similar trends in cases between sexes and within the same age group, however, since 2009 the increase in the number of _S. flexneri_ cases reported was attributable to an overrepresentation of men aged between 31 and 50 years (Figure 3).

Figure 4 shows the number of _S. flexneri_ diagnoses by serotype from 2004 to 2011. The number of cases infected with serotype 3a has increased considerably and as from 2009 it has become as predominant as the 2a serotype and accounted for the increase in _S. flexneri_ cases between 2009 and 2011.

The increase in serotype 3a since 2009 was mostly attributable to diagnoses among men aged 30-50 years which constituted 65 percent (211/324) of all _S. flexneri_ 3a reports with no or unknown travel history between 2009 and 2011. When focusing on the male adult cases with serotype 3a, the number of monthly _S. flexneri_ diagnoses in 2007/2008 fluctuates between 1 and 7 cases. The number of monthly reports increases to between 5 and 15 from 2009 onwards. The following graph shows the number of monthly diagnoses from 2007-2012 and a 3-month moving average (Figure 5).

Control measures
----------------
The outbreak control team introduced control measures which focused on actions aimed at prompt and effective management of cases to prevent onward transmission. They included increasing awareness among clinicians and MSM and prompt diagnosis and treatment, increased testing of MSM with diarrhea and treatment of laboratory-confirmed cases with ciprofloxacin (12) subject to antimicrobial sensitivity.

These actions also included recommendations regarding behaviours that may contribute to prevent further transmission:
- wash hands after using toilet, before preparing or eating food, and after sexual activity;
- avoid anal sex, oral-anal sex, scat, and rimming while symptomatic and until test for infection shows clearance;
- use of condoms, gloves, dental dams during sex;
- avoid sharing douching materials and sex toys;
- avoid swimming pools and spa centres whilst ill and for 2 weeks after recovery.

Work is ongoing to identify risk factors for infection and evaluate other possible control measures such as screening of asymptomatic contacts.

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
As the outbreak is still ongoing and no similar _S. flexneri_ outbreaks have recently been reported by other countries, increased vigilance, and monitoring by other European countries is recommended in order to promptly and effectively detect any change in the reported trends of _S. flexneri_.

Although some people may have been reluctant to disclose details about their sexual orientation, the enhanced surveillance revealed a strong association between UK-acquired _S. flexneri_ and transmission in MSM. The outbreak will continue to be monitored through routine arrangements and information on cases occurring in MSM will continue to be collected in order to effectively describe the epidemiology of the disease in MSM and identify any potential risk factors to inform public health action.

Although the outbreak 1st emerged in 2009 and has been sustained since then, it has only been detected relatively recently. An evaluation of shigellosis surveillance will therefore be carried out in order to identify factors leading to the delay in outbreak identification and to explore new approaches to routine surveillance of sexually-transmitted shigellosis.

[_Shigella_ were discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
