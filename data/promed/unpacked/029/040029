Birds Died of Starvation
-------------------------------------------
Testing has confirmed that the dead murres that washed up on the
beaches from Eastport to St. Shott's over the Easter weekend [6 to 8
Apr 2007] died of starvation. The Animal Health Division of the
Department of Natural Resources and the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife
Health Centre (Atlantic Region) today [13 Apr 2007] confirmed that
the marine birds did not die from Avian Cholera or Avian Influenza
and there is no sign of a toxic event. Staff with Environment
Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service have collected approximately 200
dead birds since [6 Apr 2007] and will continue to monitor the
situation, removing further carcasses as necessary.
In the case of starvation, which is a naturally occurring event, it
is often difficult to determine a specific cause. For marine birds,
especially fish-eating birds, die-offs due to starvation often occur
when birds cannot access their prey. This can happen when fish are
low in numbers, when fish move out of an area and the birds do not
move with them, or if the fish move too low in the water and out of
reach of the birds.
People are asked not to touch the birds and to keep pets from coming
into contact with them. Contact with a sick or dead bird may cause a
skin infection.
