Listeria cases put pregnant women, others on alert
-----------------------------------------------
The Houston Department of Health and Human Services has detected a rise in
August 2005 in the number of cases of listeriosis, a serious illness that
can result in miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery and babies born
with the life-threatening infection.
Health officials have identified 6 cases of listeriosis so far in August
2005, all among Hispanic people. They include 3 pregnant women, 2 newborns
and an elderly woman. On average, Houston only has about 8 cases in a year,
so 6 in a month is especially troubling to health officials.
The victims are not all from one area of Houston, so epidemiologists are
trying to figure out the source and whether there is a connection.
"We do know in the past there had been some cases here in Houston and also
in South Texas where people ate imported Mexican cheese that did not have
labels. It was not pasteurized, so there is a danger there," said Porfirio
Villarreal, HDHHS. "We want to make sure that that is not happening.
Because we do know of certain flea markets that do sell, illegally, those
foods."
Eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_, found
in soil and water, causes the illness. Bacteria can contaminate foods of
animal origin, such as meats and dairy products. Those at high risk of
becoming infected are pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened
immune systems because of AIDS, cancer, diabetes and kidney disease.
HDHHS warns against eating un-pasteurized or raw dairy products, such as
soft cheeses, and recommends people cook left over foods or
ready-to-eat-foods, such as hot dogs, until steaming hot.
Other recommendations include:
- Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources, such as beef, pork or poultry.
- Wash raw vegetables thoroughly before eating.
- Keep uncooked meats separate from vegetables and from cooked foods and
ready-to-eat-foods.
- Wash hands, knives and cutting boards after handling uncooked foods.
In 2004, the CDC reported 2500 cases across the country and 500 deaths.
