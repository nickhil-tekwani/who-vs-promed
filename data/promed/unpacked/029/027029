Bovine tuberculosis has been found in a small herd of beef cattle in Michigan's northeastern Lower Peninsula.

The state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development says [Tue 18 Apr 2017] that the Alcona County herd was identified through routine surveillance testing.

An informational meeting with cattle producers in Alpena and Alcona counties will be held 25 Apr 2017 at the Hubbard Lake Community Center in Hubbard Lake.

State officials say the bacterial disease primarily affects cattle, but it can be spread between wildlife populations and other mammals, including humans.

The Alcona County herd is in an area where bovine tuberculosis is pervasive in the free-ranging white-tail deer population.

Earlier this month [April 2017], parts of 5 Michigan counties were designated as potential high risk areas after several deer tested positive for the disease.

State and federal animal health officials have identified 2 additional cases of bovine tuberculosis (TB) during follow-up investigation after the disease was initially found in a Harding County beef herd in late February [2017]. Single infected animals were found in 2 herds, located in Harding and Butte Counties. Both herds had received the infected cows from the index herd within the past 2 years.

The affected herds remain under quarantine while state and federal animal health officials continue to investigate adjacent and contact herds that may have had contact with or purchased animals from the affected herds. Bovine TB is a respiratory disease of cattle. It is a chronic, slowly progressive disease that does not spread easily. Infected animals may be capable of transmitting an infection to other animals even if they appear healthy. The US has nearly eliminated bovine TB due to a cooperative eradication campaign. Bovine TB is not a food safety threat, thanks to milk pasteurization and meat inspection programs. South Dakota has officially been recognized as free of the disease since 1982.

It might be interesting to recall that Michigan said they would test 5000 cattle for bovine TB in Newaygo County. Nevertheless, it appears they are proving true the adage of 'seek and you will find" (see archive no 20170330.4935481).

Likewise, it is important to recall that South Dakota has the new strain, apparently from Mexico (see archive no 20170402.4942680).

Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds. - Mod.TG]
