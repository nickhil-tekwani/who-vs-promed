Mass emergency vaccination campaigns are now underway in Guinea to control a spreading outbreak of measles. The World Health Organization warns that measles is one of the most highly contagious diseases, and is a leading cause of death among children.

Doctors Without Borders and UNICEF said they were working with Guinea's Ministry of Health to vaccinate more than 2 million children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years against measles.

Guinea's measles outbreak began in December 2013, and the government declared it had reached epidemic proportions.

The head of UNICEF's health program in Guinea, Dr. Salvator Nibitanga, spoke to VOA from the capital, Conakry.

"In the whole country, up to now, we have 1590 cases. This is suspected cases. And among them, unfortunately, 6 deaths have been recorded. And this has covered around 23 districts out of 38. You can imagine that the situation is [quite bad] at the moment. And we also know that other districts will be affected in the coming days," he said.

The last outbreak of measles in Guinea, in 2009, affected more than 4000 children and caused 10 deaths.

Most cases of measles are curable, but health experts say immunization is the best way to keep the death toll down.

WHO reported that vaccinations reduced the number of measles deaths globally by nearly 80 percent between 2000 and 2012.

But in Guinea, Doctors Without Borders said that less than 80 percent of children living in Conakry have received routine vaccinations that include protection against measles, and nationwide, only 37 percent of children have been received the specific anti-measles vaccine.

Dr. Renaldo Ortunio, a medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, said even one case of measles was too much.

"Measles is a preventable disease by vaccine, so you shouldn't have an epidemic, an outbreak in this country. But unfortunately, there are some weaknesses in the Ministry of Health in the regular vaccinations. And with this lack of vaccination among children, we see an outbreak every 3 to 4 years, which is currently the case in Conakry," he said.

Ortunio said large scale immunization programs targeting measles were difficult because the vaccine must be kept well-refrigerated, and much of Guinea still did not have access to electricity.

To help children who already have contracted the measles virus, UNICEF is supplying the Ministry of Health with antibiotics and vitamin A.

Doctors Without Borders is offering free measles diagnoses and follow-up medical care for cases in which there are complications. Teams of doctors are also training local health center staff to deal with measles cases.

Health officials in Guinea are now urging parents to seek medical care for their children at the 1st sign of measles. Symptoms include a high fever, bloodshot eyes, white spots on the mouth, and a rash on the face and neck.

The vaccination campaigns will continue free of charge for at least 2 weeks.

Health officials are reminding people to get vaccinated after 2 cases of measles were spotted in Wisconsin. The 2 people apparently contracted the highly contagious disease while travelling overseas.

Marathon County public health nurse Becky Mroczenski says that's the most common way people catch the measles these days. "Because of so much travel now, a person can come into the state with measles and spread it to people who are susceptible."

The 2 cases are in southern Wisconsin and were apparently unrelated. Mroczenski says vaccinations among the population kept it from being worse than it could have been. "This time it's not an outbreak, but certainly it can become one very quickly, because measles will spread quite easily and rapidly."

She says that's why it's so important to be vaccinated. "When what we call herd immunity levels aren't high enough, we can have breakthrough cases which can worsen the spread or cause an outbreak."

Measles is spread through the air and is highly contagious. A person with measles can spread the disease even before they know they have it because the symptoms are like the cold or the flu. "Because we don't see much of it, it's typically misdiagnosed at first. Practitioners aren't used to seeing it, because the vaccine has done such a wonderful job of keeping it at bay."

If you don't have the vaccine or don't know if you have it, contact your local health department or your health practitioner for more information.

Health officials in San Francisco have warned Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) users of a possible measles outbreak facing this very populated California city. The warning came out after an infected individual was identified on Thursday [13 Feb 2014].

Though the name of the individual is unknown at this time, sources have confirmed that the person is a student at the University of California Berkley. The student had recently spent time studying abroad in Asia, where it is suspected he acquired the virus. Since the individual had not been inoculated for measles, he was able to carry and later transmit it.

Health officials are warning that any passenger of the BART between 4-7 Feb 2014 may have been exposed. The student rode the trains in the early and late parts of the day, commuting to school from his home in Contra Costa County.

The measles virus is almost extinct in the United States. Most people are inoculated for the disease as children, helping them to build immunity. However, young children who have yet to complete the process of immunization are at a high risk to acquire the disease. Adults who have not been immunized also carry a high risk factor.

One of the highest concentrations of children who are not immune exists in the San Francisco area. California is facing this measles outbreak because the virus itself is very contagious. An individual who has been infected with the virus is contagious from 4 days before the symptoms appear to 4 days after they have gone. Unfortunately for Bart riders, direct contact with the sick individual is not needed to contract the virus. It is spread through coughing and sneezing. If an infected person coughs onto a surface or into the air, the virus remains alive for up to 2 hours on its own. All it takes is for someone to touch a surface that has been coughed on or breath infected air for them to acquire the virus. 90 percent of individuals who are not immune will contract the virus if exposed to it.

If a person is infected by the measles virus, it usually will take one to 2 weeks for the symptoms to manifest. The common symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and red watering eyes. In addition, the infected will also suffer a blotchy rash that covers their body, as well as a feeling of tiredness and ache within their bodies. Symptoms usually begin like those of a common cold, with the fever, sore throat, and runny nose. Within a week, the rash will break out, usually from the top down. Patients may also suffer from tiny, painful, white spots in their mouth, called Koplik spots. After several days of this painful and irritating rash, it will slowly fade, as will the rest of the symptoms.

Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. Luckily, most are immune. For those that aren't, they face a series of bad, irritating days. Many who are infected will also suffer from ear infections and possibly pneumonia. Most patients will recover from any and all of these symptoms within a few weeks. Only one out of every 500 patients will die from the measles.

If you rode the BART during the early part of Feb 2014, be aware of the symptoms and stay away from children. However, know that even if you fall victim to the measles, in 3 weeks you'll leave them behind forever. Once you have had them, you can never get them again.

A 4th Orange County resident has been diagnosed with measles since late last year [2013], the Health Care Agency said Tuesday [18 Feb 2014].

The circumstances are still under investigation, but the latest patient, an adult who had been previously vaccinated, had contact with one of the earlier cases, said spokeswoman Nicole Stanfield. Among the earlier cases of 2 adults and one child, one had also been vaccinated.

The Honolulu Quarantine Station in Hawaii notified the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) of a confirmed case of measles in an Oahu infant who traveled from the Philippines through Guam on 2 Feb 2014 during the infectious stage of the disease. The child has been hospitalized and is improving.

The Honolulu Quarantine Station in collaboration with Guam Customs and Quarantine is reviewing the passenger manifest to identify passengers who were seated in close proximity to the measles case during the flight from Manila to Guam. To date, no Guam resident has been identified as a close contact.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It is primarily spread by person to person contact via large respiratory droplets. Symptoms are characterized by a generalized rash lasting 3 days or longer with fever (101 F or higher) and cough, or coryza (runny nose), or conjunctivitis (red eyes).

It would be advisable for persons traveling to the Philippines to make sure they have been vaccinated for measles (given in combination with the measles and mumps vaccines) 2 weeks before departing. With the recent holidays and due to frequent travel of residents between Guam and the Philippines, it is possible that the disease may be brought here.

The DPHSS is encouraging parents to check their children's shot record to be sure they have received their MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The current recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are:

- Children should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine, with the 1st dose given at one year of age or older and the 2nd dose given between 4-6 years of age.

- All persons born during or after 1957 should have documentation of at least one dose of MMR vaccine given on or after the 1st birthday.

All health care providers on Guam are urged to be on alert for possible cases of measles and to promptly report suspected cases to the Immunization Program, Bureau of Communicable Disease Control, at 735-7143/7148 or 735-7135. Furthermore, all health care providers are urged to review and update the immunization status of all patients they see. If vaccination is contraindicated because of illness, a follow-up appointment should be scheduled to update vaccination as soon as the illness is over.

For more information, please call the DPHSS Immunization Program at 735-7143.

A case of measles has been confirmed in central Alberta in addition to 2 probable cases, Alberta Health Services says.

AHS is advising Red Deer area residents to take precautions to protect themselves against the highly infectious disease. "There's a possibility of it spreading further, said AHS Central Zone medical officer Dr. Ifeoma Achebe. "Chances are that people might catch it, and measles is an extremely contagious disease," Achebe said.

Achebe said they are hoping to keep possible infection numbers low by raising awareness about what the public should do if symptoms of measles present themselves. "They should not go to the hospital or the clinic. They stand the risk of putting other people at the risk of catching the disease, so we recommend that they call Health Link," she said.

There is no treatment for measles, which is why Achebe stressed the importance of immunization. "Immunization remains the one way that we can prevent the spread of measles," she said. The measles vaccine is typically given to children when they are a year old. The booster shot is then given between ages 4 and 6. The measles vaccine is free of charge in Alberta.

The outbreak in central Alberta is not linked to the Nov 2013 outbreak in the Lethbridge region, Achebe said. That outbreak was officially declared over by the AHS in early January 2014. There were 42 confirmed cases.

Measles symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a blotchy rash that starts on the head and face and spreads down the body.

Residents of Bangesh, Madyan fear that an outbreak of measles in the area is causing children to fall ill. Several minors have been found infected with a mysterious illness in the area for the past one week.

Residents complained of no action on the part of the authorities to control the outbreak of said illness. The father of an infected child revealed locals had informed the government of the outbreak and urged them to arrange a medical camp for the treatment of their children. Meanwhile, he said, they had been taking their children to local medics. Residents claimed dozens of children are infected with measles.

Bahrain Assistant Commissioner Mohammad Arif said they have enough medicines, vaccines and staff in hospitals, and soon the epidemic will be controlled. "I have already directed the hospital administration to send an EPI team to the area," he said.

I'm a 3rd year medicine resident at UMass in Worcester [MA, USA]. I am currently on an away rotation at Jan Swasthya Sahyog, a non-profit hospital working out of Ganiyari village in Bilaspur district, Chhatisgarh state in India [http://jssbilaspur.org].

We saw a 4-year-old child yesterday [19 Feb 2014] with measles in the outpatient clinic. The diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical features of fever, cough and rash. Unfortunately, the child left to go back to the village before I could get pictures. A team from JSS went to the village today [20 Feb 2014], but the photos are not great. The child is from the village Naktabandha, Karkha panchayat, Kota tehsil and Bilaspur district. The child belongs to the Baiga tribe. Panchayat and Tehsil are administrative units of the government.

We heard of 2 other cases of measles in the district, one in Dari village, Masturi tehsil and mini-basti slum in Bilaspur (where an 11-month-old child is confirmed to have died).

There is also a large outbreak of pertussis in the district that private practitioners have been seeing. I will let you know if we see any here.

Increase in imported measles cases, epidemiologic week 48, 2013 - Epidemiologic week 4, 2014
-----------------------------------------------
During epidemiologic weeks 1-4, 2014 (30 Dec 2013 - 26 Jan 2014), 46 cases of measles were diagnosed (see latest epidemiologic curve of measles: http://www0.nih.go.jp/niid/idsc/idwr/diseases/measles/measles2014/meas14-04.pdf), indicating a considerable increase relative to the same period in the previous year. As of 3 Feb 2014, 16 cases have been genotyped for measles virus (for more information, see isolation/detection of measles virus in Japan http://www.nih.go.jp/niid/ja/iasr-measles.html).

During epidemiologic week 48, 2013 to week 4, 2014 (25 Nov 2013 - 26 Jan 2014), as of 3 Feb 2014, 61 cases of measles were diagnosed, 26 cases more than the same period in the previous year. 32 of the 61 cases were male, with a mean age of 17.0 years (median 15 years, range 5 months to 60 years). Among the 24 cases that have been genotyped, 22 were B3 with one case each of D8 and D9 (Figure).

Figure. Measles cases by place of transmission, genotype, and date of onset (17 Nov 2013 - 26 Jan 2014) [Available at the above link].

The number of cases reported by prefecture during this period was as follows: Kyoto (n=21), Aichi (n=8), Kanagawa (n=7), Tokyo (n=5), Okayama (n=3); 2 cases were reported from each of the following: Chiba, Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Hyogo, Saitama; and one case was reported from each of the following: Mie, Miyazaki, Niigata, Osaka, Shiga, Shizuoka, and Yamaguchi. Transmission occurred domestically in 37 cases (61 percent), with the remaining 24 (39 percent) having report of transmission overseas, with the largest proportion from the Philippines (Philippines (n=17), Sri Lanka (n=2), Indonesia (n=2), and one each in Guam, India, and Australia). Among the 61 cases, 52 (85 percent) had either no or unknown history of measles vaccination.

Importantly, from late 2013 to early 2014, the number of imported cases has been increasing. Among those believed to have been infected overseas, there was an average notification rate of 0.32 cases per week during epidemiologic weeks 1 to 47, 2013, relative to 2.7 cases per week during epidemiologic week 48, 2013 to epidemiologic week 4, 2014.

Regardless of age, measles is a potentially fatal disease and warrants vigilant attention. In addition, while there is no specific treatment, prevention is possible through immunization. Japan has achieved substantial progress toward measles elimination. Working toward elimination by 2012, there has been an estimated 97 percent decline in incidence since 2007-2008 when measles predominated among adolescents; the next target is achieving certification of measles elimination in 2015. It is imperative that imported cases continue to be monitored, and at the same time, to be alert against secondary transmission from imported cases. Thus, there is a need to respond to each case rapidly with epidemiologic investigation; additionally, measles vaccination (ideally MR vaccine) should be systematically implemented among those susceptible, particularly those who are targeted for routine immunization (age one year, one year period prior to elementary school attendance).

Furthermore, there has been an increase in the reports of measles cases among overseas travellers (or those linked to overseas travellers), with numerous cases believed to have been on board an airplane when they were infectious. Healthcare workers should carefully investigate symptomatic persons regarding their travel, contact and immunization histories.

Travellers overseas should confirm their vaccination status and ensure that they are up to date with the necessary vaccines, preventing importation. Additionally, if measles is suspected, notification should be made prior to visiting a health facility to prevent secondary transmission.

The Department of Preventive Health under the Ministry of Health on [15 Feb 2014] launched preventive measures against measles, which took the lives of 3 children in the country so far this year [2014].

At an online meeting of the Pasteur Institute in central Nha Trang city and the Central Highlands Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Deputy Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long confirmed that if preventive measures are fully applied, the measles outbreak will be contained in 2 months.

He asked local authorities nationwide to closely monitor the situation so as to deal promptly with people who contract the disease.

Provinces and cities where measles has been recorded were requested to organise vaccinations for all children under 2 years old who have not been fully vaccinated against the disease.

The National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology was asked to ensure that stocks of the vaccine were sufficient.

According to the department, 993 cases have been recorded in 24 provinces and cities so far this year [2014], with one death in Hanoi and 2 in the northern province, Yen Bai.

Largely, the outbreak is isolated to northern mountainous provinces, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Children not fully vaccinated are currently the most vulnerable group. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children. The disease, which is caused by a virus of the paramyxovirus family, causes about 330 deaths every day and 14 deaths every hour. Thanks to vaccination, a 78 percent drop has been seen in deaths between 2000 and 2012 worldwide, the organisation pointed out. Since 2000, more than one billion children in high risk countries were immunised against the disease through mass vaccination programmes.

Queensland Health is warning of a possible measles outbreak after a man with the virus travelled from North Stradbroke Island to Cleveland on 12 Feb 2014.

Metro South Health's public health unit issued the notification on Tuesday [18 Feb 2014] of the 2nd measles case from the island in a month. Queensland Health spokesman said a man, who did not know he had the virus, left North Stradbroke Island on the 7.30 am water taxi to the mainland on Wed 12 Feb 2014 and returned on the 10.55 am water taxi.

Public health physician Dr Kari Jarvinen said residents needed to be alert for symptoms, particularly those who could have had contact with the man. The island was put on alert on 24 Jan 2014 after a man with measles caught a 5 pm barge that day.

Auckland health officials are worried that a separate strain of measles not linked to cases from overseas may be starting to spread but stress those who have had 2 MMR vaccines are still protected. Auckland Regional Public Health Service says there were no measles cases in 2013 until just before the New Year, since when there have been 17 cases.

Auckland medical officer of health Dr Richard Hoskins says several cases have been traced back to the Philippines, where the infection is not uncommon. But he says that link has not been established in the 2 most recent cases, which is causing some concern. "We won't know whether it's a new strand of measles for some time or whether it's the one that's come mostly from the Philippines that we've been dealing with up to date. It is of concern in that what we don't want is a lot of measles spreading in the community."

Dr Hoskins says health officials are working hard to make sure there isn't another outbreak of measles as happened in 2011 and 2012, when more than 500 people were affected. He says measles is very infectious, and 80 percent of household members who are not immune will catch it from a family member who has it. But Dr Hoskins says while the public health service is unsure of the origin of measles in those particular cases, it's still the same disease, and those who have had 2 MMR vaccines are still protected.

[Among the most contagious vaccine preventable diseases, measles continues to be a serious problem globally, causing considerable morbidity, mortality, and consumption of public health and medical resources. The factors responsible for this include the inadequacy of immunization programs in low-resource areas, less than complete immunity in some individuals afforded even by 2 doses of measles-containing vaccines, high levels of global travel, and ironically, diminished acceptance of immunization in developed countries. - Mod.LM]
