The number of confirmed and suspected chikungunya cases in the Caribbean continues to increase; in fact, some new cities on the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe have reported cases for the 1st time, according to a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) update today [28 Mar 2014].

To date, there have been 3211 confirmed/probable chikungunya cases reported in the region, including 5 deaths and 15 282 suspected cases.

In addition, a suspected outbreak is being reported in the Dominican Republic according to a Spanish language news source. According to Health Minister Freddy Hidalgo, more than 1000 patients since February 2014 have come to the medical center with chikungunya-like symptoms. Samples have been sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation. The report does note that there are no confirmed cases of chikungunya to date.

[The presence of chikungunya virus transmission in these Caribbean islands is of economic significance because they are important tourist destinations, and loss of tourism could have serious adverse effects on the economy. If the Dominican Republic cases are confirmed as chikungunya virus infections, that could be especially adverse, because that country has the highest number of tourist stop-overs, with 3 840 761 in 2013. Cruise ship arrivals were highest in St. Maarten. Caribbean tourist stops can be seen at this same source (http://www.onecaribbean.org/wp-content/uploads/DEC12Lattab13.pdf).

[The number of cases continues to climb on most of the Latin Caribbean islands and in Dominica and St. Maarten, indicating that virus transmission continues in those localities. Apparently, the week indicated as 12 in the table should really be 13, since the table title is labeled as epidemiological week 13.

[3] ECDC report
Date: 23-29 Mar 2014

http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-29-mar-2014.pdf


As of 28 Mar 2014, there have been more than 18 000 probable and confirmed cases in the region. There have been 5 fatalities reported.

Update of the week
-------------
During the past week, the number of new cases reported increased in most of the affected areas but at a lower rate than in the previous weeks in the French Antilles.

In Martinique and Guadeloupe, new municipalities were affected. A media report in ProMED's Spanish page quoting the Minister of Health reports a large suspected outbreak of chikungunya in the Dominican Republic. Specimens have been sent to CDC Atlanta for confirmation.

The islands with confirmed cases are St. Martin/St. Maarten, Martinique, Saint Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, Virgin Islands (UK), Anguilla, Dominica, Aruba, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and French Guiana in mainland South America.

In most of the territories of the French Antilles, given the load of cases, the health authorities decided not to seek laboratory confirmation for all suspected cases.

[The spread of chikungunya virus in the Americas will depend on abundant populations of vectors that can transmit the virus efficiently. A recent report assessed the vector competence of 35 American _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ populations to 3 CHIKV genotypes. Primarily, viral dissemination rates were high for all mosquito populations irrespective of the tested isolate. In contrast, differences in transmission efficiency (TE) were underlined in populations of both species through the Americas, suggesting the role of salivary glands in CHIKV for highly efficient transmission. Nonetheless, both mosquito species were capable to transmit all 3 CHIKV genotypes, and TE reached alarming rates as high as 83.3 per cent and 96.7 per cent in _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ populations, respectively. Ae. albopictus_ better transmitted the epidemic mutant strain CHIKV_0621 of the East-Central-South African (ECSA) genotype than did _Ae. aegypti_, whereas this latter species was more capable of transmitting the original ECSA CHIKV_115 strain and also the Asian genotype CHIKV_NC. Therefore, a high risk of establishment and spread of CHIKV throughout the tropical, subtropical, and even temperate regions of the Americas is more real than ever.

Anubis Vega-Rua, Karima Zouache, Romain Girod, Anna-Bella Failloux, Ricardo Lourenco-de-Oliveira. High vector competence of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ from 10 American countries as a crucial factor of the spread of Chikungunya [virus; CHIKV]. 26 Mar 2014 J Virol (ahead of print).

These findings are not good news for the potential of the spread of chikungunya virus in the Americas in those locations where populations of these mosquito vectors are abundant and transmitting dengue viruses. - Mod.TY]

Health authorities in the Nigua and San Cristobal municipalities are worried because of the increase in patients in hospital centers who have various symptoms that are similar to those of chikungunya fever.

From February [2014] to date, more than 1000 patients have come to the Maria Paniagua Municipal Hospital in Nigua with symptoms similar to those of chikungunya [virus infections], explained the Center Director, Flor Paredes [who, in the accompanying video, stated that there were 1108 cases]. She stated that the patients who presented with fever and body pain have been tested for dengue [virus infection] and typhoid fever, with negative results.

Given this situation, fumigation operations have been carried out in the Galindo, Cambelen, los Kilometros, Boca De Nigua and San Antonio sectors, places where the greatest number of cases have been registered.

[In a 26 Mar 2014 report published in Diario Libre (in Spanish), the Minister of Health indicated that samples from these cases were sent to the USA CDC, and results were expected in 2 weeks (http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/2014/03/26/i543141_salud-pblica-confirma-casos-fiebre-chikungunya.html). ProMED awaits the results of the laboratory tests with considerable interest.

During the 3rd week of March [2014], the number of people [in French Antilles and Guiana] who have consulted a general medical practitioner is 1780. This is a slight increase from the previous week, when there were 1740.

Of the 35 cases reported to date, almost 2/3rds are in Kourou, the only city where one can talk about epidemic outbreaks. These are concentrated in a series of contiguous areas, city 205 or Gonfolo Balata in particular. On 17 Mar [2014], strong action has been taken by the mosquito control services of the General Council; nearly 2 dozen officers were on the ground for chemical treatment of [vector mosquito] breeding sites spotted in the sector.

As St. Maarten continues to take measures to combat the spread of the chikungunya virus, the number of cases continues to climb.

Health Minister Cornelius de Weever announced on Wednesday [26 Mar 2014], that the total number of confirmed chikungunya cases thus far stood at 224.

De Weever also announced that government will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with French St. Martin as a means of collectively responding to the mosquito threat that puts the population at risk. He said both sides have been working closely together to address the dengue and chikungunya threats.

The MOU will cover, amongst other things, a regular exchange of epidemiological information on vector-borne diseases and collectively publishing and representing data collected under the agreement.

The need for collective information campaigns and enhancement of the mosquito vector-control programme will also be included in the MOU. The MOU also describes the need for planning execution and evaluation of collective responses to the chikungunya threat.

[The increase in the number of chikungunya virus infections over the past week in St. Maarten is of concern, rising from 123 cases to 224 cases. This number is confirmed in another report that also indicates that there are an additional 325 suspected cases (http://www.rivm.nl/dsresource?type=pdf&disposition=inline&objectid=rivmp:239786). - Mod.TY
