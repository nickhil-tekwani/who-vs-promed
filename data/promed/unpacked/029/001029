As I knelt next to the cow elk, my thoughts went through the usual ritual following a successful hunt. After wrestling with the emotions over taking an animal's life and surveying the distance back to the truck, I remembered an extra task that demanded immediate attention.

I searched through my pack, found a small plastic tube and filled it with blood while field dressing the elk. I capped the container, placed it inside a protective bag and secured it back inside the pack.

The vial was one of about 1500 that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game provides to elk hunters each fall, according to Dr Mark Drew, the agency's state veterinarian. The blood samples are tested to gauge the prevalence of brucellosis, an infectious bacterial disease that causes pregnant elk to abort during their middle trimester. The particular strain that affects ruminants, _Brucella abortus_, likely arrived in North America via European cattle more than a century ago, then spilled over to elk and bison. According to a 2006 report from an Idaho wildlife brucellosis work group, the US Department of Agriculture implemented a national eradication effort in 1934.

Since then, federal, state, and private resources amounting to more than USD 3 billion were used to address and eventually eradicate brucellosis in livestock. One region of the United States known as the Greater Yellowstone Area, however, still harbors elk and bison infected by the disease.

Not only can brucellosis affect the health of Idaho's elk herds, but its continuing presence and potential for "spillover" back to cattle remains worrisome. Twice in the past decade the state lost its "Class Free" status when cattle in eastern Idaho likely became infected by elk.

Eliminating the infection in wildlife residing in the national park and the surrounding areas of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming appears unlikely.

"If it was easy, we would have done it decades ago," Drew said. "Coordinating between the states, 3 federal land-management agencies, several tribes and private landowners is a challenge." When that effort covers a large landscape for animals that roam freely and cross all those entities' boundaries, the task becomes even more difficult.

Drew believes that Idaho's management seems to be working, noting that, in contrast, Montana's and Wyoming's occurrence of brucellosis infections is increasing.

The main thrust behind Idaho's efforts focuses on keeping cattle and elk separate, especially during late winter. Deep snows can concentrate wildlife and livestock at a time when pregnant elk are in their 2nd trimester and most susceptible to abortions. If the 2 species mingle at that time, the likelihood for disease transmittal rises sharply.

The emphasis on separation is coordinated by state wildlife officials and the Idaho Department of Agriculture using several tactics. Idaho prohibits any private feeding of elk inside a specific region near Yellowstone known as the Designated Surveillance Area, Drew said. In addition, fences there are constructed not only to keep elk away from haystacks, but also to force cattle to remain inside their winter feeding areas.

In order to determine the prevalence and distribution of brucellosis in elk, Fish and Game established 2 means of monitoring. The Idaho Brucellosis Management Plan mandates that elk which the state feeds more than 3 consecutive winters are trapped, bled and tested on site. Seropositive elk -- or animals that carry brucellosis antibodies but not necessarily the disease -- are removed from the area.

In addition, Fish and Game supplies hunters with blood sampling kits like the one that I carried into the Pioneer Mountains last fall and mailed back to their laboratory in Boise. These kits are distributed on an annual rotation between 3 areas that include one west, one south and one inside Idaho's portion of the Greater Yellowstone Area.

Drew says 15 percent of the sampling kits are usually returned, and with about half being usable, the laboratory often yields about 200 good samples. This effort, along with the live testing of elk at feeding sites, indicates that eastern Idaho's critical area contains seropositive elk at a rate of 2 percent to 3 percent.

Of the samples returned last year [2013] from the entire area west of Interstate 15, no elk tested positive, Drew said.

[Bovine brucellosis (caused by _Brucella abortus_) has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century. Collaborative efforts by the US Department of Agriculture, the livestock industries, and state animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 states with no known infection since 2002.

The only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.
