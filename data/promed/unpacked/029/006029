[ProMED-mail does not usually post OIE Follow up reports but there
are, as with most things, exceptions, and we will provide a rare
update on a case by case basis. In this situation, this report is
important because it is, in fact, an H5N1 Avian Influenza and we have
not reported it since very early in the outbreak. Furthermore, this
current outbreak is the closest one yet to the North Korean border.

This outbreak should serve to remind us that although sometimes the
1st incursion of H5N1 into a particularly country will be resolved
quickly, other circumstances may end up dictating timelines of 6
months, a couple of years or even decades before the eradication of
H5N1 is realizable. Much depends on the particularly epidemiologic and
economic situation in the country.

The outbreak location can be seen on the map appended to the OIE
WAHID report referenced above or by visiting the Healthmap website
