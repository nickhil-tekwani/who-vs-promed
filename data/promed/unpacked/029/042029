LYME DISEASE AND TOURETTE'S SYNDROME: RFI
*****************************************
A PromED-mail post
Date: 1 March 1998, 1158 MDST
From: C.H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>

The 7 February 1998 issue of The Lancet (351:418-419) contains an
interesting article on Tourette's syndrome in a young male apparently
infected with _Borrelia burgdorferi_. If anyone has further information or
has plans to study this apparent correlation, or any other correlation
between Tourette's syndrome and infectious diseases, please let ProMED-mail
know. At the least, Lyme disease researchers might consider their own
investigations of this possible correlation.
For additional information regarding Tourette's syndrome see:
