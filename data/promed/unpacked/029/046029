Eastern North Carolina had the same predictions of mosquitoes emerging from
the flood waters of hurricane Floyd in the fall of 1999. Although a
considerable amount of aerial spaying was done immediately following the
flood (thanks to federal resources), I am not convinced that this prevented
any significant arboviral disease outbreaks.
Much like the concerns about cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A, etc. during the
earlier parts of the flooding, these fears were unfounded. During these
large flood events, there is so much water that any microbe, insect or
human is easily overwhelmed and often becomes hard to find; but that
doesn't mean we shouldn't keep looking.

[The above interesting comment was received on 7 Sep 2005, but posting was
delayed in case any further comments on the effect hurricane Katrina might
have on local mosquito populations and mosquito-borne infections were
received. However, none were.
Dr Morrow seems to imply that there were no serious mosquito-borne
outbreaks post Hurricane Floyd, but that probably there would not have even
if there had been no aerial spraying. I might add that the Vector Control
Research Centre, Pondicherry, India reported that the Asian tsunami created
new mosquito larval habitats in the Nicobar and Andaman Islands, when sea
water was left behind post flooding. Such saltwater habitats were colonized
by a local malaria vector, _Anopheles sundaicus_. This mosquito, which is
widely distributed in Asia, lays her eggs in both fresh and saline waters.
It is stated that there are indications that this mosquito increase has had
a significant impact on human health, with a 14-fold increase in malaria
infection in some regions; see <http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?> for
a summary of the paper in the online Malaria Journal dated 20 Jul 2005
