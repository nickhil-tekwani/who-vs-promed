From: Peter May <pmay@stetson.edu>

For the past 6 years, Terry Farrell and I have been doing field studies of
the ecology and natural history of pigmy rattlesnakes in central Florida.
This fall and early winter, we have encountered about 10 snakes (out of an
estimated population of 400-500) showing symptoms of what we initially
thought to be necrotic stomatitis. We haven't seen these symptoms in the
past, in spite of ~10,000 observations of individual snakes. A few
individuals have shown some swelling and exudate from the gums, but
recently, we have encountered others with no such gum involvement. All
individuals show noticeable swelling of the entire head, and some have also
developed opaque eyecaps (whitish in color and much more pronounced than in
pre-ecdysis). A couple of individuals have also shown distinct cyst-like
swellings on the head. All of these individuals have been conspicuous in
posture and exposure, apparently attempting "behavioral fever" in response
to the infection. We have also seen one ribbon snake showing the same
symptoms. There are no apparent environmental or climatic differences
between this season and the 6 previous years we have monitored this
population. As we are ecologists with little experience in microbiology or
reptile pathology, we are looking for any suggestions as to what we might
be dealing with.
If anyone has any suggestions for methods of culturing and possibly
identifying the infectious agent we would appreciate it; further, if anyone
knows of any literature on episodic disease outbreaks in wild populations
of herps, we would like to know of those as well.
Thanks in advance for any information or suggestions.
