Beijing reports 11 deaths from malaria in 3 months
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 11 Chinese people, aged between 20 to 50, died from
malignant malaria from January to March 2011, according to the
Ministry of Health on Monday [18 Apr 2011].

According to the statement, the number of malaria cases had plunged
from an annual average of 30 million when the People's Republic of
China was founded in 1949 to 7433 cases in 2010.

However, recent years had witnessed rising deaths from malignant
malaria, due to greater population flow, the statement said.

The Ministry of Health, together with other related government
departments, will carry out a publicity campaign to raise awareness of
malaria prevention and control in the lead-up to the national malaria
day which falls on 26 Apr 2011, it said.

[Beijing's climate at this time of the year does not favor
transmission of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria, which requires an
average 24 hour temperature of 20 degrees Celsius [68 degrees
Fahrenheit; _P. vivax_ requires 16 degrees C or 60.8 degrees F]. This
support the idea, which is also implied in the text, that cases are
being imported into Beijing. The current climatic conditions in
Beijing make local transmission very unlikely. â€“ Mod.EP]
