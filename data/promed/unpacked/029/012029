Chronic Wasting Disease in deer has been recorded in DeKalb County
------------------------
Cases of Chronic Wasting Disease among deer have been found in
northern Illinois and a program to address it is in progress, said
DeKalb County Board member Julia Fauci, at a county executive meeting
last week.
Previously, cases have been found in southern Wisconsin and in western states.
Chronic Wasting Disease is a fatal neurological disease found in deer
and elk. The disease attacks the brains of infected animals, causing
them to become emaciated, display abnormal behavior, lose
coordination, and eventually die.
Tim Schweizer, spokesman for the Illinois Department of Natural
Resources,said last week, "So far, in the past 2.5 years that we have
had positives, we have found 54 cases in the state from 4 counties:
Boone, Winnebago, McHenry, and DeKalb. There have been 4 cases in
DeKalb County."
Schweizer continued, "CWD only affects deer and elk. We are trying to
contain the disease and slow it by taking samples of deer taken by
hunters." Where they find the disease, the DNR destroys deer in that
area.
Schweizer stressed, "There has never been any evidence that it can be
contracted by people or livestock." That position has been supported
by the World Health Organization.
The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources began to monitor the
wild, white-tailed deer herd for the disease in 1999. On 28 Feb 2002,
the 1st cases of CWD were reported for 3 deer near the city of Mount
Horeb in south-central Wisconsin.
For the last 2 years, the Illinois Departments of Agriculture and
Natural Resources have tried to prevent chronic wasting disease from
moving into Illinois. That has been difficult because the method of
transmitting it is unknown. It is even possible that animals can pick
it up from the soil.
A State of Illinois news release reported, "Researchers are just
beginning to understand CWD. It is likely caused by an abnormal
protein called a prion. The means of spreading CWD is unknown, but
could involve close contact between animals or animals exposed to a
CWD-infected environment.
"Usually months to years pass from the time an animal is infected to
when it shows signs of the disease. Classic CWD signs in deer and elk
18 months or older include poor body condition, tremors, stumbling,
increased salivation, difficulty swallowing, and excessive thirst or
urination," the release said.
Concern has been expressed for both captive and wild herds, including
a growing industry of farm-raised deer and elk raised for food.
Though there is no scientific evidence that CWD can infect humans,
for safety's sake, experts suggest that hunters avoid eating the
brain, spinal cord, eyes, tonsils, spleen, or lymph nodes of
white-tailed deer and elk because the infectious agent tends to
concentrate in those tissues. WHO has recommended no part of deer or
elk that show evidence of CWD should be eaten by people.
DNR has long advocated good hygiene by hunters, including the wearing
of rubber gloves when handling deer. Several years ago, CWD was
diagnosed in wild, free-ranging deer and elk primarily in
northeastern Colorado, southeastern Wyoming, Nebraska,
Montana,Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.
Scientists test for CWD by examining the brain tissue of animals.
Illinois livestock regulations require that any captive cervid
(member of the deer/elk family) that dies from an unknown cause and
that has exhibited a neurological disorder must be tested for CWD.
Programs are in place for establishing Certified Monitored CWD herds
of captive deer and elk.
Illinois has participated in a "targeted surveillance program" for
CWD in wild deer for more than 5 years, because that approach was
first proposed by the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease
Study, a diagnostic and research service that investigates wildlife
diseases.
If individuals suspect local deer of having the disease, they should
contact the DNR's Wildlife Office at 217-782-6384.
