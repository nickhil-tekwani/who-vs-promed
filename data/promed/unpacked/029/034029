The Nassau County Department of Health [New York State, USA] is looking into a Legionnaires' [disease] outbreak on Long Island. There are 10 reported cases in a one-mile radius of Wantagh Avenue and Old Jerusalem Road on the Levittown-Wantagh Border. All of the cases were discovered within the past 2 weeks.

The _Legionella_ bacteria are found naturally in the environment and are transmitted by aerosolized water. People can get Legionnaires' disease when breathing in a mist or vapor containing the bacteria, most commonly from cooling towers, fountains, spray parks, hot tubs, whirlpool spas, showers, and faucets. The bacteria are not spread from person to person.

Those who are 50 years of age or older are at a higher risk of becoming ill with Legionnaires' disease, as well as current or former smokers, those with chronic lung disease, those with a weakened immune system, and people who take immunosuppressant medications.

[The news report above describes a cluster of 10 cases of Legionnaires' disease occurring in a 2-week period within a one-mile radius of the intersection of Wantagh Avenue and Old Jerusalem Road in Nassau County, New York State. A map of showing this location can be found at https://bit.ly/3ARnkpi.

At this point, we do not know if we are dealing with a cluster of unrelated cases or a common-source outbreak. The investigation usually involves genotyping the clinical isolates of the bacterium _Legionella_ from patients with Legionnaires' disease to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes of the clinical isolates match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. We will await further findings from the investigation.

Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described by Correia et al (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. - Mod.ML
