Headlines
- Amid the escalating crisis in Ukraine, the GPEI has expressed extreme concern about the unfolding effects of the conflict on the country's health system as security and displacement increase risk of diseases such as polio. Read the statement at https://polioeradication.org/news-post/global-polio-eradication-initiative-deeply-concerned-for-health-of-ukrainian-people-amid-escalating-crisis/. [As a reminder, the Ukraine has cVDPV cases, a sign of reduced vaccination coverage. The massive movement of population without access to services is a potential time-bomb for vaccine preventable diseases. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan violence

Gunmen kill polio worker in Pakistan vaccination campaign
---------------------------------------------------------
Gunmen in northwestern Pakistan shot and killed a female polio worker as she was returning home Wednesday [2 Mar 2022] after taking part in the country's latest anti-polio campaign, police said.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. However, militants often target polio teams and police assigned to protect them in Pakistan, falsely claiming the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Wednesday's attack [2 Mar 2022] happened on the outskirts of the city of Peshawar. Iqra Iqbal was gunned down on her way home, said Iftikhar Khan, a police official.

Pakistan regularly launches anti-polio campaigns in an effort to eradicate the highly infectious disease. The latest 5-day drive against polio started on Monday [28 Feb 2022].

Since January last year [2021], Pakistan has not reported any new cases, raising hopes the Islamic nation is close to becoming a polio-free country. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only remaining countries in the world still trying to eradicate polio, which can cause severe paralysis in children.

[Repeating what I said in response to the violence in Afghanistan last week, "What can one say above and beyond what we've said previously. It's hard to fathom why healthcare workers are being targeted. As long as this type of violence continues, the probability of polio eradication remains seriously challenged."

[3] Africa outbreaks
Date: Thu 3 Mar 2022
Source: Science [edited]
https://www.science.org/content/article/africa-battles-out-of-control-polio-outbreaks


On [17 Feb 2022], Malawi's Ministry of Health announced a nasty surprise: A 3-year-old girl who was paralyzed in November 2021 was infected with the wild poliovirus, which Africa officially vanquished in 2020. The sequence of the virus showed it had somehow made the leap from Pakistan, one of the last 2 holdouts of the wild virus. A week later came bad news from Afghanistan: Gunmen killed 8 polio workers in the country's northeast.

The incidents are the latest setbacks on the long, bumpy road to global polio eradication. Yet Pakistan has "exported" wild poliovirus before, sparking outbreaks that were quickly snuffed out, and the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan improved dramatically last year [2021], with polio cases tumbling to a historic low.

Instead, perhaps the biggest threat to the effort now is an explosion of vaccine-derived polio outbreaks in Africa that affected almost 2 dozen countries last year [2021] and paralyzed more than 500 children in 2020 and again in 2021. Vaccine-derived strains emerge where children are un- or underimmunized, allowing the live, weakened virus in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) to circulate and accumulate enough mutations to revert to its neurovirulent form and paralyze kids. These outbreaks -- which almost always emerge from type 2 poliovirus, one of the 3 virus strains -- are "very worrying" and "front burner" at the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), says John Vertefeuille of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a partner in the initiative.

A big part of the problem is that countries don't view vaccine-derived strains as an emergency, says Simona Zipursky, an adviser to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) polio program, even though they behave just like the wild virus. "It is not like there is a milder variant as there is with COVID-19," Zipursky says. Nigeria's widely lauded victory over the wild virus -- it was the last African country to achieve that feat -- fed a sense that "the job was done," says WHO's Aidan O'Leary, who directs GPEI. The quality of Nigeria's polio program, once among the best in the world, slipped, and today the country is "the most important generator" of vaccine-derived polioviruses, says Jay Wenger of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, another partner in GPEI. Nigeria accounted for more than half of all vaccine-derived polio cases globally last year [2021] and exported the virus to 18 countries.

Other factors have contributed, too. Lately, many African countries have been slow to respond to new outbreaks as they wait for a new vaccine that they think will solve the problems, which has allowed the virus to spread. Many are frustrated with the existing vaccine, monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2); they would use it to quash an outbreak but then, because the vaccine virus occasionally reverts, the response would seed more outbreaks.

Known as novel OPV2 (nOPV2), the new vaccine was engineered to be as effective as mOPV2 but more genetically stable, greatly lessening the chance it will revert. The vaccine, funded by the Gates foundation, was rolled out in a few countries in March 2021 under an emergency use authorization.

Pending its arrival, Senegal waited for almost 1 year before responding to a virus detected in late 2020, instead of using readily available supplies of mOPV2. "If the virus gets a head start for such a long time it is harder to stop," says Mark Pallansch, who recently retired from CDC but remains involved in GPEI.

Although early data suggest nOPV2 is indeed less likely to trigger outbreaks, Pallansch thinks its promise has been oversold. "Governments thought, if I can just get it, things will be fine," he says. But countries ran nOPV2 campaigns of poor quality, reaching just a fraction of the target population. Nigeria has burned through about 184 million nOPV2 doses, out of 255 million used so far, and still hasn't stopped many of its outbreaks. The new vaccine "is not a magic bullet," Zipursky says.

A new threat
------------
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the last 2 countries where the wild poliovirus is endemic. Cases in both dropped sharply last year (left). Vaccine-derived outbreaks are now a big threat to polio eradication -- especially in Africa (right). [This text discusses graphs available at the source URL. - Mod.MPP]

GPEI and other international bodies are hammering home that countries should respond to any outbreak immediately with whatever type 2 vaccine is available. The mantra is "faster, better, bigger," O'Leary says: Be quicker to detect and respond to outbreaks, improve the vaccination campaigns, and broaden them. "We need to conduct them not where you think the virus is, but, based on migration patterns, where you think it will be," he says.

The new worries come as Pakistan and Afghanistan, the last 2 endemic countries, are doing surprisingly well, with just 5 reported cases of wild poliovirus last year [2021], down from 140 in 2020. Pakistan has just gone an entire year without a case. (Vaccine-derived cases in both countries are way down as well.) "It looks better than it ever has," Wenger says. The low numbers are "absolutely not" an artifact, says Hamid Jafari, who heads the eradication program in the region; surveillance remains "really, really good." Some of the gains stem from very favorable epidemiology. Polio resurged in both countries in 2019 and 2020, and "after a peak we always see a trough," Jafari says, in part because of increased population immunity. Reduced travel during the COVID-19 pandemic helped.

In Pakistan, vaccination drives already cover most of the target population, and they are improving, Jafari says. Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister, is actively involved. Bill Gates just visited the country to bolster enthusiasm. In Afghanistan, too, "we've made more progress than we could have anticipated," O'Leary says. After resuming power in August 2021, the Taliban rescinded its ban on house-to-house polio vaccination in its strongholds, which had left 3.5 million children out of reach. (In some areas GPEI is still restricted to vaccinating in mosques.) Vaccination campaigns in November [2021], December [2021], and January [2022] reached 8.5 million out of 9.9 million children, Jafari says, including 2.6 million who were inaccessible for 3.5 years.

But future campaigns could be hobbled if last week's killings are a harbinger of further violence. And Jafari suspects the virus may survive in small populations that move back and forth across the border between the 2 countries. A couple of positive environmental samples detected in December [2021] in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan show the virus is still lurking there. Jafari worries it could resurge when the weather warms and people begin to travel for Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. The recent spread to Malawi underscores the risk of further delays, he says: "We want to kill the virus now."

[The article in item 3 above is an excellent summary of the challenges faced by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). While last week it was an attack in Afghanistan, this week it's an attack in Pakistan (see item 2 above). What shouldn't be neglected is the comment ""after a peak we always see a trough"" referring to the decrease in cases seen in 2021 following a very active transmission year in 2020. As a reminder, following a major epidemic it takes time to build up a susceptible population that will serve as a pool for continued circulation of the poliovirus; both the wild poliovirus (WPV) as well as the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). Interpretation of success should be cautious... especially following the case in Malawi where the implicated virus circulated undetected for 2 years. A similar event happened in Borno, Nigeria in 2016 (see Poliomyelitis update (13): Nigeria (BO) 20160905.4467318, Poliomyelitis update (11): Nigeria (BO) 20160811.4410331, and Poliomyelitis update (10): Nigeria (BO), new cases, RFI 20160811.4408853).

Another cause for concern is the heavy focus on eradication of the WPV and a seemingly lesser concern about cVDPVs. Is polio eradication only for the wild poliovirus or is it for all polioviruses that can be transmitted? The cVDPVs are derived from vaccine viruses that have reverted to a more wild virus-like neurovirulence. Will we eradicate WPV but continue to fight cVDPVs? - Mod.MPP]
