[1] FDA recall: uneviscerated sardine anchovies
Date: Wed 1 Feb 2012

W & International Import Inc. is recalling "Rely" Sardine Anchovies because the product was found to be uneviscerated. The recalled "Rely" Sardine Anchovies were distributed nationwide in 7.0 oz. plastic packages and are a product of China.

The "Rely" Sardine Anchovies were sampled by a New York State Department of Agriculture Food Inspector during inspection. Subsequent analysis of the product by New York State Food Laboratory personnel confirmed that the "Rely" Sardine Anchovies were not properly eviscerated prior to processing. The sale of uneviscerated fish is prohibited under New York State Agriculture and Markets regulations because _Clostridium botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated fish have been linked to outbreaks of botulinum poisoning.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.

[2] FDA recall: uneviscerated dried yellow croaker

W & International Import Inc. is recalling "Rely" Dried Yellow Croaker because the product was found to be uneviscerated.

The recalled "Rely" Dried Yellow Croaker was distributed nationwide in bulk cardboard boxes. The "Rely" Dried Yellow Croaker is a product of China.

The "Rely" Dried Yellow Croaker was sampled by a New York State Department of Agriculture Food Inspector during inspection. Subsequent analysis of the product by New York State Food Laboratory personnel confirmed that the "Rely" Dried Yellow Croaker was not properly eviscerated prior to processing.

The sale of uneviscerated fish is prohibited under New York State Agriculture and Markets regulations because _Clostridium botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated fish have been linked to outbreaks of botulinum poisoning.

This product may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which can cause botulism, a serious and potentially fatal food-borne illness. Symptoms of botulism include blurred or double vision, general weakness, poor reflexes, difficulty in swallowing, and respiratory paralysis.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated [yet] with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
