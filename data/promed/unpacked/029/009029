Zookeepers at the Albuquerque BioPark are keeping a close eye on an elephant they say has elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus. The BioPark says 3-year-old Thorne tested positive for a very low level of the virus.

They believe he should be okay since they caught it early. Elephants carry the virus latently throughout their entire lives, and researchers do not know why the virus ever actively appears. Thorne will continue to spend time with his herd and can be seen in outdoor habitats.

[Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus 1A is a member of the _Proboscivirus_ genus and is a major cause of fatal hemorrhagic disease in endangered juvenile Asian elephants worldwide.

This virus causes fatal hemorrhagic disease commonly identified at North American zoos. The virus causes only benign external herpetic lesions in African elephants, but in Asian elephants infection results in endothelial disease, which in many cases can be fatal.

Asian elephant deaths are the consequence of cross-species infection with a herpesvirus that is naturally latent in, but normally not lethal to, African elephants. - Mod.PMB
