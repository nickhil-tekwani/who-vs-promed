New Zealand [NZ] children have suffered convulsions from a flu
vaccination following reports of similar reactions in Australia [see:
Pediatric influenza vaccine - Australia: adverse reactions 20100428.1368].

Last week [week of 19 Apr 2010], the NZ Ministry of Health advised
doctors against using Fluvax on children. On Wednesday [28 Apr 2010],
New Zealand's Health Ministry chief adviser for child and youth
health Pat Tuohy told politicians that 5 children had been reported
to have suffered febrile convulsions in New Zealand since Friday [23 Apr 2010].

Australia's chief medical officer had already suspended seasonal flu
vaccinations for children under 5 following concerns stemming from a
significant rise in the number of Australian children developing a
fever after receiving the vaccine. A 2-year-old child was found dead
in her cot on 9 Apr 2010, [one] day after she and her twin sister
were given the seasonal flu vaccination by a private Brisbane GP
[General Practitioner]. The case continues to be investigated.

As of 6 pm (AEST) on Tuesday [27 Apr 2010], Queensland Health had
received 95 notifications of Queenslanders who'd had adverse
reactions after receiving the seasonal flu vaccine. Of those 95
cases, 41 related to children aged 5 and under. And in Western
Australia, flu shots have caused adverse reactions in 251 children under 5.

The NZ Health Ministry was in regular contact with its Australian
counterpart and a teleconference was scheduled to try and garner more
information, he said. On present advice there was no reason for
children, especially those at high risk, to stop receiving other
types of flu vaccines, Dr Tuohy said. Children at a high risk were
considered to be those who had an underlying chronic condition, such
as asthma or diabetes, or those at risk for other reasons including
those from low socio-economic families.

While there had been more reports of severe reactions, including the
5 febrile convulsions, there were also more children receiving the
vaccine and people were more likely to report reactions due to the
media attention.

Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore were the only countries to use
the [Fluvax] vaccine so far this year [2010]. Most northern
hemisphere countries begin flu vaccines in the lead up to winter.
Over 260 000 Fluvax doses were administered in March [2010] and the
ministry said supplies were now likely to be low. More supplies of
[an] alternative vaccine -- Vaxigrip -- were expected from Europe
this week [week of 26 Apr 2010].

[Fluvax, marketed by the CSL company, is a trivalent seasonal flu
vaccine, which includes the pandemic A(H1N1) virus. CSL's Fluvax is
available in adult and pediatric formulations. It is an inactivated
split-virus vaccine that does not include an adjuvant. It contains
the flu strains recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)
for the Southern Hemisphere's seasonal flu vaccine: that is, the
pandemic A(H1N1), an influenza A Perth-like H3N2, and a Brisbane-like
influenza B. In February 2010 the WHO recommended similar strains for
the Northern Hemisphere's next flu season.

It is unclear at present to what extent the adverse reactions are
related to an individual component of the vaccine, or the whole CSL
vaccine, or one or more production batches of the vaccine. Further
information is awaited. The adverse reactions appear to comprise
predominantly febrile convulsions. The autopsy findings from the
single fatality in Australia were inconclusive and indeed this case
may be unrelated to the subsequent vaccine-related cases, which have
been observed in several Australian states and now in New Zealand. - Mod.CP]
