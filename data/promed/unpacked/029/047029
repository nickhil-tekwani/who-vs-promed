Bat killer cause confirmed as fungus
------------------------------------
Big-eared bats appear to be immune to white nose syndrome, for reasons
that are not clear white nose syndrome (WNS), the disease rampaging
its way through the bats of North America, is caused by a fungus,
scientists have confirmed.

Researchers from a number of US institutions infected healthy bats
with the fungus _Geomyces destructans_, and found they did develop the
disease. The team also showed that the fungus can pass from one bat to
another.

Writing in the journal Nature, they say WNS "has the potential to
decimate North American bat populations." So far, the disease has
killed more than a million bats in the eastern US and Canada since it
was first identified in New York state in 2006.

_G. destructans_ is usually found on the animals' snouts, where it
causes a characteristic white colouration and, more significantly,
lesions in the skin. Although the fungus has been suspected as the
disease's primary cause, researchers have not been able to prove it
definitively. Animals sometimes contract fungal diseases when their
immune systems have been compromised, perhaps by a different
infection, and this has been seen as a possibility for WNS as well.
The research group, led by David Blehert from the National Wildlife
Health Center at the US Geological Survey, appears to have proven the
primary role of the fungus.

First, they took little brown bats (_Myotis lucifugus_) that were fit
and healthy, and infected them with _G. destructans_ from culture. 3
months after infection, all showed lesions characteristic of WNS. To
determine how the fungus could be transferred from one bat to another,
the researchers set up 2 different experiments. In one, infected bats
could mingle with healthy ones. Nearly 90 percent of the healthy ones
had contracted fungal infection 3 months on.

In the wild, bats appear to transmit the fungus when they "swarm" in
vast groups outside the caves where they will hibernate, literally
rubbing shoulders and everything else with their fellows, who may be
from a different species or a different cave.

In the other experiment, healthy bats and diseased ones were put in
neighboring cages separated by 1.3 cm [0.5 in]. Here, the fungus did
not spread, indicating that infectious spores are not airborne.

The researchers hope that confirming the disease's cause will enable
agencies to concentrate on ways to halt its advance. "There's unlikely
to be any 'magic bullet' that we could deploy to block the disease --
diseases among free-ranging wildlife are not usually stopped in their
tracks when they're established," Dr Blehert told BBC News.

But measures could be adopted to reduce transmission by humans, he
said, by closing caves and insisting on decontamination when people do
go into hibernation sites. This would probably not stop the disease
spreading between neighboring bat populations that will normally
intermingle. But it could stop people inadvertently taking spores from
one side of the continent to another, or even to other continents.

It is generally believed that WNS came to the US this way from Europe,
where bats appear to be immune.

Another approach might be to change the environment of the cave
subtly, so as to slow the fungal spread while leaving it habitable for
bats and other wildlife.

_G. destructans_ appears to like low temperatures and certain levels
of humidity; so altering those parameters could retard its growth.

Meanwhile, research goes on into how the fungus actually kills the
animals. "It might be called white nose syndrome, but when you look
closely the most significant damage perhaps is to the wings," said Dr
Blehert. "These are exquisite organs, external structures made
entirely of skin, comprising 8 times more skin than is on the rest of
the body. "They play a role in water balance when the bats are
hibernating, blood pressure regulation, even passive CO2 exchange with
the atmosphere -- so if the wings are heavily damaged by the fungus,
that might explain its lethality."

The advance of WNS across North America in some ways parallels the
spread of chytridiomycosis, the frequently lethal fungal disease
affecting amphibians.

As with chytrid, some species of bat appear immune, or at least
resistant. In North America, these include the gray bat and the
spectacular Virginia big-eared bat.

Scientists want to understand why they are immune when others such as
the little brown bat succumb; and, as is being investigated with
chytrid, to see whether this natural immunity can be turned into a
defence for vulnerable species.

Chytridiomycosis has wiped many amphibian populations and quite a few
entire species off the map; and this research group warns of similar
troubles ahead for bats unless WNS is tackled. "Fungal pathogens have
the unique capacity to drive host populations to extinction because of
their ability to survive in host-free environments," they write.

"Given the high mortality rate and speed at which WNS has spread, the
disease has the potential to decimate North American bat populations
and cause species extinctions similar to those documented for
amphibians affected by chytridiomycosis."

Therefore, recapping what is known of white nose syndrome:
- WNS is associated with a fungus known as _Geomyces destructans_ --
and the new research confirms it as the cause;
- once present in a colony, WNS can wipe out the entire population;
- it was first reported in a cave in New York in February 2006;
- the most common visible symptom of an infected bat is a white fungus
on the animal's nose, but it can also appear on its wings, ears, or
tail;
- other symptoms include weight loss and abnormal behavior, such as
flying in daylight or sub-zero temperatures;
- species known to be vulnerable to WNS include: tri-colored, little
brown, big brown, northern long-eared, small-footed, and Indiana
bats;
- there is no known risk to human health.

[Definitively establishing the cause and that there are resistant
species should give us a way to control it. We are definitely looking
forward to the news on how to stop the fungus and give our bats the
same immunity as those in the EU. - Mod.TG]
