Dengue surveillance in French Guiana
------------------------------------
Weekly Epidemiologic Status Report, Week 18, 2006 (1-7 May 2006)
Observations: For the past 4 weeks, nearly 3600 suspected cases of dengue
have been reported, with the number of weekly cases stabilizing between 800
to 1000 cases (per week). Since week 48 of 2005, 1746 dengue cases have
been confirmed by laboratory tests. One can not yet determine whether the
peak of the epidemic has been reached. In the final analysis, the data for
the confirmed cases is incomplete since the introduction of NS1: certain
negative tests without date at the beginning of the symptoms had not been
studied by serology, such that the number of confirmed cases is
underestimated in the preceding weekly reports. For the past 3 weeks, the
epidemic has particularly affected the coastal communities. Since the start
of the epidemic, 4 deaths can be directly attributed to dengue, 3 of whom
were children (ages 7 months, 4 years, and 6 years), and a 64 year old adult.
For Week 18, 2006:
From sentinel physicians:
The number of persons having consulted a town doctor is estimated at 442
(an estimate based on the number of clinical cases diagnosed by the
sentinel physicians and also partly on their activity). 25 per cent of the
suspected cases are under 6 years of age.
From Health Centers:
32 cases reported. 25 per cent of the suspected cases are under 6 years of age.
From the Medical Service of the Armed Forces of Guiana:
Four cases reported, of which 2 were in Kourou, and 2 in Cayenne.
Emergency Rooms and Medical Watch in Cayenne:
440 persons received consultation for suspected dengue, of which 20 were
seen at the Medical Watch in Cayenne. Nine per cent of those seen for
suspected dengue were urgently admitted to the hospital.
From the Emergency Medical Assistance Service (SAMU):
SAMU received 37 calls for suspected dengue, representing 9 per cent of all
calls (for the week).
Hospitalizations (for confirmed cases of dengue):
Since the beginning of the epidemic, there were 146 confirmed cases of
dengue requiring hospitalization: 15 per cent for hemorrhagic dengue, and
52 per cent for severe non-hemorrhagic dengue. The distribution per age
group follows: 19 per cent were under 5 years of age, 21 per cent were
between the age of 5 and 14, and 60 per cent were over 15 years of age or
more. Among those followed by laboratory measures, thrombocytopenia was
noted in 73 per cent, and 57 per cent had a very profound thrombocytopenia.
A significant increase in hematocrit was found in 25 per cent of the cases
(58 per cent of these increases were greater than 20 per cent of the
reference value). Furthermore, 17 per cent presented with serious bleeding.
