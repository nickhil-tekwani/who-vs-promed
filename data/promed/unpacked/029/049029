Avian Influenza A (H7N7) Virus Epidemic 2003: Public Health Consequences

Risk factors, health, well-being, health care needs and preventive
measures during the H7N7 avian influenza outbreak control in the
Netherlands.
------------------------------------------------
An estimated 1000 people, possibly more, have been infected with
avian influenza during the outbreak in the Netherlands in 2003. 1/3
of the poultry farmers whose holdings were cleared reported stress
reactions, fatigue and depressive symptoms. The large spread of the
virus underscores the importance of the measures to prevent
poultry-to-human transmission in people handling infected poultry.
The possible uncertainty, stress and anxiety associated with the
avian flu control demand specific health care attention. A total of
453 people reported with health complaints, predominantly
conjunctivitis. Antibodies were found in 59 percent of infected
poultry workers' family members. Of the 500 tested persons who had
handled infected poultry, about 50 percent showed an antibody
response. The poultry farmers and workers complied insufficiently
with the preventive measures.
The antiviral drug oseltamivir protected against infection, whereas
mouth and nose masks did not. The attention to support, information
and respectful treatment of poultry farmers and workers during the
clearances worked quite well. Externally hired veterinarians
experienced their activities as emotionally aggravating more often
than other professionals.
About 1/4 of the poultry farmers worried about the survival of their
holding and the sector as a whole; 16 percent felt a need for
additional support, help or health care because of the avian flu.
They consulted agricultural care providers and family doctors, and
less frequently mental health care providers.

[The outcome of this retrospective analysis of the epidemiology of
the H7N7 avian influenza outbreak in the Netherlands is both
reassuring and disquieting. The spread of infection to family members
of infected poultry members is greater than initially supposed,
indicating that there was considerable human-to-human transmission of
the avian virus. Under these circumstances it is perhaps surprising
that only 50 percent of workers exposed to infected poultry exhibited
an antibody response. It would be interesting to know the
relationship of antibody response in this group to age and previous
history of exposure to influenza. On the other hand, any direct
disease response in humans was mild, and the neuraminidase inhibitor
oseltamivir appears to have provided adequate protection to those
handling infected birds. Nor has there been evidence of interaction
between avian and human influenza viruses in the aftermath of the
outbreak, which might have provoked a new outbreak in either the
human or avian population. - Mod.CP]
