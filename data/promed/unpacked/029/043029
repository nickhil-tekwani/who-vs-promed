A Princess Cruises ship docks in California with 172 passengers and crew members suffering from norovirus infection. For the 2nd time this year, Carnival's Crown Princess cruise ship arrived in a U.S. port with passengers and crew members sick from the norovirus. The ship docked in California early Sunday [16 Nov 2014] with 172 people sick.

"There were so many people walking around with buckets of sanitizers and wiping down walls and every time someone got up from a table, they were wiping down the tables and wiping down the chairs." Experts have said the outbreaks usually stem from having too many people confined to a small area, lackluster hand-washing and buffet-style dining. Crews will now carry out a deep cleaning before the ship embarks on its next voyage.

[ProMED-mail no longer reports outbreaks of norovirus (the winter-vomiting bug) infection because of its ubiquity early in winter, together with the brevity of the illness, for which there is no treatment. Outbreaks have frequently terminated before they can be reported and the consequences of infection are normally benign. Information on this particular outbreak is posted as a reminder of the phenomenon and the frequency of norovirus outbreaks as a feature of social gatherings at this time of year. The phenomenon is global and several different norovirus strains may be circulating at the same time. - Mod.CP
