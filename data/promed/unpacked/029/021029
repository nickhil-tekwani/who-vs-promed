An outbreak of bovine tuberculosis has been identified and confirmed by laboratory test in a cattle farm located in the municipality of Asse-le-Beranger, in the canton of Evron, Mayenne department.

The same farm was found infected during a previous outbreak, detected on the farm in 2006. This led to the slaughter of the entire stock, as well as cleaning and disinfection measures according to regulations, said the prefecture of Mayenne.

The whole herd, consisting of 180 cattle, has been declared as infected by the prefecture and was placed under quarantine on 4 Oct 2012. All animals were slaughtered between 13-16 Nov 2012, following their evaluation. The premises will be subject to double disinfection procedures prior to allowing for repopulation.

Compensation for the slaughtered animals and the costs of disinfection will be fully covered by the State. Epidemiological investigations have identified farms in contact with this new focus; they are being monitored.

Bovine tuberculosis (_Mycobacterium bovis_ infection) is potentially transmissible to man. It is reminded that, on the national level, the percentage of TB cases in humans due infection with _Mycobacterium bovis_ is minimal [out of the total TB cases). Theses cases involve people in close contact with confined excretory animals or consumption of raw [unpasteurized] milk from animal shedders.

The vast majority of cases of human tuberculosis is due to _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the specific TB bacterium of human and primates. The health authorities in charge of human health (Health Region Pays de la Loire) will carry out investigation and tests to exclude infection of the breeder concerned and his family.

Two cases of bovine tuberculosis [BovTB] were detected in Semide and Chehery, Ardennes department. This led to the slaughter of about 400 cattle. France is approaching the threshold which, if crossed, will challenge its status of country officially declared "free" of the disease [see commentary below]. It is true that we touch on a very sensitive subject because of the economic impact at the national level.

The 1st warning was recorded in June [2012], in Semide, resulting in the regulatory slaughter of the entire herd of 40 heads. The 2nd, one month later, in Chehery, where 350 cattle were sent to the slaughterhouse. Since then, fingers are crossed that the veterinary services detectives will discover the source of infection.

"Bovine TB has existed for decades," says Arthur Tirado, veterinarian and director of training DDCSPP (Departmental directorate of social cohesion and the protection of people, under the direction of veterinary services, DFS), "but the fight against this disease has borne fruit since the early 2000s, when France was recognized as BovTB free. This means that despite a few cases, at least 99.9 percent of the French herds are not infected. For now, in the Ardennes, our main concern is to identify the origin of the disease".

To this end, DFS conducted a survey of all animals sold or introduced into each of 2 herds concerned. No result yet. "What we know so far is that 2 different strains were found in the Ardennes; thus there has been no contamination between the 2 herds. The studies are continuing to discover the source of infection".

The owners of the slaughtered herds were compensated on the real value of their stock determined by 2 experts from a list, chosen by the breeder.

[According to a recently published referenced paper (Ref 1; thanks to Susan Baekeland for bringing this to our attention), France has been experiencing a resurgence of BovTB since 2004. The rate of herd prevalence increased from 0.02 percent in 2004 to 0.07 percent in 2010. This increase, if continuing, could jeopardize the free status of France.

Moreover, the distribution of the disease on French territory is heterogeneous, with 4 geographic regions infected (Cote-d'Or, Dordogne, Camargue, and Pyrenees-Atlantiques) and uncertainty as to the situation in other areas.

In addition, the authors indicate that the discovery of infected wild animals in several areas where bovine infection is present, raises the question of suspected reservoirs in wildlife, leading to the maintenance of the epidemiological cycle.

Subscribers are referred to commentary in ProMED-mail posting 20111228.3695, which included the following information: on BovTB in wildlife in France.

Regarding France's BovTB status, subscribers are referred to article 11.6.2. of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.6.htm. According to said article, to qualify as free from bovine tuberculosis, a country or zone should satisfy the following requirements:
1. _M. bovis_ infection in domestic (permanently captive and owned free-range) bovines including cattle, water buffaloes, and wood bison is a notifiable disease in the country;
2. an on-going awareness programme should be in place to encourage reporting of all cases suggestive of bovine tuberculosis;
3. regular and periodic testing of all cattle, water buffalo, and wood bison herds demonstrated that _M. bovis_ infection was not present in at least 99.8 percent of the herds and 99.9 percent of the cattle, water buffaloes and wood bison in the country or zone for 3 consecutive years;
4. a surveillance programme should be in place to detect bovine tuberculosis in the country or zone through ante- and post-mortem inspection;
5. if the surveillance programme described in points 3 and 4 above demonstrated that _M. bovis_ infection was not present in at least 99.8 percent of the herds and 99.9 percent of the cattle, water buffaloes, and wood bison in the country or zone for 5 consecutive years, surveillance may be maintained through ante- and post-mortem inspection.
