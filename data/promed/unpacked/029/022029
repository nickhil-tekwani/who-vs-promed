Extract from an e-mail received on 4 Oct 2000 from Dr Emily Mmamakgaba
Mogajane, Chief Director, Agricultural Production, National Department of
Agriculture, Pretoria:
End of previous report period: 24 Sep 2000 (see Disease Information, 13
[38, 170, dated 29 Sep 2000).
End of this report period: 3 Oct 2000.
Depopulation:
In order to minimize the risk of further spread and to shorten the time to
normalize the situation, it was decided that, based on the identified
natural barriers, an area of about 3 km around the infected 2 farms should
be depopulated. This involved 14 farms, which ranged from smallholdings,
where animals were kept as pets, to good production systems.
The stamping-out policy on the infected farms was completed on 29 Sep 2000.
Depopulation within the 3-km radius was completed on 1 Oct 2000.
Physical examinations and sero-surveillance:
Intensive serological surveys conducted since 18 Sep 2000 on all farms
within the restricted 10-km-radius zone have thus far produced negative
results.
Within both the 10-km-radius infected zone and the 20-km-radius
surveillance zone, a total of 526 farms have been inspected, with 5 821
cattle, 937 sheep, 1 442 goats and 9 566 pigs subjected to physical
examinations and 469 cattle, 83 sheep, 150 goats and 135 pigs bled for
sero-surveillance, and all results were negative.
The inspection visits and sero-surveillance will continue within the coming
2 weeks.
