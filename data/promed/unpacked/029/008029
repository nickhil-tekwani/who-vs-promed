A 5th patient affected by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin which causes botulism was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Regional Hospital of Cacoal in Rondônia. The woman was hospitalized at the Urgency and Emergency Hospital (Heuro) and, after worsening of the picture, the medical team also chose to transfer her to the ICU, where 4 other relatives have already been since Mon 11 Feb 2019. There are suspicions that they contracted the bacterial toxin during a barbecue last Sun 11 Feb 2019, after eating a mayonnaise prepared with green maize. All are residents of São Miguel do Guaporé. In addition to the 5 patients hospitalized in the ICU, another 3 people, 2 children and an adult also ate the mayonnaise, but did not present symptoms of botulism.

According to the coordinator of health surveillance of Cacoal, Ivani Gromann, 4 patients hospitalized in the ICU were already medicated with the botulism antitoxin. The 5th patient is still awaiting the arrival of the drug. "The serum is given in a single dose. The other patients have already been medicated, but since it is rare, the municipality did not have the serum and it was necessary for the Ministry of Health to send it from Brasília, we were informed that the drug arrives today [14 Feb 2019]," said Gromann. As soon as the medication arrives, the 5th patient transferred to the ICU will be medicated.

The 3 people who also ate the mayonnaise, but did not present symptoms, will also be medicated. Patients who were already treated with the antibotulinum serum remain in a serious health condition. The health surveillance sector of Cacoal warns that there has been no confirmed outbreak of botulism on the site.

Cacoal's health surveillance coordinator Ivani said botulism is a rare, serious bacterial toxin induced disease that can be fatal and is non-contagious. The toxin can enter the body through the ingestion of improperly preserved canned food. "Hours after eating the contaminated food already begin to present double vision and then a progressive paralysis that strikes the mouth, eyes, and eyes. If left untreated, it can lead to death," said Gromann. Those were the symptoms that family members began to present shortly after lunch at a family barbecue. They were transferred to Cacoal at dawn on Mon 11 Feb 2019.

Ivani explains that most botulism bacteria are present mainly in improperly canned foods, but it has not been confirmed which food was contaminated by the bacteria; the suspicion is canned corn.

[It is not stated specifically if the suspect vehicle, the canned corn, was home canned rather than a commercial product.

The following is a review of botulism in Brazil:

"Abstract
--------
Botulism is a rare and potentially lethal illness caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ neurotoxin. We describe the findings of a laboratorial investigation of 117 suspected cases of botulism reported to the surveillance system in Brazil from January 2000 to October 2008. Data on the number and type of samples analyzed, type of toxins identified, reporting of the number of botulism cases, and transmission sources are discussed. A total of 193 clinical samples and 81 food samples were analyzed for detection and identification of the botulism neurotoxin. Among the clinical samples, 22 (11.4%) presented the toxin (9 type A, 5 type AB, and 8 with an unidentified type); in food samples, 8 (9.9%) were positive for the toxin (5 type A, 1 type AB, and 2 with an unidentified type). Of the 38 cases of suspected botulism in Brazil, 27 were confirmed by a mouse bioassay. Laboratorial botulism diagnosis is an important procedure to elucidate cases, especially food-borne botulism, to confirm clinical diagnosis and to identify toxins in food, helping sanitary control measures."
