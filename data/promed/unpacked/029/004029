A 44 y.o. woman in Ponchatoula (Tangipahoa Parish) has been diagnosed with
EEE. This is now the second human case; the 47 y.o. man in Assumption Parish
remains in critical comatose condition. A horse in the Ponchatoula area has
also been also confirmed with this disease.
To date the virus has been confirmed in 34 horses but there are "probably
some 40 to 50 more that have been infected" according to Louise MacFarland,
State Epidemiologist. Some died displaying classic signs before blood could
be drawn; unfortunately owners are reluctant to have the heads removed for
virus isolation.
To date, cases have been confirmed in humans, birds, and horses in 15
parishes ... Ascension, Assumption, Calcasieu, East Baton Rouge, Iberville,
Lafourche, Livingston, Pointe Coupee, St Charles, St James, St Landry, St
Mary, Tangipahoa, Terrebonne, and Vermilion parishes. In simpler terms, we
can now assume that the virus is in all Louisiana parishes adjoining and
south of Interstate Highway 10.
