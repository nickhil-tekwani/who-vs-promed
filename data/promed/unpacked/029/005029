Foot and mouth disease [FMD] infections have been confirmed in livestock in China's eastern Jiangsu Province, the Ministry of Agriculture said on Monday [17 Dec 2012]. A total of 12 pigs at a food company in Changzhou City of Jiangsu, which were transported from out of town, showed symptoms associated with FMD, according to the ministry.

The National FMD Reference Laboratory confirmed that the pigs were infected with type O FMD on Monday [17 Dec 2012] after the provincial animal epidemic prevention and control center diagnosed it as a suspected case, it said.

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where a total of 338 pigs have been culled and safely disposed of in order to prevent the disease from spreading, said the ministry.

FMD is a contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic and wild bovids.
