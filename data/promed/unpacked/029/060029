The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has documented a disease outbreak in the Devil's Canyon bighorn sheep herd northeast of Lovell.

"Since 14 Oct 2022, Game and Fish has documented 37 bighorn sheep mortalities in the Devil's Canyon herd, which constitutes approximately 10 percent of the population," said Corey Class, wildlife management coordinator for the Cody Region. "The majority of deaths have occurred in ewes and lambs."

Game and Fish was first alerted of the die-off by a report from a landowner and a mortality signal from a GPS collared bighorn sheep in the herd.

"We have been working closely with a local landowner who has been key to managing and monitoring this disease outbreak," Class said. "We greatly appreciate their assistance and cooperation."

On 16 Oct 2022, Game and Fish collected biological samples including nasal and tonsil swabs and tissue from bighorn sheep carcasses at the site.

The samples were sent to the Game and Fish Wildlife Health Laboratory in Laramie for analysis where a pathogenic strain of the bacteria _Mannheimia haemolytica_ was cultured. This strain type is known to cause lethal pneumonia in sheep. The source of the infection is unknown.

Game and Fish is actively monitoring the population and any potential spread of pneumonia. Currently, 24 bighorn sheep in this herd are fitted with GPS tracking collars to monitor distribution, habitat use, seasonal movement, annual recruitment, and survival rates.

"The collars will now help us monitor bighorn sheep populations from a disease perspective and document additional mortalities," Class said.

All bighorn sheep carcasses are being disposed of to decrease the spread of the disease.

"Our limited experience with this pathogen gives us some hope the outbreak will run its course quickly, with minimal mortalities," said Hank Edwards, Wildlife Health Laboratory supervisor.

The Devil's Canyon bighorn sheep herd (Hunt Area 12) is located in the northwest portion of the Bighorn Mountains. This population is estimated at 250-300 individuals.

[Bighorn sheep have experienced die-off episodes for several years. Most mortalities have been caused by bighorn sheep pneumonia, which is mainly caused by _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ (Movi), an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids.

Although Movi infection does not always directly cause significant respiratory disease in domestic animals, it may predispose individuals to more serious illness. This is often caused by concurrent infections of Movi and other equally difficult-to-spell bacterial flora, such as _Mannheimia haemolytica_ and _Pasteurella multocida_, species that naturally occur in the upper respiratory tracts of sheep and goats.

The agent that caused this die-off, _Mannhemia(=Pasteurella_) haemolytica_, is an opportunistic bacterium that does not affect whole populations unless some predisposing conditions are prevailing. The underlying predisposing factor in this episode does not seem to be identified.
