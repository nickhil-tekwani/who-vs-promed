Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 23 April 2007
Date of confirmation of event: 9 May 2007
Date submitted to OIE: 09 May 2007
Reason for notification: change in epidemiology
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
Nature of diagnosis
Report pertains to: entire country
New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Laosi, Yuncheng, Guangdong
Date of start of outbreak: 23 April 2007
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not submitted)
Epidemiological unit: village
Species: swine
Susceptible 2981

Slaughtered 0
Affected population: fattening pigs reared in backyards and small-scale
farms.
Outbreak statistics
Species: swine
Apparent morbidity rate: 55 per cent
Apparent mortality rate: 11 per cent
Apparent case fatality rate: 20 per cent
Proportion susceptible removed*: 23 per cent

[This report officially confirms information kindly sent in previously by
Richard Knox of NPR; see Undiagnosed disease, porcine - China (04)
20070509.1492.
The comments contained in this report indicate that this disease is the
same one that was referred to as "Pig High Fever Disease" last year [2006]
which oddly included PRRS as one of 3 possible causes in the official OIE
report. The other 2 agents in a "mixed" infectious etiology included
classical swine fever and porcine circovirus.
It appears as if this year's diagnosis is more definitive citing a highly
pathogenic form of PRRS as the definitive cause as diagnosed by PCR and
virus isolation. While progress is evidenced by a definitive diagnosis this
year, more details on the outbreak (both this year and last) would be
valuable. It would be particularly useful to obtain good, standard outbreak
investigation information which would tell how many farms, what provinces,
morbidity and mortality rates etc. Previous news media reports this month
indicate distribution in Sichuan, Henan provinces which are quite some
distance from Guangdong province see - Undiagnosed disease, porcine - China
