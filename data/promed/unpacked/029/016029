African swine fever has been found in a wild boar in Italy's capital Rome, reported Reuters, citing a statement from the regional government on Thursday [5 May 2022].

An isolated outbreak of the deadly hog disease was reported in northwest Italy at the start of the year [2022] and the Rome case was the 1st time the illness had been detected in the centre of the country.

Several thousand boars are believed to live in and around Rome, foraging for food in often overflowing rubbish bins. Officials carried out tests after a dead boar was discovered in the north of the city, and found it had swine fever.

African swine fever is harmless to humans but often fatal to pigs, leading to financial losses for farmers. It originated in Africa before spreading to Europe and Asia and has killed hundreds of millions of pigs worldwide.

China suspended pork imports from Italy in January [2022] after the illness was detected in a wild boar in the Piedmont region.

The Italian government subsequently appointed a special commissioner to coordinate measures aimed at eliminating the disease.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. ASF is believed to have evolved in a sylvatic cycle that occurs in eastern and southern Africa between common warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) and argasid ticks of the _Ornithodoros moubata_ complex that share their burrows. But the tick is not necessary for the ASF virus transmission. Pigs in the acute stage of infection develop high viremia and shed large amounts of virus in various secretions and excretions. The virus can tolerate a wide range of temperature and pH. Pigs can become infected through direct contact with infected pigs or materials contaminated by infected pigs and eating uncooked meat products derived from infected pigs, as well as when infected _Ornithodoros_ ticks feed on them.

Although ASF is harmless to humans, ongoing transmission among wild boars and lapses in biosecurity measures favor the spread of the disease.

The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. Further west or eastward spread could adversely affect the pig sector in many countries. - Mod.PMB
