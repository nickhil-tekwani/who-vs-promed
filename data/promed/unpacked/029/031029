Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Associated with Cadaveric Dura Mater Grafts -
Japan: January, 1979-May, 1996
In 1997, a nongovernmental surveillance group for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in Japan reported to the Ministry of Health and Welfare its analysis
of a 1996 mail questionnaire survey of neurological, psychiatric, and
neuropathologic institutions throughout Japan. This analysis identified 829
patients with CJD diagnosed by physicians during January, 1979-May, 1996,
including a large number (43 patients) who had received a cadaveric dura
mater graft during a neurosurgical (42) or orthopedic (one) procedure
during 1979--1991. This report presents a summary of features of these 43
cases, which indicated that at least 41 of these patients had received dura
mater grafts from the same processor, and describes CJD in the most recent
recipient of a dura mater graft. The findings indicate that an
international outbreak of CJD
associated with a single brand of dura mater grafts is larger than
previously recognized and that recipients of contaminated grafts may remain
at risk for CJD at least 16 years following receipt of grafts.
