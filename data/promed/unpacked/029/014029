Pig disease virus detected in India for first time
-------------------------------------------
For the first time in Mizoram and perhaps in the country,
virus of a pandemic disease which causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs has been detected in the samples of sick swines sent to laboratories for testing. The samples of the sick swines were tested at the laboratories in the Veterinary College in Selesih, Mizoram and at ICAR Research Complex, Borapani in Meghalaya which detected the presence of 'artevirus', the virus that carries the disease Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRSS), Director of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Dr LB Sailo said.

The PRRS has never been detected earlier in the state and the country but was prevalent in some Asian countries including neighbouring Myanmar with which the state shares 404-km-long border, he said. Sailo added that tackling the full blown
pandemic PRRS would be extremely tough as the vaccine was yet to be
manufactured in India. The samples were sent to the laboratories following the death of hundreds of swines in Mizoram during the past few months, state AH and Veterinary department officials said.

Following the detection of the PRRS virus, the current ban on import of pigs from Myanmar would be in place for a longer time in the state, Sailo said. District Magistrates Mizoram's districts adjoining Myanmar had issued prohibitory orders banning import of pigs in May last.
