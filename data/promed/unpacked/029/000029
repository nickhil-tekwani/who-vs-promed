An outbreak of chikungunya [virus] was reported in April [2010] in
south-eastern Gabon, which has also recorded cases of dengue fever,
which caused no deaths, officials said Friday [28 May 2010], at the
Centre International de Recherches Medical (CIRMF).

The 1st cases of chikungunya emerged early April [2010] in the region
of Ogooue-Lolo and late April in the Haut-Ogooue, Franceville, which
is the county seat, said Dr. Eric Leroy, a researcher at CIRFM where
samples were analyzed at the request of health authorities.

He said out of 608 total samples studied in 3 weeks (3-23 May[2010])
for the area of Franceville only, the researchers found 298 cases of
chikungunya and 82 cases of dengue fever, 2 diseases of viruses are
transmitted by mosquitoes.

In a report on the situation of both diseases in Franceville, CIRMF
believes that "the epidemic of chikungunya is coming to an end, in 3-4
weeks."

Among the positive cases 15 were "doubly infected with both viruses
which is exceptional. Their lives were not endangered but their
condition required hospitalization," Dr Leroy said.

"Only 7 cases were found in 2007 when the epidemic hit Libreville." In
Franceville the epidemic of chikungunya affects other localities of
Upper Ogooue (Moanda, Mounana, Okondja) and Ogooue-Lolo (Koulamoutou
Lastourville) but no statistics will be released until Friday [29 May
2010] to determine the magnitude (of the epidemics) in the absence of
"systematic sampling."

"As of today, there have been no deaths. [...] The trend is
stabilizing or even declining," assured his [Dr Eric Leroy's] aide
Norbert Mouyabi, Head of Communication CIRMF.

A person with chikungunya [virus infection] has the same symptoms as
the flu: fever over 38 degrees, muscle aches, joint pain, haemorrhage
or headache.

[This is an interesting mixed chikungunya/dengue virus outbreak. Both
viruses are likely transmitted by the same _Aedes_ mosquito, but it
would be of interest to have the identity of the mosquito vector(s)
confirmed.

In the 19 May 2010 ProMED post (archive no. 20070523.1654) Dr. Andreas
Krueger reported that the potential chikungunya virus vector is _Aedes
albopictus_ in Libreville (together with _Ae. aegypti ssp. formosus_).
This was the 1st report of the detection of _Ae. albopictus_ in Gabon.
