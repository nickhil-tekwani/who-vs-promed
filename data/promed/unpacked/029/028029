On 6 Jun [2022], the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reported 2 horses in Osceola County, Florida, have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

A 2-year-old Quarter Horse stallion started showing clinical signs on 24 May [2022], presenting with a fever, weakness of the hind limbs, and an inability to stand. He was undervaccinated and has been euthanized.

Additionally, a 10-year-old Miniature Horse presented with apprehension, depression, muscle-twitching, incoordination, weakness of the hind limbs, aimless wandering, and head pressing. He was also undervaccinated and has been euthanized.

These are the 3rd and 4th cases of EEE in Florida in 2022.

EEE 101
Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include the following:
- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the US. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2022] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses), available at hardware stores.

In a follow-up on the eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) situation in Florida this year [2022], the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has reported 3 additional cases in Orange (1) and Osceola counties (2), bringing the state total to 4.

No human EEE cases have been reported to date [7 Jun 2022] in Florida.

In horses, the virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General signs include central nervous system signs such as head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 deg F [39.4 deg C], ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression, and stupor. Other signs may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, in-coordination, circling, and staggering. All signs may not be exhibited by an infected horse.

The mortality rate in horses from EEE is almost 90%.

In humans, symptoms of EEE disease often appear 4-10 days after someone is bitten by an infected mosquito.

EEE is a more serious disease than West Nile virus (WNV) [in people - Mod.TG] and carries a high mortality rate for those who contract the serious encephalitis form of the illness. Symptoms may include high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, and sore throat. There is no specific treatment for the disease, which can lead to seizures and coma. [These almost seem to be a summary of the previous cases. But there is additional information not included in some of the other reports. - Mod.TG]

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reported the confirmation of an eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a one-year-old colt in Levy County.

On 16 Jun [2022], the unvaccinated horse presented with seizure-like activity on the owners' property, then became laterally recumbent with dull mentation and nystagmus.

EEE was confirmed on 23 Jun [2022], and the horse was euthanized.

This is the 5th confirmed case of EEE for Florida in 2022.

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is spread to horses and humans by infected mosquitoes, including several _Culex_ species and _Culiseta melanura_.

In horses, the virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General signs include central nervous system signs such as head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 deg F [39.4 deg C], ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression, and stupor. Other signs may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, in-coordination, circling, and staggering. All signs may not be exhibited by an infected horse.

The mortality rate in horses from EEE is almost 90%.

[Clearly it is mosquito season, especially in coastal areas. The EEE immunity wanes fairly fast in the horse. Consequently, revaccination is necessary approximately every 3-4 months. Even if you have vaccinated your equine friend, it may be time to do it again to keep the animal fully protected from this disease.

Please check with your veterinarian regarding when you gave vaccination last, or if in doubt, please vaccinate. EEE is preventable with safe, proven vaccines. - Mod.TG
