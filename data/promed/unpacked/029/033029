[These overseas briefs contain reports of disease outbreaks in
countries other than Australia. Reports are derived from a number of
sources including the World Health Organization website and
ProMED-mail. The following report concerns the period 1 Apr to 30 Jun 2007.

This report contains information supplementing that provided
previously in ProMED-mail in the form of a Request for Information
(see: "Undiagnosed deaths, encephalitis - Bangladesh (Kushtia)(02):
Nipah, RFI 20070423.1330"). Although the information relates to an
outbreak earlier in 2007, it provides official confirmation of the
diagnosis of Nipah virus infection. - Mod.CP]

In early April 2007, 6 fatal cases of acute neurological syndrome
were reported from the Kushtia region of western Bangladesh. Three of
the 6 cases tested positive for Nipah virus at the Institute of
Epidemiological Disease Control and Research in Dhaka. The
International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research identified a
further 12 probable cases during the outbreaks, including 5 deaths
that occurred between 21 Jan and 4 Apr 2007. Seven of these probable
cases were from the Thakurgaon region in northern Bangladesh.

In mid-April 2007, an outbreak of Nipah was reported from the Nadia
district of West Bengal (neighbouring the Kushtia region) with
approximately 50 suspected cases, including 3 deaths, between
February and mid-May 2007. Only the 3 fatal cases (all members of one
family) were confirmed by the National Institute of Virology in Pune.
Some media sources reported a further 2 fatal cases (one was a
relative of the earlier 3 fatal cases and one was a healthcare
worker), but there is doubt as to whether the deaths were due to
Nipah virus infection or other causes of encephalitis.

Outbreaks of Nipah in south Asia have a strong seasonal pattern and a
limited geographical range. In 2005, there were 12 human cases
(including 11 fatal) reported from the Tangail district of
Bangladesh, most of them related to the consumption of fresh date
palm juice contaminated by infected bats (thought to be the natural
reservoir of the virus). However, in an outbreak between February and
April 2004 with 36 cases (CFR 75 percent) in the Faridpur district,
there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in some of the
cases. In particular, 2 of the fatal cases acquired the disease after
having casual contact with a relative who was dying of the infection.
The 2004 outbreak was also unique in that 6 of the cases developed
acute respiratory distress syndrome rather than the neurological
symptoms usually observed in Nipah virus cases.

Health authorities were investigating a number of possible sources
for the 2007 outbreaks. The probable index case in the Nadia outbreak
visited the Kushtia region of Bangladesh in February 2007 and
developed a fever within days of his return. The wife of one of the 3
fatal cases in Nadia said that bats (which could be carrying the
virus) are common in her village and even enter homes.

involvement of Nipah virus infection in these episodes of disease in
Bangladesh, this thread is now cut.
