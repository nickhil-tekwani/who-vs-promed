It was my understanding that many serologic samples from the south PRC
[People's Republic of China] were negative for the virus after the first
case, i.e., about 1500 samples were taken. This information was shared
informally at the APEC meetings in Singapore in the fall. I am under the
impression that very serious and thorough surveillance is underway.

All Hong Kong's estimated 1.2 million chickens are to be slaughtered in a
radical attempt to rid the SAR of the deadly bird flu virus that has killed
four people. Poultry in retail markets - including geese and ducks kept
near chickens - will also be destroyed in the massive 24-hour operation
beginning today. Government officials announced the move, sanctioned by
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, after a New Territories farm and part of a
Kowloon wholesale market were found to be infected with [influenzavirus A
H5N1].
Compensation for farmers may top $40 million and 2,200 government workers
will be needed to arrange the slaughter. Teams of five Agriculture and
Fisheries Department staff will visit each of Hong Kong's 160 chicken farms
and 39 mixed poultry farms. They will place groups of chickens into plastic
containers and then gas them to death with carbon dioxide. The operation is
expected to start at about 1pm. Commercial farms will be the first target,
but small flocks raised for family use will also be destroyed. "No matter
how remote they are, they will all be covered in this exercise," said
Secretary for Economic Services Stephen Ip Shu-kwan. The 1,000 Urban and
Regional Services market poultry stalls will be advised to kill all ducks,
geese, pigeons and quail. "Cross infection could not be ruled out," said Mr
Ip. After the slaughter, the carcasses will be disinfected, put into
plastic bags and taken to one of Hong Kong's eight landfills for disposal.
The Environmental Protection Department expects to deal with about 6,500
cubic metres of waste generated by the blitz.

morning and should, by now, be completed. It is not a good time to be a
bird in Hong Kong. -- Mod CHC]
