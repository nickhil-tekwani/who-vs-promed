While health authorities have yet to identify the cause of the mysterious skin disease in central Quang Ngai Province, 2 more people died in Ba To District in the past 3 days, taking the death toll to 23 so far.

A 34-year-old woman in Reu Hamlet, Ba Dien Commune, died at 10 am on 30 May 2012 at the provincial General Hospital while 9-year-old boy died on 28 May 2012 in the same hamlet. Luong Ngoc Khue, head of the Health Ministry's Department of Medical Examination and Treatment, said the hair samples taken from the boy contained arsenic at a level 100 times higher than the country's acceptable limit.

The disease has so far spread to 5 communes in Ba To district, including Ba Dien, Ba Ngac, Ba Xa, Ba Vinh and Ba To, of which Ba Dien is leading with the most cases.

The mysterious skin disease that 1st occurred in the district on 19 Apr 2011 is characterized by thickened skin (keratosis) over the palms and soles, causing stiffness in the limbs and ulcers on victims' hands and feet that look like burns.

There has been no disease in the world so far that is exactly identical to the strange syndrome in Quang Ngai, Health Deputy Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said at recent conference. Most of the patients have elevated liver enzymes, but they do not suffer from infectious diseases since no symptoms of infection have been found, according to the results of patient blood tests made by Japan's Nagasaki University, he said.

Health workers have found more than 200 species of insects, including mites, ticks and fleas, in disease-impacted areas, but no evidence has been found to link them with the disease.

According to some scientific councils, the strange syndrome might be caused by toxic substances that affect malnourished people with low immunity.

[The news article above concerns an outbreak in several villages in the Bo To district of Quang Ngai province, Viet Nam, on which ProMED-mail has previously reported. Those affected are reported to have developed an acute febrile illness with loss of appetite and respiratory symptoms followed by a rash on the hands and feet described as "palmoplantar keratoderma," (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1108406-overview#aw2aab6b) accompanied by liver dysfunction and, in some patients, by multi-organ failure and death. Ulcers on the hands, feet, mouth, back, and abdomen, eye disease, stiffness of the limbs, and miscarriage are also described. Mainly children and young adults have been affected.

The disease is said to have started in April 2011, subsided somewhat between November 2011 and February 2012, and picked up pace again in March and April 2012. The numbers of patients affected vary in the news reports, but may be as high as a total of 150 in 2011 and a total of 179. The death toll in 2012 was previously reported to be 27, but the news report above says that number is 23.

Early "treatment" is said to effective, but exactly what this treatment consists of has not been specified. However, some patients are said to relapse after an initial response to therapy. Pictures of the rash on the hands and feet of the affected Vietnamese villagers are available at http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Health/2012/4/100698 and http://www.eyedrd.org/2012/04/breakout-of-unknown-skin-disease-has-claimed-27-lives-in-central-vietnam.html.

The current news report above says that the hair samples taken from a 9-year-old boy who died contained arsenic at a level 100 times higher than the country's acceptable limit. Arsenic exposure can lead to skin pigment changes and multiple, irregular, warty keratotic lesions on the palms and soles, alone or in combination with nodules usually symmetrically distributed. These skin lesions typically occur after chronic arsenic ingestion, as mentioned in the ProMED-mail moderator's comments in Undiagnosed illness - Viet Nam (03): (QG) RFI Archive Number: 20120423.1110507.

Chronic arsenic toxicity also produces varied systemic manifestations, such as chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis), liver disease (e.g., non cirrhotic portal fibrosis) and other diseases (e.g., polyneuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension and ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, non-pitting edema of feet/ hands, weakness and anemia), as well as cancer of skin and different internal organs (e.g., lung and urinary bladder). Pictures of the skin lesions of chronic arsenic toxicity can be seen at http://icmr.nic.in/ijmr/2008/october/1007.pdf. Elevated concentration of arsenic in hair (> 1 mg/kg of hair) or in nail clippings (> 1.5 mg/kg of nail) serves as presumptive evidence of elevated arsenic exposure within the preceding nine months (WHO, A field guide for detection, management and surveillance of arsenicosis cases. Caussy D, editor. Technical Publication No 30. New Delhi: WHO, SEARO; 2005. p. 5- 18. Available at http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Publications_seaTP30.pdf).

Humans are exposed to arsenic primarily from air, food and water. Drinking water may be contaminated with arsenic from arsenical pesticide, natural mineral deposits or improperly disposed arsenical chemicals. However, elevated arsenic level in drinking water is the major cause of arsenic toxicity in the world.

Quang Ngai is a Vietnamese province located in the South Central Coastal region along the South China Sea, 883 km (549 miles) south of Hanoi and 838 km (521 miles) north of Ho Chi Minh City (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quang_Ngai_province). The province has a large plain along the coast and in the center of the province and has mountains and hills in the west. Ba To is a rural district of Quang Ngai province with a population of 47 268 in 2003 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_To_District).
