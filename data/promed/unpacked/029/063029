After the notification of a positive case of rabies in a bovine in 1 of its districts, the Health Surveillance of the Municipality of Patos de Minas, in Alto Paranaíba, was mobilized to vaccinate dogs and cats in the region where the sick animal was found. The information was released by the municipality on Tuesday [22 Feb 2022]. In December of last year [2021], the City Hall also carried out the vaccine blockade in the region of Moreeiras, for the same reason.

The cattle testing positive for rabies was located in the community of Basilio, in the district of Areado, which is about 40 km [25 mi] from the city. The mobilization, which is called anti-rabies blockade, involved domestic animals within a 5 km [3 mi] radius of the place.

In all, 326 dogs and 111 cats were vaccinated. Part of them already received the vaccine in 2021, but were revaccinated according to the guidance of the competent state bodies. The city took the opportunity to guide the population on the importance of immunizing animals and ways of transmitting and preventing the disease.

"It is important to highlight that the vaccination of cattle and horses against rabies has become mandatory, on behalf of the owner of the animals, although the declaration to the Mineiro de Agropecuária Institute (IMA) is not mandatory. Anyway, this will help a lot to avoid occurrences like this", explains the director of Health Surveillance in the city, Lílian Marinho.

The professional also says the vaccination blockade of dogs and cats is a way to eliminate one of the cycles of transmission of the disease, since, if an animal was detected with rabies, it is because there are bats infected with the virus in the region and that could infect other mammals.

According to the Patos de Minas City Hall, rabies is transmitted by bats feeding on blood, the so-called hematophagous bats. [This is likely the species more commonly known as the vampire bat. - Mod.TG]

With the virus present in saliva, it transmits the disease by sucking or licking blood from mammals, such as horses, cattle, dogs and cats. Therefore, domestic animals are the main transmission agents for humans. [If this is the vampire bat, it most likely makes a tiny razor-like cut in the skin and then licks the blood from the wound. These bats are known to feed on cattle and horses, especially at night. - Mod.TG]

"Rabies is a serious disease, with a lethality rate close to 100%. For more information, contact the Zoonosis Control Center by phone at (34) 3822-9624 (7am to 6pm)", concludes the municipality.

Two boys who possibly handled a rabies-infected bat in Corona could suffer health complications, prompting Riverside County officials Wednesday [2 Mar 2022] to urge their parents to have the children tested.

The youths, described only as 11- to 12-year-olds on bicycles, may have picked up the rabid bat Monday afternoon [28 Feb 2022] before it died, according to the Department of Public Health.

Health officials said a man who later retrieved the creature and turned it over to health officials said he spotted the youths, who appeared to touch the bat. It was lying in the parking area of an industrial park at 301 Lincoln Ave., officials said.

"It is important these children be seen by a health care provider because of the potential for a serious health issue," county Public Health Officer Dr. Geoffrey Leung said.

The bat was confirmed to have been a carrier of rabies following tests at a county lab, he said.

Rabies impacts the central nervous system and is transmitted through saliva of a wild animal. Humans can be exposed if they're bitten, or if the saliva otherwise enters a break in a person's skin, according to the California Department of Public Health.

A rabies vaccine is available, but if it is not administered in time, "there is no effective treatment, and the infected person will likely die within a few days," CDPH said.

Anyone with concerns about exposure risks was encouraged to contact the county health department at 951-358-5107.

[3] USA: Florida (Polk County) bat, dog

Animal Control officials have confirmed the 1st case of rabies this year [2022] in Polk County.

Officials said a bat had tested positive for the deadly virus on [3 Mar 2022].

According to the Polk County Sheriff's Office Animal Control Section, a family dog in the Lake Mirror area of Winter Haven was found with a live bat in its mouth on [1 Mar 2022].

The family contacted Animal Control which then sent the bat to a Tampa lab for testing.

Officials say the dog was current on its rabies vaccination, but will still need to be quarantined to make sure it is not infected. [Although the dog is current on its rabies vaccination, it is recommended by the rabies compendium to revaccinate immediately and then placed under a 45-day quarantine, instead of a 4-month quarantine. The compendium implies this quarantine may be a home quarantine provided certain qualifications are met. - Mod.TG]

Polk County had 5 confirmed cases of rabies in 2021, and 2 in 2020.

Officials warn residents if a wild mammal is acting aggressive or appears sick to stay away and contact Animal Control immediately.

[4] USA: Florida (Hillsborough County) cat, human exposure

The Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County has issued a rabies alert for the area surrounding East Bank Drive in the northeast Tampa area after a cat tested positive for rabies Monday [7 Mar 2022].

The cat was a black domestic short-haired stray cat. One person was confirmed to have been exposed and has begun rabies post-exposure vaccinations.

This rabies alert is for 60 days and includes the area bounded by Puritan Road on the north, 56th Street to the east, East Sligh Avenue to the south and the Hillsborough River to the west.

This is the 2nd rabies alert the health department issued in Hillsborough County Tuesday [8 Mar 2022].

The county also issued an alert for Glen Harwell Road in Plant City after a white and gray stray cat tested positive for rabies. Two people were confirmed exposed and have begun post-rabies vaccinations.

This alert is for 60 days as well and includes the area bordered by Interstate 4 to the north, Branch Forbes Road to the east, U.S. 92 to the south and Bethlehem Road to the west.

Anyone who has been bitten, scratched or exposed to the saliva of these cats is asked to report the exposure to DOH-Hillsborough at 813-307-8059.

The Department of Health (DOH) is reminding residents to stay away from wild animals and make sure all their pets are vaccinated and do not roam free.

Rabies is a disease of the nervous system and is fatal to warm-blooded animals and humans. The only treatment for human exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies immunizations [Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP].

People who have been bitten or scratched by wild or domestic animals should seek medical attention right away.

[In the 1st article from Brazil, the bat in question is most likely what is commonly known as the vampire bat. It is known for feeding on cattle and a host of other animals. There are 3 species of hematophagous bats in the Neotropical region, one of which -- _Desmodus rotundus_ -- is a well-known reservoir of rabies. This species feeds on a wide range of hosts, including humans, although it will preferentially feed on large livestock such as cattle and horses. For a picture of _D. rotundus_ go to https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41168-Desmodus-rotundus/browse_photos.

Rabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system of its victim, regardless of whether it is a human victim or an animal victim. This virus has no mercy and without treatment, its victim will die.

While we recognize rabies prevention in the form of rabies vaccination for our animals, and for some high risk human beings, such as veterinarians and persons involved in animal control, it is not a wide spread practice to vaccinate human beings against rabies. Therefore, when an individual is exposed to this lethal virus, post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) must be administered. This is a series of human immunoglobulin and PEP to prevent rabies in human beings but it must be started very soon after the exposure. In the case of bats in a room where an individual was sleeping, PEP is recommended as bats can bite a sleeping individual and not awaken them.

If you have pets, including horses and other farm animals, it is the wise, prudent move to vaccinate them against rabies. It protects your pets and yourself. Even if you do not know if there has been exposure to your animal, you are more likely to be protected. - Mod.TG
