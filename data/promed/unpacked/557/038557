A month-long joint study by the Directorate of Health Services and a private institute finally made a breakthrough, declaring that the mystery illness was caused by tick bites, but the report which was in the possession of the directorate for the last 3 days, was kept under wraps.

Herald had broken the story on Tuesday [14 Apr 2015] over the silence of directorate on the mysterious deaths reported at Pali and the fear prevailing among villagers over inaction by the directorate.

State Epidemiologist Dr Utkarsha Betodkar on Monday [13 Apr 2015] informed Herald that the common detection found in all the samples is of KFD [Kyasanur Forest Disease], which is a tickborne disease. "You cannot eliminate this disease but it can be controlled; tick bite control measures should be taken in the area of Pali," Dr Betodkar recommended.

Directorate of Health Services will be conducting an awareness campaign in Pali village to take preventive measures from tick bites. Dr Betodkar said that the people should wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants to prevent tick bites. The people should also check for ticks once they come from outdoors and remove them. He advised that if somebody is ill, he/she should not go to the forest, and instead go to the nearby hospital immediately.

KFD [virus] infected people have very common symptoms of fever with vomiting, frontal headache, diarrhoea, followed by haemorrhagic symptoms such as bleeding from the nasal cavity, throat and gums as well as gastrointestinal bleeding.

The Valpoi community health centre and Goa Medical College have been informed by the DHS regarding the outbreak of KFD in Pali village and informed them to treat patients who come from that particular area accordingly. "We have also informed the National Health and Family Welfare department, Government of India and National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi. They may visit Goa shortly, as it is a rare disease," Dr Betodkar said.

When contacted Dr Pradeep Naik, Dean of GMC, said that he will have to check with the professor of medicine whether GMC has treatment facilities for KFD-infected patients. He also said that vaccines for KFD are not available with GMC as it is a rare disease. According to medical experts the vaccine should be requested from NIB (National Institute of Biologicals) Pune.

A 38-year-old man from the Ezhupathimoonnu Kattunayakka tribal hamlet at Cheeyambam in the district died of Kyasanur forest disease (KFD or monkey fever) at a private medical college hospital at noon on Mon [13 Apr 2015].

The man, a temporary forest watcher, was admitted to hospital nearly 3 weeks ago in a critical condition with repeated symptoms of KFD.

His condition had improved slightly in the past 2 days but he died of complications from KFD, P.V. Sasidharan, District Medical Officer in-charge, told The Hindu.

As news of the death spread, hundreds of villagers staged a road blockade. Traffic was disrupted for nearly 2 hours after the villagers placed his body in an ambulance on the Sulthan Bathery-Pulpally highway at Cheeyamam.

They demanded sufficient compensation and a job for a member of the family of the deceased, increase in financial assistance to KFD patients from INR 10 000 to 25 000 [USD 160 - 401], and expediting of measures to disburse financial aid to all KFD patients.

Later, Sulthan Bathery Tribal Development Officer A. Moosa held talks with the villagers and handed over a cheque of INR 200 000 [USD 3209] as solatium to the kin of the deceased. He also agreed to take up their demand with the government.

This is the 9th monkey fever death case being reported from the district in the past couple of months, Dr. Sasidharan said.

As many as 165 suspected KFD cases have been reported in the district since 16 Jan [2015]. Of these 69 were positive, he said.

As many as 5 patients were under treatment in various hospitals in the district.

A tribal activist said though the government had announced financial assistance of INR 10 000 [USD 160] each to KFD patients, the Scheduled Tribe Development Department had disbursed the assistance to only 35 patients.

Though the Health Department had provided the list of the remaining patients a few days ago, no steps had been taken yet to disburse the aid.

[KFD virus is actively transmitted this year (2015) and appears to be spreading to new localities. This is the 1st report of KFD in Goa that has come to ProMED. Karnataka and Kerala states are endemic for KFD virus, which is being actively transmitted this season. Goa is adjacent to Karnataka state, so appearance of the disease there is not surprising. Many cases have occurred in Kerala in 2015 as well.

KFD can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week, as apparently was the situation with the above case in Kerala. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case-fatality rate is from 3 to 5 percent. http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html.

Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. "Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family."

Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
