The King County Health Dept. announced on Friday afternoon [6 Jul 2018] that it had closed 2 Redmond restaurants: I Love Sushi and Sodexo's Cafe Mario, both located at Nintendo of America at 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA. The eateries were "Closed by a Public Health food inspector on 5 Jul 2018 at 5:30 pm due to the imminent health hazard of an ongoing suspected foodborne illness investigation," said a news release from the health dept.

The health department, in a posting on its web page, said that since 2 Jul 2018: "We have learned that 4 people (2 King and 2 Snohomish County residents) have tested positive for enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). All 4 consumed food from Cafe Mario in King County and work at the Nintendo of America campus in Redmond. Symptoms included abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. Illness onsets occurred during 25-28 Jun 2018. The 4 ill people consumed food from Cafe Mario on multiple days during 18-22 Jun 2018; one ill person also ate at I Love Sushi on 19 and 26 Jun 2018, which is a food establishment that operates out of Cafe Mario once a week."

On 3 Jul 2018, Seattle and King County Environmental Health investigators visited Cafe Mario. Inspections were completed for both Cafe Mario and I Love Sushi. "At Cafe Mario, potential risk factors were identified, and corrective actions were discussed with Cafe Mario's management, including inadequate hand washing practices and improper cold holding temperatures of food," said the statement. "At I Love Sushi, potential risk factors were also identified and discussed, including improper temperature storage of foods. Both restaurants were not open on 4 Jul 2018 due to it being a holiday."

On 5 Jul 2018, investigators closed Cafe Mario and the onsite I Love Sushi food services. Both restaurants will remain closed until approved to reopen by Public Health. Both food establishments will be required to complete a thorough cleaning and disinfection before reopening. Remaining food products are being held, and environmental swabs were collected for laboratory testing.

"We are currently investigating whether any employees of these restaurants had a recent diarrheal illness. Investigators also reviewed with Cafe Mario's management the Washington State Retail Food Code requirement that staff are not allowed to work while having vomiting or diarrhea," said the Health Dept. statement.

Three of the 4 people who got sick tested positive for EHEC by a healthcare provider. Further testing at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory is pending, including determining the genetic fingerprint and specific strain of EHEC that caused the illnesses. The health dept. says the investigation is ongoing and that it will provide more information as it becomes available.

[Given the epidemiological link between the 4 cases, the genetic fingerprints of each strain are likely to be identical. The posting does not identify the serotype of the isolates, O157 or otherwise. ProMED awaits more information regarding the food vehicle, whether there are more primary or any secondary cases and whether hemolytic uremic syndrome intervened in any case. - Mod.LL
