A rare superbug detected in a slaughterhouse in Sheung Shui [an area in New Territories, Hong Kong] has never before been found among livestock in Hong Kong or Asia, a University of Hong Kong study has confirmed.

The microbiologist who led the study told the South China Morning Post it had raised concerns that pig farmers in Hong Kong or on the mainland were misusing antibiotics to treat their animals, leading to the development of such drug-resistant superbugs. "It indicates that there may have been widespread use by some farmers of antibiotics to keep their pigs healthy," Ho Pak-leung said. "This is one explanation as to why [the Sheung Shui] pork contains the drug-resistant bug."

Humans can catch the superbug through eating uncooked pork or coming into contact with infected livestock, Ho said. But the risk of Hongkongers becoming infected remains low as long as they only consume pork that has been thoroughly cooked, he said.

The superbug, vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ (VRE), was detected in one of 137 batches of pork samples collected in January [2013] at a slaughterhouse in Sheung Shui. Genetic analysis confirmed the bug to be of the sequence type ST6, never before detected in any animal bred for consumption in Asia. Another strain of VRE, ST414, is more common in Hong Kong and causes several deaths a year during hospital outbreaks, Ho said.

VRE infections tend to occur in already debilitated patients, and usually break out within a contaminated institution, such as a hospital. Mortality rates for VRE infections have been calculated at between 40 and 70 per cent. It can be contracted and carried by a healthy person for years without any symptoms only to attack when the carrier becomes sick or is injured.

The infected pork in Sheung Shui could not be traced because the slaughterhouse gathers animals from both local and mainland farms. Ho said: "The reason for its occurrence is still unknown. We cannot rule out the possibility that there may be a VRE outbreak in some farms."

A paper detailing the study's findings argued that the mainland, which has a problem with bacteria in livestock that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial treatment, should more strictly regulate and monitor the use of antibiotics by farmers there.

[Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that are normal constituents of colonic flora of humans and other animals. They commonly cause both community-acquired and nosocomial infections, which include urinary tract infections, biliary sepsis [a systemic infection related to the bile duct], secondary peritonitis [inflammation of the tissues lining the abdomen], intra-abdominal abscesses, wound infections, bacteremia [presence of bacteria in the blood], and endocarditis [inflammation of the inner layer of the heart]. The most common enterococcal pathogens are _Enterococcus faecalis_ and _Enterococcus faecium_. Enterococci exhibit intrinsic resistance, characteristic of the species, and develop resistance by mutation of chromosomal genes or transfer of resistance genes that are linked to mobile genetic material (i.e., plasmids or transposons) from other bacteria. Antibiotic resistance has undoubtedly allowed enterococci to become very successful nosocomial pathogens.

Vancomycin was once relied on for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant enterococci. However, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become increasingly common worldwide since they were 1st detected in the mid 1980's. Some of these infections, particularly those caused by _E. faecium_, are often difficult to treat since only few antimicrobial treatment options are available.

Avoparcin, a member of the class of antibiotics (glycopeptides) to which vancomycin belongs, has been used in some countries in animal feed as a growth promoter. Because avoparcin confers cross-resistance to vancomycin, the use of avoparcin can select for VRE. VRE, i.e. _E. faecium_ carrying the vanA genotype, was common in the intestinal flora of farm animals in Europe during the 1990s; by contrast, since avoparcin has never been approved in Canada and USA, VRE had until 2008 never been isolated from farm animals in the USA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3426332/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3020891/).

In European countries that used avoparcin, human fecal carriage of VRE in the community is much higher than in European countries and the USA that never used glycopeptides in animal feed for growth promotion. In the USA, VRE has been much more common in hospitals than in the community (http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/43/9/2215?ijkey=b39281409138119765198d167a970a6cc9c0a989; http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/46/1/146).
In China, where glycopeptides, including avoparcin, are banned in animal husbandry, VRE reportedly has been rarely found on farms (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/18/jac.dkt293.extract).

There are several types of vancomycin-resistance, vanA being the most common. VanA strains have high MICs [minimum inhibitory concentrations] to both vancomycin and another related antibiotic, teicoplanin. Although _E. faecalis_ is the more common enterococcal pathogen overall, _E. faecium_ is more common than _E. faecalis_ among VRE. Additionally, _E. faecium_ is inherently more resistant to penicillin than _E. faecalis_, and penicillin-resistance among _E. faecium_ has increased since the late 1980s (Bush LM, Calmon J, Cherney CL, Wendeler M, Pitsakis PG, Poupard J, Levison ME, Johnson CC. High-level Penicillin Resistance Among Isolates of Enterococci. Ann Intern Med ll0:5l5-520, l989. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2923386).

Clonal spread is noted to be common among VRE isolates. Certain genogroups of enterococci in both continents seem to be more capable of causing hospital outbreaks, perhaps because of the presence of a specific virulence factor. Of note, a particular hospital-adapted _E. faecium_ clonal complex 17 (CC17) based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has disseminated globally (Willems RJ, et al: Global spread of vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ from distinct nosocomial genetic complex. Emerg Infect Dis 2005; 11(6): 821-8; available from http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no06/04-1204.htm). In China, including Hong Kong, most of the human isolates have also been reported to be of the CC17 lineage (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/18/jac.dkt293.extract).

In Europe, vancomycin-resistant _E. faecium_ ST6/CC5 is reportedly widely disseminated in swine and colonizes people http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/18/jac.dkt293.extract#.

The news release above refers to a recent report of a study of fecal flora in pigs, cattle and chickens in Hong Kong from 2008 to the present. Vancomycin-resistant _E. faecium_ was 1st detected in pigs in January 2013; no VRE had been recovered from animal samples previously. The strain was vanA, and MLST [multi locus sequence typing] identified the strain as ST6/CC 5 (Ho P-L, et al. Rare occurrence of vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ among livestock animals in China. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2013; doi: 10.1093/jac/dkt293. First published online: 19 Jul 2013. Available at: http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/18/jac.dkt293.extract). The authors imply that finding vancomycin-resistant _E. faecium_ ST6/CC5 in swine indicates illegal usage of banned glycopeptides like avoparcin in animal husbandry in China. - Mod.ML
