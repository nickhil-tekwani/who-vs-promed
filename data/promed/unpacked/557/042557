More than 1000 people have died from cholera in Haiti and 16 800 have
been hospitalized, health officials said Tue 16 Nov 2010, as the
outbreak spreads among earthquake survivors in the capital's tent
cities.

The health ministry death toll of 1034, accurate up to Sun 14 Nov
2010, is 117 higher than the last official toll announced at the
weekend, nearly a month after the disease surfaced in the desperately
poor Caribbean nation.

Authorities also said 16 799 people had received hospital treatment,
some 2150 more than the last update.

Haitian officials and aid workers fear the epidemic could spread
rapidly if it takes hold in Port-au-Prince's makeshift camps where
hundreds of thousands of earthquake refugees live in cramped and
unsanitary conditions.
