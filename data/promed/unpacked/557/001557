Fairfax County Animal Control Officers collected 5 raccoons over the past few weeks in the area of Fort Hunt Road and Namassin Road. One raccoon was tested at the Blue Ridge Wildlife Center, and on Fri 6 Dec 2013, the test result showed that the animal had canine distemper.

Canine distemper is highly contagious and potentially deadly for dogs. According to the ASPCA [American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals], "The 1st signs of canine distemper include sneezing, coughing, and thick mucus coming from the eyes and nose. Fever, lethargy, sudden vomiting and diarrhea, depression, and/or loss of appetite are also symptoms of the virus."

All dog owners in the area are recommended to verify their pets are current on distemper vaccinations. If you see any symptoms of canine distemper, please take your dog to the veterinarian immediately. Also, please be on the lookout for wildlife showing some of the same clinical signs. Canine distemper can affect raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders.

In raccoons, distemper usually results in neurological signs such as stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up-to-date, including both rabies and distemper.
