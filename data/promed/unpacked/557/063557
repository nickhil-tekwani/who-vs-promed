Rapid reporting EU surveillance system for meningococcal meningitis
W135:2a: P1.2, 5 - update
---------------------------
An epidemic of invasive meningococcal disease occurred in pilgrims
returning from the haj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in 2000. The
strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ isolated from these cases was W135: 2a:
P1.2, 5, or compatible with that strain. In September 2000, enhanced
surveillance for W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 or compatible strains was established in
sentinel countries within the European Union surveillance network for
invasive meningococcal disease (1, and references therein). Data is
reported weekly from the 6 participating countries' reference laboratories,
and a similar increase in cases of this strain was detected in association
with haj 2001. This report summarizes all confirmed cases in the period 23
Feb to 31 May 2002, the period following haj 2002.
Cases of W135 reported in the period 23 Feb 2002 to 31 May 2002 inclusive
-----------------------------
Over this 14-week period of surveillance 11 cases of invasive _N.
meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2, 5, or compatible strains, were reported by
the sentinel countries. Of these, 8 cases were in France, 1 in Germany and
2 in the UK. A second case of serogroup W135 has been reported by Germany,
but is awaiting further typing. No cases were reported by Ireland, the
Netherlands, or Spain.
The 8 cases of the haj outbreak strain of _N. meningitidis_ in France
included 3 in March, 2 in April and 3 in May. During March, the first case
was in a 39-year-old woman admitted to hospital with septicemia. N.
_meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 was cultured from a blood sample. The
second was a case of meningitis reported during the week ending 8 March
(week 10) in a 4-year-old boy. _N. meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 was
isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. The third case in March
was in a 70-year-old man who had been admitted to hospital with septicemia.
Phenotype W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 was confirmed from a blood culture. All 3 of
these patients survived, none of them had a known link to the haj, and
multilocus DNA fingerprinting (MLDF) showed markers for the electrophoretic
type-37 (ET-37) complex in each of them.
The cases reported in April by France were in an 82-year-old woman and a
1-year-old boy. The 82-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with
septicemia; W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 was isolated as the infective strain of _N.
meningitidis_. The patient died. MLDF typing did not show markers of the
complex ET-37. The 1-year-old boy was admitted to hospital with meningitis,
and phenotype W135:2a:NT/NT/NT was confirmed from a CSF culture. The boy
survived. Neither had a known link to the haj.
Another 3 cases were reported by France in May. In the first of these, _N.
meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 was confirmed in a 15-month-old girl
admitted to hospital with sepsis and arthritis, who survived. The second
case was in a 14-month-old girl admitted to hospital with osteomyelitis,
who also survived. Phenotype W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 was cultured from a blood
sample. The third case was in a 39-year-old male who died. W135: 2a: P1.2,
5 was isolated in a postmortem CSF sample. No known haj link was present
for any of these 3 cases.
Germany reported 1 case in May in a 9-year-old boy. The child presented
with meningitis, and phenotype W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 was confirmed. A case of
serogroup W135 infection was seen in 2-year-old girl in May, but full
phenotyping results are not yet available. The child was admitted to
hospital with septicemia and Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome. It is not
known if either of these children had links to the haj pilgrimage and their
clinical outcome has yet to be reported.
In the UK, 2 cases were reported between 23 Feb and 31 May 2002. The first
was a case of meningitis was reported in a 5-month-old boy. The infective
strain was confirmed as W135: 2a: P1.2, 5, and the case was a household
contact of a pilgrim to haj 2002. The patient survived. The second case was
in a 23-year-old male who had no known link to the haj. This case was
admitted to hospital with meningitis, and _N. meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2,
5 was confirmed as the infective agent. The patient survived.
Comment
--------
Saudi Arabian authorities stipulated that all pilgrims to the haj 2002
(21-25 February) must be vaccinated with the quadrivalent meningococcal
vaccine (A, C, W135 and Y) before visas were issued to them. As expected,
the number of cases of _N. meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 seen in either
pilgrims or contacts of pilgrims within the 6 sentinel surveillance
countries has reduced markedly from the numbers seen in these groups in
2000 and 2001, when the quadrivalent vaccine was not mandatory.
