Two more horses in Onondaga County have tested positive for eastern
equine encephalitis, the county Health Department announced Friday
[24 Sep 2010] afternoon.

The horses, which were kept on Lamson Road in Lysander, became ill
and died on 17 Sep 2010, officials said.

So far, 3 cases of EEE have been confirmed this year [2010] in the
county, officials said. The 1st horse, which was stabled on Oswego
Road in Lysander, was euthanized on 10 Sep 2010.

An Onondaga County resident infected with the virus died earlier this
month [September 2010], the 4th human EEE death in Central New York since 1971.

County health officials Friday [24 Sep 2010] also announced that no
EEE was found among mosquitoes trapped last week and tested this week.

Although EEE cases are rare, the virus is one of the most serious
mosquito-borne diseases. About 1/3rd of people infected with it die.
Most survivors suffer significant brain damage. There is no specific
treatment for EEE, nor is there a human vaccine.

Symptoms can range from a mild flu-like illness to sudden fever,
muscle pains and a headache that's often followed quickly by seizures
and coma. Symptoms can appear within 5-15 days after the bite of an
infected mosquito. EEE is diagnosed through blood or spinal fluid.

Fresh water swamps like the Cicero Swamp are breeding grounds for
EEE-infected mosquitoes. The county conducted aerial spraying of the
swamp earlier this month [September 2010].

Dr. Cynthia Morrow, county health commissioner, urged people to
continue to remain vigilant and to take measures to reduce exposure
to mosquitoes.

She advised residents to use insect repellent, wear long-sleeve
shirts and long pants outdoors, and refrain from outdoor activity
during prime mosquito feeding times at dawn and dusk.

[Although this article states that EEE cases are rare, clearly that
is in humans. This year [2010] has seen many equines affected with
this mosquito-borne disease. Mosquitoes transmit the disease to
horses and to people. Horses cannot transmit the disease to other
horses or to humans.

Horses can be given a preventative vaccine, and owners should
consider a spray or wipe-on product manufactured for the horse to
keep flies and mosquitoes off of the animals.

Human beings are encouraged to use mosquito repellant, avoid the
mosquito-prime times of dusk and dawn, to wear long sleeves when out
at these times, and to clean up any location of standing water that
may be a source of mosquito breeding. - Mod.TG]

[It is noteworthy that earlier this month (September 2010), there was
a human fatality from EEE in Onondaga County NY (see prior
ProMED-mail posting Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (27): (NY)
human 20100905.3188), and late last month (August 2010), there was a
report on an equine case of EEE in neighboring Oswego County NY.
