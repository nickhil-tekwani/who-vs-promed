-----------------------------------------------
To clarify the psittacosis report from Georgia and provide some
additional information: there have been no human cases of psittacosis
in Florida associated with this event that we are aware of.
There have been 2 bird samples and 2 samples collected from cages
positive for _Chlamydophila psittaci_ using PCR [polymerase chain
reaction] testing. Both cage samples and one of the bird samples were
collected at the bird vendor facility mentioned in the report. The
other bird sample (and the 1st positive) was collected from a
clinically normal bird in a pet store as part of their regular
surveillance program. They immediately notified the Florida
Department of Health and issued a stop sale on all birds. All birds
were isolated and put on antibiotic treatment, and store employees
were advised of the symptoms of psittacosis and reminded of store
policy regarding personal protective equipment to use when working
with birds (particularly during cage cleaning).
We believe this event is related to a change in bird husbandry at the
vendor, which has since been corrected. All pet stores and public
health officials in other states that may have received birds during
this time have been alerted and are taking appropriate action. The
vendor is currently under voluntary quarantine and is working with
their veterinarian, Florida Department of Health, and the Florida
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to assure that this
problem is resolved.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Stanek for the follow-up. What was the change
in bird husbandry at the vendor that led to the current situation,
which has now been corrected?
