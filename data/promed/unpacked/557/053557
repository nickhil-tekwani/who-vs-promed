We hear from a reliable source that cases of suspected monkeypox have been
reported in Equateur Province, DR Congo, near the border with the Central
African Republic, with onset in February 2001.
MSF France is reported to be collecting samples for lab testing.
ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving further details.
