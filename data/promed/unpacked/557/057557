One person has died and several others have been hospitalised after an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the Noord-Brabant town of Schijndel. In total, at least 10 people, all aged 60 to 90, have been affected by the outbreak, local officials say.

The source of the outbreak has not yet been established. Research at 2 nursing homes, where some of those who have been affected live, has drawn a blank and officials suggest it may be in the open air. The fountains in the town centre have therefore been switched off.

According to the regional health board, the 10 infections so far are just the tip of the iceberg and new cases are being reported on a daily basis.

Last year [2020], 461 cases of Legionnaires' disease were reported to the Dutch public health institute RIVM. The disease manifests itself as pneumonia and can be deadly for the elderly and people in poor health.

The source of the contamination in most registered cases in the Netherlands is unclear, although likely culprits are jacuzzis and industrial cooling towers. In 1999, 32 people died and more than 200 were infected with Legionnaires' disease after visiting a flower show in Bovenkarspel. The source was traced back to a whirlpool bath.

It is still unclear what is the source of the _Legionella_ infections in Schijndel. Fifteen residents of the Brabant town became infected with the bacteria. One person died.

The GGD [Regional Public Health Services] Hart voor Brabant says the search focuses on a source in the open air. "The most likely and known sources have now been sampled and closed or cleaned. This includes cooling towers and fountains, among other things."

Research has also been carried out in other places and will continue after the weekend. Among other things, it responds to tips from citizens and research is carried out in less obvious places. "Think of sources in the open air, at an event or car washes, but also places around the house, such as saunas, jacuzzis, showers that have been standing still for a long time," writes the GGD.

All patients or their relatives are also asked where they have been. The infected residents come from different neighborhoods in Schijndel. "That makes an open-air source somewhere in the area likely."

The samples taken were cultured in the laboratory. It then takes a few days before it is clear whether there is a connection between a patient's culture and a possible source.

It is not certain whether the source of the infection will ever be found. For example, it may be that the _Legionella_ source had already been cleaned.

The GGD calls on people with complaints that are consistent with pneumonia to report to their general practitioner. "Precisely if the corona test is negative, a _Legionella_ infection could be the cause of the complaints."

[Schijndel is a town in the southern province of North Brabant, Netherlands. A map showing the location of Schijndel can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Schijndel,+Netherlands.

The 2nd news article above reports a cluster of 15 cases of Legionnaires' disease, including one death, in Schijndel. A cluster refers to multiple cases in space and time that are possibly linked. An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease would imply that a common source is suspected (https://legionnaires.ecdc.europa.eu/?pid=205). Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

The 2nd news report also says that the cases come from different neighborhoods in Schijndel, suggesting that if this is a common source outbreak, airborne _Legionella_ may have been widely dispersed from a common source or all the cases were exposed to a common source in their travels out of their neighborhoods.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as a common source for 2 consecutive Legionnaires' disease clusters in the Netherlands in 2016 and 2017, based on genotyping of patient and WWTP isolates, as well isolates from air sampling above one of the WWTPs with the most aeration. Mapping the patients' residential postal codes and the prevailing wind direction indicated direct and long-distance transmission of _Legionella_ in these outbreaks (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6154163/).

We await further developments in the investigation of this possible outbreak in Schijndel. - Mod.ML
