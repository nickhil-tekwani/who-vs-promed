The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the Travel Information
section of their website, have a document entitled, "Spraying Aircraft for
Insects - Disinsection," that briefly explains the process and lists areas
in which travelers may expect to encounter it. See

[Re: Mod.JW´s comment > ... recalls the common bureaucratic response "We
don´t install a traffic light at an intersection until someone gets killed
there."
Far be it from me to run after being called a bureaucrat.
To depend upon aircraft disinsection to prevent the introduction of yellow
fever is ex post facto. It would seem to me that a much surer method of
containment would be to take action where the disease is occurring. Not
only will that prevent the spread, but control the outbreak.
Your traffic light analogy is flawed. With the importation of disease via
mosquito we are dealing with low risk and probability. It is like placing
a traffic light on the Thomas Dewey Parkway between Utica and Amsterdam to
stop speeding. Isn't surveillance of speeders a better solution? New York
has done a masterful job of surveillance and containment without putting
up traffic lights at JFK and all the bridges. Next someone will propose
spraying moving vans leaving New York for Albany.

[I was asking for trouble, crossing swords with Dave! But I think it´s his
traffic light analogy that´s flawed. We can´t block yellow fever at the
source, & we can´t stop birds infected with West Nile virus from migrating,
but we can do our damnedest to stop infected mosquitoes arriving in other
countries, and a lot of airlines are spending a lot of money to try to stop
that happening -- see the post on "Aircraft disinsection requirements"
referenced above.
Anyone else want to pitch in? This is supposed to be a dialogue, not a
duologue - Mod.JW
