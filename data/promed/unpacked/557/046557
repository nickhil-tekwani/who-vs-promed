A dog has died from suspected exposure to deadly algae near Horsham, leading to a warning from a veterinary group. According to Edric Cross, clinical director of Arun Veterinary Group, the dog was swimming in Wephurst Wood near Loxwood in the Chichester district recently when it was thought to have come into contact with the deadly algae.

It blooms at this time of year and releases toxins that can cause serious damage to the liver or nervous system, leading to seizures, liver failure and, in some cases, death. There have been reports of dogs collapsing and dying 15 minutes after coming into contact from the algae, either by drinking contaminated water or licking their fur clean, Mr. Cross claimed.

After the swim, the dog fell ill and was taken to Arun Veterinary Group's out-of-hours hospital in Storrington by South Downs Emergency Vets. It was put down after being unconscious and [having seizures] for 6 hours, Mr. Cross said.

He said another dog swimming there at the same time was unaffected. The Environment Agency was informed and would investigate whether there is an algal bloom there.

The veterinary director was keen to point out that although the dead dog's signs were consistent with blue-green algae exposure, it can take 10 working days to find out if it is present in a body of water. He said: "It is a well-recognised problem at this time of year, and our concern is to be sure people walking their dogs should be very careful of letting their dogs swim in any pond."

[There are a number of very toxic blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. The toxin may be present even if the algae are not and, likewise, the algae may be present but the toxin may not. However, safety for humans and animals means avoiding bodies of water with any blue-green algae.

"There are a number of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as 'pond scum.' Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.

"When environmental conditions are just right, blue-green algae can grow very quickly. Most species are buoyant and will float to the surface, where they form scum layers or floating mats. When this happens, we call this a 'blue-green algae bloom.' Blue-green algae blooms generally occur between mid-June and late September, although in rare instances, blooms have been observed in winter, even under the ice. Also in warmer years, blooms may be found in the Northern Hemisphere as early as April.

"Many different species of blue-green algae occur, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp., _Aphanizomenon_ sp., _Microcystis_ sp., and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species can change over the course of the season.

"Blue-green algal toxins are naturally produced chemical compounds that sometimes are produced inside the cells of certain species of blue-green algae. These chemicals are not produced all of the time, and there is no easy way to tell when blue-green algae are producing them and when they are not. When the cells are broken open, the toxins may be released. Sometimes this occurs when the cells die off naturally and they break open as they sink and decay in a lake or pond. Cells may also be broken open when the water is treated with chemicals meant to kill algae, and when cells are swallowed and mixed with digestive acids in the stomachs of people or animals.

"Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appears clear, if a 'bloom' is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.

"One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. _Microcystis_ can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin microcystin. When _Microcystis_ die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

"People swimming in dense _Microcystis_ blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US; however, Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

"_Microcystis_ blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. The blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). _Microcystis_ also requires sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in blooms.

"The commonest route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water, followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, _Microcystis_ blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people who consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people who frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports _Microcystis_ blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of _Microcystis_ cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water containing _Microcystis_ or through ingesting algal mats."

Toxins produced by blue-green algae
Toxins are compounds that have a harmful effect on other cells, tissues and organisms. In the natural environment, these toxins are generally contained within the blue-green algal cell but they are released into the water when the cell is damaged or dies.

Blue-green algal toxins can be divided into the following groups:
1. Hepatotoxins
- Hepatotoxins cause blood to collect in the liver causing circulatory shock and can lead to death by internal hemorrhaging.
- Hepatotoxins can cause weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea.
- Nodularin and microcystin are 2 types of hepatotoxins.
- Nodularin is produced by the algal species _Nodularia spumigena_.
- Microcystins can bioaccumulate in aquatic invertebrates such as mussels, so aquatic animals caught from water where there is an algal bloom should not be eaten.

2. Neurotoxins
- Neurotoxins interfere with the functioning of the nervous system and can cause death of humans and animals within minutes by causing paralysis of the respiratory muscles.
- Marine dinoflagellates (red tides) produce saxitoxins (also known as paralytic shellfish poisons), which concentrate in shellfish and have been known to cause death in humans.

3. Non-specific toxins
- Cylindrospermopsin is a non-specific toxin produced by the blue-green algae _Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii_ and _Aphanizomenon ovalisporum_.
- This toxin is a relatively slow-acting toxin that damages most organs in the body, including the liver.

4. Dermatoxic lipopolysaccharides
- When non-toxic species of blue-green algae are present at concentrations above 10 cubic mm/L, the water may still pose a risk to recreational and domestic users, as all blue-green algae have lipopolysaccharides in their cell walls.
- Lipopolysaccharides are less toxic than hepatotoxins or neurotoxins but are significant in terms of water supply for drinking, showering and recreation.
- Lipopolysaccharides have been associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis, skin and eye irritations, and hay fever in humans who have come into contact with algal blooms. Humans who contact lipopolysaccharides in the aerosol form (fine spray such as from a sprinkler) may suffer asthma, eczema, and blisters in the lining of the nose and mouth.
