Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (inf. with) (non-poultry including wild birds) (2017-), Israel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 29 Nov 2021
Confirmed: 30 Nov 2021
Reported: 1 Dec 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 9 Apr 2021
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAI]
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Mishmar Hasharon, HaMerkaz
Started: 29 Nov 2021
Epidemiological unit: natural park
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Great white pelican (_Pelecanus onocrotalus_): Pelecanidae-Phaethontiformes / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the pelican was found near a water pond. It was transferred to the wildlife hospital and died there.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comments: several outbreaks in poultry have occurred in Israel in the past few weeks. The hypothesis is that the domestic birds are infected by fomites sourced from wild birds. Israel is a migration route for about 500 million birds twice a year between Africa and Asia. The pond where the pelican was found is about 20 km [12.4 mi] from one of the outbreaks in poultry (Maayan Zvi).

Control measures at event level
Wild control measures to be applied: surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone
Additional measures: zoning, disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / Result
Kimron Veterinary Institute, Avian Diseases Division (national laboratory) / birds / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 1 Dec 2021 / positive
Northern Poultry Health Laboratory (regional laboratory) / birds / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / [12-13 Oct 2021] / positive
Kimron Veterinary Institute, Avian Diseases Division (national laboratory) / birds / 1 / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / [12-13 Oct 2021] / positive

[The great white pelican (_Pelecanus onocrotalus_) is a huge bird that breeds from southeastern Europe through Asia and Africa, in swamps and shallow lakes. It is highly sociable and often forms large flocks. Wintering takes place in northeastern Africa through Iraq to north India, with a particularly large number of breeders from Asia wintering around Pakistan and Sri Lanka. - Mod.PMB

The location of the water pond where the sick pelican was collected is available at http://tinyurl.com/bdhb59pm. This is one of 2 water bodies, countrywide, that have become "pelican-friendly reservoirs" within a cooperative effort by Israel's Ministry of Agriculture (fisheries division), the Fish Farmers' Organization, the National Parks & Nature Reserves, and respective regional municipalities, to minimise the friction between man and pelican. Until 2012, serious economic losses caused by the pelicans to fish farms compelled farmers to take drastic measures driving the birds away. Since 2013, the pelicans, mostly arriving in October and staying to early December, are provided in the 2 locations a substitute food source. Tonnes of second-rate fish that are destined to be thrown away/recycled because they are not commercial while the ponds are seasonally emptied, are purchased at the cost of labor and transportation and moved to the 2 reservoirs (the other one is in northern Israel). A byproduct is reducing hazard to air traffic by encouraging the birds to remain, before continuing their flight to Africa, at a single location (https://www.iaf.org.il/4374-38053-EN/IAF.aspx).

Israel's "when and where" regarding the great white pelican is available at https://www.birds.org.il/en/species-page/95/species-trends.

A recent feeding session of the pelicans, late October 2021, can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcnxFsfmC-c.

The thousands of pelicans in the Mishmar Hasharon reservoir have become, during the current and previous seasons, a national public attraction. During their recent stay, terminating at this time (early December), no overt disease or excessive deaths have been reported. The detection of a single HPAI H5N1 sick, infected bird (date of its initial collection not available) underlines the need for an enhanced One Health approach, including animal and public health authorities, ornithologists, nature protection and water supply agencies, during the seasons ahead. - Mod.AS
