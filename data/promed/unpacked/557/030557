A total of 3166 people have been affected so far by the outbreak of gastroenteritis detected last week in Barcelona and Tarragona, after drinking water packaged in bottles or cans installed in 925 companies. Only one had to be hospitalized and has already been discharged, according to the Department of Health of the Generalitat [local government in Catalonia].

It is unlikely that there will be more new cases, but the number of people affected could rise if some people already suffering symptoms of gastroenteritis go to the doctor, given the media coverage of this outbreak.

The secretary of the Public Health Agency of Catalonia (ASPCAT), Jordi Guix, has also explained that even though the source of the outbreak is unknown, he suggested that the problem could be in the packaging process, which takes place in a plant in Andorra [a small country north of Catalonia]. The distribution company Eden Springs Spain [was checked] and no abnormality was found. This company withdrew last week preventively more than 6000 bottles of 19 liters of water [of the] brand Font d'Arinsal, in the provinces of Barcelona and Tarragona.

In a statement, Eden Springs Spain "regretted deeply the discomfort of those affected by the outbreak of gastroenteritis" and shared "the concern of our customers". The company thanked the Department of Health of the Generalitat [for the] "diligence and close cooperation shown throughout these last days". The authorities have confirmed that "immobilization and collection of all existing carafes and sanitization of the supplying water machines has been conducted," said Guix.

The results, as stated by Guix, point to a norovirus, a causative microorganism of half of the overall cases of gastroenteritis.

The secretary of public health has stated that the Andorran authorities are conducting an investigation into how the water may have become contaminated. The results will then be sent to Catalan laboratories to compare [with the already retrieved] samples of water. It is estimated that the process will [take] at least 10 days.

Guix pointed out that it's not that new cases of affected people have appeared but that "doctors, when they detect a case, are not required to declare it if it is not in the context of an outbreak, plus many of the sick [have not] even consulted a doctor." Therefore, most cases would not have been reported until an outbreak was identified, "which explains this movement of figures". The first cases were detected between 12 and 13 Apr 2016, and since then only 1 of those affected has been hospitalized, but has already been discharged.
