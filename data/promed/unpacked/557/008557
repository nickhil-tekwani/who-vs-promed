The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has confirmed positive cases of equine strangles in Mecosta and Newaygo counties.

In Mecosta County, a 10 year old appaloosa mare had onset of clinical signs on 6 Nov 2020 including fever and nasal discharge. The mare is recovering. There are 5 other suspect cases on that property and 37 horses exposed.

In Newaygo County, a 12 year old Tennessee walking horse gelding was confirmed with equine strangles. He [developed] clinical signs on 25 Oct 2020 including enlarged submandibular lymph nodes, and is recovering.

[The following is extracted from the AAEP/Equine Disease Communication Center Disease Fact Sheet (https://aaep.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Outside%20Linked%20Documents/DiseaseFactsheet-Strep_equi_final%20Cobranded_0.pdf):

_Streptococcus equi_ equi is also known as "strep equi" or strangles.

Disease type: bacterial infection.

Transmission: _S. equi_ is spread from horse to horse through direct contact. Horses can also contract the disease by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces. The disease is highly infectious.

Frequency: _S. equi_ is extremely common. Most horses are exposed and/or infected at a young age.

Incubation period: 3-14 days.

Carrier status: Horses that have been infected but are clinically healthy can continue to incubate and shed the bacteria. A recovered horse may be a potential source of infection for at least 6 weeks after the clinical signs of strangles have resolved. Some horses having recovered from the disease can become long-term, periodic shedders and can cause outbreaks when introduced to new herds.

Shedding period: Horses infected with _S. equi_ are a source of infection to others and often continue to shed for up to 6 weeks post recovery.

Latency: _Streptococcus equi_ is present during the incubation period, and the horse can be a carrier without any clinical signs.

Severity: Low.

Clinical signs:
- fever, usually preceding other clinical signs by 24-48 hours
- abscesses in the mandibular lymph nodes (in the throatlatch and below the jaw)
- nasal discharge: often thick white and yellow mucus
- inflammation of the throat
- difficulty swallowing
- wheezing
- cough
- purpura hemorrhagica -- bleeding from the capillaries which causes red spots on the mucous membranes and swelling of the limbs and head (rare; only in cases with complications)
- swelling of the muscles (rare: only in cases with complications)

Diagnosis: Diagnosis is made through culture of nasal wash, nasal swab, or pus aspirated from abscesses or through PCR testing.

Treatment: Supportive care is the primary treatment. Use of antibiotics in infected horses is restricted to those with severe clinical signs such as respiratory difficulty, as most horses recover without antibiotic treatment. Horses treated with antibiotics early in the course of infection may avoid lymph node abscesses but may not develop immunity to the disease. Treatment decisions should be made by a veterinarian.

Prognosis: Good -- strangles is rarely fatal and horses usually make a full recovery in 3-4 weeks with few complications. Horses who have been infected with strangles can maintain long-term immunity to the bacterial strain.

Prevention: An intranasal vaccine is available but is not effective against all infections. Any surfaces contaminated with mucus or other nasal discharge from infected horses pose a threat of infection to healthy horses. After an outbreak, cleaning should involve removal of all organic material from surfaces and subsequent disinfection of water containers, feeders, fences, stalls, tack and trailers.

Biosecurity: _S. equi_ outbreaks can be hard to prevent because of the prevalence of subclinical carriers (clinically healthy horses who shed the bacteria for weeks or even years after recovery). Outbreaks are common, especially in facilities with high horse traffic where new horses are frequently moved between stables or herds. Whenever possible, new horses should be quarantined for up to 3 weeks when being introduced to a new facility. High standards of hygiene should be maintained in facilities to decrease chance of horses contacting contaminated surfaces. To prevent indirect infection during an outbreak, handlers should avoid coming in contact with susceptible animals after handling infected animals. Handlers should wear protective clothing, avoid using the same equipment on multiple animals, and disinfect hands and equipment when moving between animals.
