West Nile Virus Activity; United States, 2001
---------------------------------------------
In 2001, West Nile virus (WNV) activity was reported from 359
counties in 27 states and the District of Columbia (DC) to ArboNET, a
web-based, surveillance data network maintained by 54 state and local
public health agencies and CDC. This activity represented a marked
increase from 2000, when WNV activity was reported from 138 counties
in 12 states and DC (1). This report summarizes surveillance data for
2001, which indicate that 66 human illnesses were reported from 10
states and that widespread WNV activity in birds, horses, and
mosquitoes extended into the midwestern United States and several
southern states unaffected previously. The findings in this report
underscore the need for public education, increased WNV surveillance
aimed at early viral detection, and sustained, integrated
mosquito-control activities.
In 2001, CDC conducted WNV surveillance with 54 ArboNET surveillance
coordinators from health departments in the contiguous 48 states and
6 jurisdictions (Chicago, DC, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City,
and Philadelphia). Local WNV surveillance networks collected and
tested for WNV or antibodies specimens from human and veterinary
patients, dead birds, captive sentinel animals (mostly chickens),
wild-caught birds, and mosquitoes. Test results, including county and
week of specimen collection or illness onset, were entered into local
electronic databases, and standardized summaries were forwarded
weekly to CDC's ArboNET database system. In addition, reports of
human WNV cases and other reports of WNV activity were reported to
CDC by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail.
In 2001, a total of 66 human cases of WNV disease (64 persons with
central nervous system infections [WNV meningoencephalitis] and 2
persons with uncomplicated WNV fever) were reported from 39 counties
in 10 states. New York (13 WNV meningoencephalitis cases; 2 WNV fever
cases), New Jersey (12 WNV meningoencephalitis cases), and Florida
(12 WNV meningoencephalitis cases) accounted for 39 (59 percent)
reported cases. Among 64 persons with WNV meningoencephalitis, the
median age was 68 years (range: 9 to 90 years). Of these, 9 (14
percent) cases were fatal; the median age of these persons was 70
years (range: 44 to 90 years). The dates of human illness onset
ranged from 13 Jul 2001 to 7 Dec 2001. In 36 (92 percent) counties
reporting human cases, the first case was preceded by at least one
report of a WNV-infected bird, sentinel animal, horse, or mosquito
pool; 320 counties detected enzootic WNV activity but no human
infections.
Of the 359 counties reporting WNV activity, 328 (91 percent) counties
in 27 states and DC reported 7333 dead WNV-infected birds (5154 crows
from 2 _Corvus_ species, 966 blue jays, and 1213 birds from 71 other
avian species). In 238 (66 percent) counties, dead crows were the
first indicators of WNV activity. Of 9679 crows tested for WNV, 5154
(53 percent) were positive for WNV infection compared with 2179 (9
percent) of 24898 birds from other species. Dead infected birds were
collected during 4 Apr to 26 Dec 2001. A total of 55 sero-positive
wild-caught birds were reported from DC and 5 counties in 3 states
(Florida, New York, and Ohio) and represented the first detection of
WNV activity in 2 of these counties. A total of 218 sero-converting
captive sentinel animals were reported from 26 counties in 5 states
(Florida, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Virginia). In 4
Florida counties, seroconverting sentinel chickens were the first
sign of WNV activity.
Horses were the only WNV-infected non-human mammals reported in 2001.
A total of 733 equine cases were reported from 127 counties in 19
states (Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, and Virginia); this represented a 12-fold increase
compared with 2000 (1). Florida reported 483 equine cases (66 percent
of all reports) from 40 counties. The first equine illness preceded
the first human illness; equine illness onset dates ranged from 27
Jun to 18 Dec 2001.
In 2001, a total of 564 counties conducted WNV testing on
approximately 1.4 million mosquitoes from 91 species. WNV was
detected in 919 mosquito pools (27 species) reported from 71 counties
in 16 states (Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia) and
DC. As in 2000, two enzootic vector species, _Culex pipiens_ and _Cx.
restuans_, collectively accounted for the majority (59 percent) of
WNV-positive pools. WNV also was found for the first time in several
additional species of potential public health importance, including
_Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, _Coquilletidia perturbans_, _Cx.
nigripalpus_, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, _Ochlerotatus sollicitans_,
_Oc. taeniorhynchus_, and _Psorophora columbiae_.

MMWR Editorial Note
The 2001 surveillance data indicate that the geographic area with WNV
activity has increased and that dead WNV-infected birds were reported
in western Arkansas, southern Maine, and southern Florida. There were
7 states that reported human cases for the first time. Canadian
health authorities also detected WNV activity in dead birds from
southwestern Ontario, a region of lower latitude than the northern
limits of WNV detection in the United States (2). In 2001, a case of
WNV encephalitis was diagnosed serologically in a resident of the
Cayman Islands who had no recent travel history (CDC, unpublished
data, 2001), suggesting that WNV has entered the Caribbean region.
Human illness onsets on 13 Jul 2001 and 7 Dec 2001 in persons in
Florida and Georgia, respectively, mark the earliest and latest
reported human cases since the introduction of WNV to the United
States.
Extended seasonal activity in 2001 occurred in the northeast; 2 of 5
persons with illness onset on 15 Oct 2001 or later were from
Massachusetts. The widespread occurrence of human cases and the
occurrence of human cases outside of WNV's usual season (summer and
early fall) suggest that: 1) State and local health departments in
the contiguous 48 states should, at a minimum, establish enhanced
passive hospital-based surveillance for human cases of encephalitis
of unknown etiology, and that: 2) this surveillance should extend
beyond mid-October (3).
In 2001, infected birds, mosquitoes, or horses were detected in 16
states in which no previous WNV activity in animals had been
reported. These findings demonstrate the dramatic spread of WNV
westward and southward since 1999, when the virus was first
recognized in North America. Although virus activity was detected for
the first time in many southern states in 2001, the simultaneous
appearance of 2 epizootic foci very early in 2001 (one in the
mid-Atlantic region and one in the southeast along the common borders
of Florida, Georgia, and Alabama) suggests that WNV was introduced
into the southern states by migrating birds in late 2000, but
circulated at levels below the detection threshold of surveillance.
Because many migratory bird species use well-established north-south
flyways along the eastern seaboard, this movement of WNV from the
mid-Atlantic region to the south Atlantic region and the Gulf states
was expected; however, the reasons for WNV's rapid expansion into
multiple foci in the central United States are less obvious. Possible
mechanisms include carriage of the virus by the return of infected
birds from wintering sites in southern states or by their incremental
east-to-west local movements (4).
Surveillance of dead birds is essential in monitoring WNV activity.
Infection in species within the family _Corvidae_ (e.g., crows and
jays) is a particularly important indicator of WNV activity. In 2001,
the proportion of tested birds that were infected continued to be
disproportionately higher in crows than all other birds (53 percent
versus 9 percent). Although 83 percent of infected birds reported
were either crows or blue jays, this might be attributed to greater
emphasis placed by states on monitoring these species. State and
local health department surveillance programs should continue to
emphasize the collection and testing of dead corvids. However,
because non-corvid birds were first indicators of WNV activity in 57
(16 percent) of 359 counties where the virus was detected,
surveillance programs should include these other species wherever
possible. In 2001, sero-surveillance of sentinel chickens and
wild-caught birds contributed additional information on WNV
transmission and provided collectively the initial signal of WNV
activity in 6 counties. The limitations of these supplemental systems
are documented (3,5) and their overall utility continues to be
evaluated.
The 2001 equine WNV epizootic was unprecedented given its geographic
span and the number of horses affected. In addition to a substantial
epizootic in the northeast, an intense equine epizootic in Georgia
and Florida accounted for 75 percent (551) of all reported equine
cases. Scattered cases also were detected as far west as Louisiana,
in the Ohio valley, and in northern Illinois. In Aug 2001, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture granted conditional licensure of a
commercial equine WNV vaccine because of the detrimental effect of
these events on equine health and industry. Because WNV-infected
horses are unlikely to develop viremias sufficient to infect feeding
mosquitoes, they are unlikely to pose a risk to humans (6). However,
equine epizootics reflect intense enzootic WNV activity in
mosquitoes, which might place humans at increased risk.
In 2001, _Culex_ mosquitoes (_Cx. pipiens_, _Cx. restuans_, and _Cx.
salinarius_) were the most commonly identified mosquito vectors of
WNV in the United States, and since 1999 these species have been
found in close spatial and temporal proximity to the majority of
human cases of WNV meningoencephalitis (1,7,8). Detection of WNV in
several common human-feeding mosquito species (e.g., _Cx.
nigripalpus_, _Oc. sollicitans_, _Oc. taeniorhynchus_, and _Cq.
perturbans_) and recent studies demonstrating their ability to
transmit this virus under laboratory conditions (9,10) raise concerns
about increased human risk in areas where these species are common.
The data available to the ArboNET system likely underestimate actual
geographic distribution and intensity of WNV virus transmission in
the United States. Data provided by the 54 ArboNET coordinators are
derived largely from local health unit surveillance efforts, which
vary according to capacity and ability. The 28 jurisdictions
reporting activity probably support additional, undetected WNV
transmission within their borders, and undetected foci of
transmission probably exist in counties and states that have not
reported transmission activity. In addition, some detected WNV
infections might not have been entered into the ArboNET system.
In Florida, epizootic WNV activity has been reported since Jan 2002,
indicating that year-round transmission is occurring in that state.
In northern states, WNV activity has been reported since Apr 2002.
The extended seasonal activity, the broad vertebrate host and
vector-mosquito range, and the establishment of multiple epizootic
foci throughout the eastern United States demonstrate that WNV has
established itself permanently in temperate North America and
strongly suggest that it will spread further westward. This
underscores the need for increased surveillance geared toward early
viral detection and mosquito-control activities that weaken or break
amplification cycles and decrease the risk for human and domestic
animal infection with WNV. Prevention activities should continue to
include 1) public education programs urging residential source
reduction and personal protective measures to reduce mosquito
exposure; 2) development of sustained, community-level integrated
mosquito-surveillance and management programs (3); and 3)
high-priority emphasis on the control of urban _Culex_ mosquitoes.
