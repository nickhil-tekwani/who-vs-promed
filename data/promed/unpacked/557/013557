Malayan Racing Association secretary Krishna Kumar said all horse races scheduled to be held this month [September 2015] have been cancelled following the outbreak of equine influenza (EI) or horse flu.

Department of Veterinary Services deputy director-general Dr Kamarudin Md Isa has prohibited the transfer of horses from one stable to another.

Dr Kamarudin said following the rapid spread of the disease, several racing clubs including the Selangor Turf Club (STC), Perak Turf Club (PTC) and Penang Turf Club were asked to tighten control and ensure that no horse and equipment was taken out of the clubs.

"The results of the sample tests carried out by the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) in Ipoh and the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore confirmed the infection was caused by EI.

"The infection could have originated from 4 horses imported from New Zealand via Singapore on [31 Jul 2015]," he said at a press conference here today [5 Sep 2015] [see comment].

The disease was detected after the horses, 2 of which were transferred to STC and one each to PTC and Penang Turf Club on 14 Aug 2015, had influenza-like nasal discharges.

He said the horses did not show any signs of infection while undergoing a 14-day quarantine period at the KL International Airport's Animals Quarantine Station.

"Now more than 100 horses have been infected from the 4 imported horses but the situation is still under control. We are taking this problem seriously," he said.

Dr Kamarudin said any equestrian activities were advised to be temporarily postponed and he was confident that the disease could be controlled within the next one and a half months.

[The source of infection is in need of elucidation. According to New Zealand's last (2014) annual report to the OIE, equine influenza, a reportable disease, has never been recorded in this country. According to the 2014 annual reports of both Malaysia and (adjacent) Singapore, in both of them the last occurrence of the disease dates back to 1977. As reported in the previous posting of 28 Aug 2015, samples from the afflicted horses were to be sent to Singapore and the USA to determine where the disease originated.
