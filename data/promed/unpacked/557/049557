5 mysteries about Ebola: From bats to eyeballs to blood
----------
[National Public Radio (NPR) asked Dr. Daniel Bausch - an expert on Ebola virus disease (EVD) who is working with the World Health Organization (WHO) - to list the top-5 unknowns of the disease.
Q: How EVD reached West Africa?
A: Researchers were able to use genetic sequencing to determine that the West Africa outbreak was started when a young boy in Guinea was infected in December 2013, likely from a fruit bat.
Q: Why do so many Ebola survivors experience health problems after they've recovered?
A: According to Dr. Bausch, "The dogma prior to this outbreak was that survivors got better after a time. That even though they had been through hell, once they got better that was the end of it -- they were okay. But now we're recognizing that there are a lot of problems that can persist for a long time."
Q: Could this kind of resurgence of the virus in a survivor spark a new outbreak?
A: As far as researchers can tell, when Ebola virus flares up again in a survivor, the person doesn't develop full-blown EVD. Instead, the virus causes problems in a particular part of their body. The most common seems to be eye infection. And in those cases, the Ebola virus is basically trapped inside the eye, so it can't be transmitted to other people.
Q: What happens when a pregnant woman contracts Ebola?
A: According to Dr. Bausch, as far as researchers can tell, even if a pregnant woman who is infected with EVD survives, the fetus will not. Often the woman will miscarry while she is still sick, but she may not actually lose the fetus until after she recovers. In those cases, the baby is stillborn, and the woman no longer has Ebola virus in her blood, but the stillborn child that she delivers will still have the virus in its blood. This presents a risk to health care workers who assist with the delivery. In a few cases, workers are suspected to have been infected under these circumstances.
Q: Did any of those experimental treatments that people were clamoring for during the outbreak - the ZMapp drug, the infusions of blood plasma from survivors -- actually work?
A: According to Dr. Bausch, unfortunately no. The drug companies mobilized quickly but "By the time we were ready to do the trials, the bottom of the outbreak had dropped out and the cases started to fall away. Suddenly there were no patients. We haven't come out of this being able to say, 'This one is great. Now we have a treatment for Ebola."

[2] Sierra Leone: new case
Date: Fri 15 Jan 2016:
Source: Reuters [edited]
http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-leone-testing-idUSKCN0UT1SS

Sierra Leone Ebola sample was in tests as WHO declared epidemic over
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[At] around the same time the World Health Organization (WHO) was announcing on Thursday (14 Jan 2016) the West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak was officially over, a British laboratory in Sierra Leone, which was testing a swab from a woman, named "MJ," who had died 2 days earlier (13 Jan 2016), the sample was found to be positive for EVD.
The irony of the timing showed the problems authorities meet when making the decision when to declare the end of a mayor health emergency. According to an aid agency report seen by Reuters, the woman had potentially exposed at least 27 other people to EVD.
A British health agency, Public Health England (PHE), confirmed it had tested the sample from "MJ" at its laboratory in Makeni, in the north of the west African country.
Tim Brooks, head of Public Health England's rare and imported pathogens lab, told Reuters. "Ebola tests take approximately 4 hours to complete," he said. The results were communicated to Sierra Leone's health ministry "on Thursday (14 Jan 2015) afternoon, immediately after the initial positive Ebola test result was confirmed."
According to WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, "This really reflects what we have been saying... that there is a risk, and this outbreak is in a critical phase right now where we are moving from case management to management of risk. It is really important that people don't understand this 42-day announcement as the sign that we should all just pack up and go home. We should stay there and be ready to respond to these possible cases."
Reemergences of EVD can occur because the virus can persist for months in a person's body in organs which are protected from a person's immune system.

[3] Followup reports

14 Jan 2016 West Africa, Liberia: Latest Ebola outbreak over in Liberia; West Africa is at zero, but new flare-ups are likely to occur
http://who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/ebola-zero-liberia/en/
[The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Liberia is over, and has said all known chains of transmission have ended in West Africa. However, WHO cautions more flare-ups are expected and the maintenance of strong surveillance and response teams will be critical in coming months. Greater than 11 300 peopled perished in the epidemic, and it left many orphans without homes.]

15 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone: Deep Disappointment in Sierra Leone over fresh Ebola case
http://allafrica.com/stories/201601160299.html
[The woman who died from Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the latest outbreak was a Port Loko student. Prior to her death, she traveled to Bamoi Luma, an area close to the Guinean border, in late December 2015.
On her way back home to Tonkili District, she was reported to have had diarrhea and vomiting. On 8 Jan 2016 she went to seek medical care at a local hospital. A health worker obtained blood for testing, but it is not clear whether she was tested for EVD. The disease went undetected. 4 days later, she died.
The woman is said to have lived with about 22 other people and, so far, 27 people have been identified for monitoring. According to Francis Langoba Kellie, spokesperson for the Office of National Security, who spoke on a local radio program, Sierra Leonean authorities said they are able to deal with this new case. They have sent a team to the affected area to track down any contacts the woman might have had. Certain areas will be quarantined.
The fact that this latest case went unnoticed until after the woman's death although she sought medical advice has left Sierra Leoneans skeptical.]

15 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone: Ebola victim in Sierra Leone feared to have exposed 27 others to virus
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/ebola-victim-in-sierra-leone-feared-to-have-exposed-27-others-to-virus
[Patient "MJ" was nursed by members of a household of 22 people before being treated as an outpatient at a local hospital, and may have exposed at least 27 people to Ebola virus disease (EVD). By the time MJ returned to her parents' home east of the capital Freetown, she had diarrhea and vomiting. She was treated as an outpatient and returned home, where she died 4 days later.

16 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone, West Africa: Joy over Ebola victory crushed by Sierra Leone death
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-01-joy-ebola-victory-sierra-leone.html
[A 22-year-old woman, "MJ," became ill near the Guinean border on Thursday last week [7 Jan 2016] and died on Tuesday [12 Jan 2016], local health officials said. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement from Geneva [Switzerland] confirming she was killed by Ebola virus disease [EVD].
According to the chief local medical officer, MJ became ill while on holiday in the village of Bamoi Luma and was taken by relatives to hospital. The official also confirmed that MJ "died at home" but did not say why she had been released from the hospital in Magburaka, the capital of the northern Tonkolili district. However, a nurse at the Magburaka Hospital told AFP [Agence France Presse] MJ was not admitted but was "...given some medication as she showed signs of a severe cold", and sent home.
Langoba Kelly of Sierra Leone's Office of National Security told reporters in Freetown "The swab test on the victim after her death was done 3 times and all proved positive."
Rumors have spread in Sierra Leone media over the resumption of the practice of eating bush meat.
According to Ian Mackay, associate professor of virology at the University of Queensland [Australia], "The WHO was mentioning yesterday, that handwashing has just become just a little bit more lax and that really needs to pick up to help combat the return of this and other infections.]"

16 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone, West Africa: With new Ebola death, Sierra Leone, region suffer setback
http://www.voanews.com/content/with-new-ebola-death-sierra-leone-region-suffer-setback/3148694.html
[Sierra Leone is re-starting the 42-day countdown to being declared free of transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) after a woman died of the disease. Sierra Leone (SL) has been free of transmission for 2 months.
This latest case may indicate residents have reverted to old habits, such as washing and touching a dead body. The virus is transmitted through body fluids and is most contagious at death. It may also be related to the reality that the Ebola virus is also sexually transmissible by some survivors because of the possibility of dormancy of the virus in immune-privileged organs in the body.
According to Sidie Yahya Tunis, with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, "It is still preliminary but is highly possible considering the fact that the person died at home and was buried in the community, so it's highly likely the body was washed..."]

16 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone, West Africa: Sierra Leone death from Ebola vexing
http://www.nwaonline.com/news/2016/jan/16/sierra-leone-death-from-ebola-vexing-20/
[Already 10 other flare-ups [in West African countries] have taken place in areas where the spread of Ebola was thought to have ended, raising new questions about agency procedures in assessing whether an epidemic was really over. It is not clear how the 22-year-old deceased woman may have contracted Ebola virus disease (EVD); all known transmission chains in that country were halted in November 2015.
According to Dr. Bruce Aylward, who heads the EVD response efforts for the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebola response efforts, the deceased woman was not buried safely. He also said the agency was not reconsidering its 42-day waiting period despite the repeated re-emergence of new cases after EVD outbreaks had been declared over in countries. WHO said the virus can also jump to humans from animals such as monkeys and bats.

17 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone: More than 100 people quarantined after Sierra Leone Ebola death
http://af.reuters.com/article/sierraLeoneNews/idAFL8N1510JL?feedType=RSS&feedName=sierraLeoneNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FAfricaSierraLeoneNews+%28News+%2F+Africa+%2F+Sierra+Leone+News%29&rpc=401
[More than 100 people have been quarantined in Sierra Leone after coming in contact with a woman who died of Ebola virus disease last week [12 Jan 2016], emphasizing the possibility of the disease to spreading. Her death concerned health experts because authorities failed to follow basic protocols, according to a health report seen by Reuters last week. According to the report, she lived in a house with 22 people while she was unwell. 5 people were involved in washing her corpse [in preparation for burial], a practice considered to be among the chief modes of Ebola transmission. According to the Ministry of Health and the Office of National Security 109 people have so far been quarantined, 28 of whom are high-risk cases. "An active case investigation continues in the 4 districts where the young woman was known to have traveled," according to the statement. The source of the transmission remains unclear. According to a local leader, in apparent frustration at the latest case, the homes of some high-risk patients were attacked this weekend in Magburaka, the city about 200 km (120 miles) east of Freetown where the woman ("MJ") died. In 1 case a hut was burned down, and a barricade around 2 quarantined homes was dismantled. The unrest comes after demonstrators last week accused the health department of negligence at a local hospital that saw MJ as an outpatient before she died.

17 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone: Sierra Leone continues tracing contacts of the newly found Ebola case
http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/17/c_135017502.htm
[According to the National Coordinator of the Office of National Security, Ishmael Tarawally, who spoke at a press conference Saturday [16 Jan 2016], 1 of the most sought-after contacts, the father of the deceased woman, was found in the Freetown Saturday [16 Jan 2016]. According to Tarawally, "The government apparatus is currently on the ground with support from the international inter-agency team and at the national level, the National Situation Room has now been reactivated since the death.'' He said "active case investigations" were ongoing in all the districts where the victim was known to have recently traveled, including Kambia, Port Loko, Bombali and Freetown.]

17 Jan 2016 Sierra Leone: Sierra Leone quarantines over 100 people following new Ebola death
http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/01/17/world/science-health-world/sierra-leone-quarantines-over-100-people-following-new-ebola-death/#.Vpu-mk_LLnk
[According to Sierra Leone's chief medical officer, Dr. Brima Kargbo, when the woman arrived at Magburaka Government Hospital she showed "no signs or symptoms that fitted the case definition of Ebola. She had no fever or redness of the eyes when she was examined at the outpatient ward. What was detected was dizziness. We are now going to revisit the Ebola case definition."]

14 Jan 2016: Lessons learnt from Ebola
http://www.dw.com/en/lessons-learnt-from-ebola/a-18981177
[After the World Health Organization declared West Africa free from Ebola virus disease (EVD), with 11 300 people dead and many children orphaned, which lessons were learned?
- There is life after EVD.
- There is always a risk of a relapse.
- We have to act more quickly.
- A health issue is a global issue.
- Ebola can disrupt an entire social structure.
- Shortcomings of the health-care system.
- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are equipped to address flare-ups of EVD.
- The necessity for quicker development of vaccines.
