The district administration in Gandhinagar in Gujarat on Tuesday [6 Jul 2021] declared Kalol town as a cholera-affected region after 5 cases were found there, officials said. An order declaring the area in a 2-kilometer [1.24 mi] radius of Kalol as affected by the ailment was issued by Gandhinagar collector Kuldeep Arya under the Epidemic Diseases Act for a period of one month, they said.

"Five of 38 samples tested returned positive for cholera. It mainly spreads through water or food contamination," Arya said. Contamination of drinking water due to leakage or rupture in underground pipelines may be the cause, and teams have been formed to find out and rectify them, Arya said.

The development comes a week after Nadiad town in Kheda district was declared as cholera-affected. Nadiad has 4 confirmed cholera cases at the moment, while 50 people suspected to have the ailment and experiencing symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea are admitted in local hospitals, officials said.

"Efforts are on to repair ruptured pipelines, fill up open pits and spray disinfectants," said Nadiad municipality chief officer Pranav Parekh.

[A number of cholera vaccines are available, but edible vaccine technology offers the potential for a cold chain-free method. The following recent Japanese publication reports on a phase 1 study actually performed in 2016 using MucoRice-CTB vaccine, a genetically modified rice strain that carries a cholera toxin B subunit antigen (the Methods section of the abstract, not included here, can be found at the URL, below):

Abstract
--------
"Background: There are an estimated 1.3-4.0 million cases of cholera and 20  000-140  000 cholera-related deaths worldwide each year. The rice-based cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) vaccine [manufactured as a powder from the transgenic rice - Mod.LL], MucoRice-CTB, is an oral candidate vaccine that does not require a cold chain, has shown efficacy in animal models, and could be of benefit in places where there is a paucity of medical infrastructure. We aim to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MucoRice-CTB in humans."

"Findings: Between 23 Jun 2015 and 31 May 2016, 226 participants were recruited and assessed for eligibility. 166 participants were excluded based on health condition or schedule. We then randomly selected 60 male volunteers aged 20-40 years who were enrolled and assigned to MucoRice-CTB (10 participants assigned to 1 g, 10 participants assigned to 3 g, and 10 participants assigned to 6 g), or placebo (10 participants assigned to 1 g, 10 participants assigned to 3 g, and 10 participants assigned to 6 g). All participants received at least one dose of study drug or placebo and were included in the safety analyses. Two participants given MucoRice-CTB 3 g and one participant given MucoRice-CTB 6 g were lost to follow-up and excluded from the efficacy analysis. Serum CTB-specific IgG and IgA antibody concentrations in participants who received 6 g MucoRice-CTB increased significantly in both a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner compared with those in the placebo groups (p for interaction = 0.002 for IgG, p = 0.004 for IgA). Genome analysis of subjects' feces before vaccination revealed that compared to non-responders, responders had a gut microbiota of higher diversity with the presence of _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella_ spp. 28 (93%) of 30 participants who received MucoRice-CTB at any dose had at least one adverse event during the study period, compared with 30 (100%) of 30 participants given placebo. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 4 participants in the MucoRice-CTB group (5 events) and 4 participants in the placebo group (10 events). The most common serious adverse event was hemoglobin decreased (2 events in 2 participants in the pooled MucoRice-CTB group, 2 events in 2 participants in the placebo group; all grade 3).

"Interpretation: Participants given MucoRice-CTB showed increased CTB-specific serum IgG and IgA antibody concentrations without inducing serious adverse events, indicating that MucoRice-CTB could be a safe and potent vaccine to prevent diarrheal disease. MucoRice-CTB induced neutralizing antibodies against diarrhoeal toxins in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. A similar phase 1 trial will be done with participants of other ethnicities to substantiate our findings."

Gujarat (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat) is a state on the western coast of India with a coastline of 1600 km (990 mi) -- most of which lies on the Kathiawar peninsula -- and a population of 60.4 million. It is the 5th-largest Indian state by area and the 9th-largest state by population. Gujarat is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. Its capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is Ahmedabad. Its location can be found at the above URL. - Mod.LL
