The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks says 3 more cases of chronic wasting disease have been confirmed. The executive director of the agency's Wildlife Bureau, Russ Walsh, tells The Hattiesburg American the cases were confirmed this week in Benton and Marshall Counties. The fatal neurological disease affects deer, elk and moose.

So far, a total of 19 cases have been confirmed in Benton, Issaquena, Marshall, Panola, Pontotoc and Tallahatchie counties. Walsh says the recent cases in Panola and Tallahatchie counties were outside the current northern wasting disease management zone.

The zones prohibit supplemental feeding and the transportation of carcasses to outside zone boundaries to limit the spread of the disease. Walsh says the agency is now considering how to update the northern zone.

[Prohibiting transport and supplemental feeding are good starts. But are others transporting heads with brains to taxidermist? Mounting of heads may be fine, but the method the taxidermist uses to dispose of the brains is important. One might wonder if something is causing infected deer to migrate.

We wish them luck in determining how to update their zones. - Mod.TG
