Canada: Mysterious Virus Outbreak Sickens 140 in Calgary Shelter
--------------------------------------------------
A Calgary social service agency's facility has become the scene of a
mysterious illness outbreak. The Calgary Drop-In and Rehab Centre saw about
200 homeless people sickened by the outbreak on Sun 7 Nov 2004. They
experienced nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
This led to the building being locked down, keeping about 300 other people
inside, public health officials being called into investigate and stop the
illness's spread with police being called in to help calm some angry people.
"Well, it didn't go over too good once they locked the doors and
quarantined. A lot of people were upset over that," one centre user told
CFCN News. "But once they got the system in place and people accepted it,
it moved actually pretty good."
But one young man told CFCN that: "A lot of tempers were flying. Cops
finally showed up and calmed everybody down," a woman told CFCN.
Health officials say they don't know yet what caused the outbreak. "We do
know that in the community right now there is a lot of norovirus
infection," said Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health for
the Calgary Health Region. Norovirus infection causes gastrointestinal
problems and often occurs in outbreaks. It is often transmitted when people
eat food infected with the virus.
However, the cause likely won't be known until later this week, when test
results are available, MacDonald said. Centre spokesman Dermot Baldwin
said: "In comparison to this, we've had very minor incidents that were
easily isolated, but we were also a much smaller operation."
The centre was re-opened around 5 p.m. MST, but those showing symptoms were
to be isolated on one floor. Besides providing an opportunity for a meal --
it serves 3500 per day -- counselling and job placement, the centre also
provides overnight shelter to about 800 people.
