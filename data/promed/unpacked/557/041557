Live H5N1 avian influenza virus can be isolated from the blood of its
human victims, a finding that will be reported by Thai researchers in
an upcoming issue of a scientific journal. Evidence that H5N1 can
spread via the bloodstream to parts of the body not normally attacked
by influenza viruses confirms this particular flu strain poses
special challenges for both patient treatment and infection control,
experts say. It also raises theoretical questions about the safety of
the donated blood system should H5N1 trigger a pandemic.
"This is the first report of a large amount of (H5N1) virus in blood
in humans," University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown said of the
findings, outlined in a letter slated for publication in the June
issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases. "That's a bit surprising
because blood is poisonous [?] to flu virus. If you take any blood
... and add it to flu, you kill it (the virus). This showed that the
virus was living [i.e. surviving] in the blood," said Dr. Brown, who
was not an author of the letter. While some types of viruses spread
well in blood, cases of viremia -- viral infection in the bloodstream
-- have only rarely been reported with influenza.
The researchers -- from Chulalongkorn University, Srinakharinwirot
University and the National Institute of Animal Health, all in
Bangkok -- reported on the case of a 5-year-old Thai boy who died of
H5N1 infection on 7 Dec 2005. A blood sample drawn on the day he died
contained high levels of live virus. The finding helps to explain
reports that some humans with H5N1 experience what is called systemic
infection, with the flu virus spreading beyond its normal home in the
respiratory track to organs that would typically go untouched by
human flu viruses.
Other research groups have reported finding traces of H5N1's RNA in
blood. Those findings were highly suggestive that the virus was using
the bloodstream to disseminate throughout the body, but were not
strong enough evidence to rule out that spread was actually occurring
via other routes such as the lymphatic system.
Researchers at Oxford University's Clinical Research Unit at the
Hospital for Tropical Medicine in Ho Chi Minh City in Viet Nam, for
instance, reported in 2005 on a boy whose H5N1 infection spread to
his brain, causing encephalitis. The lead author of that report,
virologist Menno de Jong, said his group has found viral RNA in the
blood of about half of the H5N1 patients in which they've looked for
it. "It was really surprising for influenza, because the case reports
of human influenza and viremia are so rare," he said from Ho Chi Minh
City. "It's probably quite common in H5N1 infected patients."
That poses challenges for treating patients infected with H5N1,
because if the virus is spreading through the blood, so too must
drugs that aim to combat the infection. Currently there are only 4
flu antivirals on the market and one, zanamivir (sold as Relenza) is
administered to the respiratory tract by inhalation. The drug would
need to be formulated in an injectable form to be useful for systemic
infection, Dr. de Jong said.
It also raises concerns about infection control for health-care
workers and laboratory scientists coming in contact with the blood of
H5N1 patients -- although precautions against contact with blood are
widespread as a consequence of years of experience with blood-borne
infections like HIV and hepatitis C. "I think for this kind of flu,
infection control measures should include all bodily secretions,
basically," Dr. de Jong said.
The findings also raise questions about whether blood transfusions
could be a source of infection if H5N1 were to become a pandemic
strain. Canadian Blood Services and the American Red Cross have been
studying the issue, but currently it is believed that the risk is
more theoretical than real, because influenza's incubation period is
so short. Once people develop symptoms they would be unlikely to want
to give blood and would probably be turned away if they showed up to
a blood-donor clinic. "From the blood-donor and blood-supply point of
view, the issue would be whether there's virus in the blood before
the patient becomes ill," said Dr. Jeffrey McCullough, who holds an
American Red Cross professorship in transfusion medicine at the
University of Minnesota. "Once you've got somebody that's sick, of
course, they wouldn't be acceptable as a blood donor," he said.

difficult to evaluate. It is unlikely, however, that H5N1 virus
infection poses an enhanced risk for blood transfusion. - Mod.CP]
