An unidentified disease affecting cattle has emerged as a major cause of concern for farmers of Mayurbhanj district [map at https://tinyurl.com/y62fvjhb].

The worst hit are the marginal farmers of Khunta block. With a few healthy bullocks left in the area, the farmers have to shell out between Rs 1000 and Rs 1400 per hour [USD 13.90 to 19.46] on tractors to prepare their fields for transplanting paddy saplings. However, the poor farmers, who cannot afford to spend on tractors, have not yet started farming activities on their land.

The farmers said blood blisters appear on cattle's skin that lead to wounds after a few days. These blisters initially appear on joints of front legs of the cattle. Sources said apart from Khunta, cattle in Badasahi, Gopabandhunagar, Dharampur and Nuasahi of the district have been affected by the disease.

Veterinary doctor of Sankerka in Badasahi block Subhrakanta Rath said the disease is caused by virus and is curable.

He said the cattle are possibly affected by Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) or Postular Dermatitis. Rath said the farmers have been asked to take their cattle to the local veterinary hospital for immediate treatment. Additional Veterinary Officer Archana Sarangi said no cattle have yet died due to the disease.

She said blood and skin samples collected from the affected animals have been sent to the district laboratory. The report will shed more light on the disease.

[The above information adds some detail to the initial report by the same newspaper, published 20 Aug 2019, addressing LSD outbreaks in Odisha (20190822.6635505). It illuminates another devastating aspect of LSD upon agriculture, namely inactivation of draft animals. For a video clip showing draft animals at work in India, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihRwuejdbQw.

While fine-skinned _Bos Taurus_ cattle breeds such as Holstein-Friesian are highly susceptible to LSD, thick-skinned _Bos indicus_ breeds are known to present less severe signs of the disease. This may have delayed early recognition of the disease in Odisha, which is yet to be confirmed or otherwise. All age-groups are known to be susceptible to the disease.

LSD has been so far reported to be unknown in India, namely "never reported"; similarly, the disease has previously never been reported from any of India's neighbors. However, China has today notified the OIE on its 1st LSD event, situated in Xinjiang, on the border with eastern Kazakhstan (see https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31501). Notably, Xinjiang borders India's state Jammu and Kashmir; see map at https://www.newsweek.com/china-pakistan-warn-india-border-1452896#slideshow/1517778.

The location of the new outbreak in China has already been added in OIE's interactive map presenting all LSD outbreaks reported - globally - since 2005 (https://tinyurl.com/y28wazxv). China's outbreak is about 2300 km (approx. 1550 mi) distant from the current, yet to be diagnosed, cattle disease circulating in Odisha (north east India).

LSD is not zoonotic.

Any additional information on the suspected LSD event in Odisha, in particular confirmation or exclusion, will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
