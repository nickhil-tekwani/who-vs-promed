This message is to inform American citizens residing in or visiting Cuba that media reports have indicated that cases of cholera have been identified in the city of Havana, possibly linked to a reported outbreak of cholera in eastern Cuba. The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert noting the presence of cholera in Cuba and confirming that foreign travelers have contracted cholera during recent trips to Cuba.

Eating or drinking fecally contaminated food or water is the main risk factor. Unsterilized water, food from street vendors, raw fish dishes (e.g. ceviche) and inadequately cooked (e.g. steamed) shellfish are common sources of infection.

We urge you to follow public health recommendations and guidelines, such as safe food and water precautions and frequent hand washing, to help prevent cholera infection. The Cuban Ministry of Public Health is urging people to comply with sanitary measures associated with personal hygiene, water and food. The CDC and WHO both provide information about cholera to the travelling public.

[Mostly based on nongovernmental sources, it seems clear that the extent of cholera transmission in Cuba is greater than officially reported. This travel warning closely follows the PAHO report of 5 travelers from Italy, Chile, and Venezuela who acquired _Vibrio cholerae_ infection while in Havana. The cholera outbreak in Cuba began in July 2012 with a cluster of cases in eastern Granma Province and has spread mostly to other eastern provinces but also to Havana in the west and several more central areas.
