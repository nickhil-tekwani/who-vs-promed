[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) continues to spread in the area, now entering Russia through the Republic of Dagestan. If the disease has been clinically identified in Dagestan, how did it get there without being detected in Armenia, Azerbaijan and/or Georgia? The disease may very well be in these countries, but still not detected.

Based on available reports obtained from the OIE database, section "List of countries by disease situation", Georgia has reported LSD as a "disease never occurred" .Armenia and Azerbaijan have been reporting LSD as "disease absent". The date of last occurrence in Azerbaijan was reported as 25 Nov 2014. No date is available for Armenia. See http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist

The Republic of Dagestan, on the north-western shore of the Caspian Sea, can be located on the maps of Russia at http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/russia-political-enlarged-map.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3622855,47766

LSD has been spreading since 2012 throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Western Asia, and recently the Balkans. The countries already known to be infected are Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Cyprus (North), Greece, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Autonomous Territories, Syria (no official information submitted), and Turkey. LSD is endemic in Egypt since 1988. To see the location of outbreaks officially reported since 2012, including the new outbreaks in Dagestan, please go to OIE's interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/pfrx4ye (click on the cluster, zoom in).

Unless stamping out is applied immediately when the 1st case is detected in a hitherto LSD-free country, the disease is likely to become endemic in receptive conditions, such as the ones prevailing in the affected region.

To control its further spread, the application of mass vaccination deserves to be seriously considered. Wide scale LSD vaccinations have been applied in several of the infected countries since 2013, with scientific publication(s) of their results pending. The available vaccines are based on live attenuated strains of capripoxvirus, derived from large or small ruminants, such as the LSD virus strain from cattle in South Africa (Neethling); RM 65 sheep pox strain; Romanian sheep pox strain; Kenyan sheep and goat vaccine (KS-1 or 0240). The latter has been found to cause severe post-vaccination reactions in _Bos taurus_ breeds. Additional information on these vaccines is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.14_LSD.pdf. - Mod.AS]
