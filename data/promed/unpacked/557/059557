Two new rabies cases have cropped up in Cheshire [New Haven County],
adding to recent reports of rabid wildlife in the area, authorities
said.

A skunk that chased 2 dogs into their yard in the area of Dundee Road
has tested positive for rabies, and a raccoon that was attacked by 2
dogs in their fenced-in yard in the Greenwood Drive area has tested
positive, according to a release by Cheshire Animal Control.

The dogs in both cases were boostered against rabies. In the case of
the skunk, the dogs will be observed at home for 6 months due to
their vaccinations having expired, and in the other case, the dogs
will be confined to home for 45 days because their vaccinations were
current, the release stated.

Connecticut doesn't have outbreaks of rabies anymore, said Randall
Nelson, a public health veterinarian with the state Department of
Public Health. Rabies is basically here and circulating at a fairly
constant rate, he said.

A rabid coyote that attacked 3 people in a Westchester town was shot
Monday [6 Sep 2010]. The coyote killed by cops after attacks on
people in Westchester was rabid, health officials said Wednesday [8
Sep 2010].

The finding by the Westchester County Department of Health was the
1st confirmation of rabies in a coyote in the county.

The people bitten in the weekend [4-5 Sep 2010] attacks were being
treated for rabies even before the viral disease was confirmed in the
coyote.

A bat found in the Forest of Friendswood subdivision [Galveston and
Harris Counties] has tested positive for rabies, Friendswood Police
said after receiving a laboratory test report.

A resident contacted Friendswood Animal Control, a division of the
police department, on 27 Aug 2010 after finding a dead bat in the
backyard.

The bat was near a dog's bowl, which led the department to send the
bat for testing. Police said it is not known if the dog came in
contact with the bat, but as a precaution, the dog has received a
rabies booster and will be isolated at home for 45 days.

The Texas Department of State Health Services website reports that
laboratory-confirmed rabies cases often peak in September and
October. According to the site, humans should not touch bats or any
other unfamiliar animal.

Five wild animal attacks in Rutland [Rutland County] in the last 4
days have city and state officials warning about rabies.

Community Relations Officer Tim Tuttle said Wednesday [8 Sep 2010]
that 1 fox has already tested positive for the rabies virus.

"This morning we had a woodchuck attack a man and he had to beat it
off with a stick," Tuttle said. There was also an incident Wednesday
morning [8 Sep 2010] involving a raccoon that crossed the downtown
Rutland Shopping Plaza before city police located it and killed it.
On Sunday [5 Sep 2010] there were 2 fox attacks -- 1 involving a fox
that attacked Tuttle on Forest Street.

Tuttle said he was called to a home on Forest Street Sunday [5 Sep
2010] for a man who had been bit by a fox. While talking to the man,
the fox emerged from some bushes and raced toward the officer.

While one of the foxes and the raccoon were killed, the other animals
displaying signs of rabies are still at large, Tuttle said.

State Game Warden Jeff Whipple said there have been no reports of
suspected rabid animals in the communities around Rutland. However,
he said he had little doubt that most of the animals involved in
incidents with humans in the city this week [week of 5 Sep 2010] were
infected. "I'm sure both foxes are positive," he said.

A fox captured in Vernon Township [Sussex County] has been confirmed

Health officials have confirmed a 6th case of rabies in Salem County
this year [2010]. The infected animal was a raccoon in Salem City
that was fighting with a dog. Health Department officials said that
Animal Control Officer Ned Shimp found the raccoon on the corners of
Chestnut and Carpenter streets. The incident happened on 6 Sep 2010,
according to the Salem County Health Department.

The raccoon was dead, most likely hit by a car or died from injuries
received during the fight. The Salem County Health Department sent
the raccoon to the state lab to be tested. The state office recently
confirmed that the raccoon was rabid.

Currently, health officials said, the dog is confined, but animal
control has received complaints about this dog previously.

Health officials added they have been in contact with the owner and
the animal was vaccinated against rabies. The owner will be advised
to get the dog a booster shot and keep it away from other animals
while under observation for 45 days.

Salem County Health Officer Virginia Preesada said, "We have talked
with the owner about her options and I hope the dog will be fine.
Although unfortunate, this is a reminder to pet owners to vaccinate
against rabies. Rabies vaccination is important even if you do not
live in the rural area of the county."

The Mecklenburg County Health Department has confirmed that 2
raccoons found in Charlotte in recent days have tested positive for
rabies.

On Thu 2 Sep 2010, a rabid raccoon was discovered on Ashmore Drive
off Monroe Road. A 10-month-old Dalmatian was spotted by its owner
carrying the raccoon in its mouth. Officers with the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department's Animal Care & Control
Division were called to the home and the dog was seized by the
officers.

The results of a rabies test conducted on the raccoon came back on
Wednesday [8 Sep 2010] as positive. Since the Dalmatian was not
properly vaccinated, the family has the choice of either euthanizing
the dog, or having it quarantined at a veterinary facility at the
owner's expense. Typically, the cost associated with this is about
USD 10 000. [Costs vary depending on the veterinary facility, the
prices in the area, as well as state regulations - Mod.TG]

One individual who handled the dog is also receiving post exposure
rabies shots, a spokesman for the health department said.

On Sat 4 Sep 2010 a raccoon was found on Abingdon Road in south
Charlotte. The homeowner's dog chased the raccoon up a tree. The
owner came out, took the dog away, and shot the raccoon with a .22
rifle. This raccoon also tested positive for rabies. Since the
homeowner handled the raccoon, this person is also receiving post
exposure rabies shots. Since his dog was up-to-date with its rabies
vaccinations, the dog was not quarantined.

Pet owners should make sure their pet has a current rabies
vaccination. If your pet comes in contact with a rabid animal, the
vaccination could save its life.

A rabid bat found in an Omaha home with kids around. It raises some
big health concerns.

Bats in Omaha are usually a part of the night scenery but take
notice, a bat recently tested positive for rabies. A family with 2
children found 2 bats in their home last week. Now that the family
knows one of the bats had rabies, doctors urged them to take rabies
treatments as a precaution.

Even the Nebraska Humane Society is dealing with dozens of bat
related calls in recent weeks. Experts say if you encounter a bat and
want to capture it, make sure to wear gloves and use a piece of
cardboard to put it into a bag or coffee can. Don't crush it. If you
do, the Nebraska Humane Society won't be able to test it for rabies.

[As urban residents crowd into wildlife habitat it is inevitable that
wildlife will encounter domestic animals. Rabies may be one of those
viruses that come along.

However, there are some things residents should do to help deter the
unwanted wildlife. Residents should make sure trash is secure and
only place trash cans out on the collection days. Secure the lid with
a bungee cord to prevent animals from getting inside your trash.
Trash can function as a food source and an attraction for wildlife
seeking food.

Commercial food establishments and hotels with food services should
also be conscious of securing their trash bins from wild animals.
Overflowing restaurant trash bins are prime dining areas for raccoons
and foxes.

In a very busy suburban area hotel, I watched well fed raccoons raid
the hotel trash bin in a very well lit area. The hotel also had a
food service area, which likely served up scraps for the masked
raiders. Incidents such as these serve to provide a ready food
source, which is encouragement for wildlife to frequent certain areas.

Often wildlife will go unnoticed until a deadly disease drives them
more into the open. Keeping your pet vaccinated protects it against
the deadly consequences of an encounter with a rabid animal. It also
builds a level of protection around you, as your pet is in frequent
contact with you and your family. Vaccinating your pet is also a
means of protecting yourself. - Mod.TG]
