Two children from Dorset [England] are being treated in hospital for serious kidney problems following an _E. coli_ infection as investigations reopen into a previous cluster. Three other members of the same family are being tested for _E. coli_ O55.

A cluster of cases of the bacterial illness in Dorset was investigated in 2014 but no common source was found. Public Health England (PHE) said it was reviewing data but admitted it was unlikely to find a single source. A multi-agency team led by PHE and local authorities has been reconvened to investigate the outbreak.

Noeleen McFarland, from PHE, said the strain seemed to be "particular to Dorset. We will continue to investigate thoroughly if there is a potential point source."

One of the 2 children is being treated for hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) -- a complication of an _E. coli_ infection.

Results of tests for the strain of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ infection are awaited on the 2nd child.

The children were said to be "responding well" to treatment.

Parents in the county are being warned to make sure their children wash their hands thoroughly, especially after playing outside or with pets, and to cook meat well.

10 people in the Blandford area of Dorset were diagnosed with _E. coli_ O55 between July and November 2014. A further 2 cases were identified in Portland, 4 in Bournemouth and Poole as well as 3 cases outside the county which had links to people from Dorset. Nursery children were among those infected with the bacterial illness, which can lead to kidney problems in some cases. More than 500 people were swabbed in an attempt to find a common source.

Clusters of the strain had not been identified in England since records began in 1994. PHE said any previous cases of the O55 strain had been associated with travel.

[Unlike most outbreaks of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ which occur over a short length of time, this small cluster of the unusual O55 serotype has been a "slow burn" since July 2014 without clear evidence of a source. _E. coli_ O55:H7, interestingly, is thought to be a direct ancestor of _E. coli_ O157:H7 (Zhou Z, LI X, Liu B, et al: Derivation of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 from Its O55:H7 precursor. PLoS One 2010, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008700).
