Poliomyelitis in Chad
---------------------
Chad is experiencing outbreaks of both wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1 -
65 cases in 2011) and wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3 - 3 cases).

The WPV3 outbreak has been ongoing since November 2007, and Chad is
therefore considered to have re-established WPV3 transmission. A WPV1
outbreak began in September 2010 (as a result of a newly-imported
virus from northern Nigeria), and has since been intensifying.
Originally restricted to the greater N'Djamena area, WPV1 has spread
in 2011 to other areas of the country, to the south (including areas
bordering Central African Republic [CAR] and Cameroon) and to the east
(including areas bordering Sudan).

Historically, Chad has been associated with further international
spread of poliovirus. Between 2004 and 2006, WPV1 spread from eastern
Chad into Sudan, and subsequently to other areas of the Horn of
Africa, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Indonesia, resulting in 1230 cases in
these countries and over USD 500 million in international emergency
outbreak response costs. Additionally, in 2008 and 2009, WPV3 from
southern Chad spread into Cameroon and CAR.

The 2 outbreaks in Chad require urgent action to improve the quality
of vaccination activities in order to reach a higher proportion of
children with oral polio vaccine (OPV) across the entire country, and
particularly in the greater N'Djamena area, in the south and in the
east of the country. Due to gaps in the quality of acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) surveillance at subnational levels, additional
undetected WPV circulation cannot be ruled out.

To urgently address the situation, the Government of Chad with the
technical support of partners has just finalized a 6 month national
polio emergency plan. National immunization days (NIDs) using bivalent
OPV have been conducted in May [2011], with further supplementary
immunization activities (SIAs) planned for June [2011]. The Government
of Chad and partners are working to ensure that technical support is
allocated to priority areas; special strategies will be used to reach
high-risk populations and technical capacity to fill subnational
surveillance gaps will be scaled up. As part of efforts to increase
accountability for programme implementation, key indicators will be
regularly monitored. Under the National Polio Emergency Plan, heads of
district administrations will be charged with overseeing
implementation reviews following each SIA, and providing summaries
with clear outcomes and recommendations to provincial governors, whose
offices will oversee direct oversight of the operationalisation of the
plan. At the national level, monthly implementation reports will be
prepared by the Ministry of Health and shared with the office of the
Prime Minister.

Throughout 2010 and 2011, countries neighbouring Chad -- notably
Cameroon, CAR, and Sudan -- have all conducted multiple SIAs, to
minimise the risk of re-infection. It is important that countries
across central Africa and the Horn of Africa strengthen AFP
surveillance in order to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations
and facilitate a timely response. Countries should also continue to
boost routine immunization coverage against polio to further
strengthen population immunity and minimize the risk of any
importation.

Potential for international spread
----------------------------------
In 2010 and 2011, outbreak response has been inadequate. Given the
uncontrolled and widespread geographic transmission of both WPV
serotypes, historical spread to neighbouring countries, recent
geographic expansion of WPV1 across Chad (including close to the
borders with CAR and Sudan), the World Health Organization (WHO) rates
as high the risk of further international spread. With the Hajj
(pilgrimage to Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) expected to begin in
early November [2011] and Ramadan in early August [2011], it is
anticipated that pilgrims are now beginning to move across west and
central Africa, further increasing the risk of polio spread. The
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia last month [May 2011] issued polio vaccination
requirements for travellers to the Hajj.

WHO recommendation
------------------
WHO recommends that all travellers from polio-infected areas be fully
vaccinated prior to travel. As per recommendations outlined in WHO's
International travel and health (ITH), travelers to and from Chad
should be fully protected by vaccination. Travelers to Chad who have
in the past received 3 or more doses of OPV should be offered another
dose of polio vaccine before departure. Any unimmunized individuals
intending to travel to Chad require a complete course of vaccine.
Travelers from Chad should have a full course of vaccination against
polio before leaving Chad, with a minimum one dose of OPV before
departure. Some polio-free countries may also require travelers from
Chad to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa.

[From the description of the situation in Chad, there is significant
cause for concern -- the history of prior exportations of cases in
neighboring countries combined with an acknowledged weakness in acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance suggesting a high likelihood that
there are as yet undetected cases of polio, is a worrisome situation.
Now that Nigeria appears to be approaching interruption of
transmission, there seems to be a chance that Chad will replace
Nigeria as and exporter of cases in the region.

Geo News reported Thursday [9 Jun 2011] that 2 new cases of polio
have been confirmed in Peshawar and Bannu.

Deputy Director EPI [Expanded Programme on Immunization], Dr Janbaz
talking exclusively to Geo News said a 3-year old girl, who is a
resident of Qaziabad, was confirmed to have contracted poliovirus.

The 2nd case of polio was confirmed in Mir Mast area of Bannu where a
15-year old infant was found affected by the contagious disease.

Dr Janbaz said so far 3 cases of polio had been reported in Peshawar
during 2011.

He said a 3-day polio campaign would be undertaken in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa from [13 Jun 2011].

[According to The Global Polio Eradication Initiative website, as of
8 Jun 2011 there have been 49 cases of WPV1 associated polio in
Pakistan (see
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx).
In the accompanying update text (see [3] below) there is mention that
in the one week period ending 8 Jun 2011, there were 6 cases of polio
confirmed, all residents of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtoon and Gilgit
Baltistan. The 2 cases mentioned in the newswire above are from
Peshawar and Bannu, both situated in Kyhber Pakhtoon (formerly known
as NorthWest Frontier Province or NWFP) so it is unclear if these are
included in the 6 confirmed cases or if they are additional cases.

Wild poliovirus (WPV) cases confirmed as of 8 Jun 2011
------------------------------------------------------
Total cases: Year-to-date 2011 / Year-to-date 2010 / Total in 2010*
Globally: 195 / 288 / 1288
- in endemic countries: 64 / 56 / 232
- in non-endemic countries: 131 / 232 / 1056
* Data in WHO as of 8 Jun 2010 for 2010 data and 7 Jun 2011 for 2011
data.

Afghanistan
- One new case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from Hilmand),
bringing the total number of cases for 2011 to 4. The most recent case
had onset of paralysis on [9 May 2011] (WPV1 from Hilmand).
- 2 areas of south western Afghanistan (parts of Farah and all of
Zabul) conducted additional SIAs from [5-7 Jun 2011]; planned SIAs
will cover the same areas again from [12-14 Jun 2011].
- Following high-level visits by members of the Ministry of Public
Health, access was reportedly improved in a number of key, high-risk
areas, notably in Zabul province (which was inaccessible during
previous supplementary immunization activities - SIAs).

India
- No new cases were reported in the past week. There has been one
case reported this year [2011], with onset of paralysis on [13 Jan
2011] in West Bengal (WPV1) -- more than 4 months ago.
- Preparations are ongoing for the next SNIDs [supplementary national
immunization days] on [26 Jun 2011], with bivalent OPV, in key
high-risk states, notably Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal.
Technical support is again being redeployed from polio-free areas to
support the planning, implementation and monitoring of the activities
in the highest-risk districts.

Nigeria
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains 10. The most recent case had onset of paralysis
on [15 Apr 2011] (WPV3 from Kebbi).
- 6 of this year's 7 WPV1 cases are all genetically linked to
circulation of virus in Borno in 2010 and 2011 (3 Borno cases, 2
Jigawa cases from the same Local Government Area (LGA), and one case
from Sokoto). The 7th WPV1, from Kebbi state, is linked to circulation
in that state from last year [2010]. All 3 of this year's WPV3 cases
are also from Kebbi state. Mop-ups are being conducted in these and
other high-risk states to further strengthen population immunity
levels.
- In a 1st-of-its kind study in Nigeria, the field work for a
seroprevalence study in Kano has been completed. The outcomes of this
study will provide critical insight into population immunity levels
and efficacy of strategic implementation. Similar seroprevalence
studies conducted in 2010 and 2009 in India and Pakistan provided
crucial insight into those countries' eradication efforts, and helped
sensitize strategic approaches.
- The next polio immunization plus days (IPDs) are tentatively
planned for [25-28 Jun 2011], in 20 high-risk states, using bivalent
OPV.

Pakistan
- 6 new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s), from
Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtoon and Gilgit Baltistan, bringing the
total number of cases for 2011 to 49. The most recent case had onset
of paralysis on [23 May 2011] (WPV1 from Balochistan).
- The case in Gilgit Baltistan (the 1st in this part of Pakistan in
more than 12 years) is linked to virus transmission in the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). 2 large-scale outbreak response
campaigns are currently planned.
- The next SNIDs will take place on [13-15 Jun 2011], using bivalent
OPV.

Angola
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains 4. The most recent case (WPV1) had onset of
paralysis on [27 Mar 2011] in Kuando Kubango.
- A 2nd synchronized round with the Democratic Republic of the Congo
was held from [27-29 May 2011], using bivalent OPV. Further activities
in high-risk areas are tentatively planned for July [2011], in
highest-risk areas, again using bivalent OPV.

Central Asia and Russian Federation
- This region has not reported a case of wild poliovirus in more than
6 months. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [25 Sep 2010]
in the Russian Federation.

Chad
- 3 new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s), bringing
the total number of cases for 2011 to 63. The most recent case had
onset of paralysis on [4 May 2011] (WPV1 from Logone Occidental).
- Chad is experiencing outbreaks of both WPV1 (60 cases in 2011) and
WPV3 (3 cases in 2011). The WPV3 outbreak has been ongoing since
November 2007 while the WPV1 outbreak began in September 2010 (due to
a newly-imported virus from northern Nigeria).
- The WPV1 outbreak is of particular concern. Originally restricted
to the greater N'Djamena area, it has spread in 2011 to other areas of
the country, including to the south (close to the border with Central
African Republic) and to the east (close to the border with Sudan).
Historically, Chad has been associated with extensive international
spread of polio.
- To urgently address the situation, the Government of Chad has just
finalized a 6 month national polio emergency plan. Staggered NIDs took
place in the 2nd half of May [2011], using bivalent OPV. Further
activities are planned in July [2011]. SIAs are also taking place in
neighbouring countries, to minimise the risk and consequences of
potential spread of polio from Chad.

Congo and Gabon
- No new cases were reported in the past week. Both countries have
only reported one case each this year (both WPV1). This most recent
case in the Republic of Congo was reported with onset of paralysis on
[22 Jan 2011], and the case in Gabon had onset of paralysis on [15 Jan
2011].

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
- 4 new cases were reported in the past week (3 WPV1s from Kinshasa
and one WPV1 from Bas-Congo), bringing the total number of cases for
2011 to 54. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [9 May
2011] (WPV1 from Kinshasa).
- The Democratic Republic of the Congo participated in a synchronized
campaign with Angola from [26-28 May 2011]. Further activities in
high-risk areas are tentatively planned for June [2011]. It is
anticipated that the entire population would again be targeted in
Kinshasa.

Horn of Africa
- No cases have been reported from this group of countries this year
[2011]. However, a single positive environmental sample collected in
December 2010 from Aswan, Egypt was found to be genetically linked to
virus circulating in Sudan (Khartoum, northern Sudan, and Jonglei,
southern Sudan) in early 2009, indicating undetected circulation.
- Given the link with the Aswan environmental positive, and
intensification of the WPV1 outbreak in neighbouring Chad, Sudan is
carrying out several rounds to help counter any undetected
transmission. Trivalent OPV was added to a measles campaign in
Northern Darfur, Western Darfur, and Southern Darfur states held from
[14 May 2011], and SNIDs using bivalent OPV are planned for Northern,
Red Sea, Khartoum, and Nile States to be held from [20 Jun 2011].
- Additionally, immunization posts are being set up at key border
crossings and gathering sites, including in the Darfur provinces in
western Sudan and in Port Sudan, on the Red Sea coast (from where many
populations leave towards the Arabian peninsula).
- At the same time, substantial subnational surveillance gaps remain
in some areas, notably along the Uganda/Kenya border area (affected by
an outbreak in 2009 which went undetected into 2010) -- undetected
circulation cannot be ruled out at this stage. SNIDs were held in
border areas of Uganda on [16 May 2011] and in Kenya on [4 Jun 2011].
Last month's [May 2011] Horn of Africa TAG [Technical Advisory Group]
put forward key recommendations, both to improve population immunity
levels, and to rapidly fill subnational surveillance gaps.

West Africa
- No new cases were reported in the past week. A total of 8 cases
(all WPV3s) have been reported from west Africa in 2011 (one from
Burkina Faso, 3 from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Mali, and one from Niger).
The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [20 Mar 2011] (WPV3
from Mali).
- Response to the WPV3 outbreak is continuing across west Africa.
Multi-country synchronized campaigns are planned for [23 Jun 2011] in
10 countries of the region, with a further activity planned in Cote
d'Ivoire in July [2011].

[Reviewing the weekly cumulative case counts by country as of 8 Jun
2011, there are 4 countries with double-digit case reports since 1 Jan
2011: Pakistan (49 cases), Nigeria (10 cases), DR Congo (54 cases),
and Chad (63 cases). These 4 countries represent a combined total of
176 reported cases or 90.3 percent of all reported cases to date this
year (2011). 2 of these countries are considered endemic countries
(Pakistan and Nigeria) while the other 2 are not (DR Congo and Chad),
but were re-infected after interruption of transmission. Countries
with dates of onset of most recent case in 2011 include: Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Nigeria, India, DR Congo, Chad, Angola, Mali, Cote
d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Congo, Niger, and Gabon -- the 4 endemic
countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and India), and 9
additional non-endemic countries, all in Africa.
