Philippines appeals for help in probing pig virus
-------------------------------------------------
The Philippine government has appealed for
international help in investigating an outbreak
of the Ebola Reston virus that has for the 1st
time infected pigs but is not harmful to humans,
officials said Friday [19 Dec 2008]. Bureau of
Animal Industry Director Davinio Catbagan this
week [15-19 Dec 2008] wrote to the Rome-based
Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO]
requesting official assistance, after authorities
quarantined 3 hog farms in the northern Philippines.

The Agriculture Department said in a statement it
sent 28 pigs' tissue samples for testing to the
Plum Island Animal Disease Center in the U.S. and 6 were found positive.

Dr. Angel Mateo, director of the bureau's Animal
Welfare Division, said Friday no pigs had died of
Ebola Reston and a 2nd round of local tests
showed animals were no longer infected. "At the
moment, the test results from the quarantined
area are negative," he said, adding more tests were planned.

Authorities say the Ebola Reston virus -- 1st
discovered among crab-eating monkeys south of
Manila in 1989 -- has caused no known illness
among humans. But this is the 1st time the virus
has infected pigs. Ebola's 3 other subtypes --
the Zaire, Sudan and Cote d'Ivoire strains -- can
cause deadly hemorrhagic fever in humans,
according to the World Health Organization [WHO].

"We're treating this as a matter of low public
health risk," said Caroline-Ann Coulombe, a WHO
officer in Manila. "But this is a new animal
species (to be infected), and in the Philippines
particularly swine are in contact with humans and
we do feel it needs more investigation." She said
the WHO was awaiting an official invitation to
send a team of experts to the Philippines.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday [19 Dec
2008] that the Philippine government waited until
10 Dec 2008 to make the presence of the virus
public, although Manila authorities were notified
as early as 30 Oct 2008. The health and
agriculture secretaries took pains to assure the
public that pork is safe to eat if it is cooked
well -- even munching on roast pig during a 10 Dec 2008 news conference.

In the letter to FAO, Catbagan said the
Philippines has consistently acted in a
"transparent and responsible" manner in dealing
with the outbreak. That includes putting pork
exports on hold, and canceling a plan to send the
1st ever shipment to Singapore.

When I was working at the Philippines Animal
Health Centre in the early 1990s, I remember
discussing the Ebola-Reston issue with Filipino
colleagues in the Bureau of Animal Industry who
were involved in trying to understand what had
happened. If I remember correctly, the primate
trade for medical research was a very complex and
not exactly transparent exercise. I recall that
premises which had housed monkeys from the
Philippines (offically only captive bred but
unofficially thought to be a mixture of captive
bred and wild caught) had also housed, even if
only temporarily in transit, monkeys from Africa.

Therefore, it seemed to me at the time that it
was possible that the Ebola-Reston virus could
conceivably have come from Africa, not
necessarily from the Philippines, and infected
Philippine monkeys there. One has to wonder if
the virus could have moved from there into
indigenous species capable of constituting a
reservoir (e.g., shrews, rodents, bats) and from
there infecting swine, both indigenous and
domesticated. It is an interesting scenario but,
of course, I could be completely wrong.

[I was working at WHO/HQ, Geneva in 1989 when the
Reston outbreak occurred. It was determined by
WHO that the Philippine monkeys were indeed held
for some hours in an airport transit warehouse
that also held a cage with 2 monkeys from Africa,
but those were tested and found to be negative. - Mod.JW]

Farm chief assures Visayas, Mindanao versus ebola fears
-------------------------------------------------------
Amid worries by local groups of possible
contamination of their livestock, the Department
of Agriculture has assured that hogs outside
Luzon are, so far, free from the Ebola Reston virus.

"I'm personally confident that the Visayas and
Mindanao were not affected at all by the virus,"
a statement Thursday [18 Dec 2008] quoted
Agriculture Secretary Arthur C. Yap as saying.

2 weeks ago, the local livestock industry was
alarmed over the reported detection of the Ebola
Reston strain in 2 farms in Luzon, since Misamis
Oriental and this city has had reports of hog
cholera virus among backyard hog farms. The city
earlier reported 2000 hog fatalities, while the
province of Misamis Oriental had another 300.

Regional Agriculture officials, however, said the
hog deaths were due to unhygienic hog management
and delayed implementation of a program for
small-scale hog raisers. The city and provincial
veterinary offices have since been waging widespread vaccination campaigns.

The country's 1st shipment of pork meat to
Singapore from South Cotabato had been put on
hold when the Ebola report came out.

[The Philippines' notification to the OIE, dated
10 Dec 2008, addressed -- in the epidemiological
comments -- 2 affected locations:

1. Pandi municipality, district of Sto Nino,
Bulacan province, Luzon (where "the mortality was
mostly observed in piglets"). Pandi is situated
about 45 km northern to Manila; see interactive map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=Bulakan&countryCode=+#map=14.86667,120.95|10|4&bd=useful_information&loc=%20:14.86667:120.95:14|Pandi|Pandi,%20Province%20of%20Bulacan,%20Philippines>.


2. Talavera municipality, district of
Pinagpanaan, Nueva Ecija province, Luzon (where
"all animals were downers with clinical signs
suggestive of Porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS)/Classical swine
fever/Porcine circovirus type 2"). Talavera is
situated almost 100 km northern to Pandi; see interactive map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=Bulakan&countryCode=+#map=15.06574,121.29588|9|4&bd=useful_information&loc=%20:15.61667:120.93333:14|Talavera|Talavera,%20Province%20of%20Nueva%20Ecija,%20Philippines>.


The comments added: "The Philippines has
experienced a sudden increase in mortalities in
pigs in the latter part of the 2nd quarter of
2007 until the 1st quarter of 2008. The clinical
signs exhibited by the diseased animals indicated
atypical infection, which can be attributed to more than one pathogen.

"Samples from the outbreaks were sent to the USDA
Plum Island laboratory. Results show that samples
were positive for porcine circovirus type 2 and
atypical PRRS virus, which is 98 percent
homologous to the atypical PRRS virus isolated in
China and Viet Nam. With high morbidity and
mortality observed similar to China and Viet Nam,
it was concluded that these outbreaks were most
likely caused by atypical PRRS virus.

"The USDA Plum Island laboratory also reported to
have isolated Reston Ebola virus from swine samples."

It will be interesting to note the date(s) and
location(s) of sampling(s) in relation to the
samples which were later found Ebola-Reston-virus
positive in the Plum Island laboratory. According
to media reports, 4 farms in Luzon were affected.

For the OIE notification, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7596>.

The following comments are derived from
FAO/EMPRES review "Disease Situation in Philippine Swine" (Dec 2008):

"1. So what is happening in the Philippines?
Medical, veterinary and biological experts
require further evaluation of the situation.
Testing for the presence of the Ebola-Reston
virus in swine populations, animal handlers and
wildlife species will be helpful to begin to
understand the laboratory findings, how the pigs
may have become infected and potential spill over
to humans. The research required will take time
-Â­ with the earliest results expected in weeks to
months. Though it is too early to know, there are
no reports of sick or ailing people that have had
contact with the pigs according to the Philippine
Ministry of Health and the Bureau of Animal Industry.

"2. Does Reston-Ebola cause disease in pigs?
This remains unknown although it is known that
they can become infected. While it is true that
there were illness and fatalities on the farms
where the Reston-Ebola infected pigs were bred
and raised, other isolated microbes may have been
the cause of the outbreaks and not the
Reston-Ebola virus acting alone. It will be
important to separate the different pathogens
isolated from the sick or dying pigs from the
Philippines and once the different pathogens have
been purified, the necessary and specific
laboratory tools (called "reagents") can be
developed to test swine and other animals
throughout the Philippines and see how extensive
the infection is and undertake humane laboratory
controlled studies in previously non-exposed pigs."

Dr Roeder's commentary is much appreciated; the
possibility that the virus could have moved from
infected monkeys "into indigenous species capable
of constituting a reservoir (e.g., shrews,
rodents, bats) and from there infecting swine,
both indigenous and domesticated," deserves consideration.
