Wild birds are natural hosts and reservoirs for all types of avian influenza viruses. In this current wave, the continuous increase of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds, is due predominantly to HPAI subtype H5N1. The detection of this virus in different countries and regions is a clear indication of the role of wild birds in the spread of the disease.
