Southeast NSW [New South Wales] shearing contractors say they have less work due to the spread of foot rot in sheep flocks.

After a foot rot outbreak last year [2014], some farmers have removed thousands of sheep and others have got out of sheep entirely.

A Bombala shearing contractor said foot rot was going to decrease the number of local jobs. "It's going to be worse than the drought -- I can see that coming because in the drought numbers reduced slowly but in this [situation] numbers have reduced drastically," he said.

"In October, November, December when we're usually at our busiest we'll probably only have enough work for one team instead of being flat out with 2 teams."

He said the quarantine process cost farmers and that would flow through to the local community. "Those wages from the shearers and the roustabouts they just don't go through the economy anymore, they've just gone. Plus the effect on the grazier to have to restock, whether that's buying cattle or trying to get rid of the foot rot, it's going to really affect Bombala and the surrounding area economically."

The contractor downplayed the severity of the foot rot suggesting some cases he had seen appeared closer to what is commonly called foot scald.

"I think it's just foot scald because I can remember what foot rot used to be like in the 1960s and 1970s and it was nothing like this," he said. "Back then they'd be down on their knees, the sheep wouldn't cut any wool, their bellies would be matted, they'd be in a mess and you could smell it when you'd walk into the shearing shed -- whereas this time the signs just aren't there."

A grazier from Mila, was quarantined with virulent foot rot. He made the decision to get out of sheep altogether. "It's a significant impact on the district it wouldn't take much to justify economically that this will cost the area $8-10 million [about USD 6.4-8 million] in the next couple of years," he said.

[Foot rot is a contagious bacterial disease of sheep and goats, caused by the organism _Dichelobacter nodosus_ in association with a number of other bacteria.

There are many strains of _D. nodosus_ and they vary in the severity of the disease they cause. In an infected flock, several strains of _D. nodosus_ may be present. For regulatory purposes, foot rot infection is classified as either benign or virulent at the flock level.

With full expression, virulent foot rot is a severe, debilitating disease with significant economic loss from reduced wool growth and quality, poor ewe fertility, poor growth rates, losses from blowfly strike, and reduced value of sale sheep. In infected flocks, there are also significant costs associated with the control of the disease.

Because of these animal welfare and economic impacts virulent foot rot is a notifiable disease in NSW with regulatory support for compulsory eradication programs in infected flocks.
Topics include:
- The NSW Foot rot Strategic Plan
- Foot rot - the disease
- Strain differentiation
- Distinguishing between the forms of foot rot
- Foot rot scoring guide
- Dealing with foot rot
- Phases of an eradication program
- Foot rot in goats
- Foot rot in cattle

Foot rot eradication strategies in southern NSW are based on a predictable spread period in spring, combined with hot dry summers that provide a reliable non-spread period suited to undertaking eradication inspections.
