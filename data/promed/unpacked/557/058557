The death from type A influenza of a 34-year-old man with no apparent underlying health conditions sparked an investigation on [Thu 7 Feb 2019] by the health ministry and highlighted the pressure under which hospitals were operating.

To date, 40 serious cases of type A flu have been diagnosed, of which 7 have resulted in death.

Authorities on [Thu 7 Feb 2019] were investigating the death of the 34-year-old apparently from type A flu after his family complained that he had repeatedly not been properly treated before died in hospital on [Wed 6 Feb 2019].

Health Minister Constantinos Ioannou said he had asked for a report on the death while police ordered the man's funeral, scheduled for Thursday, to be postponed pending a post-mortem.

The man, who died from respiratory failure, apparently did not have any underlying health problems.

"Depending on the findings we will take the necessary measures," the minister said.

The [man], father of a small child, first visited Larnaca hospital on the morning of [30 Jan 2019] but left because it was too busy and returned in the afternoon. [His] family have since filed charges of medical negligence with Larnaca's CID [Criminal Investigation Department].

Reports said the man was diagnosed with laryngitis, was given cortisone and told to get flu medicine from a pharmacy before he was sent home.

His condition worsened the next day and he was rushed to hospital where he was given oxygen. He returned on [Fri 1 Feb 2019] and was discharged after being treated with oxygen anew, reports said.

On Saturday afternoon [2 Feb 2019], he visited a private hospital where doctors found low oxygen levels and he was rushed to Larnaca general and admitted to the ICU. His family asked that he be transferred to Nicosia where there was an intensivist around the clock but Nicosia said it had no beds. Relatives contacted a party leader who spoke to Nicosia general hospital administration and secured his transfer to Nicosia, where he died early on [Wed 6 Feb 2019].

The health minister said on [Thu 7 Feb 2019] there was a shortage of vaccines in the private sector, which has asked the ministry for fresh supplies. The health services admitted that vaccine stocks for type A flu are currently under 2000.

During a discussion in parliament, it was also said that 90 per cent of people classified as being high-risk have not been inoculated.

Chiming in, former state pathologist Marios Matsakis cited a case known to him, where a 75-year-old woman died after exhibiting symptoms of influenza A. The incident occurred about 2 weeks ago, Matsakis said. The woman had been admitted to Paphos general hospital after fracturing her hip. While waiting to be operated on, she contracted the flu and was transferred to the ICU of the Limassol general hospital, where she died.

In a statement, the health ministry's Surveillance and Control of Infectious Diseases unit said that although the public should be vigilant, there was no cause for panic. Not everyone coming down with the flu needs to be hospitalised, it added.

This year, the flu bout arrived in Cyprus early, in January [2019].

There have been 282 serious flu cases and 52 deaths, 13 in the past week, since the epidemic started last year [2018], the Higher Health Institute's Influnet surveillance network said [Thu 7 Feb 2019] .

The number of severe cases and deaths has risen over the past week, it said.

The rate of contagion has peaked with 832 000 new cases in a week.

Some 80 percent of serious cases and 85 percent of deaths have involved at least one pre-existing chronic illness, Influnet said.

https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/France-winter-flu-epidemic-worsens-as-more-than-1000-people-die-and-some-strains-resistant-to-vaccination


The seasonal 'flu epidemic in France is the most serious of recent years, with more than 1000 people having already died, and 2 strains of the virus appearing largely resistant to the 'flu vaccination.

An epidemic has been declared in all regions of mainland France. More than 1100 people have died so far this winter [2018-19], according to the weekly bulletin from health agency Santé Publique France (SPF).

All figures from medical sources -- such as the number of doctor appointments, and admissions to hospital -- suggest that the 'flu virus is still spreading and may be worsening.

More than 12 000 'flu patients were seen by emergency medical services across the country last week [week of 28 Jan 2019], with 1823 being hospitalised due to their condition -- a rise of 70% compared to the week before, according to figures from the French emergency department network Oscour.

Most hospitalisations are among people aged over 75 (43%) or children under 5 (15%), but this still marks around 3% of people with 'flu being hospitalised, a rise from the 1.8% seen the week before.

Among those to have died from the condition, most are aged over 65.

Despite vaccinations against the 'flu having been rising in recent years, 2 strains in particular appear to be especially virulent. Yet, figures from late last year [2018] show that just 42.9% of people who were eligible for a free vaccination had taken up the offer.

According to SPF, the vaccine has been deemed of "moderate" protection (59%) against the A(H1N1) virus, and of "slight" protection (19%) against the A(H3N2). A statement from SPF said: "These preliminary results come from the Sentinelles network, which creates an estimation of the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent an infection that would require the patient to see a doctor. These estimates will be refined in the coming weeks."

Although it is now too late to have a 'flu vaccination this year [2019], the Direction Générale de la Santé has issued advice for anyone who comes down with the illness.

Most people will not need to go to the doctor if they have 'flu, and should instead stay at home to rest, making sure to drink enough water, and take regular paracetamol.

You should only go to the doctor if your condition suddenly gets worse, if you are pregnant, if your baby has 'flu, if your temperature rises above 40 deg C [104 deg F], or if you have serious problems such as difficulty breathing, passing out, or coughing up blood, or if you know you are immuno-compromised.

Certain measures to avoid the 'flu or stop it spreading may help, such as regular hand-washing, using a tissue only once, wearing a disposable mask over your nose and mouth, or avoiding contact with people who are especially young or old.

Pregnant women, or those with compromised immune systems, should also be especially careful.

In India, a seasonal outbreak of influenza has been spreading across the country. Hundreds of people have died of the illness so far this year [2019]. The health ministry is calling for people to stay alert for possible infection.

India's National Centre for Disease Control says that as of Sun 3 Feb 2019], 226 people had died and more than 6700 had tested positive for the swine-origin virus H1N1.

The worst-hit area is the northwestern state of Rajasthan, where 85 people have died and more than 2300 are infected.

The winter there has been colder than usual, which is said to have worsened the outbreak. Local media say the health ministry has dispatched a public health team to Rajasthan to assess the situation and provide assistance.

Hospitals are preparing quarantine areas to prevent the disease from spreading, but now medical workers are also becoming infected.

The symptoms caused by the H1N1 virus are similar to other influenza, such as high fevers and sore throats.

The health ministry is urging people to take sufficient hygiene measures and avoid crowded places.

Japan is suffering a serious influenza outbreak. During the week from [21 to 27 Jan 2019], an average of 57.09 influenza patients per facility was reported among the roughly 5000 designated medical facilities nationwide, marking the highest level since statistics were first kept in 1999. An average of 30 patients per facility is the criterion for prefectures in Japan to issue an influenza-outbreak warning. The influenza strains detected over the past 5 weeks have been divided roughly equally between the type-A strain that caused a global pandemic in 2009 and type-A Hong Kong flu.

The prefectures with the highest level of infection for [21 to 27 Jan 2019] were Saitama (84.09), Niigata (77.70), Chiba (73.00), Miyagi (69.81), Kanagawa (67.94), Tochigi (67.00), Ōita (65.45), Nagano (69.81), and Tokyo (64.18).

Based on reports from the designated facilities, it is estimated that 2.23 million people underwent medical consultations in Japan for influenza from [21 to 27 Jan 2019], an increase compared to the 2.13 million estimated for the previous week. A total of 8928 schools, daycare centers, and other educational institutions closed temporarily during the last week of January [2019] due to influenza outbreaks, an increase over the 6343 for the prior week.

From the start of the 2018-19 influenza season in September 2018 to late January 2019, a total of 12 642 people were hospitalized in Japan for the virus, of whom those 60 and older accounted for 8021 or 63%. Widespread influenza outbreaks at nursing homes in Maebashi, Gunma Prefecture, and Awaji, Hyogo prefecture, led to numerous later deaths from pneumonia and other causes, highlighting the need for particular caution to be exercised among elderly persons with low resistance to infectious diseases.

The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare is calling on people with influenza to wear nonwoven-fabric masks when going out in public to prevent infecting others when coughing or sneezing. People without masks should cover their nose and mouth with a tissue, avert their face, and maintain a distance of at least one meter from others.

[7] USA (4 states): school closures

https://weather.com/health/cold-flu/news/2019-02-06-flu-cdc-alabama-schools-closed


An outbreak of the flu this week [week of 4 Feb 2019] in Alabama, Idaho, North Carolina, Mississippi has closed multiple schools, with school officials struggling to find enough healthy teachers to teach.

According to the latest CDC Influenza report, 25 states are experiencing high levels of the virus. The CDC's measure (as shown in the map [at the source URL above]) shows how outpatient flu visits to hospitals compare to geographic averages when there's no flu.

45 states are reporting "widespread" flu activity, a measure of the rate of spread of the flu virus, according to the CDC's report.

Alabama
-------
The schools were closed for the last 3 days of the week because of the number of cases of flu among students and employees.

Lawrence county Schools Superintendent Jon Bret Smith told news outlets that Moulton Elementary School and Moulton Middle School would be closed Wednesday through Friday [6-8 Feb 2019].

Smith said the school system is having trouble finding substitute teachers because of staff absences.

School officials said families should use the 3 days off to recover from the illness. Smith said anyone with flu should stay home for at least 5 days.

School employees planned to clean and sanitize both schools during the time off.

The closure does not apply to Lawrence County High School.

Moulton is about 45 miles [about 72 km] southwest of Huntsville.

Mississippi
-----------
Two public school districts and one private school in northern Mississippi were closed [Fri 8 Feb 2019] because of an increase in flu cases.

News outlets reported that the North Tippah School District and the South Tippah School District canceled classes because of the illness. Tupelo Christian Preparatory School was also closed. The Tippah school districts reported nearly 350 students were absent [Thu 7 Feb 2019].

North Tippah School District Superintendent Bill Brand said closing the school would allow staff to clean each classroom thoroughly to help remove the germs that cause influenza.

North Carolina
--------------
Ashe county Public Schools canceled classes for both students and staff on [Fri 8 Feb 2019] because of a local increase in flu cases. Superintendent Phyllis Yates says 452 students were out sick from the system's 5 schools and early learning center. Another 38 students who came to school were sent home.

Yates also says 30 teachers are out sick and substitutes couldn't be found to replace them.

Yates said work crews would deep clean and disinfect the schools on [Fri 8 Feb 2019] with hopes of reopening on [Mon 11 Feb 2019].

Idaho
-----
Three Idaho school districts have been forced to close amid one of the state's worst flu seasons in recent memory.

Firth, Shelley, and Fremont school districts in eastern Idaho recently have closed their schools because of the high number of absent students sick with flu-like illnesses, the Idaho State Journal reported .

Health officials are strongly encouraging parents to keep their children home from school if they're sick. They also are urging everyone to wash their hands as much as possible.

Firth School District's schools closed [Mon 4 Feb 2019] because of the flu. Shelley School District announced its schools would be closed Monday and Tuesday [4-5 Feb 2019].

The Fremont School District shut down [Fri 1 Feb 2019] after nearly 1/3 of its students didn't attend Thursday because of flu-like illnesses. The district announced inclement weather led its schools to close again [Mon 4 Feb 2019].

The Madison County School District also is reeling from the flu. 3 of its schools shut down last week after teachers and students got sick.

The flu spreads via saliva, mucus and bodily fluids, health officials say. Coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose also can spread it.

"It falls out of the air and lands on a shopping cart, remote controls, and doorknobs," Eastern Idaho Public Health surveillance epidemiologist Mike Taylor said. "Wash your hands frequently. When you leave a public area, sanitize and wash your hands."

This year's flu season [2018-19] has been a strange one, says Tom Haupt of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services [DHS].

"The bug seems to be taking it's time and doing what it wants to do," he said.

Although some hospitals are limiting visitors, the annual influenza sickness which brings fever, coughing, aches, and chills still has hasn't peaked and could linger into late March [2019], he said.

According to DHS, statewide flu levels are moderate, with lower levels indicated in Northeast Wisconsin. About 1643 people have tested positive for the virus, and influenza-associated hospitalizations have slightly increased, with 405 patients reported as of [26 Jan 2019].

That's a big drop from last year [2018] at this time, when 3809 Wisconsinites were hospitalized.

This season [2018-19], 6 people in the state have died from influenza, and 5 of those persons were over the age of 65.

Lower numbers could mean this year's flu vaccine was a good match, said Fond du Lac County Health Officer Kim Mueller.

"Testing by the state has indicated the flu virus making the rounds this year is type A and that's what is in the vaccine that was developed," she said.

Haupt confirmed the primary virus is H1N1 -- a combination of swine, avian, and human genes which mixed together in pigs and spread to humans. Although it caused a pandemic in 2009, it is now considered a typical, seasonal flu, known to target children and younger adults.

Last year's [2017-18] severe flu season, when Wisconsin had 20 208 cases of influenza, was the highest year on record and prompted more people to opt for this year's vaccine, Mueller said. A total of 7530 people in the state were hospitalized due to flu-related complications, and 379 people died -- twice as many as the year before and including 3 children.

Currently the state's vaccine rate is at 37% -- up from last year, but short of the 70% goal.

In an effort to prevent the spread of the flu, ThedaCare hospitals in Appleton, Neenah, Shawano, New London, Waupaca, Berlin, and Wild Rose are limiting visitors. Children age 12 and under will not be allowed to visit patients, except for siblings in the obstetrics unit and only if they are healthy.

Visitors are highly encouraged to wear masks and frequently wash or sanitize hands while at the hospital.

"The flu is a serious, contagious respiratory illness that is best avoided by staying away from other sick people, if possible, and washing your hands well with soap and water and getting vaccinated," said Dr. Jennifer Frank, Chief Medical Officer, Clinically Integrated Network at ThedaCare.

Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee had 4 hospitalizations this week and 7 outpatient influenza cases diagnosed, said spokesperson Gerry Steele. At this point, visitors under the age of 12 are restricted from visiting the health network's birth centers at Froedtert, Community Memorial and St. Joseph's Hospitals.

Influenza is a contagious disease caused by viruses which infect the respiratory tract. It can cause mild to severe illness, with symptoms that include fever, headache, tiredness, dry cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, and body aches.

Counties are only required to keep records of influenza-related hospitalizations, but Northeast Wisconsin health officials say there have been no anecdotal reports of any wide-spread illness in schools or facilities for the elderly.

Winnebago County Health Department reports 13 influenza hospitalizations and public health nurse supervisor Kim Goffard said they haven't seen a lot of illness.

Health officials urge it is not too late to get the flu vaccine. Locations which provide it can be found on the Centers for Disease Control website, under its vaccine flu finder link. Plenty of vaccine is still available at local pharmacies, from healthcare providers and some county health departments.

It takes about 10 days to 2 weeks to develop full immunity after the vaccine.

https://wlos.com/news/local/flu-on-the-rise-in-north-carolina-6-deaths-reported-so-far


Influenza activity is rising in North Carolina as we move closer to the peak of the 2018-19 flu season. Although vaccination early in the season is preferred, it is never too late to get vaccinated and help protect yourself and others from the spread of this dangerous, sometimes deadly virus.

During the week ending on [2 Feb 2019], 6 influenza-associated deaths were reported and the total number of influenza-associated deaths reported this season is now 35. This does not represent all flu-associated deaths in the state, since many go undiagnosed or unreported.

"Flu will be circulating, and infection rates will likely remain high at least for the next several weeks," said State Epidemiologist Zack Moore, MD, MPH. "Getting vaccinated now is the best way to protect yourself and those you come in contact with."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccination against the flu for everyone 6 months and older. In addition to reducing the risk of infection, vaccination against the flu can make illness milder for those who do get sick and reduces the risk of more serious outcomes. Flu vaccinations are available at hospitals, pharmacies, private medical offices, some federally qualified healthcare centers and local health departments.

The number of flu-associated deaths reported in North Carolina since 2009 has varied from nine during the 2011-2012 season to 391 during the 2017-2018 season. This serves as a reminder that flu can be a serious illness, especially for adults over age 65, children under 5, pregnant women, and those with certain medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.

Everyone should use precautions to protect against the spread of flu and other viruses, including:
- wash hands frequently, preferably with soap and water or an approved hand sanitizer;
- cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then discard the tissue promptly;
- if you are sick with flu, staying home until you have been fever-free for at least 24 hours.

Anyone who thinks they have the flu should contact their doctor right away to see if they need treatment with a prescription antiviral drug, such as Tamiflu. Early treatment with an antiviral drug can help prevent flu infections from becoming more serious. Treatment with a prescription antiviral drug is especially important for hospitalized patients, people with severe flu illness and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications based on their age or health.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/08/flu-cases-across-australia-almost-three-times-last-years-summer-average


An "unusually high" number of people have been hit with the flu this summer [2018-19] in New South Wales [NSW] -- double the numbers recorded in 2018.

NSW Health said on [Fri 1 Feb 2019] there had been 2196 confirmed cases of influenza across the state in the 5 weeks to [3 Feb 2019].

While it is not unusual for a spike in flu cases at this time of year, as people return from holidays in the colder northern hemisphere, the national reporting rate is almost 3 times the average, the department said.

"In NSW, our rate has doubled from notifications in January last year [2018] but thankfully once home in summer temperatures, influenza doesn't tend to spread as easily from person to person," Dr Vicky Sheppeard said in a statement.

The department has recommended that pregnant women due to give birth before April [2019] get a free flu shot from their GP or pharmacist.

"For the rest of us, it is best to wait until the 2019 flu vaccine becomes available in April or May," Sheppeard said.

ref: Chiharu Kawakami, Seiya Yamayoshi, Miki Akimoto, et al. Genetic and antigenic characterisation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses isolated in Yokohama during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons. Euro Surveill. 2019; 24(6): pii=1800467]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background: Influenza A(H3N2) virus rapidly evolves to evade human immune responses, resulting in changes in the antigenicity of haemagglutinin (HA). Therefore, continuous genetic and antigenic analyses of A(H3N2) virus are necessary to detect antigenic mutants as quickly as possible.

Aim: We attempted to phylogenetically and antigenically capture the epidemic trend of A(H3N2) virus infection in Yokohama, Japan during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons.

Methods: We determined the HA sequences of A(H3N2) viruses detected in Yokohama, Japan during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons to identify amino acid substitutions and the loss or gain of potential N-glycosylation sites in HA, both of which potentially affect the antigenicity of HA. We also examined the antigenicity of isolates using ferret antisera obtained from experimentally infected ferrets.

Results: Influenza A(H3N2) viruses belonging to 6 clades (clades 3C.2A1, 3C.2A1a, 3C.2A1b, 3C.2A2, 3C.2A3, and 3C.2A4) were detected during the 2016/17 influenza season, whereas viruses belonging to two clades (clades 3C.2A1b and 3C.2A2) dominated during the 2017/18 influenza season. The isolates in clades 3C.2A1a and 3C.2A3 lost one N-linked glycosylation site in HA relative to other clades. Antigenic analysis revealed antigenic differences among clades, especially clade 3C.2A2 and 3C.2A4 viruses, which showed distinct antigenic differences from each other and from other clades in the antigenic map.

Conclusion: Multiple clades, some of which differed antigenically from others, co-circulated in Yokohama, Japan during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons.
