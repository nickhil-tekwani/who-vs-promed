The Philippines Department of Health in the Western Visayas [Region VI] reported 17 human rabies deaths during the 1st 5 months of the year [2019], the 2nd in the list of most affected regions in the country, following Central Luzon [Region III].

This is the same number of human rabies deaths reported in all of 2018. This has prompted health officials to call on the public to become responsible pet owners.

Program coordinator of the region's Rabies Prevention and Control Program Ame Liz G. Mardoquio said Negros Occidental [province] reported the most deaths [in the region]. Aklan and Iloilo provinces each had 3 deaths; Capiz, 2; while Iloilo City had one death. Six of the deaths were children less than 13 years old.

The number of unvaccinated dogs in Legazpi City [in Region V, Bicol] is high; this is, according to officials, due to running out of rabies vaccine. Based on the record of the City Veterinary Office, the population of dogs in the city is around 22 000, but only 8000 dogs have been vaccinated this year [2019].

This prompted the local government to declare a state of emergency to access funds, which will be used to purchase anti-rabies vaccines.

[According to the most recent available OIE data from the Philippines pertaining to zoonotic diseases in humans, the annual number of rabies cases (=deaths) during 2017 was 219. The number in 2016 was 260, and in 2015, 246.

Rabies can be fully controlled by proper preventive vaccination of the vectors, which are predominantly dogs. Deficient vaccination coverage, due to unavailability of the vaccine, results directly in human fatalities. This failure needs to be corrected as soon as possible.

The Kisumu County Government has declared an outbreak of rabies after 2 children died of dog bites with several other cases being reported in Seme Sub County.

County Director of Health Services Dr Dickens Onyango has confirmed the outbreak but said health officials were working to stop the spread through timely treatment and sensitisation.

In a letter dated 27 Jun 2019 and addressed to medical superintendents manning all public hospitals, Dr Onyango ordered all hospitals to stock anti-rabies vaccines and ensure that those bitten by dogs are treated immediately.

"This is to notify you that there is a confirmed rabies outbreak in Kisumu County," Dr Onyango said in a letter signed on his behalf by Dr A. Ng'ong'a.

The confirmation came as a family on Thursday [27 Jun 2019] buried one of their children bitten by a stray dog. As [the father] buried his 10-year-old daughter in Seme, his other son was fighting for his life at a local hospital. The 2 children were bitten by stray dogs within 2 weeks.

In the 1st incident, [the daughter] was taking a nap when a stray dog attacked her at their home. When she woke up to scare it away, the dog jumped on her, biting her on the right side of her cheeks. She was rushed to Kombewa Sub County Hospital, but the family could not raise money to buy the anti-rabies drug.

"We were not able to raise the money and opted to take my child to an herbalist," said [the father]. The herbalist administered some drugs and gave her some to drink, but her health deteriorated. After 3 days, the father rushed the child to a neighbouring dispensary, which referred them to the Kisumu County Referral hospital.

"It was too late when we arrived at the facility, it did not take long before the doctors confirmed that my daughter had passed," said the emotional [father].

In the 2nd incident, his son was attacked by a stray dog while in the garden. Medical superintendent at Kombewa hospital David Okeyo, however, said that by the time the son was taken to the hospital, the facility was out of stock of the anti-rabies drugs. Dr Okeyo said the medics advised the parents to buy the vaccine at a nearby chemist at Sh 1500 [USD 14.57] per dose, but they never returned.

In same week, another case was brought at the facility and was advised to buy the vaccine, adding that the 2 succumbed. "They did not buy the drugs as advised; neither did they bring back the patients; there was nothing we could do without the vaccine," said Okeyo.

Okeyo confirmed that there was a high prevalence of dog bites in the area, saying that over the weekend, 6 cases were reported and administered with the vaccine. "As per now, we have a stock of the vaccine, but due to high demand, the stock runs out fast," noted Okeyo.

The county director of veterinary services, Dr. Evans Odhiambo, confirmed the recent deaths related to dog bites in the sub-county.

[Sindh is one of the 4 provinces of Pakistan; the 3rd largest by area, and 2nd largest by population (2017, 47.9 million) after Punjab (2017, 110 million).

According to a recent review of the literature (Ref. 1), more than 97 000 cases of dog bites in humans were reported by primary health care in Pakistan during 2010, while those treated by secondary and tertiary care facilities, private physicians, and faith healers were not documented. The paper further noted that 2000-5000 deaths due to rabies are reported in Pakistan annually.

However, according to information cited in the above media report, in Sindh alone, about 85 000 dog bites are recorded annually.
