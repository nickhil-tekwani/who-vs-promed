Four Arizonans have become ill with _Escherichia coli_ [O157:H7] infection,
possibly from contaminated ground beef that has been recalled by a
California plant. Nationally, 11 people have gotten sick in the outbreak,
which prompted United Food Group LLC to recall 75 000 pounds (about 34 020
kg) of ground beef shipped to distribution centers in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Oregon, and Utah.
Arizona health officials could not confirm to which local stores the meat
was shipped, but they are urging people to get rid of certain types of
ground beef with "EST. 1241" printed on the packages.
Of the 4 Arizona cases, 2 are in Maricopa County, one is in Yavapai County,
and another in Navajo County. Don Herrington, head of epidemiology and
disease control for the Arizona Department of Health Services, said that 2
cases, a child in Maricopa and an adult in Yavapai, were hospitalized but
are doing fine, and information is not available on the other 2.
The recalled food has a sell-by date of 6 May 2007, a freeze-by date of 7
May 2007, or a produced-on date of 20 Apr 2007, printed on the packages. It
was sold under the brands Moran's All Natural, Inter-American Products, and
Stater Bros and can be returned to the store where it was bought.
Arizona reported 79 _E. coli_ cases in 2006, and 44 cases in 2005. This
year [2007], from January to April, 13 cases have been reported.

Health investigators do not know how long it will take them to trace the
source of the _E. coli_ that tainted 75 000 pounds (about 34 020 kg) of
beef processed at United Food Group LLC's Vernon processing plant, state
officials said Tue 5 Jun 2007.
The bacterium, _E. coli_ O157:H7, sickened a dozen people in 5 states and
Canada, including 3 in Southern California.
United Food Group, one of the nation's largest ground beef manufacturers,
voluntarily recalled the beef Sun 3 Jun 2007, after health officials from
California, Colorado, and the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) discovered the bacteria in samples of the meat. From United's
Vernon plant, the product was shipped to retail distribution centers in 5
western states and ultimately made it into store freezers in 11 states.
The recall targeted 10-pound (4.5 kg) casings and 5- (2.27 kg), 2- (0.91
kg) and 1-pound (0.45 kg) tubes of Moran's All-Natural fine ground beef and
sirloin; 2- and 1-pound tubes of Inter-American Products ground beef; and
3-pound (1.36 kg) tubes of ground beef from Southern California grocer
Stater Bros. Markets.

Utah's Department of Health says the state has had at least one report of
_E. coli_ illness linked to ground beef that has been recalled from
Albertsons stores. Health department spokeswoman, Charla Haley, says the
man lives in Salt Lake County. He recovered without needing to be hospitalized.
Supervalu Inc announced a recall of some ground beef sold in its Albertsons
and Save-A-Lot stores because it is believed to be contaminated with _E.
coli_. Most products were sold under the Moran's label at Albertsons
stores, including some in Utah.
The recalled products had sell-by dates from 20 Apr through 7 May 2007.

[Outbreaks of Verotoxin-producing _E. coli_ (VTEC), primarily O157:H7,
continue to occur due to contamination of a variety of foods including,
most notably of late, spinach. The classical vehicle for this pathogen is,
of course, ground beef. This ongoing outbreak appears to be another example
of that association. It is important to remember that, despite
contamination, appropriate kitchen hygiene (avoiding cross-contamination)
and proper cooking of the meat will prevent transmission from ground beef.
Genetic analysis of the strains is needed to clearly link the cases to the
ground beef. - Mod.LL
