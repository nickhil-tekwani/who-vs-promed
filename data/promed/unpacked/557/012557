A batch of raw pet food produced by the British company Natural Instinct has been identified as the probable cause of a rare outbreak of feline tuberculosis (TB) that infected 13 cats last year [2018] in the United Kingdom [see commentary regarding additional cases].

The Camberley-based company confirmed to the VIN News Service today [15 May 2019] that it is working with Britain's Food Standards Agency as part of a related investigation into its now-discontinued "Wild Venison" product.

Natural Instinct ships only within the UK and Ireland, although it is able to deliver products outside the country "on occasions," according to the company's website. Its Wild Venison line, containing deer meat, was singled out following a separate probe into the TB cases by a group of veterinarians and academics. The results of their study were published this week in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery.

The study found "compelling, if circumstantial, evidence" of an association between the infected animals and a commercially available raw food product made by a single manufacturer. The study does not name the company, but Natural Instinct confirmed its involvement.

Cats in 5 of 6 clinical cases were either too sick to treat or deteriorated despite therapy, giving a mortality rate of 83%, the researchers found. Another 7 cats showed evidence of infection but did not require clinical attention.

Not long after reports of the outbreak surfaced in November [2018] -- and before investigations into its causes were concluded -- Natural Instinct recalled its Wild Venison product. The recall occurred "because some of the ingredients were not inspected in line with European Union requirements," according to a food alert published 11 Dec 2018 by the Food Standards Agency.

A spokesperson from Natural Instinct said by e-mail: "Everything we do at Natural Instinct is done so with the best interests of our customers and their pets in mind. We can assure our customers that Natural Instinct followed, and continues to follow, every food standard, hygiene regulation and best practice required to produce raw pet food in the commercial marketplace."

The UK Animal and Plant Health Authority regularly conducted inspections on the company and was satisfied that all standards were met, the spokeswoman said. "Even though we no longer manufacture and sell the venison cat product, we are continuing to work with Food Standards Agency as part of the investigation into the product," she added.

Raw pet food is more apt to be contaminated with pathogens than dry pet food, judging from the results of a study published in 2014 by US Food and Drug Administration researchers and collaborators. In the study of 480 dry and semi-moist pet food samples, 2 tested positive for _Listeria_, _Salmonella_ and toxigenic forms of _Escherichia coli_. By contrast, of 576 samples of raw dog and cat foods, exotic animal feed and jerky-type treats, 66 tested positive for the same pathogens (with all of them isolated to raw foods and jerky-type treats).

Suspicions that raw cat food was responsible for the UK TB outbreak were high early on, given that the infected animals lived exclusively indoors and couldn't hunt outside. The pets caught a strain of TB caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_, a bacterium more typically found in cattle and wild animals such as bison, elk and deer. The pathogen can affect humans; however, by far the more common cause of TB in people is _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.

We hereby present its abstract and selected segments from the discussion:

1. Abstract
Objectives:
_Mycobacterium bovis_, a member of the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex, can infect cats and has proven zoonotic risks for owners. Infected cats typically present with a history of outdoor lifestyle and hunting behaviour, and cutaneous granulomas are most commonly observed. The aim of this study is to describe an outbreak of tuberculous disease commencing with 6 young cats, living exclusively indoors in 5 different households across England, being presented to separate veterinarians across the UK with a variety of clinical signs.
Methods:
Investigations into the pyogranulomatous lesions, lymphadenopathy and/or pulmonary disease of these cases consistently identified infection with _M. bovis_. Infection was confirmed by PCR, where possible, or was indicated with a positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), where material for PCR was unavailable. In-contact, cohabiting cats were screened by IGRA and follow-up testing was undertaken/advised where results were positive. A lifestyle investigation was undertaken to identify the source of infection.
Results:
Six clinically sick cats and 7 in-contact cats were identified with evidence of _M. bovis_ infection. Five clinical cases were either too sick to treat or deteriorated despite therapy, giving a mortality rate of 83%. Lifestyle investigations revealed the common factors between clusters to be that affected cats had mycobacterial infections speciated to _M. bovis_, were exclusively indoor cats and were fed a commercially available raw food product produced by a single manufacturer. The Food Standards Agency, Animal & Plant Health Agency, Public Health England and the food manufacturer concerned have been notified/informed. Other possible sources of exposure for these cats to _M. bovis_ were explored and were excluded, including wildlife contact, access to raw milk, the presence of rodent populations inside the buildings in which the cats lived and exposure to known infectious humans.
Conclusions and relevance:
Upon investigations, our results provide compelling, if circumstantial, evidence of an association between the commercial raw diet of these cats and their _M. bovis_ infections.

2. Discussion (excerpt).
"At this stage, as cases are continuing to be diagnosed, there is insufficient evidence to ascertain if this is a single, one-off event or an ongoing problem. However, in either instance this outbreak raises concerns over the strength of current regulations with regard to meat inspection procedures and may necessitate an increase in trained veterinary meat inspection of a carcass before it is passed as fit for animal consumption. With particular reference to wild venison, one such development could be that the entire gralloch (all viscera) be brought to the slaughterhouse for veterinary inspection.

"Our study is the 1st to report infection of companion animals with an MTBC pathogen, which appears to be associated with feeding an RMBD, with 13 cats in 5 households infected, as identified to date. Not only does this imply that the owners were handling contaminated material, but the gastrointestinal presentation means that the cats may have been shedding _M. bovis_ into their home environment, creating the potential for even greater exposure to owners. Of further concern, the Pet Food Manufacturers' Association guidance to owners handling RMBDs is that they should clean surfaces, utensils and animal food bowls with 'soap and hot water'. Pasteurisation requires milk to be heated to 71.5 deg C (160.7 deg F) and held at that temperature for a minimum of 15 s to inactivate _M. bovis_; it is highly unlikely that owners would be able to achieve this in a domestic setting, so _M. bovis_ is very likely to be able to persist on kitchen surfaces even after the owners feel that the surfaces have been 'cleaned'. Furthermore, _M. bovis_ is able to survive for at least 60 days in standing water, such as might be found in or around a kitchen sink, over which time further organisms may be added with each prepared meal, making it highly plausible that the small dose needed to infect a human could be reached.

"The severity of clinical disease that was seen in the cats we report here is much greater than we would typically expect to see through infections acquired from hunting infected rodents. The clinical signs of pyrexia, anaemia and leukocytosis (caused by a mature neutrophilia) are not typically present in feline TB cases and the young age of many of the cats affected is also striking, as is the fact that the cats were indoor only, and not from areas of England known to have endemic _M. bovis_ in rodents, badgers, other wildlife and cattle. These factors may mislead clinicians presented with future cases to not consider TB as a potential differential diagnosis, delaying the time until correct diagnosis and thus exposing owners to possible infection for extended periods."

In an addendum to the article, the authors state: "Since submitting this article in November 2018, the outbreak has continued across the UK. The number of cases has now increased to include at least 30 clusters involving more than 90 cats. Information about the continuing outbreak will be published as soon as is practically possible."

A ProMED-mail posting dated 9 Oct 2018 addressed _M. bovis_ in prisoners in the Erlestoke Prison, Wiltshire, England (20181009.6079171). It included the following comment by Mod.ML: "We are not told if the infected prisoners had contact with possibly _M. bovis_-infected animals. Cattle and cats with confirmed _M. bovis_ infection are known to exist in the UK (https://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/174/13/322)." A response to the said RFI is pending. - Mod.AS
