A horse in northern San Luis Obispo County [California] has tested positive for West Nile virus, according to the county Public Health Department. It's the county's 1st case of West Nile this year [2014].

This is also the 1st case this year of West Nile virus found in a horse in the southern half of the state. This comes during a year where a lot of mosquitoes are testing positive for the disease in California.

The owner of this particular horse noticed the animal acting strange earlier this month [September 2014]. It was acting weak and behaving strangely. A blood test was sent to a testing lab, which confirmed a West Nile infection. This is the 10th case of West Nile virus infection of a horse this year in California.

It's been several years since a big West Nile outbreak in California, and one horse veterinarian says people could be letting their guard down.

Dr. Jim Waldsmith owns The Equine Center in San Luis Obispo, where he cares for horses on a daily basis. He's familiar with West Nile cases in local horses, and provides vaccinations year-round.

"The best prevention is vaccination and mosquito control," said Dr. Waldsmith. "That's the best thing you can do because there is not a lot we can do once a horse gets the disease."

Part of Dr. Waldsmith's mosquito prevention program is keeping goldfish and mosquitofish inside the horse's water trough. That's where mosquitoes tend to breed around horses, and the fish eat the larvae to keep the population from getting out of control.

The mosquito population in California is testing positive for West Nile virus at a higher rate than ever before, according to the San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department. The case in San Luis Obispo County is the 10th horse infected in California this year, surpassing the total of 8 from a year ago.

"Mosquitoes get the West Nile virus by biting birds that are infected with the virus and are just carrying the virus," said Ann McDowell, San Luis Obispo County Epidemiologist. "Then they come along and bite more birds, horses, and people and spread the virus."

While the 10 horse infections this year are a far cry from the 540 cases reported in California in 2004, Dr. Waldsmith offers a word of caution.

"I think that the West Nile scare of 5 or 6 years ago had everyone vaccinating, but then the disease appeared to go away. People weren't hearing about it in the news," said Dr. Waldsmith. "We may be in a vulnerable state right now where the horses aren't as well vaccinated as they ought to be."

When it comes to human infections of West Nile virus, there have been over 300 reported cases so far this year [2014]. That's already double last year [2013]'s total, which was about 150.

The Public Health Department offers these tips to reduce the chance of infection by mosquito bite:

1. Apply insect repellant containing DEET, picaradin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 according to label instructions.
2. Wear protective clothing (long sleeves and pants) with insect repellant applied, especially when outdoors at dawn and dusk, the most popular mosquito feeding times.
3. Repair or replace any screens in your home that are broken or have holes.
4. Eliminate all standing water near your home, and change pet drinking water containers frequently.

[The veterinarian in the article is correct. People do seem to have let their guard down. In many states the cases of WNV decreased when horse owners were vaccinating. But sadly, the vaccination rate decreased, mosquitoes and WNV increased and the number of positive WNV cases in horses has increased.

Caring for an animal means getting all the necessary vaccinations, which include the Eastern and Western equine encephalitis vaccines, West Nile virus vaccine (these are usually in combination and therefore only one injection) and tetanus. It should be repeated approximately 3 weeks to 30 days after the 1st injection. What a simple and easy way to protect your companion!
