Turkey's wheat harvest, the Middle East's largest, probably fell 5.3
percent in 2010 after fungal disease and rain during harvesting hurt
the crop, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
said.

A "widespread infestation" of yellow rust cut yields, especially in
the region close to the border with Syria and Iraq, while "heavy"
rainfall in central Anatolia and Thrace just before and during
harvest also affected crops, particularly durum wheat. Sowing of
[cereal] winter crops for harvesting in 2011 has started under normal
weather conditions.

FAO also said Syria's wheat harvest probably will slide 18 percent in
2010. The low output is due to a widespread infestation of yellow
rust that, coupled with some frosts in late March 2010, has severely
affected wheat yields [ProMED-mail post 20100609.1930]. The new
strain of yellow rust might cause billions of dollars in crop losses,
the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas
[ICARDA] said [ProMED-mail post 20100531.1803].

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale
(wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind
dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season, and the
fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge"
between seasons. Disease management includes the use of resistant
varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging, and
regional monitoring programmes are important to recognise them. A new
strain identified by ICARDA is currently causing serious stripe rust
outbreaks in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia. Although
it is unclear whether strain identification was carried out in
Turkey, from the report above, it appears to be likely that the new
strain may also be present there. Breeding programmes for resistance
to stripe rust are in progress, but the process of releasing new
varieties to farmers is slow.
