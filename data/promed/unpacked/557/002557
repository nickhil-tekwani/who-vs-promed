During the last 5 days, 13 cases of botulism, one of them fatal, have
been reported in Surgut [in Tyumen Oblast (region)]. The source of
the outbreak was the use of homemade low-quality products. The
doctors report that the condition of 2 patients is very severe and
they are on artificial lung ventilation.

Doctors are struggling for the life of 12-year-old girl who was
suffering from botulism in Buryatia. The doctors say that she was
admitted on 4 Feb 2008 and her condition is extremely critical. The
cause of the infection was homemade salted omul, according to the
press service of Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the
Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] report.

The grandfather of the girl purchased the fish during the fall and
salted it not in a proper way. The family was using the fish up until
now. The sanitary services are warning the population not to buy fish
from private [sources] and not to salt it themselves. The number of
cases of botulism was 15 during 2007, including 2 children under 14.
During the last 6 years, 600 people were affected by botulism and 30
[of them] them died. All the cases were due to homemade salted fish.

[Omul is a delicacy in Lake Baikal. The current situation is much
better than it was several years before, when the number of cases of
reported botulism was higher. The incidence of botulism was 189 in
1999 including 20 fatalities, 158 in 2001 including 13 fatalities,
and 140 in 2002 (8 fatalities). The incidence of botulism during the
recent years is 20-40 with 1-2 fatalities each year. See the details
at <http://www.burrpn.ru/news/detail.php?ID=1073.>. - Mod.NP

The Omul or Arctic cisco, _Coregonus autumnalis migratorius_, is a
salmon-like fish found only in the waters of Lake Baikal in Siberia,
Russia. It is a vital food fish for the Baikal region and, for the
rural population, is often necessary for survival. Its caviar is
considered a delicacy. Apart from local consumption, export to the
west of Russia is important, though difficult due to the region's
remoteness. Obtaining smoked omul (and possible botulism) is a
highlight (the former, not the latter) for many travelers on the
Trans-Siberian railway.

ProMED-mail has posted reports of botulism from Buryatia in past
years and always linked to fish.

The method of diagnosis of botulism is not stated here. Individual
cases of the paralysis can be confused with other diseases, but a
cluster of such cases is certainly likely to be botulism. Type E
botulism is the type frequently associated with fish products (1).

Classically, botulism is a food-borne disease caused by the ingestion
of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in
which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and
infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although each
type has a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that
type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status
and more autonomic dysfunction (2).
