Two incidents of transmission of bird flu viruses to humans have been recorded in 2021, Anna Popova, the head of Russia's consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, told Sputnik on Thu 3 Jun 2021.

"This year [2021] alone, we have 2 viruses of animal flu, in particular birds, which began to infect humans. One of them was reported by our scientists at the Vector Centre in February 2021; this is the H5N8 virus, which we have known of for a long time. The 2nd case, reported this week by our Chinese colleagues, is H10N3. A person contracted bird flu," Popova said on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). The official said that the goal now is to "learn lessons" from the COVID-19 pandemic and get ready "so that no infection is critically dangerous for us."

The World Health Organization's spokesperson told Sputnik on Tuesday [1 Jun 2021] that WHO is conducting a risk assessment of a human case of a strain of bird flu jointly with China, after China's National Health Commission confirmed the 1st human case of the H10N3 strain of bird flu.

There have been no previously reported cases of human-to-human transmission of the H10N3 infection in the world, with the virus considered to be low pathogenic among birds. Experts believe the case marks "accidental transmission of the virus from bird to human," adding that the risk of large-scale spread is extremely low.

[The 1st 7 human cases of avian influenza A/H5N8 were reported in February 2021 from poultry farm workers who participated in a response operation to contain an avian influenza A(H5N8) outbreak detected in a poultry farm in Astrakhan Oblast in the Russian Federation. The laboratory confirmation of the 7 specimens was performed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR, WHO H5 Reference Laboratory). The ages of the 7 positive cases ranged between 29 to 60 years, and 5 were female [https://www.who.int/csr/don/26-feb-2021-influenza-a-russian-federation/en/].

These cases with PCR-positive results were clinically asymptomatic. Infections with avian influenza viruses of the same clade (H5 clade 2.3.4.4) have been reported from China since 2014 in people with exposure to infected birds. The likelihood of human infections with influenza A(H5N8) viruses has been considered to be low.

It is imperative that, with these new cases, the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of animal and seasonal human influenza should continue to be implemented. Respiratory transmission occurs mainly by droplets, disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded, enclosed spaces. Hand contamination, direct inoculation of virus, exposure to infected birds or virus-contaminated materials or environments are potential sources of infection.

When avian influenza viruses are circulating in an area, the people involved in specific, high-risk tasks such as sampling sick birds, culling and disposing of infected birds, eggs, and litter, and cleaning of contaminated premises should be trained on how to protect themselves and on proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). People involved in these tasks should be registered and monitored closely by local health authorities for 7 days following the last day of contact with poultry or their environments.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.

Thorough investigation of all potential novel influenza human infections is warranted. All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and State Parties to the IHR are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by a new influenza A subtype with the potential to cause a pandemic (please see case definitions for diseases requiring notification under the IHR). Evidence of illness is not required.

In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection, a thorough epidemiological investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted, even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization. - Mod.UBA
