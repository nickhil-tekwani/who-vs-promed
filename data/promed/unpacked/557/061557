Reported cases of a tick-borne disease are swelling in Maine this year [2017], but it's not Lyme disease. Cases of anaplasmosis, an illness with flu-like symptoms that are similar to Lyme but typically more severe, have jumped from 52 a year in Maine 5 years ago to 433 this year, through [24 Oct 2017], according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Of this year's 433 cases, 113 were hospitalized, according to Maine CDC statistics.

The deer tick, the same tick that's a carrier for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, is also a carrier for anaplasmosis.

Lyme -- of which there have been more than 1000 cases per year in Maine since 2011 -- has established a long-term presence in the state, but anaplasmosis has remained under the radar.

Anaplasmosis cases are also rising in other New England states: Massachusetts had 828 cases in 2016 compared to about 200 in 2012, while New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode Island are also reporting increases. Lyme cases remain strong in Maine, but the 1039 cases through September [2017] are below 5-year averages. Another tick-borne disease, babesiosis, is also increasing, but still at much lower rates than Lyme or anaplasmosis, with 93 cases through September [2017].

Anaplasmosis symptoms are flu-like and can include fever, chills, fatigue, and joint pain. About 25-30 percent of all anaplasmosis cases result in hospitalizations, compared to about 5 percent of Lyme cases.

Mainers are more at risk of anaplasmosis, experts say, for a number of reasons. Part of the issue is greater awareness and more testing by people who fall ill. But also, more deer ticks are infected with anaplasmosis and passing the bacteria on to humans, said Chuck Lubelczyk, a field biologist with the Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough. "It certainly is spreading," Lubelczyk said.

Several years ago, in southern Maine, 5 percent or fewer of ticks that were tested had anaplasmosis, he said. Now, it's doubled, and about 10 percent of the ticks are infected with anaplasmosis. In the midcoast and points north, it was extremely rare for a deer tick to have anaplasmosis bacteria. A few percent of the tested ticks along the midcoast now have it, about the same rates as southern Maine 5 to 7 years ago, Lubelczyk said.

In comparison, more than 50 percent of deer ticks -- sometimes more than 65 percent -- carry Lyme disease in Maine.

Lubelczyk said ticks seem to be out earlier and longer than previously, emerging earlier in the spring and lingering into the fall, and he sees more nymph-stage ticks, which are small and difficult to detect. "We may be having 2 different tick populations, one that arrives earlier and another that arrives later. It's not clear yet," he said.

Sara Robinson, a Maine CDC epidemiologist, said anaplasmosis is more difficult to detect than Lyme, as anaplasmosis does not have the "bull's-eye" rash that appears in some infected with Lyme, signaling that they have the disease. Robinson said the best way to tell is if you're feeling like you have the flu outside of flu season, which is typically October to May. "If you feel like you're getting the flu in the summer, call your doctor," Robinson said.

"Anaplasmosis is becoming more frequent in Maine and particularly emergency room and urgent care sites need to be aware that a 'summer flu' in an endemic area is anaplasmosis until proven otherwise," [Dr Heidi Heap-Chester, who cared for a patient who tested positive for "multiple tick-borne diseases"] said. Anaplasmosis responds well to antibiotic treatment if caught early, but it's difficult to catch early.

Prevention is also key. Wear long clothing and repellents when in tick habitat, such as the woods, and when picking up dead wood or leaves. Check often for ticks, which are difficult to see. Lubelczyk said one of the more common ways to pick up a tick is from your pet. The tick that's on your pet can drop off after feeding and crawl on you.

People who do find a tick on them should remove it immediately and have it tested. In most cases, ticks need to be attached to a human for 36 hours before diseases can be transmitted.

[_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the causative agent of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and _Babesia microti_, the causative agent of babesiosis, are transmitted to humans in wooded areas of the northeastern United States by the same tick (_Ixodes scapularis_). Typically, the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/. Patients may be concurrently co-infected by these pathogens.

An increased incidence of anaplasmosis can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, but also better recognition and reporting of these diseases may contribute to the increases in the number of reported cases.

Some individuals infected with _A. phagocytophilum_ do not become ill or experience only very mild symptoms and do not seek medical treatment. The symptoms tend to be most severe in aged or immunosuppressed people. In infected persons who are symptomatic with anaplasmosis, illness onset occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. Initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care, and the disease can be fatal. Severe infections can include prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, hemorrhages, and death.

The presence of hemolytic anemia suggests babesiosis. Some patients also have splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or jaundice. Severe cases can be associated with marked thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemodynamic instability, acute respiratory distress, myocardial infarction, renal failure, hepatic compromise, altered mental status, and death.

Their diagnoses are based on specific antibody tests, detection of specific nucleic acid (DNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microscopy of thick and thin blood films. In babesiosis, manual (non-automated) review of Wright-stained peripheral blood smears or buffy-coat preparations can demonstrate intraerythrocytic ring forms. Sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish between _Babesia_ and _Plasmodium_ (especially _P. falciparum_) parasites. Cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of vacuolar microcolonies of _A. phagocytophilum_ within neutrophils can be found in 20 to 80 percent of patients with anaplasmosis, unlike the rarity of visualizing organisms within circulating mononuclear cells in patients with human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Weinberg G: Laboratory diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Pediat Infect Dis J 2001; 20(4): 435-7).

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ and _B. microti_ are found in the blood stream, infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ transmitted through blood transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57(42): 1145-8. [date cited] Available from http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm).

Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously for 10 days for all symptomatic patients suspected of having anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimal total course of 10 days. This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme disease, but is not effective therapy for patients who are co-infected with _B. microti_.

Most asymptomatic persons with babesiosis do not require treatment. For ill patients, babesiosis is treated for at least 7-10 days with a combination of either: atovaquone plus azithromycin, or clindamycin plus quinine (this combination is the standard of care for severely ill patients).
