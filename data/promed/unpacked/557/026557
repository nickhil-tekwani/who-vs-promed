Re:
>[... (HFRS) is caused by wild rodent-borne hantaviruses, the
strains differing according to geographical region: Puumala & Dobrava
viruses in Europe, Hantaan virus in Asia. Abundant harvests lead to
abundant rodents which multiply the viruses & bring them into contact with
field workers - Mod.JW<

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) large-scale outbreaks are
periodically (once every 3-4 years) registered in Bashkortostan (Bashkiria,
Bashkirskaya). Serotyping confirms that the agent is Hantaan virus.
