Influenza Update No. 226
------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity increased in the northern hemisphere and in several countries has passed the seasonal threshold. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated so far.
- In North America, the levels of influenza activity, mainly associated with A(H3N2) virus, passed the seasonal threshold.
- In Europe overall influenza activity continued to increase, though with no clear indication that the influenza season had begun.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity increased with, influenza A(H3N2) predominated.
- In northern and western Africa influenza activity increased with influenza B virus predominant.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity increased in some countries of the Caribbean, decreased in Central America and was low in the tropical countries of South America.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at a low level, but ILI [influenza-like illness] activity remained high in several Pacific Islands.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 11 Dec 2014, 14:25 UTC, during weeks 47 to 48 (16 Nov 2014 to 29 Nov 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 49 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 59 940 specimens. 7227 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 6603 (91.4 percent) were typed as influenza A and 624 (8.6 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 84 (2.4 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3472 (97.6 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 140 (97.2 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 4 (2.8 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America

In the countries in North America, the influenza season has begun with influenza A(H3N2) virus predominating.

In Canada, influenza detections increased to 15.2 percent positivity (compared to 4.6 percent in the previous update) and hospitalizations due to influenza also increased. Of the laboratory confirmed influenza virus detections, 34 percent were influenza A; 99 percent of these were influenza A(H3N2). Among cases with reported ages, 61 percent were aged at least 65 years. Hospitalizations due to influenza increased, again with influenza A(H3N2) dominating. Influenza-like illness (ILI) activity continued to be above the average for the last 13 weeks, with 29.1 consultations per 1000, mainly reported from the under 20 years old age group. Detections of RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and adenovirus also continued to increased, following seasonal patterns while detections of para-influenza and rhinovirus continued to decrease.

In the United States of America (USA), influenza detection continued to increase (17 percent positivity). ILI activity was 2.6 percent, which is above the national baseline of 2.0 percent. The highest activity levels were seen in the southern states of the USA. The pneumonia and influenza mortality from the 122 Cities Reporting Systems was 5.4 percent, which is below the epidemic threshold of 6.5 percent. Of 2274 influenza positive specimens, 93.6 percent were influenza A and 6.4 percent were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses subtyped, 99 percent were influenza A(H3N2). Influenza viral characterization data indicated that 48 percent of the influenza A (H3N2) viruses collected and analyzed in the United States from 1 Oct through 22 Nov 2014 were antigenically "like" the 2014-2015 influenza A (H3N2) vaccine component, but that 52 percent were antigenically different (drifted) from the A(H3N2) vaccine virus. The RSV detection rate also increased.

In Mexico, acute respiratory infections (ARI) activity increased slightly but remained consistent with seasonal patterns, while influenza activity remained low.

Europe

In Europe, influenza activity remained low, and there was no indication that the influenza season had begun. Of the 848 specimens tested from sentinel ILI and ARI patients from 35 countries, 34 (4 percent) from 14 countries tested positive for influenza virus. The predominant influenza virus subtype circulating has been A(H3N2). Similar to the findings in the USA, viral characterization data in Europe showed that a proportion of the A(H3N2) viruses has drifted from the H3N2 vaccine virus

Northern Africa

In northern Africa, influenza detections increased in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with influenza B virus dominating.

Western and Central Asia region

In the western and central Asia region, influenza activity remained low, with some increase in influenza activity in Qatar with mainly influenza A(H3N2) detections.

Eastern Asia

In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity increased.

In north China Influenza activity continued to increase with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominantly. ILI increased to 3.1 percent, following the seasonal trend. It was slightly higher but similar to the same week in the years 2011-2013, where it ranged between 2.8 and 3.0 percent. In Japan influenza activity increased with influenza A(H3N2) predominating. In Mongolia, ILI activity continued to rise with no indication of increased laboratory confirmed influenza detection.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

Overall in this region, influenza activity increased in some tropical countries of the Caribbean, decreased in Central America and was low in the tropical countries of South America.

In Cuba influenza A(H3N2) detections increased further. In Central America, increased SARI activity in Costa Rica and pneumonia rates in Nicaragua were seen over the last few weeks associated with detections of mainly RSV and influenza A(H3N2). Circulation of influenza A(H3N2) virus was also reported from Honduras and Panama.

Tropical countries in South America reported low ILI, SARI and laboratory confirmed influenza activity.

Central African tropical region

In Africa, influenza detections were reported from a few countries. Ivory Coast reported mainly influenza B detections while the United Republic of Tanzania reported mainly influenza A(H3N2) detections. In Madagascar and Zambia, influenza activity was caused by both influenza A and influenza B viruses.

Tropical Asia

In most southern Asian and South-Eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate Zone of South America

In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.

South Africa

In South Africa, ILI and SARI activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia

In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity remained low.

In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable; high activity was reported in American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[These data indicate that the 2014/2015 winter seasonal influenza epidemic is developing slowly in the northern hemisphere. However, no antigenically novel viruses have yet made an appearance, although a proportion of the H3N2 viruses isolated so far exhibit (but not complete) antigenic difference from those prevalent in the preceding winter when the design of the vaccine was formulated. The difference is judged not to be sufficient to restrict the use of the combined vaccine, or to be sufficient to reduce the overall effectiveness of the combined vaccine. - Mod.CP]
