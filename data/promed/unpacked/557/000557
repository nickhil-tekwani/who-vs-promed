2004/136 Results of 2003 surveys on quarantine pests in Latvia
---------------------------------
During 2003, several surveys for different plant quarantine pests were
carried out in Latvia (for 2002 results see EPPO RS 2003/119).
Beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus (rhizomania - EPPO A2 list)
51 samples were collected from 41 beet production farms from a total area
of 1397.7 ha. The virus was not found. Absent, confirmed by survey.
_Erwinia amylovora_ (EPPO A2 list)
No fireblight was found in surveys of 125 sites with fireblight host plants
(_Cotoneaster_, _Crataegus_, _Cydonia_, _Malus_, _Mespilus_, _Pyrus_,
_Sorbus_). 484.3 ha were visually inspected and 149 samples were taken and
tested for the presence of the bacterium. _E. amylovora_ was not found.
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ and _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ (both EPPO A2 list)

64 seed-potato production farms were inspected and 195 samples were taken
for detection of potato ring rot and brown rot. _C. michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_ [Cms] was found in the fields of 7 farms (17.7 ha). In 2003,
a monitoring programme of ware potatoes for the presence of ring rot and
brown rot was initiated. 83 ware potato production farms were inspected and
128 samples were taken. Cms was found in 7 farms (90.2 ha). In all infected
sites, control measures are being taken in accordance with EU Council
Directive 93/85. In 2003, the Ministry of Agriculture also allocated
financial compensations to infested farms in order to reduce their losses
due to the application of compulsory phytosanitary measures. During this
survey, _R. solanacearum_ was not found. Cms: Present, found at 6
production sites, under official control. _R. solanacearum_: Absent,
confirmed by survey.
_Globodera rostochiensis_ and _G. pallida_ (both EPPO A2 list)
8839 soil samples were collected from 74 seed-potato production farms, 105
ware potato production farms and from 112 nurseries, and then tested.
Inspections were also carried out on these sites. The presence of
_Globodera rostochiensis_ [Gr] was confirmed in 6 seed potato production
farms (2.5 ha), in 2 ware potato production farms (8 ha) and in 4 nurseries
(4.6 ha).
Eradication measures are being taken in the infested areas. _G. pallida_
was not found. Gr: Present, found in several production sites (6
seed-potato production sites, 2 ware potato production farms and 4
nurseries), under eradication. Gp: Absent, confirmed by survey.

[Cms is a major pathogen of potato that is very difficult to control. Yield
losses are caused by tuber rotting and in individual U.S. crops have been
as high as 50 percent. Disease management is predicated on application of
strict phytosanitary measures to ensure that the pathogen is
eradicated. Management strategies include planting only pathogen-free
potatoes, regularly cleaning and disinfecting all machinery, equipment,
containers, vehicles, and storage facilities used during potato production,
and discarding potatoes and potato processing waste to reduce inoculum load.
Regarding _Globodera rostochiensis_ and _G. pallida_, these nematodes exact
a major toll on potato seed production. At extremely high nematode
densities, tubers may become infected, resulting in the appearance of cysts
on their surface. In countries that are free of the potato cyst nematodes,
quarantines can help prevent their introduction. In countries where their
occurrence is localized, quarantines can help prevent further spread.
Eradication of the potato cyst nematodes once they are established in an
area seems unlikely. Potato cyst nematodes are among the most difficult
pests to control. Once established they are difficult to eradicate, because
they can survive for over 30 years as eggs, protected by the durable cyst
wall. Potato cyst nematodes are major pests of the potato crop in
cool-temperate areas. More recently, crop rotation has been supplemented by
use of resistant potato cultivars and nematicides (fumigants or granular
systemic compounds). Methyl bromide is being gradually phased out in favor
of other fumigants. There is no known single alternative fumigant,
chemical, or other technology that can readily substitute for methyl
bromide in efficacy, low cost, ease of use, wide availability, worker
safety, and environmental safety below the ozone layer. Research by USDA
indicates that multiple alternative control measures will be required to
replace the many essential uses of methyl bromide. For pre-plant uses, such
measures include combinations of fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides;
other fumigants; and non-chemical alternatives, including cultural changes
in cropping systems, resistant crops, and biological control.
Note: The 4th link discusses methyl bromide alternatives. Because of the
large number of reports, I did not list specific reports in
