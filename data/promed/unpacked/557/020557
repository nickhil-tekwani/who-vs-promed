Ukraine
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There are 2 cases reported in 2021.
- The GPEI is extremely concerned about the unfolding effects of the current crisis in Ukraine on the country's health system. A functioning health system must be kept neutral and protected from all political or security issues affecting countries, to ensure that people have continued access to critical and essential care. At the same time, we have seen time and again that large-scale population movements, insecurity, and hampered access contribute greatly to the emergence and/or spread of infectious diseases, such as polio.
- A national supplemental polio immunization campaign targeting nearly 140 000 children throughout Ukraine who had not been vaccinated against polio began on 1 Feb 2022, but is currently paused, as health authorities have shifted focus towards emergency services. Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted, increasing the risk of undetected spread of the disease among vulnerable populations. The GPEI is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio. While the cold winter climate of Ukraine is not conducive to polio transmission, undetected residual transmission cannot be ruled out, particularly as the surveillance system has been disrupted.
- The GPEI has a long history of working in a variety of complex environments and will continue to adapt its operations to the reality on the ground, to the degree possible, without compromising on the safety and security of health workers. At the same time, immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries, to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from the current large-scale population movements. It is critical that necessary resources are mobilized and made available to assist with the humanitarian needs, including relief, disease response/prevention efforts both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.
- Immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from large-scale population movements.
- The GPEI is strengthening synergies with broader immunization needs for displaced persons, including polio vaccines in the package of health interventions and using polio surveillance to help detect other vaccine-preventable diseases.
- The GPEI is assessing the availability of IPV and measles vaccines in key areas; assessing cold chain capacity and potential impact on it due to electricity cuts; providing communication support for demand generation for immunization; and supporting proactive AFP and environmental surveillance in all IDP sites.
- In border areas, operational support is provided to set up mobile vaccination teams and ensuring safe and efficient transport and temporary storage of vaccines.
- In neighbouring countries (Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary), support is focusing on strengthening surveillance (AFP and environmental); registration of children; procurement of vaccines; increase communication to generate vaccine demand; and strengthening immunization in camps and refugee settlements.

Yemen
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There are 13 cVDPV2 cases and 3 cVDPV1 cases reported in 2021.

Officially reported WPV1 and cVDPV cases as of 15 Mar 2022

[This week's report has 2 countries reporting AFP cases associated with cVDPV: cVDPV2 in DR Congo and Nigeria.

Looking at the charts showing the virus isolates and date of most recent isolate by source (AFP case, other humans (non-AFP infected) and environmental samples) for WPVs and cVDPVs for this past week (as of 15 Mar 2022), one sees that there have been positive environmental samples (ESs) for cVDPV3 in Israel beginning in 2020 (1 isolate), with 3 isolates in 2021 and 2 in 2022 (see https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/). The Palestinian Authority has reported 7 ESs positive for cVDPV3 in 2021 and 1 in 2022. See below for additional information on the situation in Israel.

A map of Israel and the Palestinian Authority can be found at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/israel_map.htm.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Malawi. - Mod.MPP]

The poliovirus is now being identified in samples of wastewater from areas outside Jerusalem, the Health Ministry reported Thursday [17 Mar 2022], saying that samples taken in Tiberias and Modi'in Illit had also shown evidence of the virus.

Earlier this week, samples of wastewater in Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh showed that the poliovirus was present. Earlier this month [March 2022], a 4-year-old girl from Jerusalem who had not been vaccinated against polio contracted the virus and became paralyzed.

According to the Health Ministry, another unvaccinated child from the Jerusalem area tested positive for the virus and was showing symptoms, and another unvaccinated child had tested positive but was asymptomatic. The ministry reported that cultures taken from 5 more unvaccinated children who were still asymptomatic had indicated the possible presence of the virus.

The ministry is carrying out additional tests to confirm the original findings. A week ago, the ministry launched a polio vaccination campaign in Jerusalem and by Thursday [17 Mar 2022] evening had vaccinated 11 785 infants and children.

The poliovirus is contagious and enters the body through the mouth and can be found in the excrement of a carrier. In most cases, symptoms are mild and include a sore throat, a fever, and weakness, but 1 out of 1000 unvaccinated people who contract the virus will develop more serious symptoms, including paralysis.

The Health Ministry stressed that the most important tool in preventing the spread of polio is to ensure that children receive their routine vaccinations on time.

"The Health Ministry is calling on all parents to ensure that their children have the Health Ministry's recommendations and to vaccinate children who still have not been. The polio vaccine is the safest, most effective way to prevent the spread of the virus and protect people from it," the ministry said.

2 versions of the polio vaccine are available in Israel: a live attenuated (LAV) version, which is taken orally, and an inactivated polio vaccine, which is injected into muscle tissue.

Professor Hagai Levine, chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians, said, "The moment there is a single [polio] case in Israel, we need to respond as if there is an outbreak, and at the very least launch an active vaccination campaign nationwide."

https://www.gov.il/he/departments/news/17032022-01


Vaccines given by breastfeeding stations of the Ministry of Health, the Jerusalem Municipality and some by Leumit:
- Vaccinated from the beginning of the operation until now: 11 785
- Vaccinated today ([17 Mar 2022]) until 14:00: 349

To date, positive / suspicious samples for the poliovirus (polio) in Jerusalem and the surrounding area:
- Children with a positive culture and symptoms: 1 not vaccinated
- Children with a positive culture without symptoms: 1 not vaccinated
- Suspicious and asymptomatic initial examination (final culture has not yet been obtained): 5 unvaccinated

All cases in which fecal polio is found are not vaccinated.

In addition, there are preliminary findings in sewage sampling of the virus in Beit Shemesh, Modi'in Illit, and Tiberias. The Ministry of Health is conducting additional tests to confirm the initial findings.

The Ministry of Health again calls on parents to make sure that their children are vaccinated according to the Ministry of Health's vaccination routine and to vaccinate the children who have not yet been vaccinated as soon as possible. The poliovirus vaccine is the most effective and safest way to prevent infection with the virus and to protect against the disease.
