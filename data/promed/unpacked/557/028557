Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture officials said that after the authorities conducted laboratory tests on thousands of dead pigs in northern Sumatra this week, the country confirmed the 1st case of African swine fever [ASF].

A provincial official said on Thursday [8 Nov 2019] that more than 4000 pigs died after the outbreak of pig cholera in North Sumatra. According to reports, in North Sumatra, in September [2019], Da Yinli County 1st discovered cases of pig cholera.

"The results of clinical trials and laboratory tests have shown that pigs die only from African swine fever, but there are also positive samples of swine cholera," said Faculty of Animal Health, Faculty of Agriculture.

[2] An evaluation of information currently available from the Philippines

For roughly a month we've been following media reports of thousands of pig deaths in Indonesia, which -- while tests are usually described as "pending" -- have been preliminarily blamed on "Hog Cholera", which usually describes classical swine fever (CSF).

As the map above [see the source URL] illustrates, Indonesia is more or less surrounded by nations that have recently reported African swine fever, which has killed tens of millions of pigs across Asia over the past year.

In recent days, media reports on "Babi Mati" -- aka "pig deaths" -- have increased, along with reports of the illegal dumping of dead pigs into lakes and streams (see picture titled "Dead pigs dumped in the River Bedera, public advised not use water" at https://tinyurl.com/y5qwf6xy).

As recently as 2 days ago [6 Nov 2019], headlines (based on statements by the MOA) still proclaimed "Dead pigs in North Sumatra result of hog cholera virus not ASF", but over the past 24 hours new test results have emerged suggesting that ASF has been confirmed in some of the pig deaths. Despite these reports, I've yet to find an official announcement on the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture website or an OIE notification.

There are literally dozens of Indonesian media reports of positive test results overnight, many quoting statements made by Fadjar Sumping Tjatur Rassa, the Agriculture Ministry's director of animal health. But a few links to English language reports follow:

1. Indonesia suspects outbreak of African swine fever - Reuters (https://tinyurl.com/y5z88h7m)
2. Indonesia reports 1st African swine fever outbreak - Beef Central (https://tinyurl.com/yxrmbgoh)
3. More than 4000 pigs in Indonesia allegedly die of deadly African virus - Xinhua (https://tinyurl.com/y46ftrpb)

Indonesia is primarily a Muslim country, but it produces roughly 8 million pigs a year, primarily for consumption by ethnic Chinese and Christian tribes. The economic impact there would likely be considerably less than in other major pig-producing countries.

The bigger concern is that if ASF is confirmed in Indonesia, it would provide yet another stepping stone for the virus, as it [winds] its way through the Western Pacific region, and potentially points east and west.

[Although in agreement with Michael Coston's assessment of the Indonesian factual situation, we await an official confirmation from Indonesia's authorities.

In the meantime, ASF continues its spread in Luzon, the Philippines. Since the Department of Agriculture confirmed the 1st ASF outbreak, which reportedly started on 25 Jul 2019, there have been 24 ASF outbreaks in 9 provinces/cities on Luzon Island; nearly 70 000 pigs have been culled, with new cases found in Caloocan City and Malabon City in Metro Manila. - Mod.AS
