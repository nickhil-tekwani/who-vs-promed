The Ministry of Health in Turkey has confirmed its first 2 cases of human
infection with avian influenza caused by the H5 virus subtype. Both cases
were fatal.
The 1st case was a 14-year-old boy from the rural district of Dogubayazit,
in the eastern province of Agri, which borders the Islamic Republic of Iran
and Armenia. He was hospitalized in Van Province on 1 Jan 2006 and died the
same day. The 2nd case was his 15-year-old sister, also hospitalized on 1
Jan 2006. She died on 5 Jan 2006.
Earlier this week, Turkish authorities had ruled out avian influenza in
these cases based on preliminary test results from samples taken from the
nose and throat. Subsequent tests of additional patient specimens taken
from the lungs produced positive results. Patient samples were sent today
to a WHO collaborating centre in the United Kingdom for further analysis.
The samples have now arrived; results are expected within the next days.
Turkish health authorities have informed WHO that, since 1 Jan 2006, a
total of 11 patients (including the 2 confirmed fatal cases) have been
hospitalized in Van Province with symptoms suggesting infection with avian
influenza. Most patients are children between the ages of 6 and 15 years
and all reside in the Dogubayazit district. 2 of the children are siblings
of the 2 confirmed [i.e. suspected, but not yet independently confirmed -
Mod.CP] cases.
Following a request by the Ministry of Health, an initial team of experts
from WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the
European Commission is travelling today [Thu 5 Jan 2006] to Turkey to
collaborate with the authorities in their investigation of the situation.
Initial information about the confirmed cases suggests that the children
acquired their infection following close contact with chickens. Deaths of
chickens are known to have occurred in the Dogubayazit district near the
end of 2005. Although no poultry outbreak has been officially reported in
the district, a confirmed outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in chickens and
ducks was reported on 27 Dec 2005 in the adjacent province of Igdir.
National authorities have informed WHO that the Dogubayazit district has
been placed under quarantine; no people or animals are allowed to move in
or out of the district. Culling operations are currently under way.
The 2 Turkish cases mark the 1st confirmed reports of human infection with
avian influenza outside East Asia. Since January 2004, a total of 142 human
cases of H5N1 infection have been reported in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia,
Indonesia, and China. The cases in Turkey bring the number of affected
countries to 6, from which 144 cases have now been reported.
Turkey reported its 1st outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry in
mid-October 2005. That outbreak, which occurred in the northwestern part of
the country, was attributed to contact between domestic poultry and
migratory waterfowl. The outbreak in Igdir and other suspected outbreaks in
this part of the country are thought to have occurred following
introduction of the virus by migratory birds. The region, which has several
large lakes, is known to lie along migratory routes.

[ProMED-mail thanks Greg Folkers <GFOLKERS@niaid.nih.gov> for providing the
same information. WHO appears to be accepting the veracity of the tests
carried out in Turkey, despite the earlier ambiguity, and prior to receipt
of the results of independent testing from the WHO-affiliated laboratory in
the UK. The Turkish cases should be designated 'suspected' until the
results of confirmatory testing in the UK are available. The number of
putative human cases is surprising in view of the relatively recent
appearance of H5N1 avian influenza in Turkey. - Mod.CP]
