The deadly apple scab has broken out in orchards in [several] districts, creating panic among farmers. Horticulture officials inspected 22 orchards. "Apple scab has been detected on both fruit and leaves. We found up to 50 per cent of incidence," they observed.

The detection of scab after 33 years has come as a chilling reminder, [the disease] had destroyed the apple economy for 2 years. "It was controlled by an all-out joint vigorous anti-scab campaign launched by farmers, scientists and horticulture officials. We need the same effort this time as well," said Harish Chauhan, HP Fruit Vegetable and Flowers Association, demanding adequate supply of anti-scab fungicides at cheaper rates.

Dr Vijay Thakur, Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, said, "It has been showing signs of revival over the years. The farmers should resort to spray of chemicals to prevent its spread." Director [of] Horticulture, Dr ML Dhiman said he had sought comprehensive reports from the apple belt of Shimla, Mandi, Kullu and other places.

[2] Rust - Jammu and Kashmir

A widespread outbreak of fungal diseases called "rust" in apple crop is being reported in south Kashmir, bad news for farmers. Scientists [from a regional agricultural extension centre] said that the continuous rains in recent months are the main reason why the rust diseases have afflicted apples. However, they said, the rust doesn't affect the life of apple if it doesn't develop cracks. "Apple orchards in low-lying areas that have higher water retention have been found to be most susceptible to rust problems," a scientist said.

To contain rust diseases, [the] scientists recommend deep pruning of low-lying orchards, which facilitates air circulation and reduces relative humidity in the microclimate, thus creating fast drying conditions after rains and pesticide application.

[(1) Scab disease (also called black spot) caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ affects apple, crab apple, loquat, and a few other related tree species. It is considered the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable and losses can be more than 70 percent. Symptoms may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall and fruit lesions. Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit and are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures. Cracks in fruits may serve as entry points for other pathogens to cause rotting pre- or post-harvest.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing rain, and they are carried long distances in air currents. Disease management is expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays per year in areas where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently suitable for commercial production.

The related species _V. pirina_ causes scab on pear with similar symptoms. The pathogens are specific to pear and apple, respectively, and cannot cross-infect the other's hosts. Other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops.

(2) Apple and pear rusts are caused by _Gymnosporangium_ species which are similar in appearance and require two hosts to complete their disease cycle. Different species can have different hosts, but all must spend part of their life cycles on members of the family Rosaceae (subfamily Amygdaloideae, such as, apples, pears, quinces, hawthorns) and alternately infect members of the family Cupressaceae, mainly from genus _Juniperus_ (junipers, red cedars). Some species form galls with orange tentacle-like spore horns. Spores are spread by wind until they infect an alternate host.

The fungi rarely cause serious damage to junipers. But on apple or pear, if environmental conditions are favourable for disease development, any of the rusts can result in serious losses of fruit production and reduced plant vigour which predisposes trees to infections by secondary pathogens or insect attacks. Hence, in some areas of commercial pome fruit production, eradication of the coniferous alternate hosts is being practised to control the disease. Preventative fungicide sprays may also be used on both hosts.
