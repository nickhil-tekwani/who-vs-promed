580 children have suffered foodborne illness after being given chicken sandwiches for breakfast at a school in northern Bolivia. The children from the Antonio Vaca Diez School were transported to hospitals in the city of Cobija after suffering stomach pains and nausea. A 9-year-old girl is in intensive care, while 11 other pupils are being kept in for observation.

A pupil said: "The students were vomiting; at 1st we had headaches, and we were nauseous, and we were vomiting."

The angry father of one of the children said: "Unfortunately, there is a lack of responsibility in the schools that don't regulate the school breakfast. Bad things can happen, and kids can die, and nobody says anything; it's the last straw."

Authorities said the sandwiches, which also contained mayonnaise and tomato ketchup, have been taken away for analysis. The school has stopped serving food while the investigation takes place.

[The Bolivian city of Cobija is located about 600 km (373 miles) north of La Paz in the Amazon Basin on the border with Brazil. Cobija lies on banks of the Rio Acre across from the Brazilian city Brasileia. It can be found on a map at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobija.

The timing between the chicken sandwich ingestion and the development of nausea and vomiting is not stated nor is whether fever was present. It is certainly possible, given the mayonnaise in the sandwich and if the illnesses began 4-6 hours after ingestion, that the illness was staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced, as mayonnaise is a common vehicle for this acute but short-lived illness.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration's Bad Bug Book at http://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/causesofillnessbadbugbook/ucm070015.htm:

"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

"A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning." - Mod.LL
