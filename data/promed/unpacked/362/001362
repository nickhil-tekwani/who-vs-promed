According to data from the Department of Disease Control of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, there were 9 cases of hantavirus syndrome nationwide in (2021) year. Among them, Taoyuan City first saw a case of hantavirus syndrome on 26 Nov [2021]. The case was a 51-year-old male in Taoyuan District. At the end of October [2021], he was bitten by rodents at his residence. Since 5 Nov [2021], he developed muscle soreness, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, posterior orbital pain, diarrhea, etc., and went to the hospital for treatment on 7 Nov [2021] because the symptoms did not improve. After the 2nd examination, the disease was diagnosed by the Department of Disease Control on 26 Nov [2021]. The case has been discharged from the hospital and returned home to recuperate. There is no doubt that the family members living with him seem to be symptomatic.

According to the Health Bureau, hantavirus syndrome is a zoonotic disease, with a very low probability of human-to-human transmission. The virus is present in the urine, feces, or saliva of rodents; [infection occurs] mainly through inhalation or contact with polluted air or objects in the environment or by the bite of a rodent with a virus. The incubation period after hantavirus infection is several days to 2 months. The main symptoms are sudden and persistent fever, headache, weakness, backache, headache, abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, etc. After treatment, the condition will be improved. People who have related symptoms should seek medical attention immediately.

The Health Bureau reminds that when people are cleaning their homes at the end of the year, they should pay attention to the path that rats may invade the environment. Kitchen waste or animal feed at home should be properly handled to remove spots where rats may hide in the home; restaurants, food stalls, markets, food factories, and other businesses should pay attention to environmental sanitation, get rid of rodents in buildings, comply with hantavirus syndrome 3 measures (i.e., do not let rats come in, live in, or eat [in the building or area]), use 5000 ppm bleach disinfection (100cc bleach stock solution + 1 liter cold water dilution), and take other relevant rodent-proof measures to prevent the outbreak. If the public has related questions, they can call the 24-hour epidemic prevention hotline of the Health Bureau: 0800-033-355.

[Mahmoud Orabi is thanked for submitting this report along with 2 others that are similar.

This is the 2nd case of transmission of a hantavirus by rat bite in Taiwan this year (2021). As noted earlier, Taiwan has had sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in recent years, with the Taiwan CDC indicating that there have been 0-7 cases per year recently. The case above brings this year's (2021) total to 9 cases.

The hantavirus involved is not stated, nor is the species of rodent identified. However, the rat bite leads one to suspect Seoul hantavirus, assuming that the rat involved was a brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the natural host of this virus.

In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in Asia. People become infected when exposed to the virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled. Transmission can also occur via rat bite, as apparently occurred in the above case.

An image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul virus, can be seen at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg. - Mod.TY
