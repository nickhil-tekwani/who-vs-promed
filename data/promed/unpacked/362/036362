For [a woman] who works at a maize mill outlet in Kisenyi [a deprived
district in Kampala, the capital of Uganda], it started as itchy eyes
on Wednesday [5 May 2010] and by Friday 7 May 2010], she was having
the full blown effects of red eyes -- pus flowing out of one reddened
eye, headache, and a bit of fever. That's when she was told that a
number of people in the area were suffering a similar illness. "I
hadn't heard of any outbreak of the disease till then. And much as
this place is very dusty, I thought I had just had a lot of dust in
my eyes during the day. The following day, one eye was a little red
but still itchy and then pus started forming in the corner on the 3rd day."

[She] is one of the people who have been affected by the outbreak of
red eyes, also called conjunctivitis, that has hit Kisenyi I and II
sub-parishes. But the disease has spread very fast and Dr Livingstone
Makanga, the principal medical officer with Kampala City Council, who
has been spearheading the medical team dealing with the outbreak
says, some cases have now been reported in Makindye division [of Kampala].

Conjunctivitis is of 2 kinds: viral and bacterial, with the former
being more contagious. "We are waiting for the Ministry of Health to
come out and tell us which one of these it is. But from the way it's
spreading, it must be viral," Dr Makanga said on Monday [10 May
2010]. At the moment, he says 397 people have received treatment but
that there are still people out there in the community who haven't
come. "This is because the disease is self-limiting, meaning it can
heal naturally without treatment."

After contracting the disease, a person can stay 3 or 4 days without
any symptoms but while spreading the disease and after that, Dr
Makanga says (there may be) symptoms like a headache, fever in some
cases, a burning sensation of the eyes, which may lead to tearing,
swelling of the eyes, reddening, and then pus will begin forming in
the corner of the affected eye(s).

Francis Dudu, one of the KCC [Kampala city council] personnel in
charge of disease surveillance says the chances of re-infection are
very high because Kisenyi is very unhygienic with so many flies which
are the main carriers of the disease. "A fly can pick it from the
eyes of an infected person and if it drops on the hands or any body
part of another person and he touches his eyes too, then he gets
infected," Mr Dudu explains.

"The disease is spreading very fast because waste management is poor,
drainage is poor, and there's overcrowding meaning that people are
always in contact, a situation that largely contributes to the spread
of the disease. People can't observe 100 per cent personal hygiene
because there is a shortage of wholesome water for washing so the
chances of re-infection are very high. This is dangerous because
continuous re-infection can lead to other eye diseases like trachoma
and blindness in some cases." He says the disease has [mainly]
affected [employees] of maize mills and animal feed [producers]. And
because some of these people come from far-off districts to purchase
produce, it is likely they are carrying back the disease.

Well, if you pass by Kisenyi right now, a number of people are
wearing sun glasses which Mr Dudu says help to minimise sunlight
because sufferers are very sensitive to light and get a lot of pain
from exposure to the sun. Though he says other people just don't want
to be identified as suffering from the disease. KCC has set up a
mobile clinic in Kiganda zone, the most affected area and is treating
sufferers for free. The treatment [chloramphenicol] eye drops, amoxyl
capsules, metronidazole tablets, and painkillers.

[Infective conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva (the thin layer
of cells covering the white of the eye and the inner surface of the
eyelids) becomes inflamed as a result of an infection. The 3 most
common causes of an infection in the eye are bacteria, for example
those strains of bacteria that more commonly cause lung and ear
infections, and viruses. There are no particular signs or symptoms
that differentiate the bacterial agents or viruses that cause of
infective conjunctivitis. Most cases of infective conjunctivitis do
not require medical treatment and will heal without treatment in one
to 2 weeks.

Most frequently, viral conjunctivitis is due to adenovirus infection.
Many serotypes may be involved. Types 3, and sometimes, 4 and 7, are
responsible for pharyngoconjunctival fever -- conjunctivitis
associated with upper respiratory tract infection. Adenovirus types 8
and 19 are frequently associated with keratoconjunctivitis.
Coxsackievirus A24, enterovirus 70, herpes simplex virus, and
varicella-zoster virus may also cause acute haemorrhagic
conjunctivitis. Less commonly viruses such as molluscum contagiosum,
vaccinia, and human immunodeficiency virus may be responsible for
conjunctivitis. Systemic infection with influenza virus, Epstein-Barr
virus, Newcastle disease virus, measles, rubella, and mumps, may also
cause conjunctivitis in association with upper respiratory tract infections.

Viral conjunctivitis often occurs in the aftermath of extreme and
stressful climatic events such as hurricanes, sandstorms and the
like, or as a consequence of exposure to irritants in the work-place.
The virus responsible for the current outbreak in Kampala is likely
to be an adenovirus or an enterovirus. Information on the precise
diagnosis would be welcomed.
