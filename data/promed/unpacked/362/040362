Sources at the Fuenlabrada hospital confirmed that they may be able to re-open the ICU by the middle of next week. "They are taking cultures and are on a deadline," they said.

Those affected by the fungus [_Aspergillus_] remain in stable condition and were transferred to a recovery room where they are able to treat the disease. There were 2 people, a 60 year old and an 80 year old, who were in the ICU for a general infection in one of the cases, and the other case was post-operative, explained Joaquin Alvarez, the head of the ICU.

The health facility will complete an "absolute cleaning" as well as a series of "exhaustive biologic controls" explained the medical director, Antonio Zapatero. In addition, they will take apart all equipment in the unit and collect specimens to determine the origin of the infection. This process includes the "cleaning of all respirators" and all materials and medical equipment.

After learning about the cases, the hospital administration informed patients and their families and friends, as well as the different services [departments] in the health facility and the works council [unions?]. In addition, in coordination with the Madrid Health department, they notified SUMMA 112 [Emergency Medical Services of Madrid] and the nearby hospitals, where patients needing ICU care will be referred until there is no longer a risk of infection in the ICU.

The detection of these 2 cases, combined with identifying 2 additional suspected cases, led to the decision to transfer these patients and an additional 4 patients requiring continuous care in an ICU to the recovery room. "These are patients who are clinically compromised and with immunocompromising conditions," explained Alvarez.

Nevertheless, the management team of the health facility ruled out any risk for the population. "The situation is normal," said Zapatero, who said that these infections are usual in hospitals.

On her part, the chief of prevention [infection control] of the hospital, Laura Moratilla, said that collection of "routine specimens" from the ICU and operating rooms, as well isolation rooms and other areas, reduces risks.

[Aspergillosis is an infection caused by the fungus _Aspergillus_ species, most commonly _Aspergillus fumigatus_ and _A. flavus_. Invasive aspergillosis usually occurs in people who have severe/prolonged granulocytopenia or are immunosuppressed for other reasons. Aspergilli can also cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with underlying lung diseases.

_Aspergillus_ is found everywhere in the environment, such as soil, decomposing plant matter, household dust, building materials, plants, food, and water. Transmission usually occurs through inhalation of airborne spores. Hospital-acquired infections can be sporadic, or clusters of cases can occur due to inhalation of spores, such as following building construction.

_Aspergillus_ is an angio-invasive fungus, and definitive diagnosis requires histopathological evidence of infection or a positive culture from a normally sterile site. _Aspergillus_ appears microscopically as septated hyphae with acute angle branching. Other diagnostic methods include detection of galactomannan and beta-D-glucan (both cell wall components of _Aspergillus_ as well as other fungi) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

The news report above does not give any clinical or epidemiological details concerning the aspergillosis that occurred in the 2 hospitalized patients. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Fuenlabrada, with a population of 197 836 residents in 2009, is a city and municipality in the Madrid Metropolitan Area, Spain, located 22.5 km (14 miles) southwest of the capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuenlabrada). - Mod.ML
