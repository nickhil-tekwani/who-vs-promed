[1] UK (England: Herefordshire): farm workers
Date: Mon 13 Jul 2020

More than 70 workers have tested positive for coronavirus at a vegetable farm in Herefordshire during the harvesting season [73 positive cases]. Herefordshire Council and Public Health England told The Hertfordshire Times a spike in COVID-19 cases in the area was due to an outbreak at AS Green and Co in Mathon, near Malvern. The outbreak has occurred during the harvest season, when around 200 workers live in mobile homes on site. Public Health England (PHE) Midlands has asked all 200 key workers to self-isolate as a precaution and the council is arranging food supplies for those on site.

Katie Spence, PHE Midlands health protection director said the testing results showed a "significant percentage of positive cases" despite the individuals being asymptomatic, meaning they weren't showing symptoms of the disease. "A small number of workers became symptomatic earlier this week and they and a few close contacts among the workforce were tested initially and found to be positive," said Ms Spence in a statement on Herefordshire Council's website.

AS Green and Co said it had put in place a number of infection control measures to reduce the risk of staff contracting coronavirus. Workers were encouraged to wash their hands regularly, maintain social distancing in communal social areas and in the indoor packaging area, and PHE Midlands said personal protective equipment was provided for staff where applicable.

Following the Pick for Britain campaign -- an initiative to bring together UK workers and farmers together to prevent crops rotting in the ground during the pandemic -- the farm said it had received more than 300 applications. On the firm's website, it says workers are expected to share accommodation at Rook Row Farm, while there is a recreational building with a pool table, dart board and TV for all employees.

Karen Wright, director of public health for Herefordshire, added: "Prompt testing on the farm has allowed us to understand transmission and control the spread of infection.

[Agricultural workers have apparently been at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, related to conditions inside the packing areas making social distancing challenging, as well as crowded living conditions. This has been observed in many countries. The public worries about the safety of the agricultural products, but the safety of the workers should have equal attention.

[2] Japan (Okinawa): US military

The Tokyo metropolitan government on Tuesday [14 Jul 2020] confirmed 143 new COVID-19 infections, with the number staying below the 200-mark for the 2nd day in a row but spiking above the 119 cases reported a day earlier. The previous day's figure marked the 1st time the number of daily COVID-19 cases had dropped below 200 in 5 days. Concerns remain about a resurgence of the virus, however, as clusters of infections have continued to occur at nighttime entertainment establishments in downtown areas in Tokyo including those in Shinjuku and Ikebukuro wards.

Localized clusters on US bases in Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa have also triggered concerns, with Japan urging the United States to step up measures to stem the spread, the Foreign Ministry here said on Tuesday [14 Jul 2020].

The metropolitan government said that as for the newly detected cases in the capital, 93 people were aged in their 20s and 30s, with the infection route known in 79 cases, but unknown in 64. Employees or customers of nighttime entertainment establishments comprised 23 of the total new COVID-19 infections.

Tokyo's cumulative number of infections now stands at 8189, the highest among Japan's 47 prefectures, and accounting for more than one-third of the country's total COVID-19 cases. Nationwide, 330 new COVID-19 infections were detected, according to the latest figures on Tuesday evening [14 Jul 2020]. Aside from the cases in Tokyo, its neighboring prefectures of Saitama and Kanagawa confirmed 42 and 28 new cases respectively. Japan's cumulative total now stands at 22 583 COVID-19 cases. The nation's total death toll from the virus stands at 997 people, Tuesday evening's official figures showed.

The Japanese government on Tuesday [14 Jul 2020] requested the US to up its efforts to prevent the spread of the virus amid a recent spike in cases on US military bases in Okinawa. According to the prefectural government, around 100 COVID-19 cases have been reported on US bases in Okinawa sparking local and nationwide concern over the further spread of the virus.

Okinawa has reported very few cases of the coronavirus, [apart from] those related to US bases, since the outbreak began. Hence, local officials and residents have voiced strong concern that a further rise in COVID-19 cases on the island would devastate the region's local industries, especially as Japan is looking to ease international travel restrictions.

Japan's entry ban in place for 129 countries and regions including the United States amid the pandemic does not apply to US military personnel under a status of forces agreement. A local hotel in the southern prefecture being used by US Marines and their families arriving in Japan from overseas to quarantine has also added to rising concerns over the virus' spread, the prefectural government said.

According to Japanese defense minister Taro Kono, there have been "several problems" regarding the US military's virus prevention measures. Okinawa governor Denny Tamaki said that some US military-linked personnel had held parties in downtown areas and on beaches in the prefecture, coinciding with Independence Day celebrations held on [4 Jul 2020].

The US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma has reported the most coronavirus cases at 71 infections as of Tuesday evening [14 Jul 2020], while 22 infections have been detected at Camp Hansen.

[According to the most recent Worldometer data on the USA reporting entities, as of 14 Jul 2020, the US military has reported 25 822 cases of COVID-19 (see section [3] E below for tables). A delicate situation is described in the above media report. Given the known situation that the USA has the highest total case count, plus the highest daily newly confirmed case counts, it does potentially pose a threat of transmission internationally when troops are deployed.

[3] Selected countries
[A] China: National Health Commission, 83 611 total cases, 4634 deaths
[B] South Korea: 13 551 confirmed cases, 289 deaths
[C] Italy: 243 344 total cases, 34 984 deaths
[D] Iran: 262 173 total cases, 13 211 deaths
[E] USA: 3 545 077 total cases, 139 143 deaths

[These countries have been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas, in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

- A total of 1988 imported cases have been reported.
- 83 611 confirmed cases and 4634 deaths; 78 693 recovered and discharged from hospital; 767 432 close contacts with infected patients; and 3577 are under medical observation.
- 4 new asymptomatic cases (all imported); no asymptomatic cases confirmed as symptomatic; 110 asymptomatic cases under medical observation (including 87 imported cases).
- 1569 cases in Hong Kong [an increase of 100 cases since 13 Jul 2020], 46 in Macau.

[The 6 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours were all imported, and no new cases have been reported from Beijing for 9 days.

There were 4 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals (all imported) and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 100 new cases. As of 4 PM on 14 Jul 2020 (local time), there was information on 48 newly confirmed cases. Of those, there were 27 males and 21 females aged between 6 and 90 years and 8 had a travel history during the incubation period. (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/14/P2020071400955.htm). In addition, there is a report of a nosocomial cluster of 3 confirmed cases and potentially 44 ontacts of other patients and 27 healthcare worker contacts. (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/14/P2020071400906.htm).

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions -- new severe restrictions announced.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 39 cases with no new deaths, compared with 33 cases and no deaths in the previous day (13 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 92 consecutive days. There were 11 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (6), Gyeonggi (3), Gwangju (1), and Daejeon (1); and 28 imported cases: airport quarantine (23), Gyeonggi (2), Daejeon (2) and Incheon (1). There were 12 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 11 provinces yesterday, 11 Jul 2020).

The overall impression hasn't changed. Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in places of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well. New clusters seem to be controlled fairly quickly due to excellent contact tracing activities, a key to maintaining control.

Health monitoring data on the spread of the new coronavirus released on 12 Jul 2020. [These figures come from the table published for the day, recognizing that there have been adjustments in some of the data from previous tables. - Mod.MPP]:

- 243 344 cumulative cases (+114);
- 12 919 people are currently positive for the virus (-238);
- 195 441 people have recovered (+335);
- 777 patients are hospitalized with symptoms (+9), 60 in intensive care (-5), and 12 082 (-242) are in home isolation;

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +114 cases and +17 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (13 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +169 cases and +13 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in intensive care units are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (30) -- the lowest reported by Lombardy in months; Veneto (19), Lazio (18), Sicily (15), and Emilia-Romagna (13), are the other provinces reporting 10 or more cases A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (9 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 69 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 53 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

Iran's health ministry spokesman said out of the country's 31 provinces, 12 are currently considered as high-risk "red zones" in terms of coronavirus transmission. In her press briefing on Tuesday [14 Jul 2020], Sima-Sadat Lari said Khuzestan, West Azarbaijan, East Azarbaijan, Khorasan Razavi, Zanjan, Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Golestan, Hormozgan, Ilam, Bushehr, and Mazandaran provinces are considered as "red zones". She said 13 other provinces, namely Tehran, Fars, Ardabil, Isfahan, Alborz, South Khorasan, Sistan and Baluchestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Lorestan, Hamadan, Yazd, Kerman, and North Khorasan are also considered orange (alarming) zones.

Authorities also announced a decision to once more shutter some businesses in the capital to contain the virus' resurgence. The reimposition of restrictive measures comes after the government had progressively lifted them from April [2020] to reopen its sanctions-hit economy.

Lari said 179 patients have died of the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours, increasing the overall death toll to 13 211. She also confirmed 2521 new cases of COVID-19 infection, raising the total number of infections to 262 173. The spokeswoman said 225 270 patients have so far recovered from COVID-19, but 3389 are still in severe conditions of the disease. She further stressed that so far 2 023 079 COVID-19 tests have been taken across the country.

The one-week measure in Tehran includes the closure of gyms, pools, zoos and cafes, ISNA news agency quoted Tehran's deputy governor Hamidreza Goudarzi as saying. "Holding any social, cultural, and religious events and conferences is banned from today for a week," he said.

The republic has been struggling to contain the virus since announcing its 1st cases in mid-February [2020]. It has refrained from enforcing full lockdowns to stop the pandemic's spread and resorted to closing schools, cancelling public events and banning movement between provinces in March [2020] before lifting them.

[As of 14 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 262 173, including 13 211 deaths, an increase of 2521 cases and 179 deaths since 13 Jul 2020. The media report above mentions there are 12 provinces considered red zones and an additional 13 provinces considered orange (alarming) zones. That translates to 25 out of the 31 provinces experiencing major SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

[The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 545 077 including 139 143 deaths, an increase from 3 479 483 cases and 138 247 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 216 468 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 14 Jul 2020 (+269 since 13 Jul 2020) including 18 720 (+12 since 13 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4616 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee, The same 10 states as yesterday (13 Jul 2020), in a slightly different order. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1514 to 11 060. In terms of cumulative case reports, the order is unchanged from previous days with New York as number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 43 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.9%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 21.3% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country -- hopefully beginning to plateau but it's too early to tell.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 14 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The latest edition of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, published yesterday [13 Jul 2020], estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 -- up by 10 million from 2018, and by nearly 60 million in the past 5 years. The report forecasts the COVID-19 pandemic could tip over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020.

- In South Sudan, WHO and the Ministry of Health are working to address stigma and fear, which are proving to be major barriers to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.

- A new report from WHO highlights that violence and injuries are a leading cause of death in the WHO European Region, accounting for almost 500 000 deaths a year. Evidence shows that violence can increase during and in the aftermath of disease outbreaks, particularly affecting women, children and older people. WHO has also produced guidance specifically addressing violence against women.

- The WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) has launched a new webinar series to manage infodemics through effective risk communication and community engagement. This is discussed in today's 'subject in focus'.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 56.2% of the global newly reported cases and 51.0% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, although a drop in proportional representation from prior days. The USA reported 54.4% (60 113) of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 22.5% (24 831), Colombia 4.6% (5083), Mexico 4.1% (4482), Peru 3.3% (3616), Argentina 2.4% (2657), and Chile 2.4% (2616).

- The European region reported 10.5% of the global newly reported cases and 10.3% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 30.2% (6248) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 9.9% (2045), Kazakhstan 9.0% (1856), Israel 6.2% (1279), France 5.4% (1115), Turkey 4.9% (1008), Sweden 4.5% (9.8), Uzbekistan 3.3% (679), Ukraine 3.1% (638), the UK 2.6% (530), Azerbaijan 2.6% (529), Kyrgyzstan 2.0% (421), and Romania 2.0% (413).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8.0% of the global newly reported cases and 14.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 18.2% (2852) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 15.0% (2349), Iraq 14.2% (2229), Oman 13.8% (2164), Pakistan 12.6% (1979), Egypt 6.0% (931), Kuwait 3.9% (614), Bahrain 3.4% (535), and Qatar 2.7% (418).

- The African region reported 7.7% of the global newly reported cases and 4.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 76.6% (11 554) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 3.9% (595), Algeria 3.3% (494), Ghana 3.1% (470), and Zambia 2.6% (388).

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.87% of the global newly reported cases and 1.8% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 43.7% (747) of the newly reported cases in the region (a significant drop), followed by Japan 20.6% (352), Singapore 18.8% (322), Australia 10.7% (183), China 3.2% (55), and South Korea 1.9% (33).

- The South East Asia region reported 16.8% of the global newly reported cases and 17.7% of global deaths. India reported 86.1% (28 498) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 9.4% (3099), Indonesia 3.9% (1282), and Nepal 0.44% (144).

Impression: Caution in interpretation of individual country standings as data reflect reporting on Mon 13 Jul 2020 and most likely have weekend artifact. That being said, the overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 13 454 490, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours though, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (65 594) followed by Brazil (43 245) and India (29 842). It is sobering to tally the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), and see that they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (55.7%). A global total of 581 118 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5593 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Russia, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Bangladesh. The same 10 countries as yesterday (13 Jul 2020), in a slightly different order. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3163 to 65 594. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. Noteworthy is that Kazakhstan is in the top 20 (number 15), having reported 1856 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Also worthy of note is that 6 out of the top 10 countries for daily reported newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region, consistent with the continued dominance of SARS-CoV-2 activity.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.MPP]
