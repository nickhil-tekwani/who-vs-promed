The FDA [U.S. Food & Drug Administration is investigating reports of over
50 patient deaths worldwide, including four in the United States, that may
have been caused by certain dialyzers made by Baxter Healthcare
Corporation, Deerfield, Ill.
Baxter voluntarily recalled the dialyzers in mid-October after reports of
deaths associated with its product in kidney dialysis patients in Spain,
Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the U.S. The U.S. deaths
occurred at dialysis facilities in Austin, Tex., and Kearney, Neb. Most of
the dialysis patients who died experienced shortness of breath, chest
tightness, cardiac arrest or stroke symptoms within hours of being dialyzed.
FDA has worked closely with Baxter and with regulatory agencies abroad to
identify the problems quickly, and protect public health by recalling the
dialyzers.
Preliminary tests have led Baxter to conclude that a
perfluorohydrocarbon-based performance fluid used in a manufacturing step
may have played a role in the deaths of these patients. Confirmatory tests
are underway. Baxter reports that it has permanently ceased manufacturing
these dialyzers. No dialyzer shortage is anticipated as a result of
Baxter's decision.
The following dialyzers--labeled either Althane or Baxter--were recalled:
- Series A11, A15, A18 and A22
- Series AF150, AF180 and AF220
- Series AX1500 and AX2200
The products were distributed from January 1998 to 15 Oct 2001 to dialysis
facilities in more than 50 countries. The first reported deaths occurred in
Spain in mid-August.
In mid-October, Baxter notified all of its customers to stop using these
dialyzers immediately and return any inventory. FDA is continuing to work
with Baxter to ensure the recall is effective.
If you would like to contact Baxter you can either call the Center For One
Baxter at 1-800-422-9837 or 847-948-4770 (Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m. CST)

[This is the first official report of the investigation into these
unexplained dialysis related deaths. Prior reports were newswire articles
on the deaths with mention of the possibility of an association with a
perfluorohydrocarbon-based performance fluid used in the manufacturing
process. The FDA report mentions that these dialysis filters were
distributed from January 1998 through the date of recall 15 Oct 2001. If
these filters have been on the market and in use since January 1998, one
wonders what may have occurred to lead to a problem that is first observed
in August 2001, approximately 42 months after distribution of the product
began. Further information on the findings of this investigation will be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP
