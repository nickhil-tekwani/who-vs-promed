The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) received confirmation
yesterday (5 Apr 2005) that equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1) was the cause
of equine illness at the Columbia Horse Center in Columbia, Md. The virus,
which causes upper respiratory infection, can also cause neurologic
disease. 3 horses experienced neurologic signs before their conditions
required euthanasia. 2 other horses in nearby stalls that showed signs of
mild neurologic illness are doing well, and no additional horses are
showing any clinical signs.
"We are relieved to have a definitive diagnosis and that no additional
horses are showing signs of illness," said James I. Fearer, DVM, acting
state veterinarian for Maryland. The results were received from a
laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center on Tuesday
(5 Apr). "All parties involved have made the assumption from the start that
this could be an infectious or contagious disease of horses, so we will not
have to change our protocols in any way, and the measures appear to have
prevented any spread of the virus. However, precautionary measures on the
farm will remain in place until we are certain that the incident is concluded."
There is currently no known method to reliably prevent the neurologic form
of EHV-1 infection. It is recommended to maintain appropriate vaccination
protocols in an attempt to reduce the incidence of the respiratory form of
EHV-1 infection, which might help prevent the neurologic form. Transmission
of the virus can occur via coughing or sneezing over a distance of up to 35
feet, as well as by direct contact with infected horses, feed, and equipment.
"It is important to note that all of the horses had current vaccinations
and that the incidence of the illness is no fault of the owners or facility
managers," said Fearer. "Why the neurologic form of EHV-1 occurs
occasionally is not yet known in the veterinary community. The situation in
Columbia was unfortunate and has been handled with the utmost
professionalism and precaution from the onset."
Horse owners and the equine community outside of the Columbia facility were
instructed to continue with their everyday activities and with their plans
for competitions with confidence. As always, horse owners are urged to
monitor the health of their animals as usual and to work with their private
veterinarians with any concerns.
The MDA placed an "investigational animal hold order" on the facility on
Friday, 25 Mar 2005. Even before that time, facility managers began making
sure that no non-resident horses come in contact with the affected horses
or the barn in which they are housed, and they cancelled shows and lessons.
Personnel handling and caring for the horses are only working in that barn
and are practicing thorough disinfection protocols.
