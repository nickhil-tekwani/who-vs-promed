A 3rd death has been reported in Spain's biggest _Listeria_ outbreak, which has seen 200 cases of infection reported so far. A man has reportedly died after eating tainted meat in Spain. This is the 3rd fatality in the outbreak, which comes on top of the deaths of 2 elderly women. The outbreak has also seen 5 women lose their babies due to the food-borne bacteria.

The 1st possible case of listeriosis outside of Spain as part of the current outbreak has also been reported. The potential victim is a Briton who may have become infected with the bacteria while in the focal point of the ongoing outbreak, Andalusia, before traveling to France, where he was diagnosed with listeriosis and spent several days in hospital, then returning to his home country.

The source of the outbreak has been traced to a pork product stuffed with garlic and other condiments sold under the commercial name "la Mecha", which is made by the company Magrudis, based in Seville. Its factory has since been closed and its meat recalled from shops.

According to EL PAIS [Spanish newspaper], the oven cart used at the company has tested positive for the bacteria _Listeria monocytogenes_. Last week [25-31 Aug 2019], the news outlet revealed that tests carried out on larding needles used by Magrudis also returned positive results for the presence of the bacteria.

The company said they are "in a state of shock," and "couldn't explain what happened" in a press release reportedly released by Magrudis. The company also claims to have been in compliance with all sanitary regulations, with recent lab reports proving negative test results from just days before the product in question was packaged.

Showing her solidarity with the people affected by the outbreak, the families of the deceased, and women who have suffered abortions or intrauterine fetal deaths, Maria Luisa Carcedo, the Minister of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare, has expressed her "most sincere solidarity and deep regret in the name of the Government of Spain. I know that this is not enough and that the fundamental reparation that we are obliged to give [the victims and their families] is the determination of the causes and circumstances in which this outbreak has occurred and the adoption of decisions that prevent this from happening again."

The 1st official report on the outbreak was on 16 Aug 2019 by Andalusian health authorities, said Carcedo: "Since [16 Aug 2019], the protocols of the national alert network and the EU have worked," said the minister. "Spain is one of the most demanding countries in food security, and outbreaks such as [the one in] Andalusia should serve to further improve our action and response protocols." Carcedo also thanked the health professionals of the National Health System and food safety "who have worked both in patient care and in the containment of the outbreak".

The listeriosis outbreak, the largest recorded in Spain to date, has so far caused 3 deaths, 7 abortions and affected more than 200 people. The authorities considered it controlled. Now this new front opens. Dr. Jose Miguel Cisneros has reported on Friday morning [6 Sep 2019] of a new confirmed case, which brings the number of people affected in Andalusia to 207, and another abortion, the 6th in the community and the 7th in the whole country. This is a pregnant woman from Seville, 23 weeks of gestation, and who had ingested the Mecha meatloaf a few weeks ago, without presenting symptoms. The number of hospitalized is 45 versus 40 on the previous day [5 Sep 2019], of which 19 are pregnant women. Two patients remain in the ICU.

_Listeria_ is an almost harmless pathogen for most healthy people, but it can be lethal for those with weakened immune systems and for babies in gestation, as confirmed in the outbreak recorded so far by contaminated brand products La Mecha, from the Sevillian company Magrudis.

[This listeriosis outbreak is now reported to extend throughout Spain, although most cases have occurred in Seville. The 2nd news report above says that the outbreak has now involved 7 miscarriages, and a case in a tourist from the UK who was hospitalized in France with listeriosis acquired in Seville.

_Listeria_ have been identified in 3 meat products and in needles used to inject lard into the meat before it is cooked at a meat processing facility in Seville; after cooking, the meat is usually served cold and in thin slices. Proper cooking of the meat at the processing facility should have killed _Listeria_, which suggests either that the meat may have been improperly cooked or that contamination may have also occurred after cooking. The 1st news report above says that _Listeria_ was isolated from an oven cart used at the company; if the meat was placed on this cart after cooking, it could explain how the meat became contaminated despite having been previously cooked. The meat processing facility in Seville has been closed, and all its products have now been recalled.

Because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop, more cases can be expected.

Genotyping clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ will help identify clusters of cases that have a common source, and genotyping the isolates from the food and environmental surfaces at the meat processing facility will help confirm the source, if genotypes match. We await further developments in the investigation of this outbreak. - Mod.ML
