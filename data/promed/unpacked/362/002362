Dear Colleagues,

It must be human nature to avoid exertion as long as possible. One would certainly think this is the case if we extrapolate individual behavior from global actions: the international community pays scant attention to health until there is an emergency. Is it also our nature, perhaps, to focus on only one thing at a time? The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a crisis that arises in part from many months of international irresolution; it demands our immediate attention to save lives. However, the simultaneous advent of chikungunya into the Americas is a rapidly emerging disaster that will cause great physical pain and bring economic insecurity to millions. But the world community has yet to pay attention.

The first report of chikungunya in the western hemisphere came from the French side of St Martin last December. Abundant populations of the chikungunya virus mosquito vectors, _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, helped spread the disease quickly. Three weeks later, there were 66 confirmed cases on St Martin with another 14 probable and 167 suspected. By then, the disease had also spread to St Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana. By mid-February the number of Caribbean cases had climbed past 1000. By the beginning of May, the head of the Caribbean Public Health Authority had declared that the chikungunya virus outbreak had reached epidemic proportions.

Fast-forward and the outbreak in 11 months had caused an estimated 795 000 chikungunya cases in 37 countries and territories in the western hemisphere (no doubt vastly understating the actual numbers). Over the prior 8 years, an average of 28 people per year returned to the US infected with chikungunya during travel abroad; so far this year, there have been 1371 cases. In June 2014, El Salvador reported locally transmitted chikungunya cases for the first time in Central America; 5 months later, El Salvador has had over 93 000 cases. Meanwhile, back in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic has had 499 000 cases and Puerto Rico is seeing steady weekly increases in locally acquired cases and a total of nearly 19 000.

ProMED serves a vital role by providing infectious disease practitioners worldwide with news and analysis. Its daily goal is to inform readers and contribute to the prevention of infections, illness, and fatalities. To keep you up to date on topics you need and want to know about, ProMED maintains an international staff of experts available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, putting the news in context, adding perspective and analysis, and offering a level and quality of service that makes it a valuable resource. Please support the global community that is ProMED. Please contribute generously.

Some will ask how chikungunya can be compared with the horror of Ebola. The acute phase of chikungunya infection, typically lasting about 10 days, is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting; most victims suffer severe joint pain. For 30-40 percent of those infected, recurrent joint pain may be experienced for years. In the elderly, the arthralgia can evolve to a chronic arthritis syndrome; meningoencephalitis may occur. And despite frequently being seen as a non-fatal disease, during the 2005-2006 outbreak in La Reunion over a third of the population was infected and the excess mortality rate associated with chikungunya virus infection was 0.3/1000 persons. Especially for the elderly and very young, chikungunya is not non-fatal.

Because chikungunya has not previously existed in the Americas, there is little immunity to the infection; we can assume that nearly 100 percent of the population is susceptible. In a region with one billion people and ample vectors, vast amounts of suffering and economic dislocation, and many thousands of deaths, is not beyond the realm of possibility.

Clearly, events such as the current Ebola and chikungunya outbreaks can only be dealt with through a commitment to cross-sector collaboration at national, regional, and global levels. It will take commitment on the part of all of us to advocate for action and build the capacity and will to implement the changes needed to plan and prepare before a crisis hits and treat victims worldwide regardless of what's trending on Twitter. We at ProMED look forward to working with you to do this. But we can't do it without your help.
