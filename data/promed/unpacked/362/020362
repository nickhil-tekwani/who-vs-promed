Evanger's Dog & Cat Food has issued a voluntary recall of dog food after a deadly sedative was found. Cans of "Hunk of Beef" were recalled [Fri 3 Feb 2017] after pentobarbital [a sedative] contaminated a single lot made between [6 and 13 Jun 2016].

A total of 5 dogs becoming ill and one death have been reported.

"Hunk of Beef" lots that were affected were distributed in Washington, California, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.

Despite the sedative being found in just one lot of dog food, the company is recalling lots made in the same week with numbers that start with 1816E03HB, 1816E04HB, 1816E06HB, 1816E07HB, and 1816E13HB, and that have an expiration date of June 2020.

According to the FDA, pentobarbital can cause drowsiness, dizziness, excitement, loss of balance, nausea, or even death when ingested by animals.

"In an abundance of caution, Evanger's has made the decision to voluntarily recall 5 lots of "Hunk of Beef"," the company said in a statement. "Although nearly all product involved in this recall have already been consumed by pets without incident, we have decided to initiate the recall as a proactive measure against the remote possibility of any illness.

"Although only one household in the country reported illness, out of the 5 lots that are being recalled, we feel it is the right thing to do. This is our 1st recall in the 82 years that we have been in business."

According to the statement, Evanger's is funding the bills for the sick dogs while also making a donation to a local animal shelter.

[According to the FDA, pentobarbital can cause drowsiness, dizziness, excitement, loss of balance, nausea, or even death when ingested by animals. Only one animal has died.

Pentobarbital can be used to treat seizures, but when it is used to euthanize an animal, then that meat from that animal is consumed in some fashion, there can be prolonged sedation, or even death, as noted in the statement above.

One has to wonder how pentobarbital got into the dog food? If the brand is pure meat and is not ground or processed, then it is possible an animal could consume enough to cause sedation and/or death. If the animal is supposedly beef, then one wonders how did meat from a euthanized animal get into the processing line? Was this a case someone not informing the company of a euthanized animal, or perhaps no one was aware that an animal was euthanized? Was this a quality mishap and a euthanized horse somehow got into the processing line? Could this have been sabotage in some way? Did some one have a grudge against the company?

There are many questions that need to be answered. Hopefully an investigation will be conducted to provide some answers, and DNA sampling will be conducted to determine if there was meat from some animal that was not supposed to be on the processing line.

The company seems to be helping those affected, but nevertheless, an investigation may answer who may be at fault and how the situation occurred.

The recall is a good faith effort to ensure any possible affected lots are returned to the company. We wish them and all involved success in this situation. - Mod.TG
