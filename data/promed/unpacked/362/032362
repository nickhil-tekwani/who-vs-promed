A new outbreak of dengue fever has hit Townsville. Queensland Health on
Friday [16 Apr 2010] confirmed that 2 women, from the suburbs of North Ward
and Deeragun, have been diagnosed with type 2 of the dengue virusk, the 1st
locally-acquired cases in the city since December [2009].

Queensland Health's Dr Steven Donohue said given the 10 km [6 mi] distance
between the 2 cases, it was likely more cases would come to light. "There
certainly will be other cases; we are trying to find out what could be the
link," he said. Dr Donohue said one of the women had recovered, and the
other was still being treated. "They presented with very typical symptoms,
sudden fever, severe headaches, muscle pains, nausea," he said.

Three Queensland Health teams and council officers are visiting properties
to check for mosquitoes and breeding sites, such as car tyres, saucers and
pot plant stands.

The city experienced 2 small outbreaks last year [2009] which affected 13
residents. Those outbreaks were declared over early last month [March 2010].

Summary: In late February-early April 2010, 5 cases of dengue fever were
diagnosed in returning travellers in Europe in EurotravNet sites in Sweden
and France in patients with travel history to the Comoros and/or Zanzibar,
Tanzania. [Of these,] 4 cases were non-complicated dengue fever and one
case dengue hemorrhagic fever. At the time of diagnosis, 3 patients were
viraemic and infected with dengue type 3 virus.

In 2010 (until 14 Apr 2010), 5 cases of dengue fever including one case of
DHF have been reported from EurotravNet sites in France and Sweden, 4
travellers returning from the Comoros and one traveller returning from
Zanzibar, Tanzania.

[3] Mayotte

Following the reporting of "dengue-like" syndromes by several sentinel
[system] physicians over Mayotte, dengue [virus] serotype 3 has been
diagnosed. The 1st case presented with [dengue] signs on 10 Mar 2010.

As of 14 Apr 2010, 14 confirmed cases have been identified throughout the
island (map 1 [see original report]): 11 imported cases (including 10 from
the Comoros) and 3 indigenous cases (including one on Petite Terre). In
addition, 10 cases are classified as probable. No severe form [of dengue]
has been identified.

These dengue cases occurred when an epidemic of dengue serotype 3 developed
in the Comoros since the beginning of 2010.

No [previous] outbreaks had been reported to date at Mayotte, except in
Petite Terre in 1943. A serological survey in 2006 showed an IgG
seroprevalence of 23 percent of the population, mainly in people over 15
years, probably related to the dengue epidemic of 1993 in the Comoros
(DEN-1 [virus] serotype).

DEN-3 [virus] serotype had never been identified in this sub-region of the
Indian Ocean. The entire population of Mayotte is therefore likely susceptible.

The Butanta and Rio Pequeno regions in the eastern area of Sao Paulo
[state] are suffering a dengue outbreak and possible under reporting of the
disease. The School Health Center, one of the main health units in the
neighborhood, has had at least 40 [dengue] infections this year [2010].
This is greater than the 26 tallied by the prefecture [government], the
difference of which is attributed to the normal time [needed] to update
their totals.

In a visit to Morro Querosene (Butanta) last Thursday [15 Apr 2010], a
report stated that the region is living in an epidemic climate. It found in
just 3 streets, 10 residents with examinations that confirmed that they had
the disease. One of them, a journalist, had DHF and was admitted to hospital.

the state Secretariat of Health. This year [2010], there have been 17
dengue deaths. In 2009, there were 24 deaths from the disease.

The city is going through a dengue outbreak, and the cases increase each
month. In January 2010, there were 167 cases, in February 2010 another 564,
and, as of 14 Apr 2010, 811 cases were confirmed. The recommendation is

At least 45 DHF deaths have been registered in Colombia so far in 2010, and
another 32 cases of people who died with the same symptoms are under study,
the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) [National Institute of Health]
reported today [14 Apr 2010]. The report noted that up to this past 8 Apr
[2010], there have been a total of 49 122 dengue cases, of which 8 per cent
(3916) correspond to serious dengue [infections] or DHF. "As for deaths as
a consequence of this disease, 45 have been confirmed [due to dengue virus
infection], 32 are under study and 20 have been discarded," noted this source.

The departments with the most [fatal] victims of this disease are the Valle
del Cauca with 11 cases, Risaralda with 6, and Huila, Meta, and Santander
with 4 each. The Valle del Cauca, Santander, Tolima, Risaralda y Antioquia
are the regions where the most dengue cases have occurred.

Due to the seriousness of these statistics, the National Superintendency of
Health has requested that the departmental [state or province equivalent]
and municipal health secretariats provide explanations relating to
compliance with dengue contingency plans, "and other specific situations
which have arisen in facing the epidemic of the disease."

The health authorities also have requested that the population apply the
protection systems indicated.
