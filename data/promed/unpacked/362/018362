Poliomyelitis outbreaks in Africa and Asia: importation of infections
a serious risk for polio-free countries with low vaccine coverage
------------------------
The World Health Organization-coordinated global Poliomyelitis
Eradication Initiative has made tremendous progress since its
beginning in 1988 [1]. Polio became close to being eradicated in 2001
when the lowest annual case count ever, less than 500 worldwide, was
reported. However, several setbacks, mainly due to sub-optimal
vaccine coverage, have prevented this goal being reached.
From 2002 to 2005, 21 countries which were previously polio-free were
affected by cases imported from what were the 6 remaining countries
with endemic wild poliovirus (WPV) type 1 circulation (Afghanistan,
Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan). Most of these were from
Nigeria, while 3 importations were from India. For 8 countries,
imported WPV cases did not result in sustained transmission, but in
the remaining 13, WPV caused multiple outbreaks. In 2005, 1983 cases
of poliomyelitis were reported worldwide, and 50 were caused by
vaccine-derived polioviruses [2,3,4].
Large outbreaks in 2005:
3 countries were affected by outbreaks of more than 100 WPV cases in
2005: Yemen, Indonesia and Somalia. Most outbreaks required multiple
rounds of large-scale immunisation activities to control and stop
transmission.
- Yemen: confirmed its first detected case of imported WPV infection
(onset February 2005) in late April 2005. By the end of 2005, 478
polio cases had been reported from all over the country. A National
Immunisation Day (NID) had been conducted in mid-April 2005, before
the index case was identified, in response to the threat of
importation from Sudan. 6 additional NIDs were conducted from May to
December 2005.
- Indonesia: to date, 303 cases caused by WPV have been reported from
10 provinces on Java and Sumatra. The 1st case in the current
outbreak was reported with onset in March 2005. By the time the 1st
response mass immunisation campaign was organised, 99 cases had been
detected. 3 full NIDS were carried out in August 2005. The most
recent case onset was December 2005.
- Somalia: to date, 185 cases have been confirmed, with the most
recent onset being in November 2005. The first onset was July 2005,
after importation from Yemen. 3 NIDS have been carried out.
Transmission of poliomyelitis in other African and Asian countries
-----------------------------------------------
India:
A major outbreak in 2002 was successfully contained, and in 2005,
there were only 66 new cases. Continuing WPV circulation in India
also resulted in a single imported case in Lebanon in 2003, a few
cases in Nepal and reestablished circulation in Angola in 2005.
Nigeria:
Cases began to increase in Nigeria in 2002 when immunisations with
OPV were interrupted in some northern states because of an
unjustified fear of harmful side-effects, and consequently, the
number of polio cases increased in several parts of Nigeria. Type 1
WPV subsequently spread to 18 countries that had been polio-free for
several years.
Other countries:
The virus is known to have been transmitted from Nigeria to Chad,
onward to Sudan, and onward again to Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Only 2
cases were reported in Saudi Arabia, but the virus was transmitted
onward from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia. Children under 15 years of age
traveling to Saudi Arabia from countries where wild poliovirus has
been reported must now be vaccinated against polio before entry into
the country, whether or not they are visiting for the Hajj pilgrimage.
The geographical routes of virus transmission were determined by
comparing the sequences of virus isolates from different locations.
Point mutations accumulate in the viral genome during replication in
human host, which makes it possible to identify each strain
unequivocally, search for relatives among previously studied strains
and track the transmission routes.
Low routine immunisation coverage enables outbreaks from imported
infections. Supplementary immunisation campaigns with oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV), such as national immunisation days, have been
effective in eliminating wild poliovirus (WPV) circulation in
developing countries, especially where there are high population
densities and sub-optimal sanitary conditions.
The recent dramatic outbreaks of poliomyelitis in several African and
Asian countries are a strong reminder of the fact that stopping
National Immunisation Days may leave the population susceptible to
poliovirus transmission and epidemics of paralytic disease, unless
routine immunisation coverage of newborn children with poliovirus
vaccine is sufficiently high.
The 8 countries where WPV infections were imported but only isolated
cases or repeated importations were recorded, had higher median OPV
coverage than the 13 countries where WPV transmission was
reestablished and continued for at least 6 months (83 percent and 52
percent coverage, respectively). It is important to remember that
many other developing countries have the same problem of low routine
immunisation coverage. Even in countries with satisfactory overall
coverage, district-level evaluation would disclose population groups
in danger.
Low routine immunisation coverage could also occur in some European
countries, as demonstrated by polio outbreaks in the Netherlands, the
most recent being in 1992, where despite satisfactory overall
immunisation coverage, a non-immunised minority was able to sustain
WPV circulation, resulting in relatively large outbreaks of
poliomyelitis [5]. International human travel gives the virus easy
access to non-immunised subpopulations throughout the world, and so
long as WPV continues to circulate in humans, the risk of outbreaks
remains.
Current situation and future prospects
-------------------------
In early 2006, after intensive supplementary immunisation campaigns,
outbreaks in most of the reinfected African countries are under
control, with the exception of Somalia. These episodes have postponed
the possible world WPV eradication date again by several years;
according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Worldwide
eradication cannot be declared until at least 3 years after the most
recent isolation of WPV anywhere in the world. WHO now considers that
endemic transmission of WPV has stopped in Egypt and Niger [6],
leaving only 4 countries in the world with persistent indigenous WPV
transmission: Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan.
Conclusion
--------
Through impressive international and inter-agency collaboration,
poliomyelitis has become a rare disease in the world. However, the
proclaimed target, global eradication of wild-type poliovirus, has
yet to be reached.
An absence of cases over an extended period in a country or region
may give a false impression that the disease is no longer a problem.
Recent episodes in Africa and Asia remind us of the fragility of
immune protection in many populations and that all European countries
should evaluate polio immunisation coverage.
In addition, the PEI [Polio eradication initiative] can succeed only
if sufficient resources are made available for immunisation campaigns
and surveillance. The main supporters of the global programme, WHO,
UNICEF, Rotary International, and the United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, would certainly welcome increased
contributions from European countries.

[The above presentation is a continuation of the prior ProMED-mail
posting on the 2002-2005 review (archive number 20060217.0517) of
poliomyelitis worldwide, with an excellent focus on summarizing the
real concerns related to decreasing polio vaccination coverages in
areas that have been declared as having interrupted wild poliovirus
(WPV) circulation. As with the prior posting, the focus of the
summary has been re-introduction of WPV into areas where WPV had not
been isolated for 3 years, with a brief mention of 50 cases of
vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs).
Once again ProMED-mail is concerned that the impact of circulating
VDPVs in countries with pockets of low polio vaccination coverage has
not been detailed, and that further information should be provided on
the epidemiologic investigations. More specifically, there have been
46 cases of VDPV type 1 identified in Madura Island, East Java,
Indonesia, <http://w3.whosea.org/vaccine/linkfiles/polioupdate.pdf>
making this the largest outbreak of VDPV ever recorded (the 2nd
largest "outbreak" was in Egypt where type 2 VDPV was documented as
circulating during the period 1983 thorough 1993 resulting in 30
cases of paralytic poliomyelitis. Reported by: Yang CF, et al,
Circulation of Endemic Type 2 Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus in Egypt
from 1983 to 1993. J Virology, August 2003, 77(15):8366-8377) and
also covered in ProMED-mail archive 20010129.0205).
VDPV type 1 was isolated in a community in the USA where vaccinations
are not accepted on religious grounds, and in the importation of a
case of VDPV-associated paralytic disease in the USA in Feb 2006 (see
archives 20060202.0334, 20051015.3003, 20051014.2996, 20051002.2884).
