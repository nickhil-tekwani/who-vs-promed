The Forest Department has confirmed that the death of three spotted deer on the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras campus last week was not due to anthrax as suspected earlier.

A statement by the principal chief conservator of the forests and the chief wildlife warden of Tamil Nadu on [Wed 23 Mar 2022] said the tissue and blood smear samples sent to the laboratory in Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Tanuvas) tested negative for anthrax genome.

Last [Thu 17 Mar 2022], IIT Madras reported that 3 spotted deer died on the campus. As was the case during previous instances of such sporadic deaths of deer, the Forest Department said its officials examined the carcass and sent the samples to Tanuvas.

Because the cause of death was initially suspected to be anthrax, a necropsy was avoided and the carcasses were disposed of with adequate precautions. IIT Madras administration issued a circular asking all members of faculty, staff, students and residents to alert the control room about animals in distress.

The statement issued on [Wed 23 Mar 2022] said the test report allayed the fear of an anthrax outbreak at the deer habitat in IIT Madras. Pointing out that the IIT Madras had around 400 spotted deer, the statement added that instructions had been given to the wildlife warden, Chennai, to closely monitor and ensure adequate measures for their protection.

The mystery surrounding the recent deer deaths inside IIT-Madras is getting murkier with Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS), in an official communication, ruling out anthrax infection as the cause of death. Meanwhile, a monkey was found dead on the IIT-Madras campus, exhibiting similar symptoms of blood oozing out of natural openings.

A total of 3 deer were initially suspected to have died of anthrax and TANUVAS had instructed the forest department to not perform an autopsy on the carcasses and bury them in a pit not less than 6-8 feet (2-2.5m) deep, a protocol followed in anthrax cases. Moreover, officials from the forest department and IIT-Madras told TNIE on [Thu 17 Mar 2022] that at least one deer had died of anthrax.

Dr C Sreekumar, head of Department of Wildlife Science, Madras Veterinary College, sent the test reports to Chennai wildlife warden E Prasanth on [Tue 22 Mar 2022] evening. According to the report, accessed by TNIE, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, performed on the 3 deer samples (muzzle piece and blood stained sand), returned negative for anthrax genome.

According to sources, 4 deer were found dead on IIT-Madras campus between [Wed 16 Mar and Thu 17 Mar 2022], but a postmortem examination was performed only on one carcass. The examination revealed no sign of anthrax infection. The carcass, however, had 7 kg of plastic inside its stomach.

Replying to an RTI application filed by animal rights activist Antony Clement Rubin, the forest department had said 77 animals died on IIT-Madras campus last year [2021] and another 18 died in January and February this year [2022]. The office of principal chief conservator of forests has asked the Chennai wildlife warden to investigate the cause of the large number of animal deaths, especially those of deer and blackbucks, on IIT-Madras campus.

The forest department, as of now, seems to not have an answer to the back-to-back animal deaths on the campus. The latest death of a monkey, the sample of which has been sent to TANUVAS for tests, has become a cause of worry as monkeys come in close contact with human beings on the campus.

Another issue is how ill-equipped the forest department is to deal with a possible disease outbreak. There is no qualified wildlife veterinarian available in the Chennai wildlife wing. In fact, there is no post as such. "The Guindy National Park veterinarian (who initially visited the IIT Madras, examined the carcasses, and suspected anthrax infection) is a private vet on contract with no experience in dealing with wild animals. This is a precarious situation," an official source said.

The state government has spent a whopping Rs 20 crore [about USD 262 094] so far to build the Advanced Institute for Wildlife Conservation in Vandalur specifically for the purpose of conducting studies on zoonotic transmissions and genome sequencing of emerging strains.

The institute was inaugurated in 2017 but has, to date, not carried out any appreciable work. The posts of 2 scientists are yet to be filled. Recently, a Divisional Bench of the Madras High Court questioned the State government's lacklustre approach in strengthening the institute.

The forest department seems to not have an answer to the back-to-back animal deaths. The latest death of a monkey has become a cause of worry as monkeys come in close contact with human beings on the campus.

[This is clearly a more complicated problem than it appeared initially. The cause of death in these more recent cases is in the air. The university had earlier instructed forest dept to bury carcasses as per anthrax protocol. It is an ongoing problem or problems awaiting clarification. - Mod.MHJ
