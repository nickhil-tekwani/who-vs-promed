It is being reported that a barn at Illinois' Balmoral Park has been
quarantined after 4 horses tested positive for equine herpes[virus]
(EHV-1).
Harnessracing.com [see
<http://harnessracing.com/news_detailed.php?id=6780>] has indicated
that the horses in question are trained by Nelson Willis, who had a
pair of horses scratched last Saturday (21 Apr 2007) at Balmoral and
another 3 scratched from the Sunday [22 Apr 2007] program at the
Illinois oval.
According to the harnessracing.com report, Willis had qualified some
of his horses on Fri 13 Apr 2007. The horses showed some signs of
sickness the following day [Sat 14 Apr 2007], with another showing
signs of EHV-1 this past weekend [21-22 Apr 2007].
In response to this most recent outbreak and quarantine, chief state
veterinarian for the Illinois Racing Board David P. Fitzpatrick DVM,
posted the following message on the Illinois Harness Horsemen's
Association website:
"With the prevalence of EHV-1 outbreaks in other jurisdictions, I
would like to make the following recommendations to protect horses
racing at Balmoral and Maywood. All out-of-state horses shipping to
Balmoral or Maywood are required to be accompanied by a valid health
certificate with the horse's temperature recorded and proof of EHV-1
vaccination within the last 60 days.
"All Illinois horses shipping in or stabled on the track should be
vaccinated with a high antigenic dose vaccine (that is, Pneumabort K.
Rhinomune) every 60-90 days. All racehorses should have their
temperature monitored once or twice daily. Racehorses with
temperatures should not be exercised, shipped, or raced. "Trainers
are advised to consult with their veterinarian if they have febrile
horses and also on good bio-security procedures. Contact the State
Veterinarian's office if you have any questions or problems."

An outbreak of equine herpes[virus] (EHV-1) at a Balmoral Park barn
has prompted some horsemen to scratch their horses from competition,
with 13 scratched from Wednesday [25 Apr 2007] night's card, 12
scratched on Tuesday night [24 Apr 2007], and another 25 taken out of
qualifiers on Wednesday morning.
Balmoral Park took extensive efforts to clean and disinfect its
paddock, but has allowed horses to be scratched.
