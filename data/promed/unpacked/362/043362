A total of 11 cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have been reported in the commune of Oued El Berdi, about 20 km [12 miles] southeast of Bouira. These are 11 pregnant cows that contracted the virus in a barn of a private breeder. The 11 cattle head with high milk production were slaughtered.

During the onset of the disease, a few months ago, there were 23 FMD cases observed in the municipalities of Ain Bessem, Aghbalou and M'chedallah. The 23 cows were slaughtered to circumscribe the extent of the disease. All in all, this viral disease has not finished decimating the cattle herd despite the protection and compensation measures that have been taken.

In 2014, the province of Bouira saw its agro-pastoral vocation hard hit by this disease. This province, which has a cattle park estimated at more than 74 000 head, is an important dairy basin. The province had then experienced a worrying spread of the virus, with nearly 1000 cows slaughtered.

Despite the strengthening of control and prevention measures, including a large-scale vaccination campaign since the arrival of large quantities of vaccines [precise date unknown - Mod.AB], the distribution of antiseptics and disinfection products, it remains nevertheless that the agricultural services of the province of Bouira (DSA) dread other attacks. Note that FMDV can be carried even by the wind.

The regional cattle market, which was closed for a few days, saw its opening renewed again after Eid. According to some veterinarians, this situation has allowed the resurgence of other cases of FMD, certainly conveyed by herds that come from all regions of Algeria, at least the most famous for their pastoral vocation. However, the decision to close livestock markets was motivated by multiple reasons for preventing the spread of FMD, which, unfortunately, continues to prevail after their reopening.

[The province of Bouira is a region with an agro-pastoral vocation that constitutes an important dairy basin in Algeria. This province was heavily affected by FMD in 2014 and also since the emergence of the new epizootic in 2018. In the absence of strict containment measures, it appears that outbreaks of the disease originate there from other Algerian provinces.

The reopening of livestock markets, authorized on the occasion of Eid El Adha (sacrifice festival), is maintained despite the resurgence of new outbreaks of FMD. - Mod.AB

According to EUFMD's most recent available 'Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation' report for July 2018 (published 29 Aug 2018), the vaccine strains employed in the VMSD tests obtained good matching results with the field isolates detected during Algeria's 1st notified outbreaks of June 2018.

Most likely, the continuing cases are caused by the same FMDV strain which has been behind this event since its start, late June 2018, namely serotype O, topotype EA-3. - Mod.AS
