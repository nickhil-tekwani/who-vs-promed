Abstract
--------
Spondweni virus (SPONV) and Zika virus cause similar diseases in humans. We detected SPONV outside of Africa from a pool of _Culex_ mosquitoes collected in Haiti in 2016. This finding raises questions about the role of SPONV as a human pathogen in Haiti and other Caribbean countries.

[Background]
------------
Spondweni virus (SPONV) and Zika virus are closely related flaviviruses that were first described in Africa in 1952 and 1947, respectively (1). Humans infected by these viruses have similar clinical manifestations; asymptomatic infections are common, and illness is generally self-limiting (1). In the 6 documented human SPONV infections, fever occurred in all. Other symptoms included headache, nausea, myalgia, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia; only 1 SPONV-infected person had maculopapular and pruritic rash (1). The similar clinical presentations for these virus infections and reportedly high serologic cross-reactivity have resulted in frequent misdiagnosis (1).

[Results]
---------
We detected SPONV from a pool of 7 mixed-sex _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes collected in July 2016 during ongoing arbovirus surveillance in Gressier, Haiti. During May-August 2016, [when] we caught 1756 mosquitoes.

The SPONV genome from Haiti shared 10 174 (98.8 percent) of 10 290 nt identity with a SPONV isolate from mosquitoes in South Africa in 1954 (GenBank accession no. DQ859064) and 9, 58 (96.8 percent) of 10 287 nt identity with the SPONV Chuku strain from blood of a febrile human patient in Nigeria in 1952 (accession no. KX227369) (Table 1). When compared with the Zika virus reference strain from Uganda (accession no. KY989511), a strain from Puerto Rico (accession no. KU501215), and a strain from Haiti in 2016 (accession no. MF384325), Zika virus and SPONV clearly continue to diverge because the nucleotide and amino acid identities of SPONV are less similar to more recent strains of Zika virus (Tables 1,2). Few SPONV sequences have been deposited into GenBank, resulting in insufficient information to predict how and when SPONV was introduced in Haiti.

[Discussion]
------------
In the Americas and the Caribbean, SPONV is a potential emergent arbovirus and public health threat that manifests clinically with symptoms and signs similar to that of Zika virus infection (2,9). Misdiagnosis has been documented, and it is possible that SPONV has caused human infection in Haiti but has been misidentified as infection from DENV or other arboviruses (9). Little is known about SPONV pathogenesis, host range, and vector competency, especially with vectors present in the Western Hemisphere. Our detection of SPONV in _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes raises questions about the role of this species as a vector for this virus and highlights the need for ongoing surveillance for SPONV infection among humans in the Caribbean, combined with studies of potential vector populations.

[The Spondweni serogroup, in the genus _Flavivirus_ (Flaviviridae), includes 2 species: Spondweni virus (SPONV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). The finding of SPONV in Haiti, in the western hemisphere, is surprising, given that previously it was known only from Africa. Because of the possibility of misdiagnosing SPONV infections as dengue, chikungunya, or especially Zika virus infections in the Americas, SPONV should be included in routine diagnostic tests for patients with febrile illnesses. How SPONV was introduced into Haiti is unknown, as is the extent of its distribution in the Americas.
