Poultry at a Staffordshire chicken farm are set to be culled after bird flu was confirmed at the site.

A 10-km control zone has been set up around the farm north of Uttoxeter after the case was confirmed on Saturday [27 Mar 2021].

Specific rules around the housing and movement of birds and eggs apply in this area, and records must be kept of anyone entering sites where poultry is kept.

Extra rules apply to areas within 3 km of the affected farm.

A government spokesman said all the poultry at the affected farm would be "humanely culled" after bird flu was confirmed in broiler chickens.

Anyone who owns chickens or turkeys, either commercially or as pets, has been required by law to keep birds indoors since December last year [2020] due to the risk of bird flu. However, that rule is due to end on Wednesday [31 Mar 2021] after the risk was reduced to "medium" earlier this month [March].

Cases have been confirmed all over the UK, but this is the 1st case in Staffordshire or the West Midlands. Staffordshire County Council has urged anyone with poultry in the county to be alert to signs of bird flu and reminded owners to keep birds housed.

[Europe, including UK and Ireland, has been suffering since October 2020 from a widely spread outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, detected in various and numerous wild birds while affecting commercial poultry farms. Subscribers may wish to visit the 2 EC (ADNS)-updated maps "HPAI detections during the period 12-19 Mar 2021" and "HPAI detections during the period 1 Oct 2020-19 Mar 2021," both available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono_2021_map.pdf. The more recent map reflects the diminished incidence on the British Isles compared to continental Europe. The above-described outbreak in Staffordshire is exceptional and might become one of the last events during the season.

According to a later report from the same media source, the above outbreak has affected a broiler flock; HPAI H5N8 has been confirmed. Most of the outbreaks in Europe during the recent season were caused by HPAI H5N8, while 3 other serotypes -- H5N1, H5N5 and H5N3 -- have been identified as well, particularly in wild birds.

As stated in a recent DEFRA/APHA (Animal & Plant Health Agency) assessment, the detection of 4 HPAI H5 subtypes in the same epidemic event is unparalleled in the UK. All these viruses are genetically closely related through their H5 haemagglutinin gene, which is the key viral gene influencing pathogenesis, host range, transmission, and host immunity. Continued alteration to circulating viruses following co-infection and genetic reassortment in wild birds is not unexpected. Although to date, the viruses characterised have been of high sequence identity across isolates of the same subtype, further genetic variation at genome level may occur. See Updated Outbreak Assessment 19, addressing HPAI in the UK and Europe, dated 15 Mar 2021, which includes also a map presenting the distribution of the said 4 serotypes, at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/971416/HPAI_Europe_15_March.pdf. - Mod.AS
