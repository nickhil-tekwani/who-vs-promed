TRYPANOSOMIASIS - AFRICA (2)
============================
Dan Fountain's description of the trypanosomiasis disaster emerging in Africa
certainly was poignant and might open the eyes of people who might be able
to help. However, his use of the word "hostage" leaves something to be
desired ("Hostage": A person given up to another or held by an enemy as a
pledge that certain promises or agreements will be carried out) and may be
counterproductive in bringing about assistance. I believe the word is
"victim", not "hostage". Unless Dr. Fountain has direct evidence that
European countries really are holding Africans "hostage", perhaps in order to
squeeze from them their wealth, he might be better advised to tone down the
rhetoric.
Nonetheless, the situation is horrid and should be addressed quickly.
