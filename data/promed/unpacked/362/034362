[The reality underlying the following report is presently obscure and some
caution is needed when reading the following edited reports. It appears to
be a complex situation with many dimensions. Thus far there are no reports
of major anthrax, typhoid or malaria epidemics in the Thai provinces
bordering Maung Yawn. Comments have been requested of contacts living in
Thailand. Others with direct information are requested to share it with
ProMEDmail. Anthrax is endemic in Myanmar and thus human cases may be
expected, whether or not the reported diagnoses here are correct. -Mod.MHJ]
Chiang Rai, Subin Khuenkaew, and Nusara Thaitawat, Bangkok -- An epidemic
of malaria, acute diarrhea, high fever, and what is believed to be typhoid
and anthrax, due to poor sanitation and the lack of medical knowledge and
supplies. Malaria, anthrax and typhoid is [are apparently] ravaging
Myanmar's notorious drug-producing region, killing thousands and infecting
even more, including a reputed international narcotics kingpin, Thai
military sources said.
Since mid-Jul 2000, disease has killed at least several thousand residents
of Maung Yawn, a northeastern Myanmar province of over 100 000 and a
headquarters for the ethnic minority militia United Wa State Army (UWSA),
one of the world's leading drug producers. It was reported earlier that
more than 2 000 Wa soldiers and their dependents living in newly developed
towns along the Thai-Burmese border between Mae Ai and Mae Sai have died
from contagious diseases since Jul 2000. A military source now claims that
as many as 10 000 residents of Maung Yawn have died since Jul 2000, a
figure that would make the epidemic one of the worst of its kind to hit
Southeast Asia in recent years.
"Many people are dying every day, and hundreds are getting sick. It is an
uncontrollable situation," said one Thai military source posted along the
Myanmar border near Chiang Rai, a northern Thai city 800 kilometres (640
miles) from Bangkok.
Thai health officials are still unable to determine what diseases are
affecting the ethnic group for lack of blood samples. Health officials
along the border have been put on alert. Thai villagers have been
instructed to report immediately any signs of illness. So far Thai
authorities have declined to help the UWSA. Thai army sources said that
Chinese doctors will be arriving soon to help deal with Maung Yawn's
medical crisis. [The Bangkok Post reported: "Rangoon has sent a medical
team and China has sent a doctor to help contain the diseases."]
Thai Army sources say the epidemic has yet to have much impact on the Wa's
drug business as most of the people who have died are civilians, since
whatever medication exists in Maung Yawn is given to UWSA soldiers first.
But even the medication that the soldiers are receiving is outdated, as
clinics in Maung Yawn are basic and lack most essential drugs, Thais who
used to work in Maung Yawn have said.
Some sick residents of Maung Yawn have been straggling across the border
into Thailand in an attempt to obtain care, the [military] source said.
[However, other] army sources privately told AFP that the border across
from Maung Yawn has now been tightly sealed. A truck full of sick Maung
Yawn residents was recently turned back at the Thai border, they said.
Although the epidemic, along with a brewing battle between the Wa and other
drug trafficking groups in Myanmar, threatens to send thousand of refugees
into Thailand, the Thai army said it would not let in migrants or provide
much assistance to those suffering in Maung Yawn.
Thais who used to work in Maung Yawn building new structures for the Wa now
are prevented by the army from going into Myanmar, although the army said
there are still some Western missionaries living in Maung Yawn.
The 2 top leaders of the United Wa State Army's Southern Military Command,
including Wei Hsueh-kang -- one of the top leaders of the UWSA and perhaps
the most powerful drug warlord in Southeast Asia -- have been taken ill
with anthrax, border sources said. The other commander and a rival of Wei
Hsueh-kang is Wei Xai-tang (unrelated), who is based in Mong Yawn. An
undisclosed number of high-ranking UWSA officers at both commands were also
seriously ill, it was confirmed.
Although the Bangkok Post Wednesday reported that some Wa leaders were
slipping into Thailand for medical care, army sources told AFP that Wei
Hseuh-kang was receiving treatment in a safe house in the Myanmar town of
Tachilek, near the Thai border opposite Mae Sai.
The UWSA signed a peace treaty with the Yangon junta [Rangoon] in 1989
after years of fighting the central government and then used the peace to
consolidate its control over the area and move into amphetamine, opium and
heroin production and smuggling. Since the ceasefire the Yangon authorities
have been effectively absent from the region. Foreign critics charge that
Myanmar agreed to turn a blind eye to the Wa's drug trafficking business.
Myanmar is the world's second-largest producer of opium as well as a major
source of amphetamines. The UWSA has also linked up with other major ethnic
groups, such as the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army and the Shan State Army.
Their supply routes into Thailand are well developed from Mae Hong Son down
to Tak.
Rangoon has claimed that the massive relocation of the UWSA is part of its
narcotics eradication programme focusing on removing people from
drug-producing areas to a more fertile land for agriculture. The UWSA has
been relocated to the Thai border from central and northern Shan state
under a deal with the Burmese military government since early this year. It
is estimated that some 180 000 people have been relocated so far.
