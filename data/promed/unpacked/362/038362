[Ex media sources, Aug 1 -- I have deleted all the 'Outraged' citizens,
posturing politicians, and circling lawyers as they are irrelevant to much
of what is going on. You will have got a flavor of all that from the
previous postings. - Mod.MHJ
Many of Sydney's 3.7 million residents must continue boiling their drinking
water for another week before dangerous parasites are flushed out of the
water system, health officials said Saturday.
Fleets of trucks "rushed" through the streets delivering bottled water to
businesses, schools, hospitals and homes. Bottled water vanished from store
shelves as customers bought a half-dozen or more containers each. Bottled
water has become a hot commodity, but despite the high demand, there have
been no reports of price gouging by stores.
Some neighborhoods may be able to resume using tap water as soon as Sunday
after water samples from the plant that spread the parasites tests clean,
state Urban Affairs Minister Craig Knowles said. However, it will take
eight days for the clean water to flush out the entire city system, Chief
Health Department officer Andrew Wilson said. Fire hydrants and water mains
have been opened throughout the city to speed the process of purging the
water system.
No illnesses have been reported. But the parasites have an incubation
period of about a week, so it may take several more days for any serious
health problems to develop.
The cause of the contamination remains unclear. Officials have not found
evidence that the carcasses of dogs and foxes found in or near an open
canal leading to a filtration plant were the source. Sydney Water Managing
Director Chris Pollett has said the contamination may have come from
contaminated run-off.[From?
