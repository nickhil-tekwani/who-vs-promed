Italy: Community Outbreak of Hepatitis A in Campania, Jan-May 2004
---------------------------------------------------
Campania, a region in southern Italy (5 700 000 inhabitants, regional
capital Naples), is one of the 20 political regions in Italy.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is an endemic disease here, with an
annual incidence rate often twice as high as the total rate for the
rest of Italy.
Typically the seasonal pattern shows an increase during summer and in
the 1st quarter of the year, after Christmas. During the last decade,
the largest epidemic of HAV occurred in 1996 and 1997 in Puglia,
southeast Italy [1]. Around the end of March 2004, the main hospitals
treating communicable diseases in Campania reported an increasing
number of admissions of patients with HAV infection. This was
confirmed by the number of statutory notifications received by the
Osservatorio Epidemiologico Regionale (OER), the regional
epidemiological unit. A review of the number of notifications
received in the same 3-month period in previous years for this region
showed that the number of cases observed in 2004 vastly exceeded the
expected cases for the same period. Due to the high number of cases
involved, the OER requested assistance from the communicable disease
epidemiology unit at the National Centre for Epidemiology,
Surveillance and Health Promotion at the National Public Health
Institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanita) in Rome. The aims were then
to reinforce local surveillance of the occurrence of cases, to
investigate the outbreak in order to identify the most probable route
of transmission, and to implement appropriate control measures.
Methodology: According to the criteria for statutory notification of
HAV in Campania, a case of HAV is defined as any person resident in
Campania with a clinical presentation of acute hepatitis (one of the
following: jaundice, fever, nausea, dark brown urine) and a positive
serological result for IgM-HAV. Using this description, cases with an
onset from 1 Jan 2004 onwards are being examined. An additional
enhanced surveillance system with rapid reporting through an ad hoc
on-line system (EPOS) has been implemented.
Cases with pending serological results have also been recorded.
Hospitals have been asked to collect serum samples from patients
admitted with a diagnosis of HAV diseases for further virus
characterisation. A descriptive analysis of reported cases was
undertaken so that hypotheses about the source of the infection, and
possible modes and vehicles of transmission could be formulated.
Following this, an environmental investigation was launched to
collect and test samples of seafood products from local outlets and
the main seafood providers in the region, as these are known to be
the most common vehicles for endemic cases.
Preliminary results: Descriptive results presented here are
preliminary and refer to any reported case (either confirmed or
suspected) from 1 Jan until 21 May 2004. Up to 21 May 2004, 615
confirmed and suspected cases of HAV infection had been notified.
Among them, 58 percent are males. The median age is 20 years (range:
1-76 years) and 9 percent were less than 5 years of age (Table).
Table: Age distribution of cases of HAV, Campania, Italy, 2004
Age group / Number of cases / Percentage
0 to 5 / 54 / 8.7
6 to 10 / 70 / 11.4
11 to 20 / 183 / 30
21 to 30 / 209 / 34
31 to 40 / 74 / 12
41+ / 19 / 3.1
Missing / 6 / 0.9
Total / 615 / 100
The date of onset of symptoms was available for 592 cases (96
percent). The 1st cases in the current epidemic were reported in one
particular district, district A. The epidemic curve (not shown here),
drawn by week of onset, shows 2 peaks around weeks 4-5 and 10-11 of
2004. Over 60 percent of the cases were clustered in 2 out of 16
districts in Campania (112 and 265 cases).
Most of the cases were reported in district A: about 60 percent of
them were males. The median age was 16 years (range: 1-52). When
cases in this district were compared to those in other districts, no
significant difference was found in sex distribution (57.4 percent of
males to 58.3 percent, p = 0.7). However, the median age of cases
from district A was significantly lower than the median age of cases
from other districts (16 to 23, p<0.001). Case distribution by date
of onset in district A showed a similar pattern compared to cases in
the other districts. Preliminary interviews with patients suggested
that shellfish was a popular food item. Further results of the case
control study, microbiological and environmental investigations are
pending.
Discussion: Most of the cases occurred in one densely populated
district on the coast, south of Naples. Patients from this area were
younger than patients from the rest of the region, suggesting a
different pattern in susceptibility to HAV of the local population or
a different mode of transmission. The epidemic curve profile is
compatible with 2 waves of transmission. After an initial point
source of infection around New Year's Eve, the epidemic is thought to
have amplified locally and was sustained through person-to-person
transmission. As the average incubation period for HAV is 28-30 days,
and the period of exposure for most cases can be traced back to early
January and mid February 2004.
Seafood is suspected to have been the initial exposure source in both
waves of HAV cases in the area but also contributed to the
continuation of the outbreak. Seafood is believed to have been
locally contaminated through incorrect handling or storage. These
hypotheses are being tested on the field in a case-control study
currently in progress.

[Most of the hepatitis A outbreaks reported recently in ProMED-mail
have been associated with contamination of drinking water and
disruption of water supplies. This outbreak in Campania highlights
one of the other major sources of hepatitis A virus infection:
consumption of contaminated shellfish and other filter-feeding
organisms harvested from sewage-contaminated waters. - Mod.CP]
