Ophthalmic surgical instruments a risk for transmission of vCJD
---------------------------------------------------------------
There is a risk that variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as vCJD or CJD (new var.) could be transferred by
surgical instruments used in eye operations, scientists have found.
The risk could be greater than that posed by instruments used to
remove the tonsils, which the [UK Department of Health has
recommended should only be used once and then thrown away. The
Department of Health has said it will refer the findings to its
advisory group, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.
A team from the Prion Unit at Imperial College School of Medicine in
London has developed a highly sensitive way to detect the particles
thought to cause the fatal brain disease. These are known as
disease-related prion proteins (PrPSc). The scientists used the test
to carry out analysis of tissue samples from 4 patients who had died
of vCJD. They found PrPSc was present in tonsil, spleen and lymph-node
tissue at concentrations up to 15% of those found in the brain.
However, the scientists also found that PrPSc was present in tissue
from the retina and the optic nerve. The concentration in the tissue
from the retina was 2% of that found in the brain, but in the optic
nerve tissue it was 25%. It is not known how high the PrPSc
concentration has to be before there is a risk of transferring the
infection.
Professor John Collinge (the leader of the group) stated that:
"Ophthalmic surgical instruments used in procedures involving the
optic nerve and the posterior segment of the eye, in particular the
retina, might represent a potential risk for iatrogenic transmission
of vCJD." The researchers also concluded that their work vindicates
the Department of Health recommendation to surgeons that they use only
disposable instrument kits for tonsillectomy operations. However,
Professor Collinge said that while thousands of tonsillectomies were
carried out every year, operations on the back of the eye were rare.
And he said his team had found no evidence of rogue prions in the
tissue at the front of the eye, a much more common site for surgery.
Professor Collinge added that: "We don't know how many people are
incubating vCJD, or what the actual risk is of passing it on via
surgical instruments. Obviously it is not practical, or desirable to
use disposable instruments for every operation. The Department of
Health will need to balance all the potential risks and decide what
the appropriate response to all this is."
Very low levels of PrPSc were found in the rectum, adrenal gland, and
thymus from one of the patients. This raises the possibility that
instruments used to carry out rectal biopsy, a relatively common
procedure, may also pose a risk of vCJD transmission.
Dr David Bolton, from the New York State Institute for Basic Research
in Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, told BBC News
Online that: "This work illustrates how careful one must be in
assessing which tissues harbor infectious prions and which do not.
Each diagnostic test has a lower limit of detection, and we may not
always have a full understanding of where that limit is. When samples
produce results below the limit of detection, it does not necessarily
mean that there are no prions present. It simply means that there are
fewer there that can be detected by the current test."
