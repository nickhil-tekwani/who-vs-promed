A new type of foot and mouth disease was found in the village of Molodezhny
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinical signs characteristic of foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been found in 270 head of cattle and 8 pigs in the village of Molodezhny in Priangursky district.

More than 190 head of cattle and 8 pigs have fallen ill with FMD in the village of Molodezhny. Deaths among animals were not registered [none died]. It was reported, that Vladimir Mishchenko, chief researcher of the Laboratory and Prevention of Diseases of Pigs and Cattle of the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Animal Diseases, doctor of veterinary Sciences, arrived specially in our region for the epizootic survey.

According to him, the disease in the village is localized. "It is necessary to say, that all animals have disease in the mild form, because they had already been vaccinated and have immunity. However, the problem was that for the 1st time the causative agent of foot and mouth disease, which has not previously been registered in our country, has been identified as Type A -- the genetic line typical in South-East Asia has been revealed during laboratory studies. Prior to this, such a virus was found only in Korea, Thailand and Viet Nam," said Vladimir Mishchenko.

At the present time the specialists are investigating how this type of foot and mouth disease virus was brought to the territory of Russia, and more precisely in the Trans-Baikal region. "Multiple versions were investigated, but for this day there is no specific information about where this disease came from. Humans and animals may be carriers. There are lot of ways of transfer, so to establish them is difficult, but the fact is that the disease was recorded in the region absolutely," said the head of the office of Rosselkhoznadzor for the Zabaykalsky region and the Amur region, Nikolai Gantimuranov.

At the moment, according to the experts, the main work is to prevent the penetration of disease into the environment, and to provide clinical inspection in other areas in order to exclude the occurrence there of foot and mouth disease. It is planned to organize a double vaccination of animals. Disinfection is being provided at checkpoints, and explanatory work goes on among the population.

[Priangursky district is an anti-FMD buffer zone of the Russian Federation. The settlement is situated 25 km (15.5 miles) from the border with China. The indirect double sandwich version of the ELISA test and RT-PCR found that this new foot and mouth disease virus is type A.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate A/Zabaikalsky/RF/2013 belongs to the genetic line "South-East Asia" topotype "Asia" foot and mouth disease virus type A. The data obtained prove that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease type A in Trans-Baikal region is caused by the drift of an infection from China. In 2013, China reported 2 outbreaks of foot and mouth disease type A on its territory: to the South-East (Guangdong province) and in the center of the country (province of Qinghai). It cannot be excluded, however, that, in fact, foot and mouth disease type A is more widespread in China, as reported officially. Currently, studies are under way to examine antigenic conformity of a new strain of foot and mouth disease virus and available vaccine strains in Russia, see http://emeat.ru/new.php?id=63507. - Mod.NP]

[This would be a logical spread from the Chinese outbreak, see the ProMED report of 19 Mar 2013, archive number 20130319.0540. - Mod.MHJ
