1 Disease Report
South Africa has reported outbreaks of African horse sickness (AHS)
in free roaming horses in Mamre area of Western Cape Province within
the AHS control zone surveillance area and 53 km from the quarantine
facility in Kenilworth. The serotype has been identified as serotype
1. Disease control measures are in place, and vaccination will be
used.

2 Situation Assessment
Sub Saharan Africa, including South Africa is considered endemic for
AHS in the wild equidae population. Nine strains have been identified
across sub Saharan Africa, and occasional incursions have occurred
beyond the traditional epizootic range into the Middle East and
Europe, involving strains 4, 6 and 9.

There are strict controls on exports of horses and their products
from this region to the EU. Under Commission Decisions 2004/211/EC and
1993/197/EEC, South Africa is only approved for the import of
registered horses, temporary import of registered horses, horses for
breeding and production, and semen from registered horses from a small
region in Cape Town into the EU, and that approval is dependent on
surveillance of horses in the neighbouring region and continual
disease freedom in this region.

Most horses in the area are vaccinated against AHS. Registered horses
and horses for breeding and production to be exported are required to
be pre-export tested and kept in an approved vector free quarantine
station prior to movement for a period of 40 days. Horses should also
be accompanied by a certificate stating the animal's vaccination
status and mandatory testing.

EU rules require that all imported equidae from 3rd countries are
checked (i.e. a documentary, identity and physical or DIP check) at
the port of entry to the EU. Post import testing of equidae may be
carried out if deemed a risk by the veterinary inspector at the border
inspection post. BIPs in the UK have been notified and will increase
checks on horses from Cape Town.

The South African authorities have put certain control measures in
place (Department of Agriculture, 2011):
- Advising horse owners to keep vaccination up to date, to stable
horses around sunset and sunrise when vector activity is highest, and
to use insect repellent;
- Movement controls of all equidae into and out of the restricted
zone in Western Cape province.
- Ring vaccination in immediate vicinity of the cases.
- A ban on horse export from the Cape Town area will be put in place
(European Commission, 2011).

Tracings on South African origin horses entering the UK have not been
carried out as the disease has a short incubation period, limited
viraemia, and in almost all naive horses would cause clinical signs,
if not death. Therefore, it would be expected that disease would have
been reported by now. However, TRACES, the EU electronic trade
notification system, has been checked, and there have been no equidae
imported since the outbreaks began.

3 Conclusions
We consider there would be a negligible risk of introduction of AHS
to the UK via legal imports and temporary re-admission of registered
horses or the import of semen from registered horses as a result of
this outbreak because of the strict import rules governing trade in
horses from the Cape Town area and the ban currently imposed by South
Africa.

The risk from illegal or non-compliant imports is difficult to
quantify, but as the disease has a short incubation period, causes
severe clinical signs, and frequently results in death of the infected
horse, this is an unlikely scenario. Illegally imported zebras, mules,
African, Asian or European donkeys are all less susceptible to disease
and are, therefore, a greater risk; however, again, the possibility of
illegal import is difficult to quantify, but thought unlikely. We will
continue to monitor the situation.
