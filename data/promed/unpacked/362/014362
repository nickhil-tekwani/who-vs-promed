A study of human H5N1 influenza cases in Egypt, including a genetic
analysis of some of the isolates, shows that most cases have occurred
in children and females but does not explain why the fatality rate
there is significantly lower than in other countries. Writing in the
open-access journal PLoS One, a team of US and Egyptian scientists
says Egypt became the epicenter of human H5N1 cases in 2009 and 2010,
with 68 of the 121 cases reported worldwide. But the country's H5N1
case-fatality rate (CFR) is 34 percent, versus 60 percent for other
countries with human cases.

Because the H5N1 viruses in Egypt seem to be less virulent than those
elsewhere, there is concern that they are becoming more adapted to
humans, say the authors, who are from St. Jude Children's Hospital in
Memphis and the Egypt's National Research Center in Cairo. Their
report was published yesterday [21 Mar 2011]. Egypt had 119 human H5N1
cases from 2006 through 2010, with 40 deaths (CFR, 34 percent), the
report says. In 2006 the cases peaked in the spring, and in the
ensuing 4 years, they peaked in the winter and spring. There were 3
family clusters [?] totaling 7 cases during that time.

62 percent of the patients were under age 18, and 60 percent were
female. The mean age for all patients was 10.0 years, with a range of
1-75 years. The young age distribution could reflect Egypt's
demographics or children's level of contact with poultry, the authors
say. They also note that women typically play the lead role in tending
backyard poultry, perhaps explaining the burden of cases in females,
but this needs corroboration.

The fatality rate increased with age and was 3 times as high in
females as in males, the investigators found. The CFR ranged from 4
percent for children under 5 to 10 percent for 5- to 9-year-olds and
53 percent for 10- to 18-year olds. Adults up to age 49 had a 61
percent CFR, and the rate was 75 percent for older adults. The rate
for females was 47 percent, versus 15 percent for males, a significant
difference. The CFR also varied considerably by year and was
particularly low in 2009, at 10 percent, before bouncing up to 45
percent in 2010, the authors note.

Most of the cases in 2009 were in children under age 5, but a
regression analysis showed that mortality was significantly lower in
2009 than in other years, even when the different age distribution was
taken into account. The time from illness onset to hospitalization was
found to be a key factor in risk of death. The CFR for patients who
were hospitalized within the 1st 2 days was 8 percent, versus 54
percent for those who were hospitalized later, a significant
difference. The authors caution that the overall 34 percent CFR may be
an overestimate, because the rate of unrecognized cases is unknown.

The team found that the pattern of H5N1 cases in humans tends to
mirror the pattern in poultry, both in frequency and severity. "Milder
disease among poultry leads to mild human infection," the report says.
"For instance, a decrease in human case-fatality rate in 2009 was
accompanied by an observed decrease in mortality among poultry."

On the genetic front, the scientists say several sublineages of H5N1
clade 2.2.1 have been reported in Egypt, of which at least 3 are still
circulating. They identified what they believe is a new sublineage,
which they call Egypt-G, represented by 4 isolates. But they found no
specific lineages that seemed to circulate in humans but not in birds
or vice versa, and thus no "host-adaptation mutation." Similarly, they
couldn't find particular changes in the virus that seemed linked to
changes in the fatality rate: "We were not able to confirm that lower
pathogenicity of the viruses is the main reason for increase or
decrease in the mortality rate among humans in Egypt." The virus
appeared "in its most virulent form in 2006," and any significant
mutation may be expected to lead to lower virulence, they add. But
they caution that other host and environmental factors that may affect
disease severity must be properly studied before concluding that any
decrease in mortality is due to mutations.

The study was limited to lab-confirmed cases reported to the World
Health Organization, and a lack of data for many variables forbade an
in-depth epidemiologic investigation, the authors say. They say
experts are concerned about "the potential of H5N1 viruses circulating
in Egypt to become more adapted to human-to-human transmission,"
because the viruses are less virulent and may be causing asymptomatic
infections, especially in adults. Consequently, there is an urgent
need for more epidemiologic studies in Egypt, they conclude.

H5N1 viruses at the human-animal interface in Egypt." By Kayali G,

The Abstract reads as follows: "With 119 confirmed cases between
March 2006 and December 2010, Egypt ranks 2nd among countries
reporting human H5N1 influenza virus infections. In 2009-2010, Egypt
reported 68 new human cases and became the new epicenter for H5N1
infections. We conducted an epidemiological and molecular analysis in
order to better understand the situation in Egypt. The onset of new
cases peaked annually during the winter and spring months, with
majority of cases reported in the Nile Delta region. Most cases were
less than 18 years old (62 percent) and females (60 percent). The
overall case-fatality rate was 34 percent and significantly increased
by age. There was a significant difference between the case-fatality
rates among females and males. We observed a significant drop (p =
0.004) in case fatality rate in 2009 (10 percent) as compared to
higher rates (36-56 percent) in other years. Hospitalization within 2
or 3 days after onset of symptoms significantly decreased mortality.
Molecular analysis showed that variations do occur among viruses
isolated from birds as well as from humans in Egypt, and these
mutations were especially noted in 2009 viruses. As the
epidemiological profile of Egyptian cases differs from other
countries, there is an urgent need to conduct prospective studies to
enhance our understanding of incidence, prevalence, and determinants
of virulence of human infections with avian H5N1 influenza viruses."

This analysis of human cases of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection in
Egypt (as summarised in the CIDRAP account) leaves some questions
unanswered, but it is reassuring to have the authors' opinion that
their phylogenetic analyses revealed no evidence so far for
host-adaptation mutation, which suggests that the main transmission
route of H5N1 in Egypt is still contact with infected birds, just as
observed in the rest of the world.

A peculiar feature of the epidemiology of avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus infection in the human population is the almost complete absence
of overt infection among the large number of people involved both in
the rearing of poultry and their culling and disposal after infection.
