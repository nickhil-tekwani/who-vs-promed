The Iwaki City Public Health Center announced on [29 Mar 2022] that a food poisoning, which seems to be caused by having eaten toxic _Veratrum oxyseum_, has occurred. A 77-year-old woman in the city ate wild grass on [28 Mar 2022] and complained of vomiting and other symptoms. The woman is admitted to a medical institution in the city, and she is on a recovery trend.

According to the health center, on [27 Mar 2022], the woman thought it was an edible Urui in the wild mountains in the city and collected wild grass. She ate it with vinegar [like a salad - Mod.TG] on [28 Mar 2022], complained of vomiting and diarrhea, and was taken to the emergency room about an hour and a half later. _Veratrum oxyseum_ and Urui look very similar during the budding period. According to the city, the veins of _Veratrum oxyseum_ are branched [they branch from a central point, like a palmately veined plant - Mod.TG], while the veins of Urui [sometimes called hosuta in some areas and hostas in other areas - Mod.TG] are parallel. Especially when the buds start to sprout, it is difficult to identify them, so caution is required.

["Iwaki is a city located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. As of 1 Apr 2020, Iwaki had a population of 337 765 in 143 500 households, and population density of 270 persons per square km."

Most of the _Veratrum_ spp. contain the same toxic agent, producing almost the same clinical signs. And it appears there may be some difficulty in distinguishing between them early in the growing season. So it is possible this person's health issues related to the wrong plant.

"Veratrum plants have been remedies of popular medicine for hundreds [of] years. In [the] Middle Age[s], they were used against sorcery, and subsequently they have been used as emetics and as drugs for neuralgia. After the classical descriptions of veratrum effects on heart physiology, the use of veratrum extracts and, thereafter, of purified alkaloids was proposed for treating arterial hypertension. It was shown that these compounds do, indeed, induce in humans a marked decrease in cardiac output coupled with a moderate fall in arterial resistance (Hoobler et al, 1955). Protoveratrine was the preferred alkaloid for antihypertensive treatment (Currens et al, 1953) (Doyle and Smirk, 1953) (Gray and Hamer, 1957) (Hoobler et al, 1952) (Meilman and Krayer, 1950 and 1952). These therapeutic uses have been dampened by the occurrence of intolerable side effects, namely nausea and vomiting and profound hypotension. The clinical application of veratrum alkaloids has been explored also for the treatment of myasthenia gravis (Hofmann, 1958) (Editorial Can Med Assoc J, 1967). Nowadays, veratradine and other veratrum alkaloids do not have any clinical use."

"Veratrum species
Most plants of the_Veratrum_ genus belong to the family of Melanthiaceae; _Veratrum chiengdaoense_ belongs to the Liliaceae.

"The rhizome and root of _Veratrum album_ (white hellebore) and the rhizome of _Veratrum viride_ (green hellebore) contain many alkaloids, including hypotensive ester alkaloids and jervine. _Veratrum californicum_ contains the alkaloids cyclopamine, cycloposine, and jervine. Veratrum alkaloids increase the permeability of neuronal sodium channels, causing them to fire continuously; increased stimulation of the vagal nerve results in the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, causing hypotension, bradycardia, and apnea. Purified formulations of veratrum alkaloids were at one time used as antihypertensive agents, but are now obsolete.

"Among the major toxic signs of the veratrum alkaloids are vomiting, hypotension, and bradycardia.

"_Veratrum californicum_ has teratogenic activity in livestock." - Mod.TG
