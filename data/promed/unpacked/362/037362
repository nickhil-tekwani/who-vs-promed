The Halifax County Animal Shelter in Virginia has revised its adoption rules since sending a family home with a rabid dog, reports WBDJ7 News.

Last month [November 2014] the animal shelter was overcrowded with dogs and cats, so a local animal-rescue group asked to foster a stray dog with 6 puppies. The animals had just been impounded at the shelter 2 hours before.

Todd Moser, Animal Warden for Halifax County, told WBDJ7 that there were no visible signs of illness, and both the mom and her pups seemed fine. However, 2 days later the mother dog was tested and diagnosed with rabies. [Animals can only be tested after they are deceased. - Mod.TG]

She and her pups were euthanized as a prophylactic step to assure they would not come in contact with any other animals or humans and possibly spread the rabies virus. [There is something wrong here. The only test for an animal is to examine the brain. That means the mother dog would have been dead when she was tested. The puppies may subsequently been euthanized. But she could NOT have been tested and then euthanized. Sadly, even very young animals have been shown to be capable of developing the disease. - Mod.TG]

Seven people were treated for post-exposure to rabies, including the foster family and shelter staff.

According to the WBDJ7 report, it takes about 10 days for an animal to start showing signs of rabies, and because of the only 2-hour window that the dogs were impounded, staff had no clues that the dog and pups might be ill. They decided to release the animals into a safer and more hygienic environment.

Staff sanitized the area and recently changed protocol, the shelter reports. Now when an animal is impounded, it's monitored for signs of any disease, and the animal welfare groups are not given immediate access to the animals. "We are very reluctant on letting anybody or any rescue [group] to foster the animals prior to their time to be released," Moser told WDBJ7.

According to Moser, dogs could show signs of rabies even after the monitoring period, which is why environmental health professionals recommend taking the pet to get rabies shots and checked out by the veterinarian before its paws step into your home.

Drs. Scott Weese and Maureen Anderson, of the Ontario Veterinary College's Centre for Public Health and Zoonoses, coordinate a website called Worms & Germs, "which focuses on infectious diseases of companion animals (household pets and horses), with an emphasis on zoonotic diseases -- diseases that can be transmitted from animals to people."

In regard to the sad occurrence (above) at Halifax, Dr. Weese posted on 10 Dec 2014, "Yes, that's an 'oops', but it's also not completely preventable."

He continues: "It is a common and logical thing to try to get the puppies into a lower-risk environment prior to adoption. However, any unknown animal carries some risk, and that was a problem here."

Dr. Weese explains that the comment by the shelter that "it takes about 10 days for an animal to start showing signs of rabies" is incorrect. "It can take much longer," he writes.

"The 10-day window is what we used after an animal has bitten someone, because an animal that is shedding the virus will become ill with rabies within a 10-day window. However, the incubation time ... the time from when an animal is exposed to the time it develops disease, can be months."

Dr. Weese states that the customary 10-day quarantine period for new arrivals at a shelter is good for some things, "but doesn't mean that the dog won't develop signs of rabies later."

In regard to the statement by the shelter official that "staff sanitized the area," Dr. Weese responds that this procedure is "not really needed." He explains, "Rabies isn't spread through contact with the general environment, [but sanitizing is] good for the shelter overall."

Dr. Weese concludes: "It sounds like it would have helped them pick up this dog as being rabid before it was sent out, but it won't prevent all cases like this from occurring. It's a tough balance between monitoring for signs of disease and wanting to get the animal out of the shelter as soon as possible (because of shelter space issues, to reduce the chance of the animal being exposed to something in the shelter...). There's no perfect approach."

[Dr. Weese is very correct. Even keeping the animals for 10 days may not have revealed the neurological signs that may have been suspicious for rabies virus. The disease may or may not develop and present quickly. As Dr. Weese said, it can take months. However, once the animal is shedding the virus it will become ill usually within the 10-day window.

Rabies is a serious concern. It always results in death of the animal. And with extremely rare exceptions, it will almost always cause death in people as well.

Revision of the shelter rules may or may not prevent this situation from occurring again.
