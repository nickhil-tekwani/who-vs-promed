Two cases of strangles -- a type of horse flu -- have been discovered
at stables in East Ayrshire. Quarantine regulations have been
introduced in a bid to prevent the spread of the disease, and the
affected animals are the subject of stringent hygiene checks.

The crisis was discussed at the regular committee meeting of Irvine
Carters' Society on Monday [1 Aug 2011], when it was decided to
contact horse owners warning them of the outbreak.

The society says it will leave it to individual owners to decide
whether or not to take part in Scotland's biggest horse drawn
procession in just 2 weeks.

Captain Danny Kerr said the society hoped to go ahead with the Fourth
Port Parade on Sat 13 Aug 2011. He told the Irvine Herald: "We are
keeping a very close watch on the situation. We are still going ahead
with the Fourth Port Parade and hopefully Marymass itself. We will
take a final decision in the next 10 days, but I can assure everyone
there will be a Marymass parade of some description. The society have
been contacting local horse owners all week. It will be up to them to
decide on whether or not to take part. This could also affect the race
meeting as well. But I'm hopeful we will be through the incubation
period."

It is believed the latest outbreak originated in Dundee. One horse
owner told the Irvine Herald: "I'm really worried. I'll be leaving it
to the last minute before making up my mind whether to take part in
the parade."

Strangles is one of the most contagious equine diseases. Some horses
can outwardly show no symptoms yet still carry the disease and spread
it to other horses. It can also be spread through contact with tack or
simply clapping horses. Carrier horses can be very difficult to
identify. The animals show flu-like symptoms such as a high
temperature, coughing, nasal discharge and swollen and abscessed lymph
nodes of the head.
