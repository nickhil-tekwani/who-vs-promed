There are high chances of diseases among livestock in various parts
of the province during the ongoing monsoon season, as the outbreak of
diseases among sheep has already been reported from Kamalia and Toba Tek Singh.
The officials of the department said some 385 000 animals had been
treated since 15 Jun 2007 that were suffering from various diseases
related to rainy seasons, especially enterotoxemia, foot and mouth
and hemorrhagic septicemia.
Sources said diseases among animals had also been reported from
various areas of the province, especially near the belts of the Ravi
and Chenab Rivers. The areas include Kasur, Gujranawala, Gujrat,
Sheikhupura, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sialkot, Narowal and Shakargarh.
Muhammad Ramazan, a grower and cattle owner from Bhai Pheru, district
Kasur, said that foot and mouth disease was common among animals and
that the livestock staff was mostly absent from the dispensaries. He
said attention must be paid immediately, otherwise the disease would
play havoc with livestock in the area.
Rana Dildar Khan, a villager of Kamalia, said: "Animals suffer from
various diseases, especially the foot and mouth and sheep diseases,
and we appeal to the department to take immediate measures to save them."
According to details provided by the Provincial Livestock department,
it had planned to vaccinate some 12 million animals from June to 15
Sep 2007, and it claimed it had vaccinated 4.8 million animals.
Some 577 flood relief centres have also been set up, and 25 disease
diagnostic labs for animals are also working in various parts of the
province. According to the latest livestock census, there are 29.56
million cattle, 27.33 million buffaloes, 26.49 million sheep and
53.79 million goats in Pakistan. As far as the livestock population
in the Punjab is concerned, it makes up 49 percent of total cattle in
the country, 65 percent of buffaloes, and 24 percent and 37 percent
of sheep and goats, respectively, in the country.

[Haemorhagic septicaemia, caused by _Pasteurella multocida_ in
buffaloes and cattle, and enterotoxaemia, a globally prevalent
clostridial toxaemic disease in sheep, are endemic in Pakistan,
probably seasonally exacerbated during the monsoon period.

Though FMD is rather common in the Indian subcontinent, including
Pakistan, it is of importance to follow up and monitor the identity
of the circulating serotypes in order to apply the right vaccines.
According to the Pakistan page on the web-site of the World reference
laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, serotype O has been the predominant
serotype there for many years, with 50 isolates already received
during 2007. Serotype A was isolated in 2006 and serotype Asia-1 in
2005. See at
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/fmd_genotyping/asia/pak.htm>.
Information on the identity of the FMDV serotype(s) involved in the
current outbreak, and data on the serotypes included in the vaccine,
will be helpful.
