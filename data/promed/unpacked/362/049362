A rare virus nearly ended the life of a Grand County man, who says his wife "nagging" him to go to the doctor is what likely saved his life. MT has been out of the hospital for 2 weeks and still is having a hard time finding enough energy. His recovery from contracting the deadly hantavirus disease continues.

[Sin Nombre] hantavirus is carried by deer mice, which can be found statewide. The Colorado Department of Health and Environment says there have been only 110 cases of hantavirus [infections] in the last 30 years.

MT spent several days inside intensive care at a hospital in Denver fighting for his life. It all started when he noticed some mouse droppings inside a garage on a ranch outside of Kremmling. Hantaviruses get inside a person's lungs through the air if the droppings are disturbed by sweeping or vacuuming.

Hantavirus [infections] are extremely rare, but New Mexico and Colorado lead the nation in reported cases.

"I had flu-like symptoms, and I was just going to ride it out, but my wife was encouraging me to go to the doctor," MT told CBS4's Matt Kroschel on Wednesday [24 Oct 2018].

Doctors say that early treatment contributed to MT surviving the virus [infection].

"If I would've waited another day or 2 instead of trying to ride out the flu-like symptoms, I probably would not be here talking to you."

Common field mice, like the ones found in homes, likely don't carry the virus, but the deer mice do.

The health department's website recommends wearing a protective mask and airing out sheds before disturbing any mouse droppings to lessen the risk of contracting hantavirus [infections].

[This is the 3rd case of a hantavirus infection in Colorado this year (2018). One previous case recovered from the infection, but the 2nd case was fatal. The circumstances under which the above case contracted his infection involved an area where mouse droppings indicated that the rodent reservoir of the virus was present. The above report does not indicate if MT had been sweeping the area or involved in other activities that might have raised dust containing excreta from infected deer mice that contained the virus. The hantavirus involved in this, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious and progress swiftly, so patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at the above URL and at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY
