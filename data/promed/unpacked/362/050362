Ruidoso Downs [New Mexico] has lifted its 14-day equine herpes quarantine of one barn after a horse was euthanized for the virus.

Officials said last week [week of 27 Jun 2016] there have been no positive tests in that barn or any other stable at Ruidoso Downs since and racing has not been affected.

The horse was euthanized [18 Jun 2016].

The New Mexico Livestock Board and New Mexico Racing Commission worked with Ruidoso Downs officials to ensure a horse-specific virus is limited to one racehorse.

Ruidoso Downs' racing integrity liaison Dennis Monroe says the quick response was a key factor to eliminate this individual case from spreading.

An EHV-1 outbreak in January [2016] led officials to shut down racing for several weeks at Sunland Park and quarantine at the track near the New Mexico-Texas border.

[Equine herpesvirus (EHV) infections cause neurologic disease in horses. Neurological signs appear as a result of damage to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord caused by EHV. Interference with the blood supply leads to tissue damage and a subsequent loss in normal function of areas in the brain and spinal cord.

To date, 9 EHVs have been identified worldwide. EHV-1 is the primary cause of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) in domestic horses and can have significant economic impact. - Mod.PMB
