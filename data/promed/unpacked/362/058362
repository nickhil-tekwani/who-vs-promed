Cases of hepatitis A found in northeast China's Liaoning Province have caused public concern over a potential outbreak. A local health authority said on Saturday [7 Mar 2020] that cases of the disease were only sporadic in the region, but it did not reveal the number of cases.

"Rumors about people getting hepatitis A from eating undercooked seafood have been going around the city for 10 days," [ZD], a resident in the coastal city of Dandong, Liaoning Province, told the Global Times on Monday [9 Mar 2020], adding that it has exacerbated public anxiety amid the current COVID-19 outbreak.

Dalian, another coastal city in Liaoning, has also been at the center of disease outbreak rumors. [MW], a resident in Zhuanghe, a county-level city administered by Dalian, told the Global Times on Monday [9 Mar 2020] that she saw a widely shared message in a WeChat group on 27 Feb [2020], saying that 5 out of 12 people tested positive in a liver function test in a local hospital, which implied that hepatitis A was prevalent in Zhuanghe [Liver-function-test abnormalities are not specific for HAV. - Mod.LL].

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) of Zhuanghe released a notification on its WeChat official account on 28 Feb [2020] in response without directly confirming whether the message was true or false. The notification said that cases of hepatitis A found in Zhuanghe were only sporadic, not clustered, and that increasing cases are just in line with the seasonal epidemic trend of hepatitis A. A health center in Dandong also claimed that the disease is controllable even though the number of cases has been slightly increasing.

However, the statements did not calm down the public concern. A photo of a pharmaceutical company's announcement in another city in Liaoning Province, in which the company warned its employees on Friday [6 Mar 2020] to not eat seafood due to the hepatitis A outbreak in Dalian and Dandong, spread over social media. The photo caused doubts among some netizens about the credibility of the local health authorities because the exact number of the hepatitis A cases in the region has not been revealed to the public.

The CDC in Dalian, in an interview with the National Business Daily on Saturday [7 Mar 2020], stressed again that cases of hepatitis A in the city were just sporadic and said that they will sound an alarm if the disease becomes more prevalent. Residents were also advised to fully cook seafood before eating it to prevent possible infection with hepatitis A.

People may get infected by eating uncooked and contaminated seafood, as shellfish are the primary vectors of hepatitis A, and the virus can survive in them for more than 3 months, Zhao Guoqing, chief physician of liver disease at Beijing You'an Hospital, told Jiankang Shibao, a health-focused newspaper under People's Daily, on Sunday [8 Mar 2020].

[It is unusual to see outbreaks of hepatitis A in the developing world, as serosurveys suggest close to 100% seropositivity by age 10 from asymptomatic infection earlier in childhood. The diagnosis of acute HAV infection is made by finding anti-HAV IgM in suspected cases.

Liaoning is a coastal province in northeast China (historically also known as Manchuria) and is the smallest, southernmost, but most populous province in the region. Located on the northern shore of the Yellow Sea, it is the northernmost coastal province in China. - Mod.LL
