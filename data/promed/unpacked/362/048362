On Tuesday, [10 Mar 2020], The Minnesota Department of Health issued a health advisory in relation to a _Listeria_ outbreak along Highway [94]. The advisory was directed specifically to local and tribal health departments, hospitals, clinics, other facilities and any other healthcare providers. The advisory was not issued to the public as the outbreak is not believed to be linked to any products currently on the market.

The advisory notes that Minnesota experiences approximately 8 cases of listeriosis (invasive _Listeria monocytogenes_ disease) per year. Recently, 2 seemingly separate cases of listeriosis, one a previously healthy teenager and the other, a person over the age of 60 years-old, have been confirmed in the state of Minnesota.

After further investigation, the cases of listeriosis were found to have zero allele differences in an entire genome sequence, indicating that they share a common strain of _Listeria_. After extensive questioning, officials discovered that both ill persons had eaten at China Buffet restaurant in Alexandria on [15 Feb 2020], before falling ill.

Upon investigating China Buffet, no fault has been found with their food safety procedures. Officials believe that the _Listeria_ contamination may be the fault of a preceding supplier instead. China Buffet's transactions are being tracked and each possible location investigated in order to pinpoint the source of the outbreak.

Health care providers and facilities were given the advisory in an effort to spread awareness for the detection of any future cases. Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, and confusion. People at a higher risk for listeriosis infection include pregnant women and their infants, elderly, and any other immunocompromised persons.

If the source of the _Listeria_ outbreak of Minnesota is found to be linked to a public supplier of grocery stores or markets, the public will be immediately notified through the Food and Drug [Administration] (FDA).

[Two individuals were found to be infected with _Listeria monocytogenes_, both of which had identical genotypes, suggesting a common source for their infections. Both individuals had eaten at an Asian restaurant in Alexandria, Minnesota on 15 Feb 2020, before falling ill, but we are not told what type of food both individuals ate in common.

Alexandria is a city with a population of 11 070 as of the 2010 census (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Minnesota). Alexandria is near Interstate 94. A map showing the location of Alexandria can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alexandria,+MN+56308.

In the USA, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or produ cts of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_ include ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products such as, smoked salmon, sushi, and cold cut meats, that do not require further cooking before eating. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women (and their newborns), adults aged 65 years or older, and people with weakened immune systems, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source. - Mod.ML
