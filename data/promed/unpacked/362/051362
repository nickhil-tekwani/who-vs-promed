Fatal bird disease suspected at root of chicken carcass scandal
---------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of Newcastle disease is understood to be the main cause
of the deaths of tens of thousands of chickens which were then
slaughtered and illegally sold on to consumers, restaurants and shops
in a food scandal revealed last week [13-17 Jun 2011].

Livestock Development Department officials in Saraburi province said
the outbreak of the disease was nationwide. Livestock authorities in
several areas have been trying unsuccessfully to suppress the disease
since late last year because of fears it may seriously harm the
lucrative chicken export market.

Panya Chotitawan, chairman of Saha Farm Co, said the Nakhon
Ratchasima scandal has caused domestic poultry meat consumption to
drop by about 10 per cent. Officials are now concentrating on chicken
farms in neighbouring Saraburi as the sources of the illegally sold
carcasses.

Large chicken farms in Saraburi have been vaccinating chickens
against Newcastle disease, while livestock authorities were
concentrating their efforts on domestic fowl. "Had it not been for
this disease, the incident in Nakhon Ratchasima would not have
happened," said one Livestock Development source.

Last Monday, abattoirs in the province were raided and about 8 tonnes
of decomposed chicken was seized. Police have laid charges against 4
of the 11 operators of the abattoirs.

"When you have 1000 chickens die on average a day, that's a lot. So
what farm owners may have possibly resorted to is getting rid of them
quickly, but as we have learned several do not have standard disposal
facilities," the source said.

Newcastle disease is a contagious viral disease fatal in some bird
life but non-threatening to humans. In birds, it usually can be
controlled through vaccination programmes. In April [2011], an
increase in the price of eggs was blamed on Newcastle disease
affecting laying hens and reducing production, according to a Tan
Network news report. One egg farmer said many farmers were forced to
sell their sick laying hens and added that the outbreak had been under
way for at least 10 months.

Mr Panya said yesterday he had yet to receive confirmation about an
outbreak of Newcastle disease in Thailand. He said chicken deaths
could be due to any number of reasons -- from other poultry diseases
to changes in weather. He said last year's low temperatures were a
likelier culprit as most of the dead fowl came from small-scale farms
that did not have a temperature-control system.

An investigation by the Bangkok Post Sunday has revealed that some of
the carcasses from the Nakhon Ratchasima raid came from a certified
chicken farm in the Kaeng Khoi district of Saraburi. Livestock
authorities inspected the farm last week and were told by the owner it
had a facility to dispose of chicken carcasses. However, the
inspectors found no disposal facility, which is required under the
Agricultural Standards Act 2008 for certified chicken farms.

Under the Disease Outbreaks Act, dead chickens commercially produced
must be either buried or incinerated.

However, the Animal Slaughter Control and Meat Sale Act allows farm
owners to sell dead livestock if they are examined and approved by a
veterinarian for sale. [For human consumption?! Confirmation from
reliable sources will be appreciated. - Mod.AS].

The investigators also found that the farm owners had not submitted
any notice for examination of their dead chickens.

Another certified farm in the district is also suspected of being the
source of the chicken carcasses but has yet to be investigated by
livestock officials. 3 other farms, owned by a large agribusiness,
were also accused by local residents of supplying the carcasses to the
slaughterhouses.

There are 7000 certified chicken farms in the Kingdom that must meet
certain food safety requirements. Many more are not certified and
livestock authorities are pressuring them to do so. But there are no
penalties under the Agricultural Standards, and, at worst, farm owners
face revocation of their certification.

Getting a chicken from the farm to the dinner table and fit for human
consumption is a complicated process covered by several laws and
different departments. Transportation is under the Animal Diseases
Act, and once the chickens reach the slaughterhouse, a different law
is used to try and ensure hygienic slaughtering and sale. Breaches can
result in penalties of up to one year's jail, with a fine of no more
than 20 000 baht [USD 655.52] or no more than 2500 baht [USD 81.94]
for each chicken counted.

Once the chickens reach food processing facilities and the market,
public health regulations come into place. Each step in the
complicated process creates loopholes which can be exploited or lead
to negligence, according to a senior bureaucrat who once supervised
the country's livestock development work. The National Food Committee
can coordinate work between various agencies but it "hardly works," he
said, adding it needs to focus on its mission's objectives of "food
safety" and "food security."

"The chicken carcasses incident can be seen as a good opportunity for
us to seriously get back to what we have started about food safety and
get it done. It has reflected our weak food safety," he said.

Nirandorn Uangtrakoolsuk, who heads the Disease Control and
Veterinary Bureau, said the department needed time to further
investigate the farms' alleged involvement and a panel needed to be
set up. Any chicken farmer found to be still involved in the scandal
would have their certificate revoked, he said.

Mr Panya echoed Mr Nirandorn's sentiment, saying that the Livestock
Development Department must boost safety control measures to better
contain chicken diseases and ensure that dead birds are properly
disposed of.

[Thailand's reports to the OIE indicate (2010 report) absence of NCD
in domestic fowl since 2004. Updated information, including
surveillance results in commercial and backyard flocks, would be
useful.

In February 2009 a mission of the European Union's Health and
Consumers DG (Directorate F - Food and Veterinary Office) visited in
Thailand to evaluate the animal health aspects of the production of
poultry meat products intended for export to the EU. Their final
report is available at
