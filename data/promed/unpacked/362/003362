A Gwangju man has tested positive for cholera, health authorities said Tue 23 Aug 2016. It is the first outbreak of the deadly disease on Korean soil in 15 years.

The man, 59, was hospitalized early this month [Aug 2016] with the disease's typical symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain and confirmed to have cholera. He was discharged from hospital after receiving antibiotics at an isolation facility. He is now in a stable condition, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). His family has no cholera symptoms, it said.

The KCDC has launched an investigation to confirm the route of the man's infection. He has no overseas travel record in 2016, meaning he was exposed to the bacterium here, it said.

Experts said people used to be infected by consuming cholera-contaminated fish, shellfish or water.

[The serotype of _V. cholerae_ is not stated. Some non-O1, non-O139 strains (non-epidemic serotypes) can cause cholera-like symptoms but the mechanism is not the production of cholera toxin.
