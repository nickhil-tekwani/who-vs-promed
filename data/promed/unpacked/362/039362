The Public Health Virology laboratory (PHV), Forensic and Scientific Services, Queensland Health have reported the isolation of the rodent-borne arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), from products of conception tissue taken from a 28-year-old woman, residing in southern Queensland (QLD). The patient miscarried in July 2021 in the setting of a febrile illness with associated headaches. Laboratory diagnostics detected anti-LCMV IgM and IgG antibodies in the patient's serum using immunofluorescent assays prior to the miscarriage. LCMV RNA was detected in the products of conception tissue by RT-PCR [1] and the same sample yielded an LCMV isolate in 4 vertebrate cell lines, including Vero E6 cells.

This case follows the recent diagnosis of LCMV infections by PHV since January 2021 in 13 other patients, all of whom resided in the same region in southern QLD as the above patient. Metagenomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated LCMV sequences from the tissue isolate in July, as well as a CSF sample from one of the aseptic meningitis cases in January 2021, clustered phylogenetically together within genotype I.

Originally isolated in 1933 in the USA, LCMV is the prototype of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, consisting of enveloped viruses with bi-segmented RNA genomes. The house mouse, _Mus musculus_ is the primary reservoir host for LCMV and humans can be incidentally infected following exposure to urine, faeces or saliva from infected rodents or other fomites they have contaminated [2, 3]. Whilst most human LCMV infections are asymptomatic or result in a mild febrile illness, more serious clinical sequelae can develop, including aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. Vertical transmission of LCMV from infected pregnant women to their unborn fetus can result in miscarriage and fetal death. Human-to-human LCMV transmission associated with organ transplantation has also been documented [3].

A current mouse plague in Australia, likely precipitated by over-abundance of food following bountiful rainfall during the summer, has been particularly prevalent in New South Wales (NSW) and southern QLD regions during 2020-2021. In March 2021, a farmer from NSW was also diagnosed with an LCMV infection during the current mouse plague which has been implicated as the likely cause of the recently reported LCMV infections in both states [4]. Previously unrecognized in southern QLD, the recent LCMV infections described in this report highlight public health concerns that the geographical distribution of LCMV, and heightened risk of infection amid the current mouse plague, is more widespread, and not limited to the regions where locally acquired cases have occurred. Greater awareness of this current Australian viral threat and consideration of LCMV infection in mouse-infested areas should be a public health priority.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Pyke for this interesting report. Australia experiences periodic house mouse population eruptions that doubtless contribute to increased human exposures to LCM virus. Dr. Pyke's reference 4 provides a link to the story of the farmer who became infected with LCM virus, was very seriously ill but survived (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-04/mouse-plague-farmer-contracts-lymphocytic-choriomeningitis/100037256). Avoidance of contact with mice, their excrement and virus-contaminated fomites is the only way to avoid exposure to the virus. There is no vaccine available.

Although reports of human LCM virus infection are relatively rare, the virus can cause serious disease and the risk is greater when there is exposure to rodents and the areas that they inhabit. The late Mod. CP commented in a 17 Aug 2012 post (see Human lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus - USA: (IN) rodent house 20120816.1247976), "Lymphocytic choriomeningitis, or LCM, is a rodent-borne viral infectious disease that presents as aseptic meningitis (inflammation of the membrane, or meninges, that surrounds the brain and spinal cord), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges). Its causative agent is the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ that was initially isolated in 1933. Although LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological disease, as its name implies, infection without symptoms or mild febrile illnesses are common clinical manifestations. In addition, pregnancy-related infection has been associated with congenital hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and mental retardation.

"The primary host is the common house mouse, _Mus musculus_. Infection in house mouse populations may vary by geographic location; about 5% of mice throughout the United States carry LCMV. The virus is found in the saliva, urine, and feces of infected mice. Infected mice carry LCMV and shed it for the duration of their lives without showing any sign of illness. Other types of rodents, such as hamsters, are not the natural reservoirs but can become infected with LCMV from wild mice at the breeder, in the pet store or home environment. Humans are more likely to contract LCMV from house mice, but infections from pet rodents have also been reported. Individuals become infected with LCMV after exposure to fresh urine, droppings, saliva, or nesting materials. Transmission can also occur when these materials are directly introduced into broken skin, the nose, the eyes, or the mouth, or presumably, via the bite of an infected rodent. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported, with the exception of vertical transmission from infected mother to fetus. Recent investigations indicate that organ transplantation may also be a means of transmission.

"LCM and milder LCMV infections have been reported in Europe, the Americas, Australia, and Japan, and may occur wherever infected rodent hosts of the virus are found. However, the disease has historically been underreported, often making it difficult to determine incidence rates or estimates of prevalence by geographic region. Several serologic studies conducted in urban areas have shown that the prevalence of LCMV infection among humans ranges from 2 to 5%.
