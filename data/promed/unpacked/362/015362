Foreigners planning to attend the Festival of Pacific Arts in Solomon Islands in July 2012 are being urged to vaccinate against rubella, also known as German measles. The health authorities have issued the warning after a 1st case was recorded on Tue 8 May 2012 and 5 more a day later.

Officials say due to the airborne nature of the virus, containment is no longer an option. The Undersecretary for Health Improvement, Dr Cedric Alependava, says a nationwide vaccination program is being organised to start next month [June 2012].

[Transmitted in airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough, rubella is an acute, usually mild viral disease traditionally affecting susceptible children and young adults worldwide. Rubella infection just before conception and in early pregnancy may result in miscarriage, foetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The highest risk of CRS is found in countries with high rates of susceptibility to rubella among women of childbearing age.

In 1996, there were close to 13 000 cases in the WHO Western Pacific Region prior to the introduction of vaccines. Very few countries in these regions had introduced rubella-containing vaccine. Large-scale rubella vaccination during the last decade has drastically reduced or practically eliminated rubella and CRS in many developed and in some developing countries. Indeed, the western hemisphere and several European countries have eliminated rubella and CRS.

The WHO Measles and Rubella Initiative is backing a new 2012-2020 Measles & Rubella Strategic Plan. The strategic plan presents a 5-pronged strategy to cut global measles deaths by at least 95 percent by 2015 compared with 2000 levels and to achieve measles and rubella elimination in at least 5 WHO regions by 2020. The strategies include: High vaccination coverage; monitoring spread of disease using laboratory-backed surveillance; outbreak preparedness and response and case management; communication and community engagement; and research and development.

Solomon Islands is a sovereign state in Oceania, east of Papua New Guinea, consisting of nearly 1000 islands. It covers a land mass of 28 400 square km. The capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The interactive HealthMap of the Solomon Islands can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/2kOL. - Mod.CP]
