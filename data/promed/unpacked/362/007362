Is anything known of the child's immunization status or whether or not he [or she] is immunocompromised?

[We were told in the news report referenced above that an elementary school student in Medicine Hat, Alberta had been diagnosed with diphtheria. The student had not travelled outside Canada, was not known to have been in contact with anyone having diphtheria, and did not require hospitalization. We were not told the child's clinical manifestations, such as, did the child have respiratory or cutaneous diphtheria, if the strain of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ was a toxin-producer, if the child was vaccinated against diphtheria, and if the child was immunocompromised. As requested by Dr Lenoir, more information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
