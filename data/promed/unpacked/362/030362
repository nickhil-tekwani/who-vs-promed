The continued advance of African swine fever (ASF) through eastern European countries has triggered concern amongst pig farmers and governing bodies. DEFRA [UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs] has upgraded the threat to the UK from 'very low' to 'low' -- meaning the risk is "rare but could occur" (EFSA [European Food Safety Authority] terminology). This severe disease of pigs entered Europe through Georgia in 2007, and has since continued to the Russian Federation and eastern Europe, including EU countries in the Baltic States, Poland and very recently the Czech Republic, in wild boar. In early August 2017, an outbreak was confirmed for the 1st time in Romania among backyard pigs.

African swine fever is caused by infection with ASF virus (ASFV), which can have fatality rates of up to 100 per cent. The virus causes acute disease in domestic pigs and wild boar, and may cause varying clinical signs that are similar to other pig diseases such as high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. Pigs may also die suddenly without clinical signs.

Although the virus does not cause disease in humans, the impact it has on the economy, especially through trade and farming, is substantial. As a consequence of ASF in Poland and the Baltic States the value of pork and pig exports was reduced by USD 960 million (2014-2015). In Denmark, the predicted impact of an ASF outbreak is estimated at USD 12 million in direct losses and USD 349 million in exports.

Unless the appropriate control measures are put in place, additional outbreaks could occur across Europe, further into Russia and beyond to Asia. An outbreak in the UK is unlikely as imports of meat and pigs are extremely well regulated and the UK does not have a wild boar population substantial enough or widespread enough to maintain an outbreak. However, personal imports of pork products from affected areas could result in disease incursion if deliberately or accidently fed to pigs or wild boar, actions which are illegal.

The seriousness of an outbreak for some countries could be far worse than others; China is home to over half the world's pig population and an outbreak of ASF could result in devastating consequences. In a Veterinary Record article [see reference below] world-expert on ASF Dr Linda Dixon leader of the ASF group at The Pirbright Institute, outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of ASF spreading to China and highlights areas that could be improved to reduce the risk of an outbreak including biosecurity.

[Subscribers may refer to more data in the article above, addressing the following questions:
- how does ASF spread?
- how quickly does it spread?
- how can the spread of ASFV be prevented?
- what is The Pirbright Institute doing to help?

The last item includes the following statement: "The vaccine research is crucial for the prevention and control of ASF, and good progress has so far been made. An effective vaccine will enable better control and prevention measures to be put in place in the future, helping stem the losses currently being suffered by farmers around the world."

The editorial "Preparing for the worst: African swine fever in China", by Linda K Dixon, was recently published in the Veterinary Record [ Vet Rec. 2017; 181: 115-6, doi: 10.1136/vr.j3525. http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/vetrec/181/5/115.full.pdf].

The European Commission's working document SANTE-2017-10272 (36 pages) of 31 Jan 2017, titled "Blueprint and roadmap on the possible development of a vaccine for African swine fever prepared by the African Swine Fever EU reference laboratory on Commission request" is available at
