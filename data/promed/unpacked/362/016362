Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) virus was identified in a white-tailed deer found dead in southern Alberta south of Foremost, about 30 km [19 mi] north of the US border on 16 Sep 2013. At least 50 other deer and 3 antelope were found dead in the vicinity. Carcasses were too decomposed for extensive necropsy; however, tissues from one deer and one antelope were suitable for virus testing. EHD virus was present in the spleen of the whitetail. Further testing is currently being done to determine the strain of the virus.

EHD is most frequently transmitted by the biting midge, _Culicoides variipennis_ which are less often found in more northern environments due to colder winters. In some cases, the disease has been shown to cause large scale outbreaks in wild deer populations. EHD was first diagnosed in the United States in 1955 and has since become an important disease of white-tailed deer throughout US. It has also been previously reported in Alberta, although quite sporadically.

[It was still warm enough in September for the midges to be transmitting disease to the cervid population. Likely the weather is too cool now in that location for this scenario to be ongoing. Some parts of the continent have remained rather warm, but Alberta has cooled to seasonal temperatures which should have killed the midges.
