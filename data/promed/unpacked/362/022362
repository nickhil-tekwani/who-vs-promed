I would just like to bring attention to the fact that this important step in
public health was possible after the malaria DNA vaccine had been tested on
monkeys in Panama at the "Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios en
Salud", with which the US Naval Medical Research Institute has maintained a
fruitful relationship over the years.
(*) The Gorgas Institute of Health Studies is a Panamanian institution that
continued after the US Gorgas Memorial Institute left Panama. The latter is
now based in the University of Alabama in Birmingham (UAB).
