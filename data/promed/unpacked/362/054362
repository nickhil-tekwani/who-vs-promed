With reference to the report [cited above on a 12-day-old baby with
leptospirosis, dark field microscopy for leptospires and the Microscopic
Agglutination Test for antibodies are mentioned. In addition it is
mentioned that antibiotics will blunt the response of the laboratory tests.
We would like to express words of caution first on dark field microscopy
for leptospires and secondly on antibiotic treatment and antibody response.
As for the first issue, in The Netherlands a pseudo-epidemic of
leptospirosis among swimmers in a lake was reported in the Journal of the
Netherlands Medical Association (Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd 1991; 135, nr25 (in
Dutch)). On the basis of darkfield microscopy of blood, leptospirosis was
diagnosed in patients having swum in the lake, incorrectly it appeared as
the diagnosis could not be confirmed by other established methods.
We cite from S. Faine's book Leptospira and Leptospirosis (CRC Press, Boca
Raton, Florida, 1994) from Chapter 14 "Clinical Laboratory Diagnosis of
Leptospirosis" page 230 the following: "During the first week to 10 days,
especially days 3-7, leptospires may be seen on direct microscopic
examination of blood, peritoneal or pleural exudates, and urine. The
advantage of direct observations is speed, leading to definitive early
diagnosis. The disadvantages are the technical difficulties of obtaining
suitable specimens, the short time in which positive results are likely,
and the subjective interpretation in reading results. " And further:
"Darkfield examination is not recommended" (as a sole technique for the
laboratory diagnosis of leptospirosis); "even experts can occasionally
confuse threads of fibrin and protein in wet preparations with leptospires."
As for the second issue, the evidence that early antibiotic treatment of
leptospirosis in humans will suppress antibody formation and thus
invalidate serological diagnosis is inadequate. The main report on which
the statement is based refers to patients with clinical leptospirosis
believed to be _L. pomona_ infections, treated with penicillin. Some of them
failed to develop antibodies to _L. pomona_, but had low level antibodies to
_L. medanensis_ in the Hebdomadis serogroup. The presence of concomitant
hardjo infections in the district was not then (1963- 64) recognised. The
medanensis antibodies were probably due to cross-reactions with hardjo, not
then known as a cause of human, cattle-associated leptospirosis, and not
included in the serological testing (references: Tennent, R.B., and N.A.
Philip. 1964. Leptospirosis: a general practitioner's point of view. New
Zealand Medical Journal 63 (Supplement): 28-32S; and page 234 from the same
Chapter from Faine's book mentioned above).
There are many different methods for the laboratory diagnosis of
leptospirosis. Please refer to appropriate textbooks and manuals such as
Faine's for diagnostic methods in leptospirosis. Leptospirosis should be
treated without delay and as early as possible in the disease. For the
sake of clarity and perhaps superfluously, we feel that leptospirosis
should be treated without delay and as early as possible in the disease.
In this light and perhaps superfluously we wish to add that, from medical
and ethical viewpoints, it is, of course, not acceptable to withhold
potentially life-saving antibiotic treatment.

[It is also possible to culture _Leptospira_ sp. in specialized
bacteriological media, so it would seem that conventional laboratory
analyses of clinical specimens would be possible. I presume that this is
covered in the Faine textbook cited above. - Mod.ES
