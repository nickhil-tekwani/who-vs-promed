A. International Council of Nurses
Date: Wed 6 May 2020

https://www.icn.ch/news/icn-calls-data-healthcare-worker-infection-rates-and-deaths


The International Council of Nurses (ICN) calls on governments to immediately start keeping accurate records of infections and deaths among healthcare workers: failure to do so increases the chances of more deaths and fails to honour those who have died.

Last month [April 2020], ICN reported that more than 100 nurses from around the world had died after contracting COVID-19. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) had reported 23 000 healthcare worker infections. The figures released by ICN and WHO are shocking, but ICN now believes them to significantly underestimate the situation.

ICN has gathered further information from its member National Nursing Associations (NNAs, some official government figures, and media reports), which suggest that at least 90 000 healthcare workers have been infected, and more than 260 nurses have died.

Thousands of nurses have been infected with COVID-19 and hundreds have already died, but governments cannot say exactly how many because they are not collecting the data. This lack of accurate data has led to a serious underestimation of the infection rate among nurses, and the number of deaths. ICN says this failure to record both infection rates and deaths among healthcare workers is putting more nurses and their patients in danger.

ICN is calling for data on healthcare worker infections and deaths to be systematically collected by national governments and held centrally at the WHO. Such a move would show respect to the nurses who have given their lives, but also inform prevention strategies, such as addressing fundamental issues, including testing and the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE).

ICN Chief Executive Officer Howard Catton said: "The lack of official data on infections and deaths among nurses and other healthcare workers is scandalous. Nurses and healthcare workers have been put at greater risk because of the lack of PPE and poor preparedness for this pandemic. As a result, we have seen infection rates and, tragically, deaths rise on a daily basis. Governments' failure to collect this information in a consistent way means we do not have the data that would add to the science that could improve infection control and prevention measures and save the lives of other healthcare workers. 'If governments fail to act on this, I fear we may look back on this pandemic and count the dead among our nursing colleagues in the thousands."

ICN's data is from 30 countries. It shows that, on average, 6% of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 are among healthcare workers, with a range from 0% to 18%. If that proportion were repeated globally, the 3.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world would yield a figure for the number of infected healthcare workers of 210 000.

Mr Catton continued: "If governments do not count the number of nurses who have lost their lives, if they continue to turn a blind eye, it sends a message that those nurses' lives didn't count. Having this data will help to focus the minds of government ministers and officials on what matters most: saving people's lives.

'ICN has made every effort to influence governments, hold them to account, and prevent the deaths of our nursing colleagues. When the history of the 2020 pandemic is written, we will make sure that the names of the nurses who gave their lives are recorded and honoured, so that their sacrifice is never forgotten.

'And if governments still fail to act, we will make sure that when the post COVID-19 inquiries take place, as they inevitably will, political leaders will be asked why that information was not collected."

[This call to action while somewhat harsh is highly appropriate. The media have been filled with anecdotal accounts of healthcare workers not having access to adequate PPE. And the term healthcare workers applies to doctors, nurses, therapists (respiratory therapists), other clinical support staff, and administrative, supply, and logistic staff. The numbers of those individuals working in facilities with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals that have become infected, most likely exposure being the healthcare facility, would provide a window on the efficacy of PPE out in the field, and flag those areas with likely shortages as reflected in higher numbers of healthcare worker cases and unfortunately, deaths. - Mod.MPP]

https://www.intellinews.com/report-paints-harrowing-picture-of-iranian-doctors-and-nurses-dying-in-coronavirus-struggle-183047/


A report from The Associated Press on [12 May 2020] painted a harrowing picture of just how hard doctors and nurses in Iran have been hit by the country's coronavirus (COVID-19) emergency and "disjointed" response, stating that during the 1st 90 days of the virus outbreak alone, about one medical staffer died each day and dozens became infected.

The article, written by a reporter in Cairo who interviewed more than 30 medical professionals and reviewed communications by doctors on messaging apps and other documents, reads: "It is no secret that Iran has been hit hard by the coronavirus. Official government figures show that around 100 000 people were infected by the virus and around 6500 have died. But a report by the research arm of Iran's parliament said the number of cases could be 8 to 10 times higher, making it among the hardest hit countries in the world. The report said the number of deaths could be 80% higher than official numbers from the Health Ministry, about 11 700."

Though the Iranian government is currently reporting a decline in the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in many areas, local authorities are expanding cemeteries in places like Tehran where the municipal council said it had to add 10 000 new graves to its largest cemetery, Behesht e-Zahra. The report also relates how "in the beginning, medical staffers faced the outbreak with very limited equipment. Some washed their own gowns and masks or sterilized them in regular ovens. Others wrapped their bodies in plastic bags they bought at the supermarket. The result: Dozens of medical professionals without adequate protection died along with their patients."

As health services struggled with makeshift equipment, the health ministry said millions of pieces of protective gear had been stolen and diverted to the black market, the report says, adding: "One doctor interviewed by The Associated Press -- who, like all medical workers interviewed for this story, spoke only on the condition that they not be named for fear of persecution -- said he and his colleagues were even discouraged from using protective equipment. He said government officials claimed wearing masks would cause panic."

A list compiled by a group of Iranian doctors found that a total of 126 medical staffers have died since the virus was first reported, mostly in the provinces of Gilan and Tehran, while over 2070 contracted the virus. The Associated Press said it verified 100 of the deaths by piecing together scattered news reports in local media outlets, statements from health institutions and social media messages of condolences.

Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour acknowledged to the news agency the deadly toll of COVID-19 on the medical profession in Iran, telling the news service that the total number of deaths was 107. Jahanpour added that 470 had tested positive for the virus.

"The number of real patients with COVID-19 in Iran, from the beginning ... until today is much more than what has been reported," a Tehran radiologist was quoted as saying, in comments that the news agency said echoed similar sentiments expressed by most medical workers it interviewed. He estimated that the numbers were 3 to 4 times higher than the figures released by the government.

[4] China: complete nucleic acid testing of all Wuhan residents
Date: Tue 12 May 2020 5:16 PM
Source: CNN [edited]
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/12/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-testing-china-intl-hnk/index.html


Millions of people in Wuhan will be tested for the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] within the coming days, after a new cluster of cases emerged despite a strict 76-day lockdown that was intended to eliminate the virus from the central Chinese city. Over the weekend [10 May 2020], 6 new cases were reported in the city, the 1st in 35 consecutive days. None of the new cases were imported from overseas, sparking concern that the infection could still be spreading in the city where the virus is thought to have 1st emerged.

In response to the outbreak, authorities in Wuhan will conduct city-wide nucleic acid testing over a period of 10 days, according to an emergency notice issued by local authorities and circulated by state run media outlet The Paper. Nucleic acid tests work by detecting the virus' genetic code, and can be more effective at detecting the infection, particularly in the early stages, than tests which examine a body's immune response, though the latter are easier to conduct.

The ambitious screening drive, described in the report as a "10-day battle," could see up to 11 million people tested -- more than the entire population of Greece. Wuhan was the 1st city in the world to enter into lockdown and great effort has been expended in an attempt to eliminate the virus. The city has been gradually returning to normal after that 76-day enforced lockdown lifted on [8 Apr 2020], with residents finally permitted to go outside, though many businesses remain closed.

Despite the ongoing economic pain and trauma, however, Wuhan had been held up as a poster child of China's effective response to the pandemic, emerging "like a phoenix," in the words of one state-backed newspaper.

The reemergence of the virus has already had ramifications for the local government. State media reported Monday that Zhang Yuxin, chief official of Changqing, the area where the new cases had been detected, was removed from his post "for failures in epidemic prevention and control work." While no new cases of the virus were reported in Wuhan as of Tuesday [12 May 2020], any major increase in numbers as a result of the new testing will raise serious questions over the accuracy and transparency of the city's previous figures. Officials are already facing accusations of covering up the severity of the virus in the earliest stages of the pandemic, and confusion over China's national figures has been created by several shifts in diagnostic and reporting procedures.

Nor is Wuhan the only part of the country where new cases have been detected. The city of Shulan, in Jilin province in the country's far northeast, was put under "wartime control mode" Sunday [10 May 2020], after 11 people were confirmed to be infected with the virus.

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea, previously thought to be largely on top of the virus, has also faced a setback this week, with a cluster of new cases detected in Seoul. The country's president, Moon Jae-in, said Sunday that the fight against coronavirus is "not over until it's over."

[A massive undertaking to do PCR testing on 11+ million individuals in 10 days. One wonders what the "false negative" rate of the testing in use, having heard anecdotal reports of false negative tests. Hopefully the results of the testing will be shared with the public health world, especially the identified asymptomatic rate of infection. - Mod.MPP

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published a new guidance on Considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/considerations-for-school-related-public-health-measures-in-the-context-of-covid-19) as an annex to earlier guidance on adjusting public health and social measures (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/considerations-in-adjusting-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-context-of-covid-19-interim-guidance) published on [15 Apr 2020].

- WHO has issued a Statement on Tobacco use and COVID-19. Tobacco smoking is a known risk factor for many respiratory infections and increases the severity of respiratory diseases. A review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO found that smokers are more likely to develop severe disease with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19.

- The Director-General Dr Tedros in his media briefing yesterday [11 May 2020], urged a slow, steady, lifting of public health and social measures (so called lockdowns), which is key to stimulating economies, while also keeping a vigilant eye on the virus so that control measures can be quickly implemented if an upswing in cases is identified.

Subject in focus: technical support for COVID-19 treatment centres
------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO Operations Support and Logistics (OSL), in collaboration with a technical network of universities, architects, biomedical engineers and other health experts, is working to support the establishment of COVID19 treatment centres, self-quarantine and community facilities at the request of countries seeking technical guidance in setting up such facilities.

Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, WHO OSL has provided technical recommendations and operational guidance for the construction of treatment centres, or repurposing of existing buildings, to provide medical care to COVID-19 patients.

To support this initiative, OSL is working to establish a global Technical Network that so far has brought together the expertise of 200 architects, academics, civil engineers, biomedical engineers, and other technical health experts from 27 institutions across 22 countries. The initiative aims to strengthen national COVID-19 preparedness and rapid response capacities through a multi-disciplinary collaboration, 24-hour remote support and, whenever required and possible, deployment of international experts to support the COVID-19 response in countries in need of technical assistance.

Since March [2020], OSL's HealthTech Unit, with the voluntary support of architects and engineers from the Technical Network, has helped set up COVID-19 treatment centres in the following countries: Senegal, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Sao Tome and Principe, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritius, Australia, and Italy.

In Tanzania, OSL recently completed the design and layout plan to convert a commercial site in Dar Es Salaam into a 500-bed capacity COVID-19 treatment centre. Working in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and colleagues in the WHO Country Office, OSL architects, and health experts have provided blueprints and technical operational guidance for the facility.

In Burkina Faso, OSL worked in partnership with the Ministry of Health to set up a 42-bed COVID-19 treatment centre in Bobo-Dioulasso. The centre is currently functioning and run by Medecins Sans Frontieres.

In Nigeria, OSL has helped set up a COVID-19 Self-Quarantine Facility in a camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The facility, located next to the camp, aims to provide early recognition and source control, including isolating patients with suspected COVID-19, as a strategy for preventing or limiting transmission in camps and camp-like settings. The facility was designed to allow a safe, controlled, dignified, and comfortable self-quarantine for new arrivals in order to (a) limit human-to-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and healthcare workers, preventing transmission amplification events, strengthening health facilities; (b) identify and provide optimised care for infected patients early; and (c) communicate critical risk and information to all communities and counter misinformation.

In Italy, OSL is providing technical assistance, working with hospitals in Bologna and in the southern Puglia region to advise hospitals on adapting existing care facilities into dedicated treatment facilities for COVID-19 patients.

To coordinate technical assistance, OSL has established a COVID-19 Help Desk, a 24-hour global resource to provide technical information and support to the COVID-19 treatment and healthcare facilities. Recommendations and solutions provided by the Help Desk are based on WHO guidelines and are adapted to the social, economic, and health context of each country. The Help Desk works in collaboration with other WHO outbreak response pillars, including the COVID-19 Supply Portal (https://covid-19-response.org/), HealthOPS clinical care, case management, and other WHO support mechanisms to assist Member States in strengthening response capacity for managing the COVID-19 outbreak.

Development of a standardized assessment tool for COVID-19 treatment centres is currently ongoing. SARI Treatment Centre guidelines are now available in English, French, Portuguese, and Italian; translations into other UN languages are forthcoming.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 41 266 new cases (50.0% of the global newly reported cases), and 2675 deaths (62.8%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 64.6% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 16.4%, and Peru at 5.6%. Recognizing that USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, if newly confirmed cases from the USA are excluded, then Brazil reported 46.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 15.7%, Mexico at 10.7%, and Chile at 8.2%. Ecuador has shown downward readjustments of the cumulative cases over the past few days.

The European region reported 24 184 new cases (29.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 1277 deaths (30.0%). Russia reported 45.1% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 16.0%, Spain 12.6%, Turkey 4.6%, Germany 3.9%, and Italy 3.1% each.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8863 new cases (10.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 125 deaths (2.9%). Saudi Arabia reported 22.2% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 12.9%, Iran at 19.0%, Qatar at 12.4%, and the United Arab Emirates at 7.7%.

The African region reported 2296 new cases (2.8% of the global newly reported cases) and 34 deaths (0.80%). South Africa reported 27.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana at 19.0%, Nigeria at 10.5%, Senegal at 7.7%, Algeria at 7.3%, Gabon at 6.1%, and Guinea-Bissau at 5.2%.

The Western Pacific region reported 962 new cases (1.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 34 deaths (0.80%). Singapore reported 50.5% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 30.4%, and Japan at 7.9%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 61.3%, Japan at 16.0%, Malaysia at 14.7%, and South Korea at 5.7%.

The South East Asia region reported 5020 new cases (6.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 116 deaths (2.7%). India reported 71.8% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 20.6% and Indonesia at 4.6%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 73.0% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 16.5%, Nepal at 5.0%, and the Maldives at 4.4%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 12 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South East Asia.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
