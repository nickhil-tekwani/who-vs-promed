The Canary's Entomological Surveillance System has detected 2 larvae of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito on La Palma Island, but this is "an isolated finding" and they do not have viruses that carry transmissible diseases, the Ministry of Health reported.

_Aedes aegypti_, known as the yellow fever mosquito, "is a vector that transmits viral diseases in other geographic areas where these pathogens are endemic, which is not the case in the Canary Islands."

The sequencing of the larvae has verified that they do not contain viruses that carry transmissible diseases, but in any case "we must also activate the detection and surveillance protocol."

In 2017, the Entomological Surveillance System of the Canary Islands detected the presence of this mosquito in Fuerteventura Island, from where it was definitively eradicated (see Invasive mosquito - Spain: (CN) 20171214.5503487).

In this case, the presence of invasive mosquito larvae "has been detected in a specific area" of the island of La Palma, so residents will be surveyed and possible breeding sites inspected and located, as well as more traps will be placed in the area.

The Ministry of Health points out that the surveillance system allows the early detection of invasive mosquito larvae and eggs, "before their presence has been reported or before they have caused bites in the island's population."

"All the necessary information is being compiled to limit, verify and, where appropriate, eradicate the presence of this mosquito on the island," the Ministry states.

The presence of the mosquito "does not mean that there is transmission of [of viruses that cause] diseases, such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever or chikungunya, since these [viruses] are not present in our territory, except for sporadic imported cases."

The Surveillance and Public Health System team, coordinated by the General Directorate of Public Health in collaboration with the Directorate of the La Palma Health Area is carrying out initial preventive action.

The placement of traps has been expanded at points considered to be at greatest risk, such as greenhouses, banana packing plants, cemeteries, and tire dumps, in addition to the port and airport, where they are currently located by protocol.

_A. aegypti_ mosquitoes are black with [silver] stripes and smaller than the usual ones in the Canary Islands. They appear more in urban environments and have become adapted to reproduce in small water collection sites generated by people.

They usually bite during the day and not at night and their bite generates a strong inflammatory reaction that is accompanied by a great irritation. They move nimbly close to the ground and no buzzing is heard.

The female mosquitoes are the ones that bite, since they need to feed on blood to reproduce. They also need water as breeding sites to complete their development. They lay their eggs in the water, from which the larvae emerge, then transform into pupae (both are aquatic) and finally become adult mosquitoes.

Mosquitoes that bite humans need to be breeding very close to people. That is why the most effective measure against them is to monitor or eliminate their breeding sites.

[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.

This is yet another example of movement of _Aedes aegypti_ to a new location. The possible mechanism of transport in this case is not mentioned. This is the 2nd report of the appearance of _A. aegypti_ in the Canary Islands. The 1st was in 2017. The entomological surveillance in the Islands has been very effective in detecting the presence of _A. aegypti_ very early on and eliminating them. The risk of new introductions of this mosquito is ongoing. One hopes that surveillance and response will continue to be successful in preventing the establishment of this mosquito or others in the Canary Islands. - Mod.TY]
