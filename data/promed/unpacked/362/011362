AI outbreak in Lochem
---------------------
Avian influenza virus subtype H7 has been identified on a poultry farm in Lochem. This has been announced by the [Dutch] Product Boards for Livestock, Meat and Eggs (PVE).

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has installed, since Tuesday 16:00, a restriction zone of 1 km [0.6 mile] around the affected layers farm which includes 3 hen houses with a total of 83 000 layer hens. 2 of the hen houses have access to free ranching. There are 2 additional poultry units within the restricted zone, a broiler breeding unit with 53 400 birds and a free-ranch flock with 10 000 hens.

It is not yet clear if the virus involved is of high or low pathogenicity (HPAI or LPAI). This is expected to become known on Wed 13 Mar 2013. However, in view of the observed clinical signs, this may eventually be determined as an LPAI case.

[In the past, both HPAI H7 and LPAI H7 epizootics have been recorded in the Netherlands. Results of the pathogenicity tests, and full definition of the AI virus serotype involved, are expected soon.
