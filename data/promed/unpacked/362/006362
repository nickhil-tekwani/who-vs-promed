If there is a significant risk that the blood of British beef-eaters serves
as a reservoir for BSE infection, the only appropriate response would be for
the GOVERNMENT and hospitals in the UK to stop accepting British blood
donors and to obtain its blood from foreign sources (or, as a lesser
measure, to segregate British blood from other blood, and only use the
British blood when other sources are unavailable).

Eh? How come, Rachel? There are no elderly persons, or meat workers or dairy
farmers among the known vCJD victims.

We need somewhat broader horizons here.
_If_ this is a serious discussion, and _if_ CJD is transmissible from human
to human by blood, then there would be no reason whatsoever to distinguish,
for this purpose, between vCJD (or nvCJD as it now commonly designated) and
"classical" CJD. Classical CJD occurs everywhere at a remarkably consistent
rate. And there is no blood anywhere that would be free from risk of CJD. In
addition we have to consider other dangerous transmissible diseases that are
definitely _known_ to be blood transmissible. Not a comforting thought for
someone like myself, who has very recently received a necessary blood
transfusion (not my own blood -- see later) in the course of (thankfully)
successful life-saving heart surgery, but there it might be.
Bart suggests UK should obtain its blood from "foreign sources". Which ones?
>From countries where donors are sellers, paid for their blood and therefore
with a financial incentive to hide reasons why they ought not to do so
(perhaps to help finance their injection drug-taking?)
How about from USA? As there are of the order of 300 cases of CJD per year
in USA, and given an incubation period of up to 30 years, there are at any
given time up to some 9,000 people in USA who are, unknowingly and unknown.
and at present undetectably, at various stages of incubating CJD.
Moreover, as reported in The Lancet last week (Larkin, "Some blood donors do
not report risk behaviours", The Lancet, 1997, Vol 349, 9056) 'A
"measurable percentage" of US blood donors do not report risk factors at the
time of donation, report Alan Williams, American Red Cross Holland
Laboratory, and colleagues this week (JAMA, 1997, Vol 277, 967-72). The team
collected demographic, medical and behavioural information from 34126
anonymous donors across the USA'. '1.9% reported a risk, such as injection
drug-taking, sex with a prostitute, or recent blood transfusion, that would
have resulted in their deferral from donation, had it been revealed at the
time of interview. In 0.4% of respondents, exposure to the risk occurred
within 3 months of giving blood.'
Given that some of those interviewed might still have concealed their risk
status, these figures must be considered conservative.
Although all blood donated (in USA) is tested for seven infectious diseases,
Williams et al note that only 8.2% of those who subsequently reported risk
had actually been screened out by the laboratory testing. That suggests that
some 1.7% of the 12 million donations annually could involve risk factors of
blood-transmissible diseases.
And this takes no account of those donors incubating CJD, _if_ that should
prove to be blood-transmissible from human to human.
Even disregarding accidental mis-match of blood types (which is now rare but
can occur) blood transfusion can be a chancey business, no matter which
national blood supply is used. Perhaps this is the reason why some people,
in a position to anticipate surgery that will involve a blood transfusion,
arrange to donate their own blood for that exclusive purpose, in the few
weeks beforehand.
