Romania's government on Tuesday released funds to help cash-strapped local
authorities contain an epidemic of anthrax that has so far killed 2 men and
dozens of cattle in the Danube Delta. "We have had 2 confirmed deaths from
anthrax, both farmers who ate contaminated pork," said Marian Avram, chief
sanitary-veterinary inspector of the Tulcea county.
Since the epidemic was declared 3 weeks ago, 29 people suspected of anthrax
infection have been rushed to hospital in Tulcea, the main Danube Delta
port, 260 km east of Bucharest.
A government statement said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu
had allocated the equivalent of US$230 000 from the government's coffers to
the Tulcea authorities.
Veterinary authorities link this year's epidemic to the worst drought in a
century that has hit the Delta, like the rest of Romania. Avram said that
similar outbreaks had been reported in previous years, but with no [human
casualties. Farmers, he said, were reluctant to vaccinate animals,
preferring to let them graze at large [!, on huge wild expanses of the
Delta. Local authorities have declared a quarantine in the nearby Danube
port of Braila, to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
