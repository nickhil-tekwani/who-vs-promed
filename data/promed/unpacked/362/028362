E. coli - tainted meat sickens 56
---------------------------------
WASHINGTON (Reuters): At least 56 Midwesterners have become ill in the
latest suspected contamination of ground beef with a potentially deadly
strain of _Escherichia. coli_ O157 bacteria, state health officials
[report]. The outbreak in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois comes just
days after the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), under fire
for allegedly failing to protect the public against _E. coli_ O157:H7,
declared "war" on it and ordered all US beef plants to adopt new safeguards.

The Wisconsin Division of Public Health said on Fri, 27 Sep 2002, it
alerted federal authorities about two separate _E. coli_ outbreaks within
the state, each connected to ground beef. The USDA said it was
investigating a Wisconsin meat plant that may be the source of the
contaminated beef, but declined to identify the company or give other
details. "We have been investigating this and I think by late today we are
going to see a recall," said Steve Cohen, spokesman for the USDA's Food
Safety and Inspection Service. "We are going to present the evidence to the
plant and hope they can recall the product." The USDA, which said it has
investigated the outbreak for several weeks, does not have the authority to
order a recall.

At latest count, symptoms among 52 people in Wisconsin, 3 in Minnesota, and
1 in Illinois have been linked to the contamination. Officials said 19 in
Wisconsin were admitted to hospital. "The suspected vehicle for
transmission of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in both of these outbreaks is ground
beef," the Wisconsin health agency said. "Heightened surveillance continues
throughout Wisconsin and outside the state to detect additional cases and
determine the extent of illness attributable to these outbreaks," it said.

The USDA has come under fire in recent months for not doing enough to
protect the public from contaminated meat. In the latest outbreak, the USDA
discovered _E. coli_ O157:H7 contamination by sampling food products from 2
households whose members had fallen ill. Both samples tested positive for
the bacteria and were linked to the same Wisconsin plant, USDA's Cohen
said. USDA officials would not comment as to whether the tainted beef was
purchased at a grocery store or restaurant.

The USDA's recent declaration of war on the deadly strain of _E. coli_
called for random testing of all US meat processing plants as a precaution.
Companies were also ordered to review their food safety measures and adopt
stricter ones to reduce the risk of contamination. Congressional
investigators with the General Accounting Office 2 weeks ago said USDA food
safety inspectors were not reliable in identifying or documenting companies
that failed to meet federal standards.

Wisconsin meat company recalls ground beef
------------------------------------------
MILWAUKEE (AP): A Wisconsin meat packing company said that it is recalling
about 400 000 pounds of ground beef that may be connected to an _E. coli_
outbreak that sickened 40 people in 3 states. Health investigators also are
probing another _E. coli_ outbreak that sickened another 19 people in
Wisconsin. It is not known if the outbreaks are related, though officials
believe all the people got sick after eating ground beef.

Officials learned of the first outbreak last month after 19 people who went
on a rafting trip in northern Wisconsin fell ill. While investigating the
first outbreak, officials found another of a different strain. That
outbreak hit 40 people in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Minnesota.

The meat company said its recall was a precaution. "The evidence linking
this to this product is what you would call circumstantial," said Justin
Segel, president of Emmpack Foods and Peck Meat Packing. "We are in the
interest of public safety, consumer safety, recalling 5 days of
production." Last May 2002, the company recalled 471 000 pounds of ground
beef because [of possible] contamination with _E. coli_.
