[3] USA: questionable state reporting
Date: Wed 27 May 2020 11:01 PM EDT
Source: Politico [abridged, edited]
https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/27/bad-state-coronavirus-data-trump-reopening-286143


Federal and state officials across the country have altered or hidden public health data crucial to tracking the coronavirus' spread, hindering the ability to detect a surge of infections as President Donald Trump pushes the nation to reopen rapidly.

In at least a dozen states, health departments have inflated testing numbers or deflated death tallies by changing criteria for who counts as a coronavirus victim and what counts as a coronavirus test, according to reporting from POLITICO, other news outlets, and the states' own admissions. Some states have shifted the metrics for a "safe" reopening; Arizona sought to clamp down on bad news at one point by simply shuttering its pandemic modeling. About 1/3 of the states aren't even reporting hospital admission data -- a big red flag for the resurgence of the virus.

The spotty data flow is particularly worrisome to public health officials trying to help Americans make decisions about safely venturing out. The lack of accurate and consistent COVID-19 data, coupled with the fact that the White House no longer has regular briefings where officials reinforce the need for ongoing social distancing, makes that task even harder.

New examples seem to sprout up daily. The District of Columbia this week became the latest jurisdiction to endure scrutiny, with the city using a "community spread" metric -- excluding nursing homes, correctional facilities, and others -- as a justification for reopening the area.

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds told reporters that the state will share information about outbreaks at meatpacking plants only upon request. And Georgia has only just begun to differentiate between the 2 types of coronavirus tests it's been adding into its testing totals for weeks.

"All these stories about undercounts, overcounts, miscounts, are undermining our ability to deal with the pandemic," said Irwin Redlener, a public health expert at Columbia University. The country, he said, is confronting an "unheard of level of chaos in the data, the protocols, the information."

The problems are widespread and have infiltrated federal health agencies as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention blended diagnostic and antibody tests, boosting the nation's overall testing numbers. The Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] took out of context data on the danger of "deaths of despair" from overdoses and suicides amid an economic debacle, according to the authors of the report in question. On Tuesday [26 May 2020], an ethics center at Harvard rebuked the White House for misleadingly citing numbers from one of its studies to buttress the administration's national testing report.

Nearly half the US, meanwhile, has registered rising caseloads as states press ahead with reopening the economy. While some of that reflects increased testing, an accompanying uptick in hospitalizations is worrying experts, including former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb. The White House, which has insisted it's following a "data-driven path" to reopening, did not respond to questions about the data that it's relying on.

But within the Trump administration, some officials aren't merely ignoring the warning signs. They're also selectively using scientific advice and models in their quest for a swift reopening. For instance, HHS Secretary Alex Azar warned during a recent Cabinet meeting that the US could see 65 000 additional "deaths of despair" if the country does not get back on track to normalcy soon. In reality, the study he cited explicitly warned against lifting lockdowns before health data showed it was safe to do so. "Some might use this report to argue that this is why our economy needs to open up fast. But that's NOT what we are saying," wrote the authors of the report, which was published by the American Academy of Family Physicians and Well Being Trust. "Even as of today parts of the country are opening, data suggest that this is premature due to a lack of consistent testing, which allows public health authorities to trace, treat, and isolate to prevent further spread."

Harvard University's Safra Center for Ethics similarly publicly chastised the administration. HHS used one of the center's testing models to suggest the US was already testing enough people to contain the virus -- when the center was arguing that testing is woefully inadequate to ensure a safe reemergence from "stay at home." "The Department's Report does not provide an accurate summary of the modeling supporting our recommendations," said the center's director, adding that HHS had cited a "nonprimary" model in the study's appendix and then adjusted the assumptions underpinning it.

The data challenges are making it even harder for the states to balance health and economic imperatives. In addition to pulling back from its historic role as the central health authority during public health crises, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established few firm standards for how states should monitor COVID-19 and made little overt effort to coordinate its messaging with state and local health departments.

That's created a patchwork system where key health information is collected and communicated with little uniformity, and amid rising concern over whether Americans are receiving reliable reports about the pandemic fight. At least a half-dozen states have admitted to inflating their testing figures by mixing 2 different types of tests into its totals, a practice widely derided as scientifically unsound.

In Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp has been among the strongest proponents of reopening, the inclusion of antibody tests inflated the state's overall testing count by nearly 78 000 -- a disclosure that came a few weeks after officials posted a chart of new confirmed cases in Georgia with the dates jumbled out of order, showing a downward trajectory. Like several other states, Georgia's health department began listing separate totals for its antibody and diagnostic test counts only after reporters discovered it had been quietly combining the 2.

Georgia's count of hospitalized coronavirus patients also includes only those who were already in the hospital when their diagnosis was reported to the state, a limitation that the state has openly admitted likely creates "an underestimation of actual hospitalizations." "It's going through political filters there in the same way that maybe we're seeing some information go through political filters at the federal level," said Harry Heiman, a professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health, of the state's coronavirus data. "It makes it really hard to know what's going on."

Florida has weathered a string of controversies over its evidence to support Gov. Ron DeSantis' boasts that the state is faring better than most, including an attempt to block access to information on nursing home deaths and the firing of a health department official who now alleges she was pushed out for refusing to manipulate the state's data. A separate dispute involved the health department's attempt to suppress the coronavirus death count published by Florida's medical examiners -- a figure that was initially higher than health officials' tally. "Never, before today, has the Department of Health raised an eyebrow that this information is confidential and privileged," said Stephen Nelson, the district medical examiner for Polk County, Florida. By the time the examiners' death toll was finally released almost 2 weeks later amid public pressure, the number was lower than the one published by the health department.

States led by Democratic governors haven't been immune from transparency questions either. New Jersey revised down its nursing home coronavirus death count by about 1400 after concluding it would only count those with a lab-confirmed diagnosis of the disease, a move a GOP state legislator called a "whitewash."

And Illinois briefly drew fire after it limited its public reporting on nursing home cases and deaths to only those with "active" outbreaks -- a decision that the state quickly reversed.

Nursing homes have been particularly weak on transparency, with state leaders trying to give the appearance of a blunted impact for older Americans. "Political leaders would like to trim their numbers, and a convenient way to do that is to count only those deaths that are proven by testing to involved COVID-19," said Joanne Lynn, a former geriatrician and current analyst at Altarum. Some officials within the Trump administration have embraced this approach amid skepticism over the rising national death toll.

Data suppression in nursing homes is a particularly hard blow in a sector that has historically struggled for transparency. In a Senate Aging Committee hearing last week [week of 18 May 2020], one expert noted: "Right now, [patients and caregivers] can't easily find which ones have COVID-19 outbreaks. We need to give them that information so they can make good decisions."

Those abrupt alterations make it more difficult to track the progression of the virus as the pandemic response fragments -- and to hold political leaders accountable for their decisions. "I have never seen politicians come in like this and question the science," said Melissa Marx, a public health professor at Johns Hopkins University and former CDC official. "In my mind, it's unprecedented." Yet unlike in past public health emergencies, the Trump administration has signaled little interest in overseeing how states combat the pandemic in this next phase, and what evidence they rely on to do it.

In response to questions about states manipulating and altering their coronavirus data, an HHS spokesperson told Politico that "state leaders have the clearest insights into the situation on the ground in their states, and we stand ready to provide support as states begin to reopen safely."

As for the CDC, the vaunted public health agency spent the past week under fire for its own data issues, after confirming it, too, was combining different types of tests in calculating the nation's testing totals. The CDC, which blamed the lapse on combined testing numbers reported by individual states, said it will break out figures for the different tests "in the coming weeks."

It's an environment that threatens to erode public trust, experts warn. "You want people to trust what authorities are telling them," said Jennifer Kates of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and that trust is going to be difficult to earn.

Data as reported by 26 May 2020 as of 11:59 PM (GMT+1)
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Situation update
Three months into the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the WHO African Region (when Algeria confirmed the 1st case on [25 Feb 2020]), all Member States have been affected, with Lesotho being the last to report a confirmed case on 13 May 2020. The COVID-19 incidence cases and associated deaths continue to rise, albeit with differential trends among countries. The region has been recording a daily case-count of more than 2000 in the past 3 weeks.

Since our last situation report on 20 May 2020 (External Situation Report 12), an additional 19 735 new confirmed COVID-19 cases (a 31% increase) were reported from 43 countries. During this period, 7 countries in the WHO African region observed the highest percentage increase in cases: South Sudan 186% (from 282 to 806 cases), Comoros 156% (from 34 to 87 cases), Mauritania 100% (from 131 to 262 cases), Ethiopia 92% (from 365 to 701 cases), Madagascar 80% (from 326 to 586 cases), Sao Tome and Principe 76% (from 251 to 441 cases), Central African Republic 59% (from 411 to 652 cases), and Cameroon 54% (from 3 529 to 5 436 cases). In the same reporting week, Namibia (4) and Mauritius (2) reported imported confirmed cases after 45 and 28 days of zero reporting, respectively. The reported cases were undergoing quarantine and had previously travelled from affected countries. Samples were collected in preparation for their discharge and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 21 and 24 May 2020, respectively. Seychelles and Eritrea have independently reported zero new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the past 49 and 37 days, respectively. Although Burundi and United Republic of Tanzania have had no new confirmed cases in our database in the last 18 and 10 days, respectively, there are no official reports indicating zero confirmed cases.

From 20 to 26 May 2020, 460 new deaths (25% increase) were reported from 30 countries: South Africa (212), Algeria (57), Nigeria (56), Cameroon (37), Mali (17), Sierra Leone (11), Niger (8), Democratic Republic of the Congo (7), Senegal (7), Chad (6), Mauritania (5), Equatorial Guinea (5), South Sudan (4), Congo (4), Sao Tome and Principe (3), Liberia (3), Gabon (2), Kenya (2), Guinea (2), Côte d'Ivoire (2), Central African Republic (1), Ethiopia (1), Mozambique (1), Malawi (1), Angola (1), Benin (1), Cabo Verde (1), Togo (1), Ghana (1), and Burkina Faso (1). Central African Republic and Mozambique recorded their 1st death during the reporting week. The region has registered 9713 new recoveries in this reporting period.

As of 26 May 2020, a cumulative total of 83 913 COVID-19 cases, including 83 722 confirmed and 191 probable cases have been reported across the 47 countries in the region. The probable cases have been reported in Sao Tome and Principe (146), Comoros (44), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (1). The 210 probable cases earlier reported from Benin were retested by polymerase chain reaction and all were negative for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 2278 deaths have been reported, giving an overall case fatality ratio (CFR) of 2.7%. 6 countries have not registered any COVID-19 related deaths since the beginning of the pandemic in the region: Eritrea, Seychelles, Lesotho, Namibia, Rwanda, and Uganda.

The current status in the region represents only 1.6% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 0.7% of deaths reported worldwide. Table 1 shows the list of affected countries and their respective number of cases and deaths. The daily and weekly distribution of cases by date and week of reporting are presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. On 21 May 2020, the region recorded its highest daily case count of 3 145 since the beginning of the outbreak. The 10 countries with the highest number of cases in the region include South Africa (24 264), Algeria (8697), Nigeria (8344), Ghana (6964), Cameroon (5436), Guinea (3358), Senegal (3 161), Cote d'Ivoire (2477), Democratic Republic of the Congo (2403), and Gabon (2238), which collectively account for 80% of all reported cases.

Of the 83 913 COVID-19 cases reported, 35 788 (43%) have recovered, with recoveries documented from 46 countries in the region, with 100% of cases in Eritrea (39) and Seychelles (11) recorded as recovered. Since the beginning of the outbreak, Algeria has consistently reported the highest weekly and cumulative mortality in the region, now at 617 (27%) deaths, followed by South Africa with 524 (22%). The other countries reporting high number of deaths are Nigeria 249 (11%), Cameroon 177 (7.7%), Mali 70 (3.1%), Democratic Republic of the Congo 67 (2.9%), Niger 63 (2.8%) and Chad 62 (2.7%). The highest case fatality ratios were observed in seven countries: Liberia (9.8%), Chad (8.9%), Algeria (7.1%), Niger (6.6), Mali (6.5), Burkina Faso (6.3%), and Sierra Leone (5.8%). Of these, Liberia, Chad, Algeria, Niger, and Mali have recorded case fatality ratios higher than that currently registered globally at 6.4%. Figure 3 shows the distribution of cases and deaths by week of notification in the 6 most affected countries.

Of concern, health workers have been greatly affected by COVID-19, with 2217 health workers being infected in 32 counties since the beginning of the outbreak. Overall, Nigeria has been the most affected, with 606 health workers infected, followed by South Africa (326), Niger (177), Cameroon (175), Ghana (126), Côte d'Ivoire (116), Sierra Leone (81), Zambia (80), Senegal (77), Democratic Republic of the Congo (63), Gabon (57), and Guinea-Bissau (54). The other 20 countries that recorded health worker infections are shown in Table 1.

Based on the available data on age and gender distribution (n=5091), the male to female ratio among confirmed cases is 1.8, and the median age is 44 years (range: 0-105). Males 3186 (63%) in the 31-39 and 40-49 age groups are more affected than females 1905 (37%) across the same age-groups. The distribution of cases by age and sex is presented in figure 4.

Currently, 25 countries in the region are experiencing community transmission, 15 have clusters of cases and 7 have sporadic cases of COVID-19. The region has also observed increased incidences of importation of cases from affected countries within the region, largely fueled by long-distance truck drivers and illicit movement through porous borders.

As of 26 May 2020, the number of cases in the African continent had surpassed 100 000 cases and is now at 118 717 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3 574 deaths (CFR 3.1%). The 118 717 cases include a total of 34 804 cases from the 7 countries in the WHO EMRO Region: Egypt (17 967), Morocco (7556), Sudan (3 976), Djibouti (2 468), Somalia (1711), Tunisia (1051), and Libya (75) and 83 913 cases from the WHO AFRO Region. Additionally, the 1287 deaths have been recorded from Egypt (783), Morocco (202), Sudan (170), Somalia (67), Tunisia (48), Djibouti (14), Libya (3) and 2278 from the AFRO region.

[An excellent overview of the situation in the African region. In the past few weeks, there have been border incidents with truck drivers crossing from Tanzania to Kenya, with mandatory testing at the border with 1-2 week waits before drivers are cleared to continue across the border. In the report above there is no mention of childhood infections. Looking at Figure 4 (at the source URL above), there have been reported cases in the less than 5 year-olds, the 5-9-year-olds, and the 10-19-year-olds, albeit significantly less than the older age groups beginning with 20-29-year-olds. Healthcare workers have accounted for 2.6% of the reported cases. - Mod.MPP]

[5] WHO situation report 129 (as of 28 May 2020)
Date: Thu 28 May 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200528-covid-19-sitrep-129.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 28 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published an interim guidance on the clinical management of COVID-19. This guidance document is intended for clinicians caring for COVID-19 patients during all phases of their disease (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-covid-19).

- WHO has published an interim guidance on ethical considerations to guide the use of digital proximity tracking technologies for COVID-19 contact tracing. This document provides guidance to policy-makers and other stakeholders about the ethical and appropriate use of digital proximity tracking technologies for COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/WHO-2019-nCoV-Ethics_Contact_tracing_apps-2020.1).

- WHO Regional Director for the Americas, Dr Carissa F Etienne said the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Region of the Americas must include chronic disease care, as 1 in 4 people are at increased risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to underlying noncommunicable diseases (https://www.paho.org/en/news/26-5-2020-paho-director-says-fight-against-covid-19-pandemic-must-include-chronic-disease-care).

- In today's 'subject in focus' below, key changes in the Clinical Management Guidance for COVID19 are explored.).

Subject in focus: clinical case management
------------------------------------------
The updated Clinical Management Guidance for COVID-19 was published on 27 May 2020.This guidance has been significantly expanded to ensure quality care and meet the needs of frontline clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-covid-19).

The guidance was updated with the following new sections: the COVID-19 care pathway, treatment of acute and chronic infections, management of neurological and mental manifestations, noncommunicable diseases, rehabilitation, palliative care, ethical principles, and reporting of death. The remaining sections have been substantially expanded.

- One of the key changes in the guidance is the recommendation to discontinue transmission-based precautions (including isolation) and release from the COVID-19 care pathway for symptomatic patients 10 days after symptom onset, plus an additional 3 days without symptoms (without fever and respiratory symptoms). In addition, it is important to note that, limited, published and pre-published information provides estimates on viral shedding of up to 9 days for mild patients and up to approximately 3 weeks in hospitalized patients. There are also reports that patients can remain consistently polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for many weeks, or even test PCR positive days/weeks after a negative test, though preliminary evidence suggests that this is not infectious virus.

- Treatment of acute co-infections:
-- For suspected or confirmed mild COVID-19 cases, the use of antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis should not be used.
-- For suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-19 cases, antibiotics should not be prescribed unless there is clinical suspicion of a bacterial infection.

- Prevention of complications:
-- In patients (adults and adolescents) hospitalized with COVID-19, pharmacological prophylaxis should be used, such as low molecular weight heparin (such as enoxaparin), according to local and international standards, to prevent venous thromboembolism, when not contraindicated. For those with contraindications, use mechanical prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression devices).

Importantly, key previous recommendations that remain are:
- WHO recommends that the listed drugs including antivirals, immunomodulators, and other adjunctive therapies should not be administered as treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19, outside the context of clinical trials.
- WHO recommends against the routine use of systemic corticosteroids for treatment of viral pneumonia.
