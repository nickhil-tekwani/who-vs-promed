[West Nile fever a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the West Nile fever virus (WNV) which is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication.

The WNV has been reported across Tunisia especially in the coastal and Southern areas of the country. The 1st human West Nile disease (WND) epidemic in Tunisia was reported in 1997, but serological evidence of WNV circulation has been documented as early as 1968. A major WNV epidemic with cases of meningitis and meningoencephalitis was recorded in 2012, with 86 cases and 6 deaths. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152704).

Currently, surveillance in Tunisia is based on 3 components:
1. monitoring of human meningitis and meningoencephalitis cases (ONMNE 2013);
2. monitoring of clinical equine encephalitis cases based on the passive reporting of any suspicion of encephalitis within the framework of the integrated network monitoring of rabies (not systematic);
3. passive surveillance of the circulation of WNV in birds based on the monitoring of avian mortality integrated into the avian influenza surveillance network.

For the entomological component, no continuous monitoring is performed in the risk areas, with the exception of some investigations carried out after human outbreaks (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152704).

A multisectoral surveillance system for WNV is required, which should aim to provide early alerts to health authorities in order to adopt timely and effective measures to prevent the spread of the infection among animals and humans. - Mod.UBA
