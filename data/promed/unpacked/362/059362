Abstract:
We report molecular evidence of Tula virus infection in an immunocompetent patient from Germany who had typical signs of hantavirus disease. Accumulating evidence indicates that Tula virus infection, although often considered nonpathogenic, represents a threat to human health.

Hantavirus disease, also called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, is a zoonosis; hantaviruses are transmitted from their reservoirs (rodents) to humans. The clinical course is characterized by initial high fever and body pain, potentially proceeding to renal, pulmonary failure, or both. The case-fatality rate depends on the causal virus species and can reach up to 50% (1).

Tula virus (TULV), a member of the family Hantaviridae, genus _Orthohantavirus_, has been isolated from common voles (_Microtus arvalis_) (2). TULV, a broadly distributed virus in different parts of Eurasia, is hosted by common voles but has also been found in related vole species (3). Clinical findings of TULV pathogenicity are very rare. In 2003, a case of TULV-associated hantavirus disease was diagnosed by serologic and molecular epidemiologic means (4). So far, direct molecular evidence for TULV infection has only been found in 2 cases (one in an immunocompromised patient [in the Czech Republic] who had severe hantavirus disease (5), the other in an immunocompetent person [in France] without preexisting illness who had mild hantavirus disease (6)).

We report molecular evidence of TULV infection in a 21-year-old immunocompetent man who originated from a small village near Hamburg, northern Germany. He was admitted to hospital for sudden fever, sickness, severe headache, abdominal pain, and limb pain since the day before. His medical history was unremarkable. The patient worked as a sanitary and heating engineer in the northern part of Germany. Except for elevated body temperature, the physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Blood testing at the day of admission revealed thrombocytopenia (63 platelets/nL), markedly elevated C-reactive protein (63.6 mg/L), and borderline leukocyte (9.8 cells/nL) and serum creatinine (1.2 mg/dL) values. Because of biochemical signs of infection, ultrasound findings of a moderate enlargement of spleen and cervical lymph nodes as well as hints of a small lung infiltration, an antibiotic regime (ampicillin/sulbactam and clarithromycin) was initiated. Over the next few days, the fever resolved.

At day 4, biochemical signs of disturbed retention function indicated acute kidney injury. An enhanced serum creatinine value (1.6 mg/dL) and impaired (59 mL/min) glomerular filtration rate (GFR), determined using the CKD-EPI method, were noted; thrombocytopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein level persisted. The GFR, determined using the cystatin method, as measured at day 5, was reduced to 48 mL/min. The patient did not observe signs of oliguria. Under calculated intravenous fluid intake, the creatinine, GFR, and platelet values normalized until day 8, and the C-reactive protein declined to 12.1 mg/L. The patient was discharged from hospital at day 8 in good general condition.

Initial laboratory diagnostics were based on hantavirus serologic test results (on day 4 of hospitalization) using the Hantavirus Profile 1 immunoblot (Euroimmun, https://www.euroimmun.com). This assay does not contain TULV antigen, but the patient's serum showed strong IgG reactivity with Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), Hantaan virus (HTNV), and Puumala virus (PUUV) antigens as well as strong band intensity on PUUV in the IgM assay. The recomLine HantaPlus IgG and IgM assays (Mikrogen, https://www.mikrogen.de) revealed strong IgG reactivity to PUUV and in the IgM blot strong band intensities on PUUV, Sin Nombre virus, and DOBV. On the basis of these serologic findings, a PUUV infection of the patient was suspected.

At day 5, serum was obtained for molecular virus detection. Using the primers of the Pan Hanta PCR (7), a 392-nt long region of the large genome segment was amplified and sequenced. The molecular phylogenetic analysis of the large segment sequence demonstrated TULV, but not PUUV, infection of the patient. Within the phylogenetic tree, the new sequence (named H18045/Winsen/19 and deposited in GenBank under accession no. MT993951) clustered with vole-derived TULV sequences from Germany and, in a more refined analysis, with those from the central north (CEN.N) clade, which consists of sequences from the northern, eastern, and central parts of the country (Figure).

Previous studies from northeast Germany have shown that TULV is able to infect humans. Out of 563 serum samples from forest workers investigated, 22 samples (3.9%) reacted exclusively with TULV diagnostic antigen (8). In a survey of 6537 serum samples representing the average population of Germany, one sample showed its highest neutralizing titer to TULV compared with PUUV, DOBV, HTNV, and Seoul virus (9).

A reason for the rare finding of TULV-associated hantavirus disease might be the close genetic and antigenic relationship to another vole-associated hantavirus, PUUV, which is carried by bank voles (_Myodes glareolus_) and is a well-known pathogenic agent broadly distributed in Europe and parts of Asia (1). Because anti-TULV and anti-PUUV seroreactivities cannot be distinguished using the usual serologic techniques (i.e., without neutralization assays) (2,10), TULV infections might be misdiagnosed as PUUV infections during routine diagnostics.

The ability of TULV to cause hantavirus disease even in a previously healthy person shows the pathogenic potential of this virus. Therefore, the vole species hosting TULV should be considered as infection sources in their respective geographic ranges. Because of the broad distribution (https://www.iucnredlist.org/search?query%20=%20microtus&searchType%20=%20species) and mass reproduction of common voles in several parts of Europe, TULV should be considered as a threat to human health.

[Since cases of TULV human infection have been found elsewhere in Europe (France and the Czech Republic) and the rodent host is widely distributed, it is not surprising that a human case has been documented in northern Germany. In response to cases in Turkey, Dr. Jan Clement provided extensive comments on TULV in ProMED post Hantavirus - Europe (04): Turkey, comment 20190815.6623044 that is reproduced below.

"re: ProMED Hantavirus - Turkey 20190808.6611838
------------------------------------------------------
If one of the 4 novel hantaviruses recently found in Turkey, namely Tula hantavirus (TULV) Palandoken indeed causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), as mentioned in the statement of Professor Mehmet Ali Oktem of Dokuz Eylul University's Medical Virology Department, this would be highly interesting, because the pathogenicity of TULV is still a matter of debate.

The recent confirmation by RT-PCR of a TULV-induced HFRS case in France [1], confirms the pathogenicity of this arvicolid hantavirus, a fact not generally acknowledged yet, or at least still contested [2]. The clinical presentation of the French TULV HFRS case was, however, unusual: besides the classic fever with thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminases, leukopenia instead of leukocytosis with left shift was found, and the renal function remained strictly within normal limits. However, renal involvement was nevertheless indicated by transient microscopic haematuria. Regrettably, transient but massive and unselective proteinuria, the renal hallmark in probably all hantavirus infections, was once more not mentioned. Interestingly, a false-positive serological screening result for another arvicolid hantavirus, Puumala virus (PUUV), was obtained in 3 assays of 2 different formats (immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and ELISA), but could not be confirmed by routine RT-PCR, that is, by using PUUV-specific primers [1]. As subsequently shown by Reynes et al., TULV and PUUV are 2 closely related, yet genetically distinct, hantavirus species, both carried by distinct voles of the Arvicolinae, a subfamily of the Cricetidae rodent family [1].

Consequently, it is important to remember that the classic TULV rodent reservoir, the common vole (_Microtus arvalis_), is present throughout most of western Europe, except Fennoscandia and the British Isles, but with a presence on the Orkney Islands. The common vole is also present in northern and even central Spain. This means in serological practice that an HFRS-like infection in Fennoscandia and/or the British Isles, documented by standard IFA and/or ELISA to be IgM-positive for PUUV, could thus (until recently) readily be accepted as a true PUUV infection, given the complete absence of common voles in the area. However, the same conclusion is not so evident for a PUUV-positive HFRS case in the rest of north-western Europe, where even strong positive serological results for PUUV could in fact point to a TULV infection spread by common voles, as exemplified by this French case. This is valid also for northern and central Spain, northern Italy, and the Balkan Peninsula.

Things become even more complex when the geographical spread of the field vole (_Microtus agrestis_) is also considered. Indeed, its habitat, much more extensive than that of its cousin _M. arvalis_, includes the whole of Europe except Ireland and Mediterranean countries. Several reports mention the presence of a TULV-like agent in field voles; the most recent example is Tatenale virus, the 1st biomolecularly proven arvicolid hantavirus in the United Kingdom, characterised in a field vole in northwestern England. Like TULV, it provoked false-positive PUUV reactions in serology [3]. Finally, a TULV-like agent has also been documented in the Eurasian water vole (_Arvicola amphibius_, formerly _Arvicola terrestris_), which has the same extensive European spread as the field vole; infection with this virus therefore has the same potential of yielding PUUV-like serological cross-reactions [4]. Moreover, this novel TULV-like agent has already been found to infect asymptomatic forest workers, even in non-endemic areas of eastern Germany [5].

In summary, in western Europe, including Fennoscandia and mainland England, an ELISA-and/or IFA-positive result for PUUV does not automatically mean a true PUUV infection, as now convincingly shown [1]. Few isolated European HFRS case reports, and virtually no national European or Russian PUUV seroprevalence studies, have so far excluded this possibility. Northern Ireland, where none of the above vole species are present, remains a noticeable arvicolid-free exception [6]. Admittedly, all this bears little practical clinical significance for physicians treating a suspected PUUV case, since TULV infections seem even milder than their PUUV counterpart. In fact, it is even likely that a prior PUUV infection, subclinical or not, might confer at least partial, but probably life-long cross-immunoprotection against its cousin-pathogen TULV [7].

Consequently, a more detailed description of the clinical symptoms of the TULV-induced Turkish case can be of utmost interest, as would be the exact specification of its rodent carrier.

The new TULV human case in Germany underscores an important point that Dr. Clement makes: TULV infections may be misdiagnosed as closely related PUUV infections. The potential for misdiagnosis will not be resolved until routine laboratory tests are done to differentiate between them. - Mod.TY
