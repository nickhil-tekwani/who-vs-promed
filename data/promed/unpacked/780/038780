It is now broadly accepted that virulent APMV-1 viruses generally arise in
poultry by mutation of viruses of low virulence after these viruses have
been introduced into poultry flocks (Alexander DJ, British Poultry Science
42, 5-22, 2001). Since this ND virus reported from Victoria is almost
identical to the 1999 Mangrove Mountain isolate, then it appears more than
a remote probability that the same precursor virus (so-called Peat's Ridge
strain) may have been present in these Victorian flocks for some time and a
very similar mutation event has resulted in this virulent virus. This
raises further questions regarding the distribution of such precursor
viruses in Australia.

For countries or regions claiming ND freedom, this outbreak again
underlines the need for continuous serosurveillance of poultry flocks with
immediate epidemiological investigation (including attempts to isolate and
classify any APMV-1 viruses circulating) at the first sign of
seroconversion in flocks.

[Newcastle disease virus is a notoriously variable virus. Strains of
Newcastle disease virus differ widely in virulence, depending on the
cleavability and activation of their hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion
membrane proteins. Avirulent strains produce inactive precursor proteins,
whereas in virulent strains the precursor proteins are cleaved and
activated readily. Since the spread of infection is dependent on cleavage
occurring in the same tissue in which replication occurs, the presence of
specific cellular proteases as well as the inherent cleavability of the
surface glycoprotein precursors determines the tissue tropism of virus
strains and their ability to spread rapidly. This is the basis for the
definition of strains of Newcastle disease virus as velogenic (or
viscerotropic), mesogenic, or lentogenic for strains of high, intermediate,
or low virulence, respectively. A consequence of this is that the number of
mutational steps between avirulence and high virulence may be quite small,
and as Howard Pharo suggests, strains of high virulence could potentially
arise independently from the same (or a closely related) precursor virus of
low virulence. Consequently, this should be taken into consideration in any
disease surveillance programme. A possible complicating factor, however, is
that the source of the precursor viruses may not be domestic poultry. - Mod.CP]
