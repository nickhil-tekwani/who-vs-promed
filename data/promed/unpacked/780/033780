Twin sisters, aged 4, died of acute encephalitis syndrome in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district within hours of each other, a senior doctor said here on Tuesday [28 Apr 2020].

The girls, daughters of a labourer from Musahari block of the district, succumbed to the disease at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) on Monday [27 Apr 2020], its Superintendent S K Shahi said. They were admitted to the government hospital on [24 Apr 2020], he said.

The Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital reported 120 deaths due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) or "brain fever" last year [2019].

On 29 Mar [2020], a 3-year-old boy, hailing from Sakra block of the district, had also died of the disease at SKMCH.

This year [2020], 14 children with AES have so far been admitted to the medical facility, Of them, 8 children have recovered, and 3 are undergoing treatment at the pediatric intensive care unit of the hospital, Shahi said.

Children afflicted with AES often tend to develop hypoglycemia, which leads to a sudden drop in glucose level. The disease has been arguably linked to consumption of unripe litchis, grown in abundance in north Bihar. Medical experts had last year [2019] blamed the high number of fatalities on the inordinate delay in administering glucose to the afflicted children.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, during review meetings held recently to take stock of the coronavirus situation, repeatedly stressed the need to stay prepared for AES, Japanese encephalitis (JE), swine fever, and bird flu.

[The AES and Japanese encephalitis season is beginning in Bihar state as it has done annually for many years. The case count in the SKMCH is now up to 14. There is no indication of whether any of the 14 cases mentioned above were tested for Japanese encephalitis virus infection. AES is a common ailment in children in northeastern India, especially in Bihar state.

The issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The above report does not indicate whether any of the above etiologies have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is just beginning, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 6-7 months. - Mod.TY
