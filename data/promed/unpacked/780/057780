An outbreak of Q fever has been registered in Gabrovo. This was announced at the briefing on coronavirus [COVID-19] by the national health inspector Prof. Todor Kantardzhiev. More than 20 people in the area tested positive for Q fever and were initially tested for coronavirus.

The cases are in the villages of Kramolin, Lovni dol, and Sabotkovtsi; only yesterday [18 May 2020] 14 cases with PCR test were registered there. The patients are veterinarians and staff of 2 cow farms and one sheep farm. "The doctors first looked for coronavirus because of their temperature, but not only the coronavirus causes high fever," Kanatrdzhiev said.

He assured that the necessary measures will be taken to limit the infection. Q fever is a disease that is mainly transmitted through domestic animals (cattle, sheep, and goats), and the disease is present in all their bodily products (milk, feces, etc.). In about 50% of sick people, the disease has a clinical manifestation. It is a fever lasting 1-2 weeks, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and more. Deaths in humans are rare -- less than 2% -- and after illness the body builds long-term immunity.

[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle.

Q fever is a zoonosis. Although it has a wide and diverse host range, in animals this organism is primarily known as a cause of reproductive losses in domesticated ruminants. Clinical cases seem to be most significant in sheep and goats, with sporadic losses and occasional outbreaks that may affect up to 50-90% of the herd. Infected animals can be difficult to recognize: nonpregnant animals do not seem to have any obvious clinical signs, and seropositivity is not always correlated with shedding of the bacteria. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms, often when they are exposed to an animal that had aborted but also if birth was at term and seemed normal. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.

Q fever is frequently an occupationally acquired illness; people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants, or farms. - Mod.LL

Q fever is an OIE-listed zoonotic disease of animals and is a notifiable animal disease in Bulgaria according to the national legislation. The last outbreak reported to the OIE from Bulgaria dates back to December 2014; it affected cattle in the province Veliko Tarnovo. The Bulgarian State Veterinary Services maintains serosurveillance for Q fever in cattle; the planned surveillance for the period 2016-2018, with earlier data, is presented in Ref 1 (in Bulgarian). Additional information on the disease in Bulgaria's human population (2011-2017) is included in Ref 2.
