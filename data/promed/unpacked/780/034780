Summary
A total of 15 145 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 6 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States of America) and 2 previously affected countries (Nigeria and Senegal) up to the end of 16 Nov [2014]. There have been 5420 reported deaths. Cases and deaths continue to be under-reported in this outbreak.

In the 3 countries with widespread and intense transmission, reported case incidence is no longer increasing nationally in Guinea and Liberia but is still increasing in Sierra Leone. The outbreaks in Guinea and Liberia now appear to be driven by intense transmission in several key districts, whereas transmission is intense throughout the north and west of Sierra Leone. The number of new cases is highest in N'Zerekore in Guinea [the 2nd largest city in Guinea by population, after the capital Conakry and the largest city in the Guinee Forestiere region of south-eastern Guinea. - Mod.JW]; Montserrado in Liberia [the county where the capital, Monrovia, is located. - Mod.JW]; and in the western and northern areas of Sierra Leone, particularly the capital, Freetown, and nearby Port Loko. Lofa in Liberia, and Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone have now reported no or a very low number of new cases for several weeks.

In Mali, there have been 6 reported confirmed and probable cases and 5 deaths. The most recent cases have occurred in the Malian capital Bamako and are not related to the country's 1st EVD-positive patient, who died on 24 Oct 2014. All identified contacts connected with this initial case have now completed 21-day follow-up.

The response to the EVD outbreak continues to evolve in the 3 most affected countries. Over 1000 beds are now operational in 18 Ebola Treatment Centres. As this number increases, so does the capacity to isolate patients and prevent further transmission of the disease. The capacity to conduct burials in a safe and dignified manner of patients who have died from EVD is a crucial part of halting EVD transmission. More than 4800 safe and dignified burials have taken place since the outbreak began. Accurate, timely laboratory diagnosis of EVD cases is also an integral part of the response. Samples from all 53 EVD-affected districts of the 3 most-affected countries can be transported to a laboratory for testing within 24 hours of sample collection... - more

[Transported to a laboratory for testing within 24 hours of sample collection presumably means results will be transmitted by telephone within 48 hours, so that suspected cases with negative tests will not have to be kept in hospital longer than that, taking up bed space. This is a considerable advance, 1st reported in last week's WHO sitrep. - Mod.JW]

[2] Sierra Leone: Cuban doctor tests positive, evacuated to Switzerland

A Cuban doctor treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the disease and was being sent to Geneva for treatment, officials said, the 1st Cuban known to have contracted the potentially deadly hemorrhagic fever.

The doctor ... is one of 165 Cuban doctors and nurses treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. They have been there since early October [2014].

They are part of a Cuban team of 256 medical professionals sent to West Africa to treat patients in the worst Ebola outbreak on record that has killed more than 5000 people.

[3] Liberia gaining, Sierra Leone losing

Ebola continues to ravage West Africa, killing hundreds of people per week and showing no signs of slowing down in Sierra Leone, where new cases continue to emerge. At the same time, Liberia has seen its rate of infection and death toll slow markedly in recent weeks, turning the nation that was not long ago the epicenter of the Ebola epidemic into an emerging symbol of tenuous hope. The most recent Ebola statistics out of Liberia suggest that the outbreak, the deadliest in the history of the virus, can be stopped. But they also raise the question of just what the country has done differently than Sierra Leone, which shows no similar signs of progress.

As of 12 Nov 2014, Sierra Leone had seen 5368 reported cases of Ebola, while Liberia had experienced 6822 and Guinea 1878, according to the World Health Organization. But the situation is most critical in Sierra Leone, the only one of the 3 countries where cases are "still increasing," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [US CDC].

The 1st week of November [2014] saw 435 new Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, and about 24 percent of cases there since the outbreak began were reported in the 3 weeks preceding 7 Nov 2014, the WHO said earlier this month [November 2014], according to USA Today.

Meanwhile, Liberia has seen a major falloff in new Ebola cases, with only about 50 emerging per day, versus 500 per day at its peak, the Daily Beast reported on Mon [17 Nov 2014]. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf issued a statement Thu [13 Nov 2013] announcing the end of the official state of emergency in her country, signaling her confidence in the gains that have been made there.

The recent success in Liberia arose from a synergy of factors and circumstances, including the amount of money and professionals that have poured into the country and the efforts of the nation's government and populace to slow its spread. The U.S. military also has thousands of troops on the ground in Liberia, where it is building a series of hospitals and treatment centers to aid in the fight against the epidemic.

"I'm cautiously optimistic about the declining case numbers in Liberia, which attests to the fact that U.S. efforts to augment local capacity are starting to pay dividends. Ebola treatment units, training of healthcare workers, and more rapid testing all likely are playing a role in Liberia's improving situation," Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Center for Health Security, said. In contrast, failed anti-Ebola efforts in Sierra Leone have left the country more susceptible to the disease and allowed it to spread more quickly and efficiently. The country lacks resources, funding and people to roll out an effective, comprehensive and expensive relief apparatus.

"Liberia seems to have enough beds for patients, while Sierra Leone does not," John Lyon, CEO of World Hope International, a nonprofit relief and development organization, said. "In addition to the lack of beds, it is the lack of clean water and ambulances that are also negatively impacting Ebola cases in Sierra Leone." No county in the nation remains untouched by Ebola, and the Sierra Leonian government and aid groups have had less success instituting best containment practices there than in Liberia, according to Adalja. "There have been reports of healthcare worker strikes in Sierra Leone as well as some reluctance of people to present for treatment that may be compounding Sierra Leone's situation," he said... - more

[4] Liberia: One in 2 workers now jobless

Nearly half of all Liberians who were employed when the Ebola outbreak began are no longer working, a survey by the World Bank has found. It said many workers have been told to stay at home or have lost their jobs, while markets have been forced to shut. Earlier, a World Bank economist said the Ebola outbreak was expected to cost the region about USD 3-4 billion (GBP1.9-2.5 billion)... - more
