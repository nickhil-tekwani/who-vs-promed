Bird flu hits 2 more Thai provinces
------------------------------------
A deadly strain of bird flu has broken out in 2 more provinces in northern
Thailand, bringing to 8 the number of provinces affected by the disease, a
senior official said Thursday.
"We detected the virus during our re-examination of every part of the
country," Saravudh Suvannababba of the National Avian Influenza Center told
AFP.
In the northeastern province of Nong Khai, along the Laos border, the virus
was found in the districts of Thabor and Sri Chiang Mai, where 208 chickens
had died of the disease, he said.
Another 73 of the birds were culled to prevent the disease from spreading,
he added. Bird flu was also detected in Pichit province, about 350
kilometers (215 miles) north of Bangkok, where 20 chickens died of the
disease and 27 more were culled.
Thailand has been under high alert for bird flu since the deadly H5N1
strain of the virus was detected in chickens and fighting cocks in the
provinces of Nakhon Pathom, Nakhon Sawan, Phitsanulok, Rayong and
Uttaradit. The disease was also detected in pigeons in the central Thai
province of Uthai Thani, where more than 400 pigeons were culled.
12 people have died in Thailand from the virus that has swept Asia since
December 2003. Another 33 people have died in nearby Vietnam.
Thailand's cabinet has endorsed 4.8-billion-baht (124.7-million-dollar)
scheme to fight bird flu.

Vietnam Is Seeking International Assistance to Fight Bird Flu
---------------------------------------------------
Vietnam appealed for international assistance late Wednesday [2 Feb 2005]
evening as bird flu continued to spread among people and poultry alike.
Acting Agriculture Minister Cao Duc Phat, the chairman of the national
steering committee for avian influenza, sent a letter to the World Health
Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization asking those 2
United Nations agencies, as well as foreign governments, to provide
technical aid for fighting the disease. The A(H5N1) strain of the virus has
devastated poultry in Vietnam and killed 13 of the 14 people who were
infected in the last 5 weeks.
Anton M. Rychener, the F.A.O.'s chief representative in Vietnam, said the
country's officials wanted help from foreign epidemiologists, pathologists,
toxicologists, veterinarians and lab technicians, as well as lab equipment
for diagnosing the disease. Vietnam has lifted the many restrictions it
imposed on the much more limited foreign assistance it accepted during a
bird flu outbreak a year ago, he said.
Flu experts have warned that if the virus develops the capacity to pass
readily from person to person, it could cause a global influenza pandemic.
But they have also acknowledged that such a development is impossible to
predict.
Bui Quang Anh, the director general of Vietnam's department of animal
health, confirmed that Vietnam was seeking international assistance. The
vice director of the department, To Long Thanh, said blood tests on ducks
in Vietnam had shown the virus to be increasingly widespread in small farms
where poultry is often close to people.
"The virus is somehow stronger and more virulent," Mr. Thanh said.
Mr. Anh said the government was considering a plan to shut down all duck
breeding quickly, with a gradual halt by June to the keeping of ducks, the
main poultry industry in southern Vietnam. The industry would then be
restarted using more sanitary conditions to prevent infections of poultry
and people.
Vietnam wants international advice on how to do this, Mr. Anh added. On
Monday, Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, ordered the immediate slaughter
of the estimated 210 000 ducks being raised within the city limits and
banned farmers from bringing any more live ducks into the city.
Avian influenza has re-emerged as a problem in Thailand, where birds have
died from the disease in 6 provinces this winter and where 12 of 17
infected people died last winter before the disease faded away with warmer
weather in late spring. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has made avian
influenza and Muslim unrest in southern Thailand his top 2 issues ahead of
parliamentary elections on Sunday, as the tsunami has been less of a
partisan issue.
Vietnam's Health Ministry confirmed on Wednesday that a Cambodian woman who
crossed the border last Thursday and died on Sunday at a hospital in
Vietnam had tested positive for bird flu, making Cambodia the 2nd country
where human cases have arisen this year.
In interviews here and in neighboring Hatay Province over the past 3 days,
veterinarians, doctors, farmers and market vendors had varying assessments
of whether the spread of the avian influenza virus was worse than it was
last winter. Some are very worried.
"The disease is spreading too quickly," said Nguyen Huy Dang, the chief
veterinarian of Hatay Province. "We all recognize how dangerous bird flu
is, because the virus keeps evolving." But other experts question whether
the risks have increased.
The rate of confirmed human cases this winter, 2 or 3 a week, is similar to
the rate last winter, said Dr. Peter Horby, a W.H.O. epidemiologist.
There was one case of probable human-to-human transmission in Thailand in
August 2004, and 2 clusters of cases in families in Vietnam since late
December 2004 are now under investigation. But most cases still appear to
be caused by close personal contact with live, infected poultry.
Many of the human victims of bird flu this winter, as last winter, have
been treated at the Tropical Disease Institute here, which is an elite
hospital by Vietnamese standards but spartan and with limited equipment by
Western standards.
Dr. Nguyen Thi Tuong Van, the deputy director of the emergency department
and the head of bird flu treatment, said local labs were unable to analyze
samples quickly to determine whether patients had bird flu.
Getting lab results can take up to a week even though the test itself only
takes 6 or 7 hours, Dr. Van said, sitting in the hospital reception hall,
where an enormous Buddhist altar of carved tropical woods is covered with
roses, bananas and other offerings left by family members of patients.
Faster analysis of samples, if Western countries donate lab equipment and
technicians, would help the hospital decide whom to isolate and when to
provide family members of patients with medicine in case they had also been
exposed to the disease, Dr. Van said.
Even more important, she said, is an immediate effort to understand how the
disease spreads. Vietnamese doctors are still struggling to understand why
some people contract the disease while many others in contact with the same
infected poultry are not affected.
