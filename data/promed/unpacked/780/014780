A parasitic worm infection, once thought to only be found in cows, has shown up in a 2nd person in just 2 years, and it has experts worried that it may be on the rise in the US.

The worm in question, known to scientists as _Thelazia gulosa_, or "cattle eye worm" is transmitted by face flies, which pick up _T. gulosa_ after feeding on the lacrimal secretions (aka, the solution that lubricates the eyeball) of cattle, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From there, the cattle eye worms invade the fly's mouthparts, until it feeds again, typically depositing _T. gulosa_ into the 2nd host's conjunctival sac in the eye, where they continue to grow.

The 1st-ever case report of the infection was published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 2018, after a 26-year-old woman from Oregon felt irritation in her left eye and the feeling of a foreign object. Eventually, 14 worms were removed from the patient's eye over the course of 20 days.

Now, the 2nd case report, published Thursday [7 Nov 2019] in Clinical Infectious Diseases, tells the same story, this time of a 68-year-old woman who likely picked up the infection on a run in California while swatting flies away from her face. "She recalls swatting the flies from her face and spitting them out of her mouth," the case report says.

The woman 1st noticed irritation in her eye, like the woman in the 1st case report, in early March 2018. Upon irrigating her eye, the patient ended up removing 2 transparent, moving roundworms. The next day, an ophthalmologist removed a 3rd worm, and, a few weeks later, a 4th and final worm was removed. After that, the patient's conjunctivitis resolved.

The worm collected by the ophthalmologist was sent to the California State Public Health laboratory and later to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Parasitic Diseases Reference Laboratory, where it was identified as an adult female _T. gulosa_, or cattle eye worm.

Fortunately, both patients recovered from the infection. But the _T. gulosa_ can cause complications. "Occasionally, the worms migrate across the surface of the eye and cause corneal scarring, opacity, and blindness," the 1st case report says.

The most puzzling part of these cases -- aside from 2 women pulling multiple live worms out of their eyes -- is the increased prevalence of the worms showing up in humans. "The reasons for this species only now infecting humans remains obscure," according to the most recent case report.

Still, the report acknowledges that the 2nd case of the infection in the United States could be bad news. "That a 2nd human infection with _T. gulosa_ has occurred within 2 years of the 1st suggests that this may represent an emerging zoonotic disease in the United States," according to the case report. To that end, researchers said these infections in humans require monitoring to identify any further cases. "So, if you feel any irritation in your eye paired with something that feels worm-like, get it checked out, not just for you, but for the public."

Whether _Thelazia gulosa_ is emerging as a human pathogen or the findings are simply a coincidence is too early to tell. - Mod.EP
