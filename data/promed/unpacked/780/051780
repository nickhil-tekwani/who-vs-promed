[1] WHO media summary
Date: Tue 24 Sep 2019

https://guardian.ng/news/who-alerts-to-measles-outbreak-in-nigeria-others-2/


The World Health Organisation (WHO) has alerted to [a] major and ongoing outbreak of measles in Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Philippines, South Sudan, Sudan and Thailand. The latest preliminary reports, published yesterday [23 Sep 2019] by the WHO, warned that [the] measles outbreak continues to spread rapidly around the world with millions of people globally at risk of the disease.

According to the health body, in the first 6 months of 2019, reported measles cases are the highest they have been in any year since 2006, with [the] outbreak straining healthcare systems and leading to serious illness, disability, and deaths in many parts of the world.

There have been almost 3 times as many cases reported to date in 2019 as there were at this same time last year [2018]. This follows successive yearly increase[s] since 2016, indicating a concerning and continuing upsurge in the overall measles burden worldwide.

According to the WHO, for the period of 1 Jan through 31 Jul 2019, 182 countries reported 364 808 measles cases. For this same period last year [2018], 129 239 measles cases were reported from 181 countries. For the current 2019 period, the WHO African Region has recorded a 900% (that is a 10-fold increase), the European Region 120% (more than 2-fold increase), the Eastern Mediterranean Region 50% (1.5-fold increase), and the Western Pacific Region 230% (a 3-fold increase); the South-East Asia Region and the Region of the Americas each saw a 15% decrease in reported cases.

The WHO said that the largest outbreak in Nigeria and others was due to low measles vaccination coverage, currently or in the past, which has left large numbers of people vulnerable to the disease. At the same time, protracted outbreaks are occurring even in countries with high national vaccination rates. This results from inequities in vaccine coverage, and gaps and disparities between communities, geographic areas, and among age-groups. When enough people who are not immune are exposed to measles, it can very quickly spread.

According to the report, the reasons for people not being vaccinated vary significantly between communities and countries, including lack of access to quality healthcare or vaccination services, conflict and displacement, misinformation about vaccines, or low awareness about the need to vaccinate.

[3] Summary: Vaccination rates in major cities across the USA
Date: Thu 26 Sep 2019
Source: ABC Eyewitness News [edited]
https://abc7chicago.com/health/measles-returns-investigating-vaccination-rates/5549336/


Investigative teams at ABC-owned television stations across the country analyzed local measles vaccination rates and found local schools in communities nationwide that are below what's considered the community or "herd" immunity rate. According to the World Health Organization, 93% to 95% of people in a population need to be vaccinated against measles to make sure the rest of a population is safe from the highly contagious disease.

[4] DRC
Date: Wed 25 Sep 2019

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/measles-kills-3600-children-drc-third-emergency-vaccine-drive/


Almost a million children will be vaccinated against measles in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in a bid to stem the world's largest outbreak of this deadly disease.

The devastating childhood illness has killed 3667 children and infected close to 184 000 people already this year [2019] in the DRC -- a country that is also battling to control Ebola.

On Wednesday [25 Sep 2019], the government initiated the 3rd mass vaccination campaign -- in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) , Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and Unicef -- in an effort to bring the enormous measles outbreak to a close.

The epidemic this year [2019] in the DRC is the country's worst for more than a decade and is spreading like wildfire; it is the fastest-growing measles outbreak worldwide.

"Measles is everywhere -- every province of the country has cases," Dr. Karel Janssens, head of mission for MSF in the DRC, told The Telegraph from Kinshasa. "This is a very lethal epidemic."

The latest vaccination campaign, which will run for 9 days, will target close to 825 000 children under 5 years of age in 24 of the country's 26 provinces. The WHO says this will make the total number of children vaccinated through emergency campaigns to 4.1 million.

This year [2019] has seen measles outbreaks sweeping the globe, as a combination of growing anti-vax sentiment and a lack of access to crucial health care has left hundreds of thousands of people vulnerable to one of the world's most contagious viruses.

Africa alone has seen a 900% increase in infections compared with 2018.

But low vaccination rates in the DRC -- which is home to 81 million people, 40% of whom are under the age of 14 -- are not due to scepticism.

"The DRC is experiencing a dire situation because too many children were missed by routine immunisation," said Dr. Deo Nshimirimana, the WHO representative in the DRC.

And so a highly contagious disease such as measles pops up again and just ravishes through a population with barely any herd immunity," he said. "This epidemic is not new; it's high time that more actors were involved and more resources went into this."

The WHO has established a measles response advocacy committee to mobilise partners and donors in a joint effort to control the outbreak, and the United Nations Humanitarian Pooled Fund has given USD 2.5 million to the government's emergency campaign.

The DRC's Ministry of Health has also provided USD 843 000 to purchase vaccines.

But even with the scale-up of vaccination efforts -- which are not being used to prevent measles moving into new regions, but to try and stem the growing death toll -- it is unlikely that the epidemic will end soon.

"I'm afraid that this epidemic will continue," said Mr. Janssens. "And as much as it is important to respond now to the current epidemic, of course it's key to start thinking beyond this about how to avoid [a situation in which] every couple of years we end up with such a deadly epidemic."

The children in the DRC are suffering from so much -- measles, Ebola, cholera, malnutrition, malaria -- on top of the ongoing violence in the region. What is particularly sad is that no end is immediately in sight for these children for any of these afflictions. - Mod.LK]

[5] DRC: Ebola, cholera, measles
Date: Sat 28 Sep 2019

Kasika is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Goma, the largest city in the North Kivu Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It was in Kasika that Goma's 1st [Ebola] case was detected.

But Ebola is not the only disease to scourge the residents of Kasika, who live in close conditions, under tin roofs, with no running water, no flushing toilets and little sanitation. Cholera and measles are also surging through the community.

"Two of my neighbours went to hospital this week. I heard it was measles. Now my baby has cholera. We are really suffering here," says [RK], as she sits on a cholera cot -- a bed specially designed for cholera patients -- in the Kasika health centre, cradling her son, 20-month-old [B]. He has diarrhoea and is badly dehydrated.

The number of cholera and measles cases has risen across the DRC, including in North Kivu, where the Ebola outbreak has raged for more than a year. Since the start of 2019 in DRC, there have been 183 837 suspected cases of measles with 3667 deaths and 18 201 suspected cases of cholera with 325 deaths. There have been 2576 confirmed and probable Ebola cases with 1760 deaths in that same period.

"Usually, we organize a countrywide vaccination campaign for measles every 3 years," says Dr. Stephane Hans Bateyi Mustafa, regional coordinator for the expanded programme for immunization in North Kivu. "But this time we're late. In North Kivu, many human resources and funding sources were directed into the Ebola outbreak. Other routine activities have been underresourced."

[6] Europe update

http://www.connexionfrance.com/index.php/French-news/Health/Europe-losing-health-battle-with-measles


Europe is "losing ground" in the battle against measles, the World Health Organisation claims in a report. For the 1st time in 7 years, the number of cases is increasing in Europe: 90 000 in the 1st half of this year [2019], more than in all of 2018 (84 462).

In France, where vaccination has been mandatory for all children born after 31 Dec 2018, some 2400 cases have been reported so far this year [2019], with 2 deaths.

Most cases are among young adults who have not received the 2 required doses and are mainly in Nouvelle Aquitaine, Occitanie and PACA (France).

https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/measles-hit-zagreb-as-social-media-join-fight-against-anti-vaccination/


A total of 7 people have been diagnosed with measles in Zagreb in the past 2 weeks, raising concerns that more cases of this highly contagious virus may occur in light of the rising anti-vaccination campaigns.

This is not the 1st case of measles reported in Croatia. In the past months, a few cases have been reported in Dubrovnik and Split. In 2015, an epidemic broke out in Zagreb, mostly in Roma settlements, where most of the people are not vaccinated.

"Due to insufficient vaccination, we now have cases that measles returned to European countries, which had completely eradicated them before," epidemiologist Iva Pem Novosel from the Croatian Institute of Public Health (HZJZ) said. "We are talking about 90% of vaccinated population while experts believe that for collective immunity, the cleavage must be above 95%," she added.

The World Health Organisation published earlier this month [September 2019] a report suggesting that the disease has reappeared in 4 countries where it was considered eliminated -- the UK, Greece, the Czech Republic and Albania.

Despite warnings, Europe still severely exposed to measles. Although awareness and EU coordination on vaccination has increased, Europe is still experiencing an embarrassingly severe measles outbreak.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/los-angeles-reports-17th-measles-case-of-2019/


Los Angeles County health officials reported an additional confirmed case of measles in a resident who recently traveled and became ill with measles shortly after returning to Los Angeles County.

Other people may have been exposed to measles since public locations were visited by the person with measles while infectious. The potential public exposure locations, days and times [can be found at the source URL above].

Currently, there have been 17 measles cases among Los Angeles County residents in 2019, in addition to 11 non-resident measles cases that traveled through Los Angeles County (excluding Long Beach and Pasadena, as cases identified in those cities are reported by their local health departments). The majority of cases to date were unimmunized or did not know whether they had ever been immunized.

Health authorities disclosed that measles cases in the different parts of the Cordillera increased by 847% from January to September this year [2019] with 985 cases compared with only 104 cases during the same period last year [2018]. Officials from the different district health units were alarmed when data obtained from the Department of Health-Cordillera office of the regional epidemiology and surveillance unit indicated there were 4 measles-related deaths recorded by the health department compared with zero deaths last year [2018].

Health officials advised the disease-reporting units in the different parts of the region to make sure every detected case will have a specimen for laboratory confirmation and timely interventions by the concerned health authorities.
