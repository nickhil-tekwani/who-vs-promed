Rabbit owners are being warned to keep a close eye on their pets after haemorrhagic disease was confirmed once again on Vancouver Island [British Columbia, BC].

Rabbit owners on southern Vancouver Island are being warned to take extra precautions with their pets after the reemergence of a deadly virus in the Capital Regional District.

The Ministry of Forests Lands and Natural Resource Operations says rabbit hemorrhagic disease was recently detected in 2 dead feral rabbits.

It is the 2nd consecutive year the virus has turned up in the area, and officials say they haven't been able to pinpoint the source.

The same disease was blamed for several rabbit deaths in Vancouver earlier this summer [2019].

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is an extremely infectious and lethal disease exclusive to rabbits," said the ministry in a media release.

"Humans and other animals, including dogs and cats, cannot be infected."

The ministry added the viral strain detected last year [2018] targets European rabbits, but is not known to harm those native to North America.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by a calicivirus and works by attacking blood vessels, along with the liver and other organs.

Once rabbits are infected, signs usually manifest in between 1 and 9 days.

By way of comparison, the Ebola virus incubates in a human body for anywhere from 2 to 21 days before symptoms appear.

The ministry says rabbit owners should check their pets daily for signs of sickness, and call a veterinarian immediately if they have concerns.

Signs can include tiredness, uncoordinated behaviour, trouble breathing and, near the time of death, bleeding from the nose.

The ministry says rabbit owners can also obtain a vaccine from veterinary clinics around BC.

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease [RHD] is a serious and extremely contagious viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. Morbidity and mortality rates are high in unvaccinated animals; on some farms, most or all of the rabbits may die. This disease has also caused dramatic declines in some wild rabbit populations, particularly when it is first introduced. This has had a detrimental effect on some ecosystems in Europe, where wild rabbits are an important food source for certain endangered predators, such as Iberian lynx (_Lynx pardinus_). Conversely, rabbit hemorrhagic disease has been used to help control excessive numbers of wild, non-native European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) in Australia.

The origins of rabbit hemorrhagic disease are not completely understood. The causative virus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), may have emerged from avirulent caliciviruses circulating asymptomatically in European rabbits. The 1st known outbreak occurred in China in 1984, apparently spread by Angora rabbits that were imported from Europe. Within 9 months, this disease had killed 14 million domesticated rabbits in China. By the late 1990s, outbreaks had been reported from 40 countries, and rabbit hemorrhagic disease had become endemic in a number of areas throughout the world. Other regions, including the Americas, have experienced periodic outbreaks in domesticated rabbits. However, the species of wild rabbits found in North America are not susceptible to these RHD viruses, which facilitates eradication.

A new variant called RHDV2 emerged in Europe in 2010 and has spread widely among domesticated and wild rabbits there. This virus has also been found in Australia. RHDV2 affects animals vaccinated against older RHD viruses, as well as unvaccinated rabbits. It can also cause illness in some species of hares. Whether RHDV2 could affect any wild North American lagomorphs is not yet known.

RHDV is readily spread on fomites including contaminated food, bedding, and water. Insects can transmit this virus long distances. Flies are very efficient mechanical vectors; the infectious virus can persist in flies for up to 9 days, and only a few virions are needed to infect a rabbit by the conjunctival route. Viruses can also be deposited on vegetation in fly feces or regurgita, then eaten by a rabbit. Fleas and mosquitoes could transmit RHDV mechanically in the laboratory. Mechanical transmission has also been demonstrated in birds and mammals, which can excrete infectious RHDV in feces after eating infected rabbits.

RHDV is very resistant to inactivation when it is protected within tissues. This virus can survive for 7.5 months in tissue suspensions stored at 4 deg C (39 deg F), and for more than 3 months in dried organ homogenates at 20 deg C (68 deg F). In one study, RHDV remained viable in decomposing rabbit carcasses kept at 22 deg C (72 deg F) for up to 20 days, but there was insufficient infectious virus after 26 or 30 days to cause clinical signs in rabbits.

RHDV can be inactivated with 10% sodium hydroxide or 1-2% formalin. Other disinfectants that have been suggested include 2% One-stroke Environ (Vestal Lab Inc., St. Louis, Missouri) and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (10% household bleach). This virus resists degradation by ether or chloroform.

In rabbits less than 4-8 weeks of age, RHDV/ RHDVa infections are usually subclinical. However, some young rabbits may have elevated temperatures, and subclinical signs of liver disease were noted in experimentally infected 4-week-old rabbit kittens. Deaths have also been reported, though rarely. In a recent study, experimentally infected 4-week-old rabbits died rapidly if they were immunosuppressed with corticosteroids.

Peracute and acute disease are the most common syndromes in older rabbits. In peracute cases, infected rabbits develop a fever and die suddenly within 12-36 hours of its onset. The only clinical signs may be terminal squeals followed rapidly by collapse and death. Animals with the acute form survive somewhat longer, with signs of dullness/apathy, anorexia, congestion of the conjunctiva, and/or prostration. These animals may also develop neurological signs, such as incoordination, excitement, opisthotonos, and paddling. Some rabbits turn and flip quickly in their cages; this can resemble convulsions or mania. There may also be respiratory signs (e.g., dyspnea, cyanosis, and a terminal, bloodstained, frothy nasal discharge), lacrimation, ocular hemorrhages, or epistaxis. Animals that survive longer can develop a subacute form with severe jaundice, accompanied by weight loss and lethargy, and die in a few weeks. These animals may have diarrhea or constipation and abdominal dilatation just before death. A small number of adult rabbits can have milder signs, with a higher survival rate, or are infected subclinically. Rabbits with persistent viral RNA were apparently healthy.

Treatment is currently limited to supportive care. Passively acquired immunity (hyperimmune antiserum) can protect animals that have not yet developed clinical signs, but it is reported to be ineffective in symptomatic rabbits.

A quick response is vital for containing outbreaks in disease-free regions. Veterinarians who encounter or suspect rabbit hemorrhagic disease should follow their national and/or local guidelines for disease reporting. In the USA, state or federal veterinary authorities should be informed immediately.

Vaccines are now available for RHDV2 as well as RHDV/ RHDVa (classical RHDV or RHDV1); there is limited or no cross-protection between these 2 groups of viruses. Because the production cycle is short, commercial rabbit farms may only vaccinate breeding animals if rabbit hemorrhagic disease has not been reported in the area. However, all animals should be vaccinated if an outbreak has occurred, as the likelihood of infection is high even with strict sanitation and other control measures. Vaccination may also be useful as post-exposure prophylaxis, as immunity to RHDV usually develops in approximately 7-10 days. Sentinel animals can be used to monitor vaccinated farms for RHDV.

There is no indication either strain of this virus affects humans."

In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

[RHDV2] is a variant form of the original [RHDV1] virus and differs in the following ways:
- rabbits infected with the [RHDV2] virus typically DO NOT show the symptoms that are common with [RHDV1] infection so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations;
- deaths from [RHDV2] occur later and over a longer period of time than [RHDV1]: typically this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical [RHDV1]. Although this is marginal it is important to note from a quarantine perspective;
- only following postmortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible, however further tests are required to definitively confirm [RHDV2] which is now recommended for unexplained deaths;
- in mainland Europe, [RHDV2] is now very common particularly in France where it was first identified in 2010 and spread country-wide where it was mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in [RHDV2] in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in the UK;
- although [RHDV2] is less virulent than [RHDV1], its difficult early diagnosis means it is more challenging given rabbits can carry the disease for a longer period of time without any visible signs of infection. Hence diagnosis of [RHDV2] presents a new challenge for the UK."

[RHDV2] is a genetically and antigenically different from [RHDV1], and the immunogenic differences occur at the serotype level, for which vaccination against both variants is needed.
