Please find attached a recent media release re detection of evidence for
MVE [virus; Murray Valley encephalitis virus in sentinel chickens in the
Northern Territory. The program is a cooperative one between Territory
Health, volunteers for looking after the chickens, Department of Primary
Industry and Fisheries veterinarians and virology laboratory for
maintenance of some chicken flocks and blood collection, and Western
Australia Health for testing chicken bloods.
With limited mosquito monitoring and sentinel chicken surveillance coverage
over such a large geographic area, and with limited resources for control
of mosquito populations, we interpret possible arbovirus activity on
limited information and rely on such warnings for people to increase
personal protection in an effort to limit possible exposure to MVE and
Kunjin viruses.
MEDIA RELEASE
AUSTRALIAN ENCEPHALITIS WARNING
7 March 2000
Territory Health Services has issued a warning to residents and visitors
throughout the Northern Territory [NT to take precautions against the
potentially fatal mosquito borne disease Australian Encephalitis. The
sentinel chicken program, which acts as an early warning system, has shown
recent evidence of Murray Valley Encephalitis virus being active in the
Beatrice Hill area near the wetlands of the Adelaide River. This is an
indication that the virus could be active in any of the wet lands across
the Top End of the NT from the Victoria River to the Roper River systems.
Australian Encephalitis can be caused by either Kunjin Virus or Murray
Valley encephalitis virus. Murray Valley encephalitis virus causes a
potentially fatal illness. The normal symptoms caused by Murray Valley
encephalitis virus infection are severe headache, stiff neck, high fever,
and in some cases the disease progresses to delirium, and coma. Kunjin
causes a generally more mild disease with fever and severe headache.
The Health Department of WA has recently advised that sentinel chickens
have detected Murray Valley encephalitis activity in the Kimberley and
Pilbara areas of WA. These two viruses which cause Australian Encephalitis
are seasonally present in the north west of WA and the Top End of the NT
during most years, and can extend into the Barkly and Central Australian
areas in wet years. Both are transmitted by the bite of the common banded
mosquito (_Culex annulirostris_), which occurs in highest numbers during
and just after the wet season. Not all of these mosquitoes will be carrying
the virus, and only one person in approximately one thousand who get bitten
by mosquitoes with the virus will get the disease. In the Top End, numbers
of the common banded mosquito will be particularly high near large swampy
areas and coastal and river flood plains and along the larger river and
creek systems. This mosquito will also be high in all the recently flooded
areas of the Victoria River and Barkly areas. Areas of Central Australia
that are still flooded will also be areas of high numbers of this mosquito.
There is a risk of infection from these viruses over most of the NT
wherever mosquito numbers are relatively high or where people experience
mosquito pest problems. THS advise that there is no vaccine for Australian
Encephalitis and that the only protection is to avoid being bitten by
mosquitoes. THS recommend that people throughout the NT take extra
precautions against mosquito bites over the next two months. This
particularly applies to people visiting and camping in or near swamp and
river systems during the evening and night, and in rural areas near sites
of relatively high mosquito activity. People are advised to:
* avoid outdoor exposure around dusk and at night in all areas of high
mosquito activity;
* reduce outdoor activity in the evening and at night in all areas if
mosquitos are present;
* use mosquito proof accommodation, mosquito nets and mosquito proof tents
at night in all areas;
* wear protective clothing including light coloured clothing with long
sleeves, long trousers, and ankle protection with socks, between dusk and
dawn in areas where mosquito bites are likely;
* use a protective repellent containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) as a
supplement to protective clothing when outdoors at night in areas of
mosquito activity. The most effective and long lasting formulations are
those in lotions or gels. Most natural or organic repellents are not as
effective as DEET;
* ensure children are adequately protected against mosquito bites.

[The term "Australian encephalitis" is a misnomer. The epidemiologic
picture in infections caused by two distinct viruses is likewise distinct.
Nonethless, the idea is to get out this information. I am certain that
people infected with either virus do not care what the name of the disease
is. - Mod. CHC
