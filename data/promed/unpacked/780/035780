A cholera case has been registered in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. The
State Sanitary and Epidemiological Inspection said in a press release on
Friday that a resident of Chelyabinsk was diagnosed with cholera and his
wife with _Vibrio cholerae_ carriage. Both have been hospitalised. The
city's medical services have taken anti-epidemic measures. Specialists said
cholera will not spread.

[Chelyabinsk is in Western Siberia in the southern foothills of the Urals.
The city had an estimated population of 1.15 million inhabitants in 1990.
This article does not mention the serotype of cholera identified, nor does
it mention if there was a history of travel of the cases to suggest these
are imported cases or if these are locally acquired cases. - Mod.MPP]
[Chelyabinsk is an important commercial center. The couple could be
merchants from one of the ex-USSR Asian republics, or Russians just
returned from a trip abroad. If these are imported cases, we would
appreciate any information on their origin. In any case, we would like to
know the strain involved. - Mod.JW]
