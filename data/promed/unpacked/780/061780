A New, New H1N1 in Mexico?
--------------------------
This odd exchange took place at today's press conference with the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):

David Brown, The Washington Post: There's a report that there is yet
another new H1N1 virus that has been found in the states of Durango,
Zacatecas, and Jalisco that is distinct from both this swine H1N1 and the
seasonal Brisbane H1N1. Have you heard of this and can you tell us anything
about this?

Daniel Jernigan, CDC's deputy director of influenza division: We've heard
of some reports about that, but I've not had any direct information about
the specifics of that case. There's ongoing dialog between us and the folks
that are in Mexico, and as we know more about that, we'll be able to let
people know.

ScienceInsider is investigating but has yet to learn anything substantive.
It was aired in a public venue, though, and likely will receive media
attention, regardless of whether it turns out to be false.

"We heard a rumor but think it may be a misinterpretation of some lab data
by a non-lab person," Nancy Cox, head of CDC's influenza division, tells
ScienceInsider. "We are following up."

Why are Mexican data important?
-------------------------------
This issue of Eurosurveillance contains an article by a French team on the
transmission of the new influenza A(H1N1) in Mexico, which uses published
figures from the outbreak to estimate important parameters for
transmission, among them the reproduction rate, R (1). Such studies may
have important implications for public health action in Europe. [This
article has been reproduced previously in ProMED-mail; see Part [3],
Influenza A (H1N1) - worldwide (29) 20090515.1824]

What is R?
----------
The growth rate of an epidemic is determined by 2 factors: the number of
new persons infected by each case and the time from start of infectiousness
in one case to start of infectiousness in the secondary cases caused by
him/her. The 1st factor is called "reproduction rate" and is usually
denoted R. If the disease is spreading in a population that is totally
susceptible the term "basic reproduction rate" (Ro) is used. R is the
product of four terms: the risk of transmission in one single contact
between an infectious and a susceptible person, the frequency of such
contacts in the population, the duration of infectivity of a case, and the
proportion of susceptibles in the population. If R is greater than 1 this
means that each case infects more than one new person, and the outbreak is
likely to continue. If R is less than 1 the outbreak will eventually die
out, even if there may be a number of cases before that. The time from
infectiousness in one case to infectiousness in his/her secondary cases is
called "generation time" (Tg) and is basically a biological constant, even
if its exact value depends on how it is estimated.

Values for the factors that determine R can be calculated on the basis of
scientific knowledge of the disease, its context of transmission, and the
immunity status of the population. However, during an epidemic an R value
usually has to be derived from the analysis of the epidemic curve or by the
study of transmission chains.

Several studies have now tried to estimate R (or Ro) and Tg for the new
influenza A(H1N1) virus from Mexican data. In the one published in this
issue of Eurosurveillance [1], the authors use one exponential fitting and
one real-time estimation model to arrive at an estimate of R between 2.2
and 3.1. This is higher than the value found in an article in Science [2],
which estimated Ro to be 1.4-1.6 using 3 models: one exponential fitting,
one genetic analysis, and 2 standard SIR models for a confined outbreak in
La Gloria. Another analysis of the minor genetic changes in the virus over
time arrived at a Ro estimate of 1.16 [3].

Why is Ro important in public health?
-------------------------------------
The reproduction rate reflects effectiveness of transmission, and therefore
has important implications for the efforts that public health authorities
would have to make in implementing health measures aiming at containing or
mitigating the outbreak. For example, with a Ro of 1.16, preventing 14 per
cent of cases will result in eventually interrupting transmission, while
with a Ro of 3.1, preventing 68 per cent cases would be needed -- assuming
a total random mixing of contacts in the population.

Why are Ro estimates so different for influenza?
------------------------------------------------
A few studies have tried to measure Ro for seasonal influenza [4], and
found it to be in the order of 1.2 to 1.4. However, for most of the
seasonal strains, there is already some immunity in the population from
past seasons, which lowers the reproduction rate (and it should thus really
not be called Ro in this situation). For any epidemic of a disease that
leads to immunity after infection the initial Ro will also be higher than
the actual R at any later stage, since the proportion still susceptible in
the population will decrease. It should also be realised that delayed
reporting of cases will affect an estimate of R; a problem that adheres to
the study in this issue and the others cited above.

What influences Ro?
-------------------
The risk of transmission in a contact when an infective meets a susceptible
is basically a biological constant (even if it varies over the time course
of the infection), as is the duration of infectiveness. However, frequency
of contacts varies considerably between populations and population groups.
For example, among children in schools or day care, the contact frequency
is higher than among adults [5], and it also varies by culture, by family
size in a society, by types of social interaction, etc.

Why is the Ro from Mexico important?
------------------------------------
One could question why there is so much interest around studies of R and Ro
based on Mexican data. Would they apply to Europe? One could guess that
contact density might be higher in a Mexican setting, but on the other
hand, since the epidemic has already run its course for some time there,
the proportion of non-susceptibles would be higher in Mexico and the
European situation would more approach a "true" (higher) Ro, with a totally
susceptible population.

In a graph [not reproduced here] of the daily reported cumulative number of
cases in Mexico, Canada, US and EU/EFTA countries, outbreak of new
influenza A(H1N1), April-May 2009, we have just compared the daily reported
cumulative number of cases in Mexico, Canada, United States, and European
Union and European Free Trade Association (EU / EFTA) countries. On a
semi-logarithmic scale it is evident that the slope for Europe is very much
the same as for Mexico. It is difficult to estimate the time lag for
Europe, but it seems that we are some 1-2 months behind. If the generation
times are the same for both epidemics -- which seems highly plausible
­--then an estimate of Ro for Mexico would apply also to Europe. A Ro just
above 1 could mean that a containment strategy might be successful.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is
continuously monitoring the situation and with more data being available
every day in Europe we will obviously be able to have a better picture here
soon as well. Nevertheless, the similarities of the shapes of the epidemics
indicate that lessons from Mexico could apply also to Europe.

Novel H1N1 influenza in people: global spread from an animal source?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The rapidly unfolding and evolving events, on a worldwide scale, relating
to the human-to-human transmission of a novel H1N1 influenza A virus have
dominated the news media in the past 2 weeks. In Europe to date, as in
North America and Canada, there have been cases of laboratory-confirmed
H1N1 infection in people returning from recent foreign travel in South
America, specifically Mexico. In the vast majority of cases in people who
are not from Mexico, the reported clinical presentation has been mild.
Nevertheless, the emergence of this novel H1N1 influenza virus, and its
rapid and worldwide spread, facilitated by the normal movement of people
across international boundaries, highlights some important epidemiological
features. It is relevant to note that while this H1N1 influenza virus has
been termed "swine influenza" (or "swine flu"), the definitive scientific
evidence base to support its origin in pig populations has not yet been
confirmed. Furthermore, in the absence of contemporaneous reports of
clinical disease in pigs infected with this virus, it is not possible to
confirm the clinical signs that may be observed in infected animals. In
common with other influenza A infections of pigs, where a range of clinical
presentations can occur, asymptomatic infection with this virus is also a
theoretical possibility.

Epidemiology
------------
The epidemiology of swine influenza in pigs is itself not straightforward.
However, a number of consistent features exist:
-- swine influenza is an important, contagious disease of pigs that occurs
worldwide, and is typically caused by infection with influenza A viruses;
-- virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are endemic in many pig populations
around the world, and pigs serve as major reservoirs of these viruses;
-- interspecies transmission, including zoonotic infections, with the
recognised endemic swine influenza viruses does occasionally occur
(reviewed by Brown 2000).

The maintenance of these influenza viruses in pigs, and the frequent
introduction of new influenza viruses from other species, could, therefore,
contribute to the generation of strains of human influenza virus with
pandemic potential (Alexander and Brown 2000). Historical evidence of this
suggests that, to date, the risk has been low. In addition, there is
significant genetic and antigenic variability within each of the endemic
swine influenza subtypes, which can often be dependent on geographical
region. More specifically, before the emergence of this novel H1N1 virus,
there has been a clear genetic distinction between North American and
Eurasian lineages of swine influenza viruses. This new variant of H1N1
virus contains 3 of 8 gene segments (encoding for the neuraminidase and
matrix protein genes) that do not appear typical of the genes seen in
current North American strains. It has been postulated that these 3 gene
segments have derived from Eurasian swine influenza viruses. It is not
known if the particular genotype of H1N1 virus that appears putatively to
have originated in Mexico is circulating in North American pigs, but its
close similarity to other strains of swine influenza known to be
circulating in the region (sharing 6 of 8 gene segments) has led to the
assumption that this novel H1N1 strain is derived from pigs.

[insert in text: Influenza A virus ecology with relevance to swine
Influenza A viruses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Influenza A viruses infect a large variety of animal species, including
mammals and birds, and, given the worldwide animal-human interface, there
is potential for interspecies transmission of influenza viruses in nature.
Phylogenetic studies of influenza A viruses have revealed species-specific
lineages of viral genes and have also demonstrated the frequency of
interspecies transmision depends on the animal species. Aquatic birds are
known to be the source of all influenza viruses for other species.

Pigs are an important host in influenza virus ecology as they are
susceptible to infection with both avian- and human-origin influenza A
viruses, and are often involved in interspecies transmission, facilitated
by regular close contact with people and/or birds. Following transmission
to and independent spread of avian or human influenza viruses in pigs,
these viruses are general referred to as being "avian-like" or "human-like"
swine influenza viruses, reflecting both their previous and current hosts.
After reassortment with other influenza A viruses, some of the genes of
these viruses may be maintained in the resulting progeny viruses.
Therefore, the evolution of influenza genes in species-specific lineagesis
an invaluable characteristic in studying and determining influenza virus
epidemiology.]

Influenza viruses in pigs in Europe
-----------------------------------
A number of countries in Europe conduct routine surveillance of pig
populations for swine influenza, but, as this is not a notifiable disease
in the EU, the surveillance programme is not consistent across the region.
A European Swine Network for Influenza in Pigs (ESNIP2), funded by the EU,
has been proactively monitoring the influenza situation in the European pig
population for several years, and has demonstrated that subtypes H1N1, H3N2
and H1N2 co-circulate.

There are also some significant differences in epidemiology in terms of the
virus subtypes involved within the EU. For example, currently in Great
Britain (GB) "avian-like" swine H1N1 viruses co-circulate with H1N2, but
H3N2 has apparently disappeared since the mid-1990s [Data tabulated in the
original text]. This is in contrast, for example, to the situation in
Italy, where these viruses are still widespread (Van Reeth and others 2008).

The genotypic diversity of the influenza viruses in the European pig
population is also well recognised, and periodically genotypic variants are
identified. However, broadly, the endemic strains retain common genotypes
and the new reassorted variants appear to have poor viability for long-term
sustainability and transmission within the swine population (Brown 2008).
This is in contrast to the current situation in North America, where
multiple genotypes of several different subtypes have emerged within the
past 10 years, creating a complex aetiology with respect to swine influenza
in these populations.

Based on current evidence from surveillance programmes in several European
countries, the variant of H1N1 virus recently isolated in human beings has
never been reported, and therefore does not appear to be present in the
European pig population.

Swine influenza surveillance in Great Britain
---------------------------------------------
In Great Britain, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) has run a
national swine influenza scanning surveillance programme since 1991, funded
by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). This
programme is targeted, based on clear criteria using a standardised case
definition, selection algorithm and sampling protocol, and provides
free-of-charge laboratory testing for the detection of swine influenza
viruses in clinical samples from affected pigs submitted by veterinary
surgeons to VLA regional laboratories (RLs) and Scottish Agricultural
College (SAC) Veterinary Services. Further information can be found on the
VLA website at <http://www.defra.gov.uk/vla/diseases/dis_si.htm>, or from
local VLA ­ RLs or SAC disease surveillance centres. It is important for
vigilance to be maintained within both the swine and human sectors for the
emergence or spread of the newly reported H1N1 virus. The recent report of
human-to-pig transmission in Alberta, Canada, highlights the importance of
reverse zoonosis, a recognised phenomenon in influenza virus epidemiology.
Ongoing close liaison and collaboration is also occurring between the VLA
and public health institutes and delivery agencies to ensure rapid and
robust information exchange.

Capacity for change
-------------------
The global human-animal interface is complex and dynamic, with the
potential for zoonotic transmission of known pathogens, variants thereof
and emergent infectious agents. In turn, animal reservoirs and people, both
with the capacity for rapid global movement and distribution in time and
space (intrinsic properties of globalisation), face these shared infectious
challenges, not forgetting the propensity of some pathogens for 2-way
exchange between species.

While the novel H1N1 influenza virus is assumed to be of animal origin, it
is now clearly spreading between humans and has already entered the EU, as
well as other parts of the world. However, to date, human-to-animal
transmission has not been identified or reported by EU member states. The
case of human-to-pig transmission in Canada followed contact of an infected
occupationally exposed worker, apparently incubating H1N1 virus infection
following return from travel to Mexico. It also seems inevitable that more
human cases will be detected worldwide. It is important to note that the
potential host range for this virus is currently unknown. Potential changes
in the virus characteristics need to be closely monitored by both public
health and veterinary institutes. The world is watching on as international
scientific and sociopolitical efforts attempt to better understand and
combat an historical foe with seemingly limitless capacity for change and
variation, and to evade predictions -- the influenza virus.
