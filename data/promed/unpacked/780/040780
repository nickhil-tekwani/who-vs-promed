According to the national health service, during the past 48 hours
approximately 24 people have received treatment at the civil hospital in
Ceuta, after having ingested tainted food last Sun, 9 May 2004, at a
celebration held jointly by several families. Of these, only 2 --an adult
and a child -- remain hospitalized.

8 of the patients were treated last Sun, 9 May 2004 --the same day of the
party; 14 were treated on Mon, 2 on Tues, and it is possible that more
people will consult the civil hospital. All patients consulted with
symptoms of gastroenteritis, and, as is to be expected, several belong to
the same family.

The Consumer Services of the autonomous city of Ceuta are investigating the
source of the illness and, although it hasn't been confirmed, the sanitary
services suspect that it originated in contaminated seafood served at the
celebration.

[Ceuta is actually a city in Spanish North Africa with 68 796 inhabitants
(as of 1996). It is an enclave in mainland Morocco, covering an area of
19.7 square kilometers. It is administered by Spain's Cadiz Province. It is
1 of 2 remaining fragments of long-time Spanish presence in North Africa.

The rapid onset of most of the illnesses suggests a toxin disease such as
staphylococcal or clostridial food poisoning. Seafood is thought in the
posting to be a suspect vehicle and may be associated with these
intoxications. - Mod.LL]
