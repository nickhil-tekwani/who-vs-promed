Study: Oregon River Water Causing Fish Deformities
--------------------------------------------------
PORTLAND, Oregon - Deformed fish found for years in a stretch of Oregon's
Willamette River were damaged by something in the water, not by genetic
defects as had previously been believed, according to a new study
released on Friday.
Scientists, who called their findings "shocking," said they were
working to determine the exact cause of the problem, and investigating
whether there were health risks associated with eating the deformed fish
found in a 30-mile section of the river.
"It could be chemical, bacterial, parasites, high river temperature,
low oxygen levels, a variety of things," said Steve Ellis, a scientist
with EVS Environment Consultants, the Seattle-based firm conducting the
study.
"We need to continue to study this and determine the cause and sources
of the problem and then do something about it, which we will do," said
Dick Pedersen, manager of the watershed management section of Oregon's
Department of Environmental Quality.
The study was conducted near a stretch of the Willamette between Newberg
and Oregon City, scientists said. There, 3500 rainbow trout eggs from a
California trout farm were left above a river bed for 2 weeks until eyes
could be seen. They were then taken to a lab, reared to the fry stage,
and studied against trout raised only in a laboratory.
Of 372 trout sampled, 34 percent exposed to Willamette River water for 2
weeks had deformities compared with 9 percent of the fish raised in the
laboratory, the study found.
"The types of skeletal deformities we saw are the same type as with
other fish" having come out of the Willamette, EVS's Ellis said. In
addition, prior studies have shown random samples of fish from the this
part of the river have had deformity rates above 70 percent, scientists
said.
About 70 percent of Oregon's population lives within 20 miles of the
Willamette River, making it an important symbol for Oregonians, Allen
said, adding, "This is a slap upside the head for Oregonians."
The river, which winds through the state's most populated areas, is also
planned as a source of drinking water for the town of Wilsonville in
2002.
Ellis's firm is working on a study of the health risks of eating fish
caught on this stretch of the Willamette.
"We are still dumping a lot of chemicals in this part of the river,"
Allen said. "A lot of people think this is stuff that happened 40 years
ago. Dumping [is] a current problem."

[If they knew who was dumping chemicals, then something could perhaps
more easily be done. However, this research suggests there are a number
of chemicals from different sources and for different reasons being
dumped into the river. This area has been promoted as being a very
pristine area, when apparently it is not. - Mod.TG]
