[The current and previous outbreaks in Namibia are located in zones without a recognized CBPP [contagious bovine pleuropneumonia] status. See map at https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2021/05/eng-namibia.png

"CBPP has been unequivocally identified in Europe since the 18th century and it gained a worldwide distribution during the second half of the 19th century through cattle trade. CBPP was eradicated from many countries at the beginning of the 20th century, mostly through stamping-out strategies (UK, USA) or by vaccination campaigns followed by stamping-out strategies (Australia). Today, CBPP remains enzootic in many Sub-Saharan African countries including countries in the West, South, East, and Central regions of Africa, while in Europe the last CBPP cases were observed in Portugal in 1999." The situation in some Asian countries is unclear due to a lack of efficient CBPP surveillance.

Humans are not known to be susceptible to CBPP, so there is no public health risk. https://www.woah.org/en/disease/contagious-bovine-pleuropneumonia/. - Mod.CRD
