Anthrax found in drums used at UNH
----------------------------------
Two African drums stored at the United Campus Ministry in Durham, New
Hampshire, have tested positive for anthrax, the state confirmed
yesterday as it continues to investigate the nation's 1st known case
of gastrointestinal anthrax. The state ordered the ministry, which
serves but is not part of the University of New Hampshire, closed for
further testing. As many as 30 drums are stored at the 15 Mill Road
building.

The young woman with the disease, who attended a drum circle at the
center, remains in critical condition, state Public Health Director
Jose Montero said. Montero said the unidentified Strafford County
woman brought her own drum, which had a synthetic covering and not
one of animal skin typically used on an African drum.

Montero continues to ask drum owners who attended the drum circle
events since October [2009] to call his office for possible drum
tests. The state lab has sent some samples, including DNA samples,
for further testing at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
About a half-dozen attendees have contacted the state health
officials since the anthrax case was announced Saturday [26 Dec
2009], when more than 50 people may have attended the most recent
drum circle.

Investigators have not yet confirmed that the 2 drums are the source
of anthrax exposure. Technicians are still trying to match strains
between the patient and the drums. They are probing other possible
sources of contamination, including soil, animal products, and food
possibly ingested by the woman, who is in an undisclosed,
out-of-state hospital. "We have not yet been able to confirm that the
drums are the cause of the patient's illness and we are continuing to
follow up many leads," Montero said. "Anthrax is not an illness that
you can catch from someone else." Montero and state Health and Human
Services Commissioner Nicholas Toumpas emphasized that there is no
risk to the public. The state Division of Public Health has increased
surveillance at hospitals and health care providers across the state.

It is possible tests may never fully identify the point of infection
transmission, according to Montero. Investigators are interviewing
the woman's family and her friends to try to identify eating habits
and any other link for possible point of transmission.

Samples at the United Campus Ministry building were collected over
the weekend by the New Hampshire National Guard, state Department of
Environmental Services, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Additional samples will be collected and tested.

The African drum connection is a source under investigation after
contaminated animal hides on drums were involved in anthrax
infections in New York City in 2006 and in 2 Connecticut residents in
2007. Those cases were types of inhalation anthrax and cutaneous
anthrax, not GI anthrax, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control.

Julie Corey of Village Drum Shop in Hooksett, who facilitated the
most recent drum circle at the United Campus Ministry, said she has
been in touch with the state and with the woman's family. Corey and
the Rev. Larry Brickner-Wood, executive director of the United Campus
Ministry, were alerted to the anthrax case and possible connection by
investigators on Christmas eve. "Obviously I'm very upset about the
situation," said Corey, who knows the woman and her family. "We need
to pray for her and pray that she gets through this." Brickner-Wood
said he has also reached out to participants of recent drum circles.
He said his thoughts and prayers go out to the young woman and her
family. "It's terrible and scary and all that," he said.

There have been only 11 cases of naturally occurring anthrax in the
country (USA) since 1957. The last anthrax cases in New Hampshire
were 9 involving employees at a textile mill in Manchester.

[Curiouser and curiouser. DNA analyses will show whether her
strain(s) are the same or different from those associated with the 2
drums testing positive. I say strains-plural because in my experience
livestock infected from contaminated feed not infrequently have
multiple strains. This results from the very nature of how sun-dried
bones are collected in Africa and elsewhere, crushed, shipped, and
processed resulting in a mix of strains all in the same sack.

It would be nice and tidy if at least one of the strains associated
with these drums were the same as that affecting this young woman.
The next question then would be were the 2 (or 3 or many) drummers
playing their drums next to each other. If yes, why did she come down
with this infection and not they? If they were spatially separated
the question gets more difficult. And if it is clear that one or both
of the drums were the source, why were cases not seen following
earlier drumming sessions. Room ventilation differences?

One must also keep in mind that New Hampshire has acid soil -- from
the NH samples I have handled recently around 4.6 pH -- and anthrax
spores cannot survive in acid soils. Since the mills and tanneries
handling imported materials shut down in New England there have been
no livestock cases in that region.

An interesting puzzle. Let us hope it does not involve tragedy. - Mod.MHJ]
