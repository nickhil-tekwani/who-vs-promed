The cause behind unusual bird behavior on Alaska's coastline has scientists on high alert. Beginning in May [2018], wildlife officials began receiving reports of dead and dying seabirds from the northern Bering and southern Chukchi seas, including in the vicinity of the Western Arctic National Parklands.

National Park Service investigators found 100 carcasses in a 4-kilometer [about 2.5 mi] stretch of beach in late June [2018], most of which were murres along the coast of the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. Although, investigators say other species were found there and in Cape Krusenstern National Monument.

Scientists say the culprit is starvation -- but they don't know why. There has been no evidence of disease, and tests are pending to determine if birds were exposed to harmful algal toxins.

Northern fulmars are appearing unhealthy, and the common murres are going closer to shore than usual.

Off the coast of Katmai and Kenai Fjords National Parks, scientists are seeing the fork-tailed storm petrels unusually close to shore in large numbers. An [8 Jul 2018] report shows large numbers of the storm petrels feeding in abnormally shallow water. 2 days later, a report showed the number of birds in the area was much less, and instead, there were carcasses.

Scientists will continue to investigate, according to the post. A report on the National Parks Service website shows this die-off is not the first in Alaska seas in recent years.

Wildlife authorities are asking the public to report observations of sick or dead birds to the US Fish and Wildlife Service by calling 866-527-3358. Be sure to note the location, time, and date observed; type and number or birds; photos of sick/dead birds; videos of any unusual behavior, such as drooping their head or wings. Citizens are reminded to wear gloves and keep carcasses frozen if you collect them.

[Large die-offs of seabirds, especially murres, have been linked to strong "El Niño" events in the past. In 1993, after a prolonged series of high temperature anomalies in the Tropical Pacific, thousands of murres were found dead with signs of emaciation in the Gulf of Alaska (Marine Pollution Bulletin 34: 656-62; abstract at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X97000088). Food supplies may have been affected by the high temperatures observed during the last months of 2015 in the Pacific Ocean. In the previous mass die-off event, an unusually and unprecendented prolonged El Niño event, with anomalously warm water temperatures (+ 1 to 4 C) persisted in the north east Pacific from California to Alaska during the winter of 1992-1993 and spring of 1993.

Previous information about this episode suggest starvation as the main cause of the die-off. Now we are not in in the presence of an "El Niño". What needs to be established is whether climate change is causing dramatic disruptions in these marine ecosystems, affecting availability of food.

The common murre (_Uria aalge_) is a large auk. It occurs in low-Arctic and boreal waters in the North-Atlantic and North Pacific. It spends most of its time at sea, only coming to land to breed on rocky cliff shores or islands. They nest in densely packed colonies.
