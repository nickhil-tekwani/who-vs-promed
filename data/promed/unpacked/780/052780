Rising number of CCHF infections in Iranian provinces
-----------------------------------------------------
Iranian media report that 7 people in the country have died after contracting Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Most victims of the viral disease have been identified in the eastern provinces, but reports indicate that the virus has been detected in 27 of Iran's 31 provinces.

The Mehr News Agency reports on Sunday [10 Jun 2012] that the head of the Pasteur Institute labs in Tehran announced that since the beginning of the Iranian year in March [2012], 29 people have contracted Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever and 7 of them have died from it. He confirmed that the virus has been identified in 27 provinces. The Mehr report adds that top Health Ministry officials have so far confirmed that 2 deaths can be attributed to this disease.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe viral disease communicated to humans through animals, especially ticks. The 1st signs are flu-like symptoms such as fever, aching muscles, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, headaches, and soreness of eyes. It may also result in mood swings, depression, confusion, and aggression. Later symptoms are severe bleeding through the skin from a rash or internal bleeding that may lead to death.

Iranian health officials say last year [2011] there were 87 cases of CCHF infection, 15 of which were fatal, and in the previous year, 154 cases were reported and 26 deaths. In recent weeks, after the presence of CCHF was confirmed in Iran's eastern provinces, some cases were also reported in Tehran, with 2 of them turning critical. Despite the reports, health officials stressed that Tehran was not facing an outbreak of CCHF, and the cases reported in the capital had been transferred from other cities for treatment.

Infected livestock entering the country through eastern borders is said to be the main cause of the CCHF outbreak, and spraying them has been suggested as an effective way of halting the spread. Suggested ways to stop the contagion include using gloves when handling meat and keeping meat in a freezer for 48 hours before consumption.

CCHF has no cure, but treatment of the symptoms usually leads to the patient's recovery. The World Health Organization puts the disease's mortality rate at 30 per cent.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever caused by a member of the genus _Nairovirus_ (family _Bunyaviridae_). Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans do occur. The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia, and reflects the distribution of the tick vector.

The disease was first described in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969 it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo, and linkage of the 2 place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus. CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high mortality rate. Fortunately, human illness occurs infrequently, although animal infection may be more common. The vector is the tick _Hyalomma marginatum_, a good image to which is included in the Payvand Iran News report at the source URL above. Further information about CCHF can be obtained from the WHO website at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html.

It is unclear how these statistics relate to the Iranian calendar. According to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars): "The modern Iranian calendar (Solar Hejri) is now the official calendar in Iran and Afghanistan. It begins on the vernal equinox as determined by astronomical calculations for the Iran Standard Time meridian (52.5 deg E or GMT+3.5h). This determination of starting moment is more accurate than the Gregorian calendar as far as predicting the date of the vernal equinox is concerned because it uses astronomical calculation rather than mathematical rules, but requires consulting an astronomical almanac. The Iranian year usually begins within a day of 21 March of the Gregorian calendar."
