A Colfax-resident reported 5 dead deer near her home since
mid-September [2011], and suspects they may have died from a common
virus.

Fish and Game officials have yet to inspect the deer carcasses. One
veterinarian suggested a virus could be one possible cause of death.
[The virus could be epizootic hemorrhagic disease, EHD. Or it may be
deer adenovirus. - Mod.TG]

[The homeowner] said the deer all have the same pinkish colored foam
oozing from their mouths or nostrils. None of these deer appeared to
have any other trauma or wounds, according to [the homeowner]. As an
animal lover, she said she is afraid more deer could lose their
lives.

"The one I found most recently, on her nose it was like somebody took
this foam and put this pink shaving cream. Is somebody poisoning them,
or is this a deer disease?" [she] said.

Over the 6 or 7 years that she has lived at her home, [the homeowner]
said she has never found so many dead deer. One was below her deck,
while another was right off of her front step.

"I've lived here 6 or 7 years and I have never seen this many die so
close together. It makes me sad and it makes me concerned because
could something transfer to livestock?" [she] said. "It's been
bothering me terribly."

[The homeowner] said she originally called animal control, but later
learned the Californian Department of Fish and Game is responsible for
investigating the deaths of wild animals.

While [the homeowner] had not gotten in touch with the Department of
Fish and Game as of Tuesday [8 Nov 2011], Dr Ben Gonzales, Senior
Wildlife Veterinarian for the department, said it is possible the deer
died from a virus.

"It's always difficult to diagnose from a distance," Gonzales said.
"My best guess at this point would be an infectious disease like deer
adenovirus and it causes that sort of thing. They do tend to go down
in groups like that." Gonzales said that while anything was possible,
the death of the deer was probably not related to a poisoning.

"Anything is possible, but we get a lot of cases or reports of
poisonings and it really rarely happens," Gonzales said. "It doesn't
often pan out like that. That would be low on my list."

Gonzales said he hopes biologists in the field will be able to study
the deer near [the above homeowner's] home soon. He said it is best to
report dead wildlife immediately because it is easier to study the
body.

[The homeowner] said she hopes to get in touch with the Department of
Fish and Game as soon as possible.

While she doesn't feed the deer, or does anything special for them,
[the homeowner] said she does enjoy watching them and doesn't want
anymore to die. "I see other young deer running around, but I'm not
seeing any of the older deer," she said. "I have seen the activity of
the vultures, so I know it's more than just the 5 I've seen."

[While either EHD or deer adenovirus are on the top the list, it is
too soon to rule out other disease or toxins. For accurate results the
dead animals need to be reported immediately so that the freshest
samples may be sent to the lab. We certainly hope some samples from
these cases have been sent to a diagnostic laboratory. - Mod.TG]
