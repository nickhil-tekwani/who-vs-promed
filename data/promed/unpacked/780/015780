We ask for help because we are confronted with a disease we have never seen
before.
Seven cases including 3 men and 4 women , aged from 28 to 42, suffered from
constant severe headache lasting for three to ten days. Three cases
present stabbing pain in limbs. One patient with paroxysmal intercoatal
neuralgia. One with sharp burnt sense in the skin over whole body. Six
cases with low fever (37.2 - 38.2 C).
Physical examination: 6 cases shows clear consciousness, one case
somnolence. Cranial nerves and muscle power are normal. All patients show
soft neck; Brudzikis' signs negative, Kernig's signs are negative except
one suspected positive; Bibinskis' sign is negative, 5 cases with general
or local region pain present hyperpathia in the relative region. No
subcutaneous swelling, noduleor rash was found.
Laboratery test:
WBC differential count: eosinophilic cells were 9-37%.
LP: 3 cases CSF pressure increased
CSF analysis: no RBC was found; WBC counts were 225-1400/mm3, eosinophilic
cells were 16-72%; glucose contents were normal; proteins were 0.50-1.09g/L.
Chloride reduced to 93mmol/L at one case and others were normal.
Skull C.T. [examinations] were normal in all cases.

Epidemiology investigation: All patients had had some uncooked food
including sea snail one or two weeks before they presented the symptoms.
We also found 12 cases with same symptoms in a group of 20 people who had
had a dinner together. We consider this disease as Eosinophilic
meningoencephalitis. Human parasitic disease-Angiostrogyliasis is first
suspected. Trichniasis and Gnathostomiasic spinigera still be remain to be
excluded. We have not [performed] any special immuological test methods
for these patients' diagnoses.
We call for advice for:
1. The diagnosis of the disease
2. Available exmination methods
3. The treatment experience of the same disease.
