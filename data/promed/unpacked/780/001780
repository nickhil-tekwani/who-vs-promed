Sea Lions Sick From Contagious Disease
--------------------------------------
Dozens of sick California sea lions have been brought in to the
Marine Mammal Center field office in Moss Landing for care, and
officials say a contagious infection is to blame.

Marine officials say the mammals are dehydrated, lethargic and in
pain. The infection is called leptospirosis, and it affects the liver
and kidneys. Marine officials said some years have more outbreaks
than other years. They said this disease follows a cyclical pattern.

2 sea lions were brought into the Moss Landing field office Wednesday
with sure signs of the disease. Veterinarians treat the animals with
IV drips and fresh water. Just last month [September 2008], dozens of
sea lions were treated at the center and transported to the main
animal hospital in Sausalito for tests.

Field Office Manager Sue Andrews said the infection is contagious.
Animals and even humans can be infected with the bacteria, but it is
usually not directly transmitted through salt water. She advises
people to stay away from the sea lions and to keep good hygiene.

Andrews said she expects the outbreak to die down during the winter
months. If you see an affected animal, please call the Marine Mammal
Center at: (831) 633-6298.

[During the course of a 5-year study (1972-1977), 3 researchers
became ill after exposure to California sea lions (_Zalophus
californianus_) that were infected with _Leptospira_. The 2 workers
with more severe illness became infected after necropsying a sea
lion. All 3 developed serum agglutinating antibody titers to
_Leptospira interrogans_ serovar _pomona_ (Smith, Vedros et al. 1978).

Organism
--------
_Leptospira interrogans_ serovar _pomona_, is one of 200 serovars
within this species of spirochete bacteria. For this and other
potentially zoonotic serovars, transmission occurs directly between
mammalian hosts and indirectly through exposure to contaminated water
and soil.

Clinical disease in marine mammals
----------------------------------
Renal disease has been observed in harbor seals (_Phoca vitulina_),
and more commonly in California sea lions (_Zalophus californianus_)
and fur seals (_Arctocephalus_ spp.) (Gulland, Koski et al. 1996;
Stamper, Gulland et al. 1998). The disease causes tubular necrosis
consistent with interstitial nephritis. Clinical signs include
anorexia, dehydration and polydipsia [excessive thirst]. Cytology and
serum chemistry reveals a leukocytosis [high white blood cell count]
and high serum phosphorus, urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.

Unlike humans, sea lions and other marine mammals have hundreds of
renules that comprise a single kidney. An individual renule acts as an
independent kidney. When bacteria destroy the kidney tissue, the
damage is permanent. Even if the bacteria are killed with an
antibiotic, if there is too much damage to the kidney, the animal will
not survive. When less than one 3rd of the kidney is functioning, the
animal dies because of toxic levels of electrolytes (such as sodium),
metabolites (substances produced by metabolism), pH, and fluid
abnormalities.

Treatment
---------
_Leptospira_ are susceptible to penicillins.
