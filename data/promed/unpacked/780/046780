The Regional Health Inspectorate in Bulgaria's southern city of
Plovdiv has registered a total of 144 cases of hepatitis in August
2011. According to the report, 34 of the 144 cases were located in the
city's Roma ghetto, Stolipinovo. The majority of patients were of Roma
ethnic origin and [were] children, the watchdog announced. Most of the
cases were of hepatitis A infection, but 10 of the probes raised
suspicions of hepatitis B and C.

According to Doctor Milena Kolarova, head of the Epidemiological
Control Department at the Plovdiv Regional Health Inspectorate, the
cases of infection are epidemiologically unrelated. Doctor Kolarova
told journalists on Thursday [24 Aug 2011] that extra preventive
measures had been taken, such as frequent garbage collection from
Stolipinovo and other residential districts as well as regular
disinfection of the areas surrounding garbage containers.

Apart from that, Kolarova stated that meetings had been held with Roma
non-governmental organizations to educate the population about the
causes and symptoms of the contagious liver disease. She also
explained that it was too early to speak of a hepatitis boom, but the
situation was pre-epidemiological, and steps had been taken to ensure
adequate medical service in case of an emergency.

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's faeces. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene habits. An estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A
occur annually. Improved sanitation and the hepatitis A vaccine are
the most effective ways to combat the disease
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html.

With respect to the outbreak of hepatitis A virus infection in the
Roma population of Plovdiv, a general improvement in personal hygiene,
coupled with provision of hepatitis A vaccine, might be a more
effective strategy than enhancement of garbage collection.

The Romani people are an ethnic group with origins in India who are
widely dispersed, with their largest concentrated populations in
Europe, especially Central and Eastern Europe. The Roma are a subgroup
of the Romani people who live primarily in Central and Eastern Europe.
Romani people constitute the 3rd largest ethnic group (after
Bulgarians and Turks) in Bulga. According to the 2001 census, there
were 370 908 Roma in Bulgaria, equivalent to 4.7 percent of the
country's total population

The city of Plovdiv is the 2nd-largest city in Bulgaria after Sofia
(the capital), with a population of 338 153 [1]. Plovdiv is in the
southern part of the Plovdiv Plain on the 2 banks of the Maritsa
River. It can be located in the map of Bulgaria at:
