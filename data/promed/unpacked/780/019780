Zambia bans movement of pigs from Lusaka province
--------------------------------------------------
The Lusaka Provincial Veterinary Office has banned the movement of live
pigs from the province to other areas except for slaughter. The measures
have been put in place in a bid to prevent the spread of the Swine Fever
from Lusaka to other provinces following the outbreak of the disease at
some places in the province 2 weeks ago.
Lusaka Province Veterinary Officer Alisheke Mutemwa announced Tuesday that
an action plan has been worked out to stage roadblocks in all roads leading
out of the capital city of Lusaka for thorough scrutiny of pigs leaving the
town.
Mutemwa explained that his department would be inspecting all animals that
are destined for other provinces to ensure that they are only for
slaughter, adding that veterinary officers would always escort the
transporters so that the pigs are not left to live.
He explained that the Swine Fever is a serious disease and it could wipe
out a large number of pigs in a short period.
On the movement of pigs within Lusaka Province, Dr. Mutemwa said his
department has banned the movement from one farm to the other except for
slaughter purposes. He hoped that this would avoid transmission of the
disease in farms that are not infected.
Dr. Mutemwa also announced that the ban on transportation of pigs from
Southern Province at the beginning of the year still stands until further
notice since the area has not yet been certified free of the fever. He
disclosed that the department is currently carrying out a disinfecting
exercise in affected areas.
On Sat 21 Sep 2002, the veterinary department destroyed 1100 pigs which
were suffering from swine fever at Kyundu ranch in Lusaka. A lot more pigs
have died since the disease was discovered on 10 Sep 2002.
Dr. Mutemwa appealed to member of the public to report any pigs they see
loitering to the police station or veterinary office. He also warned
abattoir owners to take precautionary measures to help completely wipe out
the fever.

[Though not specified in the Xinhua news item, it is most likely that the
described disease is African Swine fever (ASF). Classical Swine fever
(CSF), another List A disease, has never been reported in Zambia.
ASF has been reported from Zambia to the International Office of Animal
Diseases (OIE) in each of the last 6 years (during 1997 and 1998 as a
"disease limited to specific zones"). In 2001, 5 outbreaks (1019
cases, 960 mortalities) were reported. From the data on the current
alleged outbreak reported from the Lusaka area, it is not clear if the
diagnosis has been laboratory confirmed.
For further data on the evolution of ASF in the region, see moderator's
