The Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), a rare viral strain popularly known as 'monkey fever', has claimed the life of a 60 year old woman from Mauxi village in Goa, officials said on [Mon 18 Jan 2016]. The victim, from the village in North Goa, 50 km [31 mi] from Panaji, expired at the Goa Medical College Hospital located on the outskirts of Panaji, where she was admitted last week [week of 11 Jan 2016] after the fever worsened.

Confirming the death, Utkarsh Betodkar, state epidemiologist at the Directorate of Health Services, said that screening of villagers of Mauxi in Sattari sub-district has been upped. "Because of the screening, we have discovered more cases, which are being treated now," Betodkar said. Over the last one month, 24 people tested positive for the disease, the official said.

In April last year [2015], a team from the National Centre for Disease Control had visited Pali village in Sattari, after KFD claimed 9 lives in quick succession.

KFD is caused by a similarly named virus which was first identified in 1957, when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur forest in Karnataka [state, India]. Since the time of its discovery, around 400-500 people across western India have been infected by the rare disease, which spreads through ticks, a parasite for which monkeys are common hosts.

The KFD issue was also raised during the winter session of the Goa assembly. Goa's health minister Francis D'Souza has said there was a need to increase awareness about the disease, but also bemoaned the lack of public enthusiasm vis-a-vis the vaccination drive started by the health authorities. "Last year [2015], we had started vaccination which can solve the problem, but the response from the people of these affected villages has not been good," D'Souza said, adding that the disease does not spread from human to human.

[The Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) cases that occurred in Goa in 2015 are continuing into 2016. The previous cases were reported in December 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151228.3896626).

A 17 Apr 2015 report indicated that 18 of 20 samples from Pali villagers from Sattari taluka [sub district], Goa, sent for testing were positive for KFD, which has claimed 4 lives since the 1st death was reported on 4 Mar 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150418.3306895). The report above indicates that there were 24 additional cases in the past month.

As noted in the previous posts, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case fatality rate is 3-5 per cent (see the CDC fact sheet at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html).

Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Although monitoring ticks for KFD virus provides information for issuing alerts, the only means for prevention of infection is avoidance of tick bites.

Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
