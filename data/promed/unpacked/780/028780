Fairfield Medical Center said the person who died from suspected botulism after eating at a Sunday lunch at Cross Pointe Free Will Baptist Church was a 54 year old woman. The Ohio Department of Health says there are now 18 suspected cases of botulism from the church picnic and that the death toll remains at 1. That is down from the 24 sickened people officials announced earlier in the day.

ODH spokeswoman Cassie Bala said there are no confirmed cases of botulism and that all the cases are suspected. "We're pretty sure it's botulism," FMC's Dr Andrew Murry said. "But until all the testing comes back, it's presumed botulism." Bala said another 21 people who were at the lunch have come forward and are under observation. However, they are not exhibiting any symptoms consistent with botulism and are not hospitalized.

ODH spokesman Russ Kennedy said all area hospitals that are treating patients have received doses of the antitoxin needed to treat the victims and reduce their recovery time. Murry said even if the deceased woman had been treated with the antitoxin, which is given intravenously, it probably would not have worked because she was so critically ill.

The Fairfield County Department of Health is trying to find the source of the outbreak. "We've been interviewing patients and family members who were at the event," spokeswoman Jennifer Valentine said. "We're trying to narrow down the sources of the food and send samples our for testing. There are about 20 things on the list we're looking at." She said it's hard to say how long the investigation may take.

On Tuesday, Murry said more deaths are possible and did not back off from that statement Wednesday, 22 Apr 2015. "These people are really ill, and the care is supportive," he said. "And any time somebody has to be on a ventilator for that long a period of time, it's possible they could do badly." Even so, Murry said botulism deaths are rare, taking place in only 3-5 per cent of botulism cases.

There were about 50-60 people at the picnic. Pastor Bill Pitts, on Tue 21 Apr 2015, said the lunch was like any other at the church.

[The equine polyvalent antiserum does not neutralize the botulinum toxin already bound to the neuromuscular junction target, but lessens progression by neutralizing circulating toxin that is not yet bound. Of the 7 serotypes of botulinum toxin in the antitoxin, types A, B, and E are the most likely candidates. Type A appears to be most severe as compared to the other serotypes. Type E is generally associated with foods from marine sources. - Mod.LL]

Severe botulism, the kind that officials suspect killed 1 person and sent more than a dozen to the hospital in Lancaster this week, is extremely rare, but proper food safety can help keep people safe from all types of bacteria.

Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a nerve toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. At least 18 cases of suspected botulism were linked to a Sunday potluck at a Lancaster church. That's a huge spike from 2014 when only 2 cases of foodborne botulism were reported statewide; both were in Hamilton County, Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman Michelle LoParo said.

Nationwide, 160 cases of botulism and 1 related death were reported in 2012, the most recent figures available from the CDC. 3/4 of those cases involved infants; only 25 cases involved foodborne botulism -- the suspected cause of illness in Lancaster.

The incident is likely 1 of the largest USA outbreaks in decades. In 1983, 28 people were hospitalized with botulism in Peoria, Illinois, after eating onions on patty-melt sandwiches. In 1978, 34 people became sick with the illness after eating potato or bean salad at a New Mexico restaurant. In 1977, 58 people had botulism after eating home-canned peppers at a Michigan restaurant.

[When the motoneuron action potential depolarizes the terminal axon, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released into the synaptic cleft. When botulinum toxin (BT) is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT's high selectivity for cholinergic synapses.

After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II. - Mod.LL
