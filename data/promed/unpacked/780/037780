The deadly and often fatal canine disease, distemper, hit the valley
in March 1999 and is spreading in epidemic proportions. "I've
never seen distemper this bad in the valley," Animal Shelter
Supervisor Mary Stage said.
Nearly 40 dogs have contracted the disease in the last 9 months
and only 2 survived with treatment, according to Stage. That's
nearly 95-percent mortality, while national statistics show only half
of the animals affected die.

But even if the virus does not kill or cause illness, dogs may carry
the disease -- infecting other susceptible dogs.

Ridgecrest [in southern California, in the San Diego area animal
shelter officials announced Thursday they will temporarily cease all
adoptions of dogs and puppies to slow the dispersal of the disease
and gain control of the situation.

Ridgecrest Police Chief Bruce Hagerty said animal shelter
staffers didn't want to cause undue trauma to adopting families by
allowing potentially sick animals to leave the shelter as prospective
pets only to fall sick weeks later. But he emphasized the need for
the community to work with animal control, Humane Society and
veterinary officials to end the problem.

"What I hope the community realizes is this is not a shelter
problem, it is a community problem," Stage said. "Dogs having
never set foot in the shelter are dying."

All dogs are at risk because the disease is airborne and can be
spread by animal waste. Infected animals could include stray dogs,
wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, foxes and rodents along with a
neighbor's pet. Though animal care officials could not confirm the
feasibility of cross species infection they suggested area
residents keep dogs confined until they are inoculated.

Shelter officials said animals which are brought to the shelter will
be euthanized if they are not claimed with in 7 days. "The
euthanization will go up over the next couple of months to clear the
illness from the population," Stage said.

Local veterinarians also offered to assist in the inoculation and
treatment. The vaccine costs approximately $15 and protects
animals against several other diseases also.

Meanwhile, animal control officials said they are developing an
inoculation program planned for implementation by mid January.
Every dog brought to the shelter will be vaccinated with funding
from a private donation, but city officials request help from local
donations to help fund clinics so all city animals may receive the
vaccine.

The virus reportedly effects all canine breeds including coyotes but
can remain dormant for as long as 3 weeks. The symptoms include
3 stages. The first stage includes low-level fever, poor appetite,
discharge from eyes and nose. As these symptoms disappear the
second stage begins with high fever, yellow-green discharge,
coughing and hardening of the foot pads. In the final stages many
dogs experience seizures, muscle tremors, paralysis, respiratory
problems, depression and anorexia [not eating.

Though some dogs carry the virus without ever falling ill, those
experiencing symptoms generally die within 2 to 4 weeks of onset
unless given early treatment.

Owners with potentially infected animals should call the animal
shelter to arrange for treatment. Do not bring suspected carrier
dogs to the shelter. [Why is the animal shelter arranging treatment
instead of the owner's veterinarian? - Mod.TG

Veterinary officials said distemper can be treated if caught early.
Still, the best bet is to vaccinate pets.

Veterinarians suggest owners vaccinate dogs annually.
Unvaccinated dogs require a series of preliminary shots before
gaining immunity. Owners of unvaccinated animals should be
cautious where they take pets and which animals they socialize
with. Vaccination is the only thing that can protect them.

Though Stage, Ditzler and the police chief speculated as to the
cause of the outbreak, they remained uncertain.

However, shelter staffers perform daily sanitation procedures
along with weekly pressure cleanings in hope of limiting the spread
of the disease.

[The fact that it is not only in the animal shelter is cause for alarm
with this type of death rate and attack rate. Obviously, this
community is NOT getting routine distemper shots. Why else is the
animal shelter coordinating treatment? In an unvaccinated/
unprotected population, whether owned or stray, animals can get it.
The fact that they are dying in the face of treatment suggests either
1) a very naive population or 2) a mutation in the strain of virus. -
