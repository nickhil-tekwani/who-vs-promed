State wildlife officials suspect a lethal virus spread by gnats is
responsible for killing more than 60 deer recently in southwestern New
Jersey.
The Department of Environmental Protection is testing blood and tissue
samples to determine whether epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, has
returned to New Jersey to attack the animals.
The viral infection, which causes rapid hemorrhaging and shock, appears in
20-year cycles. New Jersey is about due for an outbreak, said Paul Tarlowe,
a wildlife specialist with the state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife.
The 60-plus white-tailed deer were found dead of mysterious circumstances
last month in Salem and Cumberland counties. Eight of the animals were
found floating in one Salem County waterway. Wildlife experts theorize the
desperate animals fled into the water in an effort to cool their severe
fevers.
In 1975, EHD killed about 1,000 deer in Hunterdon, Warren, Morris and
Sussex counties. Twenty years earlier, the virus felled more than 700 deer
in Somerset, Morris and Essex counties.
EHD is neither treatable nor preventable. Greg Huljack, the wildlife
division's deputy law-enforcement chief, said the disease does not wipe out
entire deer herds. EHD outbreaks end with the first frost of autumn. State
officials said EHD is not a danger to humans, livestock or pets.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an acute, infectious, often fatal
viral disease of some wild ruminants. This malady, characterized by
extensive hemorrhages, has been responsible for significant epizootics in
deer in the northern United States and southern Canada.
A similar hemorrhagic disease called bluetongue also occurs throughout the
U.S. and Canada. The two diseases are antigenically different.
The first occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in 1955
when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) succumbed
in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was considered a new
disease of deer and the name ¡epizootic hemorrhagic disease¢ was suggested
to describe its main clinical and pathological features.
Since these initial confirmed outbreaks of EHD, documented epizootics have
occurred in white-tailed deer in South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming and
Alberta, Canada. Suspected EHD outbreaks have occurred in Missouri,
Washington, Nebraska, Iowa and British Columbia. South Dakota, Missouri and
Nebraska have experienced periodic outbreaks of EHD and the disease might
be considered enzootic in these areas.
Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily among
white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O. hemionus_) and
pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have succumbed.
The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ biting fly
or gnat. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated vector
in North America. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers
of deer - as in Michigan, New Jersey and Alberta - is that they are single
epizootics which do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer -
as experienced in South Dakota and Nebraska - occur almost annually, and
the disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks
of EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October) and
have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.
Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are very similar. White-tailed deer
develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A constant
characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose
their appetite and fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often salivate
excessively, develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate, and finally become
unconscious. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the blood results in a blue
appearance of the oral mucosa, hence the name ¢bluetongue¢. Eight to 36
hours following the onset of observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like
state, become prostrate and die.
The gross and histological lesions of EHD have been characterized by
extensive hemorrhage. The hemorrhages range from pin-point to massive in
size, and involve different tissues and organs in individual animals. No
organs appear to be exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly
involved being the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and intestinal tract.
Extensive hemorrhaging is the result of interference with the
blood-clotting mechanism together with degeneration of blood vessel walls.
Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant effect
upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers drastically.
Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild ruminants. The EHD
virus can infect domestic animals but rarely causes disease. In all
probability the virus does not infect humans. Presently there is no
evidence that crosses into humans. (Portions extracted from Roselake
