With intensified efforts this year, Singapore's fight against dengue
appears to have paid off, with 25 percent fewer cases than last year
[2007]. However, a newly emerged _Aedes_ mosquito-borne illness is
causing fresh concerns. Chikungunya cases continued their upward
trend, with more than 40 cases a week in the past 3 weeks.

Of the 43 cases diagnosed last week [week of 14 Dec 2008], 39 caught
the virus locally, while the other 4 imported cases were from
Malaysia. Last Friday [19 Dec 12008], the Ministry of Health made
chikungunya a notifiable disease. Although doctors have already been
informing the ministry of all cases since the end of 2006, when
Singapore saw its 1st imported chikungunya case, the change means
that doctors could be penalised with fines or jail terms for not
doing so. A ministry spokesman said this will enable the ministry to
monitor the disease more closely. A circular has gone out to all
doctors informing them of the change.

The appearance of locally transmitted chikungunya infections in
Singapore this year also worries infectious diseases experts.
Although no one has died of the infection, chikungunya, unlike
dengue, can be very debilitating. There is also the risk that it
could become endemic, which means the disease would be here to stay,
with no chance of wiping it out. The Health Ministry said the disease
has not become endemic yet, as a large number of cases is still from
overseas.

Until this year [2008], the few cases were all imported. But by the
middle of this month [December], 388 people had caught the virus
locally. A further 158 people who were infected were bitten by
mosquitoes while overseas, primarily in Malaysia. The areas where
people here are getting bitten by the _Aedes_ mosquito have also
spread from the northern part of the island to places such as Bedok
Reservoir and Tampines in the east.

Cases have also been on the increase, rising sharply since the end of
July [2008]. Given the current rates of infection, Singapore is
likely to end the year with more than 600 chikungunya cases. A
spokesperson for the National Environment Agency (NEA) said the
_Aedes albopictus_ mosquito, which is the main carrier of this virus,
lives in forests and other heavily vegetated areas.

This makes it "a challenge to remove as many breeding habitats as
possible in such areas," she said. She added that the current rainy
season is unlikely to be the cause of the increased rates. Instead,
it has more to do with "the movement of infected cases and the
susceptibility of the population". The NEA spokesperson said it is
fighting chikungunya the same way it does dengue -- by finding and
destroying mosquito breeding spots and educating the public about
stagnant water.

The best way to stop the spread of the disease is to prevent
mosquitoes from breeding. This year, the National Environment Agency
spent close to 200 000 [USD 138 000] a day and has a team of 500
people doing just that. A mosquito needs just a small spoonful of
stagnant water to breed. The _A. aegypti_ breeds well in indoor
receptacles but the _A. albopictus_ prefers forests and places with
high vegetation.

Those infected should wear long sleeves and long dresses or pants and
use insect repellent to prevent getting bitten again by mosquitoes,
which could continue the chain of transmission.

[Patients recovering from a severe dengue virus infection might
dispute the above statement that their infection was not
debilitating. However, arthralgias following chikungunya virus
infection can, indeed, persist for weeks or even months. The number
of reported chikungunya cases in Singapore has increased from 178
from 1 Jan - 5 Sep 2008, to a predicted 600 by the end of 2008. It is
not surprising that there have been many chikungunya cases imported
from peninsular Malaysia, as there have been about 4000 suspected
cases there (see ProMED archive no. 20081222.4028). The above report
does not indicate if chikungunya virus has been isolated frequently
from _Ae. aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_. If _Ae. albopicturs is indeed
the main vector of chikungunya virus there, rather than the
peridomestic _Ae. aegypti_, reduction of virus transmission will be
difficult indeed.
