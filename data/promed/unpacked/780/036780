Menangle virus is a zoonotic paramyxovirus of pigs first seen in a
large piggery near Sydney Australia in 1997. The virus is
teratogenic and caused widespread mortalities and deformities in
pig foetuses. All other infected pigs showed subclinical infection.
The virus cycled in grower pigs in the multi-age piggery until an
eradication program recently broke the cycle.
Two of 38 piggery workers had high convalescent-phase serum
neutralising antibody titres to Menangle virus of 128 and 512. They
had a recent history of malaise, fever and sweats. Severe
headaches confined the patients to bed for 4 and 10 days.
Lymphadenopathy, a morbilliform rash and weight loss of 3 and 10
kg were also reported. Fortunately the 2 pregnant women at the
piggery did not show evidence of infection.
My laboratory performed serological testing for a range of known
zoonotic porcine diseases of pigs in an experimental
xenotransplant program. Some of the pigs in the program were
derived from the affected piggery prior to the outbreak of Menangle
virus. At the time we did not test for Menangle virus because we did
not know of its existence.
The distibution of Menangle virus worldwide is not known although a
large serological survey throughout Australia failed to find
antibodies in any other pigs.
We decided to withdraw from the xenotransplant program.
