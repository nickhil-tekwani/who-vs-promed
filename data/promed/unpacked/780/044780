[1] Infection source sought

Health officials are raising further questions about the source of the new strain of bird flu infecting humans in China after data indicated that more than half of the patients had no contact with poultry.

The H7N9 virus has been found [as of 19 Apr 2013] in 91 people, including one reported in Jiangsu Province and 3 in Zhejiang Province yesterday [19 Apr 2013], and 17 of them have died.

But it is not clear how people are becoming infected and the World Health Organization [WHO] says there is no evidence of the most worrying scenario -- sustained transmission between people.

The WHO's China representative, Michael O'Leary, issued data yesterday [19 Apr 2013] showing that half of the cases analyzed had no known contact with poultry, the most obvious potential source, but he said it appeared human-to-human transmission was rare.

"This is still an animal virus that occasionally infects humans," he said. "With rare exceptions, we know that people are not getting sick from other people."

Experts say it may be premature to rule in or rule out whether people sick with the virus have been in contact with poultry, and note that contact with wild birds is even more difficult to establish.

A scientific study published last week showed the H7N9 strain was a so-called "triple reassortant" virus with a mixture of genes from 3 other flu strains found in birds in Asia. One of those 3 strains is thought to have come from a brambling, a type of small wild bird [see ProMED-mail postings 20130418.1655718, 20130418.1655610, and 20130417.1652959].

An international team of epidemiologists and other experts led by the WHO and Chinese government officials will visit live chicken markets and hospitals over the next several days in Shanghai and Beijing.

Some bird samples have tested positive and China has culled thousands of birds and shut down some live poultry markets.

China's poultry sector has recorded losses of more than 10 billion yuan (USD 1.6 billion) since reports of the new flu surfaced 2 weeks ago.

Chinese experts have so far found no H7N9 virus on wild birds in places where human infections have been reported.

Laboratory tests showed 861 of the 1300 samples collected in Shanghai, Beijing, and the eastern provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui were negative, while the rest are still being examined.

[Some questions arise:
1. From which animal species/locations have the mentioned 1300 samples been collected?
2. What kind(s) of samples were collected?
3. Which tests were performed?
4. Have samples been collected also from other parts of China apart from the 5 territories mentioned? Where from?

Details will be gratefully welcomed. - Mod.AS]

[2] Wetlands closed, birdwatching suspended

With the rise of human H7N9 infections and the virus's source still unclear, the bird flu outbreak is troubling domestic bird enthusiasts.

"Emotionally, I feel we have become increasingly distant from the birds after being forbidden from entering wetlands," said Guo Fuxiang, president of the Bird Protection Association of the city of Tianjin [north east China; [see map at http://tinyurl.com/bmc9afw].

Guo said tourists used to be allowed to watch or take photos of wild birds in the wetlands. But now, they are banned from entering wetlands in Dagang.

"The wetlands in Dagang are an important migratory bird path and therefore a highly dangerous area for the H7N9 virus," said Yang Jiwen, director of the Dagang Wildlife Protection Station.

"For the sake of the tourists' safety, we have to keep them away from the wetlands," he said.

Higher temperatures are bringing migratory birds back to north China. Spring is usually a peak season for bird-watching, with related activities held across the country.

However, birdwatchers have had to keep a distance from the animals in the wake of the H7N9 outbreak, which has resulted in 17 deaths thus far.

Authorities in Tianjin have not only banned tourists from entering the Dagang wetlands, but also prohibited the act of freeing birds, another common springtime event.

In Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, no swans can be seen on West Lake, as they have been sent to a local zoo to keep them away from humans.

A birdwatching event has been postponed in the city of Shanghai as well.

"Based on current research, infection may only occur when someone has close contact with infected poultry. It is safe for tourists to watch wild birds from a distance," said Zhang Zhengwang, secretary-general of the China Ornithological Society.

Zhang said experts have yet to prove that migratory birds are responsible for spreading the virus.

The virus has not been detected in 861 samples of wild fowl collected in the affected provinces, the State Forestry Administration said [see comment to item 1 above].

Keepers of carrier pigeons have also been affected. Xing Zhiqiang, who runs a carrier pigeon club in Tianjin, said his pigeons seem less energetic since local authorities ordered them to be kept in their cages.

"A rumor that pigeons are the source of H7N9 has been popular in our community. My neighbors always complain about my birds," Xing said.

All of Beijing's domesticated bird markets have been shut down temporarily.

"Half a month ago, the manager of the market ordered me to close my shop because of H7N9. I had to send all the birds back to my hometown in Hebei Province," said a woman who owns a bird shop in Beijing's Guanyuan flower and bird market.

"Although there is the threat of H7N9 and other bird flu viruses, we can't live a harmonious life without birds. Separating humans from birds completely is an overreaction," Zhang said.

[3] Support for poultry farmers

A top agricultural official said Friday [19 Apr 2013] that the government should support poultry farms that are up to quarantine standards to prevent them from being financially devastated by the H7N9 avian flu epidemic.

Large-sized distributors should be encouraged to buy poultry products from qualified farms at protective prices, Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu said while visiting a poultry company in Beijing.

The government should coordinate credit support for major poultry farms and processors, as well as find ways to provide insurance for the farms, Han said.

He also called for subsidies for businesses that provide breeding hens in order to guarantee supplies when the poultry market picks up after the epidemic.

The poultry business is a significant source of income for Chinese farmers, but recent fears over human infections of the H7N9 virus have had a huge impact on the industry and sent prices tumbling, Han said.

H7N9-infected fowl have been found in live poultry markets but not in poultry farms and slaughterhouses, as nationwide tests have shown [Details will be appreciated; see comment to item 1 above. - Mod.AS]

The test results demonstrated that the virus can be controlled and that it's safe to consume poultry products from markets and stores that pass quarantine inspections, Han said.

Local authorities need to further expand epidemic surveillance and step up quarantine measures, the minister noted.

[4] Duck catering affected

Roast Peking duck restaurants have seen a sharp drop in business because of the ongoing bird flu scare.

DaDong Food & Beverage Investment Co Ltd has seen its business fall 15 percent since the bird flu outbreak last month [March 2013], said Dong Zhenxiang, Da Dong Peking Roast Duck Restaurant owner.

But he said the restaurants are not worried because duck dishes are only part of the menu, and the reduction of orders for duck will not affect their business on a large scale.

Also, he said, Da Dong sources its ducks from Beijing Golden Star Duck Center, and he trusts the safety of ducks provided by the company based on his experience working with it in past years.

"Their quarantine and epidemic prevention management are rather mature," Dong said.

Beijing Golden Star Duck Center also provides ducks to such large roast duck restaurants as China Quanjude Group and Duck King.

After dealing with long lines at the DaDong Peking Roast Duck Restaurant in the past, Zhu Hong and her family were surprised to find one of its upmarket restaurants in the downtown Wangfujing area only half-full on Wednesday [17 Apr 2013]. "The VIP rooms are almost empty," Zhu said.

Meanwhile, shares of Quanjude, a brand with 136 years experience in making roast duck, have plummeted 17.05 percent in 12 trading days, despite company assurances that the safety of its ducks is guaranteed.

Feng Zijian, director of the health emergency center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Beijing Times there is no proof that processed and cooked chicken and eggs can lead to infection with the H7N9 virus.

Catering industry leaders have been more optimistic about the effect of the spreading influenza caused by poultry.

"We haven't seen much of a negative impact on the catering business as a result of bird flu," said Bian Jiang, assistant director of the China Cuisine Association.

Government transparency on bird flu infection cases has eased public worries about the outbreak, Bian said.

Bian said the loss of business at some high-end restaurants is more due to the government's new rules that ban spending at luxury restaurants with public funds.

The drop in sales at high-end restaurants shows the rules have been effective in curbing consumption by officials, said Sheng Laiyun, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, on Monday [15 Apr 2013].

In the 1st 2 months of this year [2013], Quanjude's revenue was down 3 percent. According to Quanjude's annual report in 2012, the company's profits rose 12.73 percent year-on-year to 216 million yuan (USD 34.9 million). The number of customers grew only 1.22 percent, to 7.56 million.

To reduce the risk from bird flu, the China Cuisine Association has asked restaurants to pay attention to product hygiene during purchasing and production.

It is important to increase cooking time and raise boiling temperatures, Bian said. Adjusting the percentage of poultry dishes on the menu also will reduce the risk, he added.

For roast-duck lovers bird flu is not a worry. "I don't think the H7N9 virus can survive the high temperature in the hot oven," said [a customer] who ordered a roast duck.

[While raised cooking temperatures and application of other strict sanitary measures within catering enterprises are to be praised, it is not clear which observations on farms can detect H7N9 risks, since infection is, reportedly, sub-clinical.

The human cases seem to be rather sporadic though spread within a wide area, some of them in clusters. They, unfortunately, and not animals are the sentinels in the current epidemic. The reservoir of the virus and its main source for human infection are yet to be elucidated. - Mod.AS
