A total of 3 more people have been struck down by listeriosis after eating soft cheese. The cases in New South Wales (NSW) follow 7 cases last week. They bring the total number of people affected nationwide to 21. 2 Australians have died and a pregnant woman has miscarried following the outbreak.

The people ate cheese produced by the Jindi Cheese Company that has since been recalled. Tests are still under way to confirm a direct link with the current outbreak, according to NSW Health. Jindi has voluntarily recalled all batches of cheese manufactured up to and including 6 Jan 2013. It follows an earlier recall of Brie and Camembert cheeses on 19 Dec 2012 after the 1st cases were identified.

Listeria has a 70-day incubation period so new cases could still emerge.

NSW Health acting director of health protection Professor Wayne Smith said all of the recent cases involved people aged over 65 with one person in a serious condition. "These cases highlight the need for people to check their fridges to see if they have any of the recalled cheeses and discard or return to the place of purchase any cheese that is on the list of recalled products," he said in a statement. "If the brand or best before date is unknown, do not consume the cheese, rather it should be discarded," he said.

Listeria is a bacteria that can affect a number of food products but particularly soft cheeses including Brie and Camembert. The infection may cause minor or no symptoms in healthy individuals but can be particularly dangerous for the elderly, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems, such as cancer patients. Early symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness, aches and pains.

[For a discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in 4 prior ProMED-mail posts last year (2012):
Listeriosis - New Zealand: (HB) nosocomial, fatal 20120720.1209143;
Listeriosis - UK (02): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, comment 20120418.1105643;

Listeriosis - USA: (NJ), perinatal 20120316.1072439.

The total number of cases has risen from 8 when last posted on ProMED-mail (Listeriosis - Australia: cheese, recall 20121219.1459159) to 21, now with 2 deaths and one miscarriage. This outbreak has occurred nationwide and the last recall of cheeses apparently has been relatively recent, but the exact date of this recall was not specified in the news report. With an incubation period of up to 70 days, more cases of listeriosis associated with this outbreak can be expected.

The news report says that "people [with listeriosis] ate cheese produced by the Jindi Cheese Company that has since been recalled" and "tests are still under way to confirm a direct link [of the recalled cheeses] with the current outbreak," probably by matching the genotype of the isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ from patients with that of any isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ from the recalled cheeses.

The Australian mainland is made up of 5 states (Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales), and 3 territories (Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, and Jarvis Bay Territory), with the 6th island state of Tasmania to the south of the mainland. In addition, there are 6 island territories, known as external territories, and the Australian Antarctic Territory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia). A map of Australia showing its states and territories can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia.
