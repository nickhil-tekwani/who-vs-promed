ASF Threatens More Than 90 000 Pigs in Northern Malawi
------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development under Mzuzu
Agricultural Development Division says a suspected outbreak of African
swine fever [ASF] has occurred in Rumphi and Mzimba Districts putting
at risk a total of 92 000 pigs.

According to the department 5000 pigs valued at MK25 million [USD 166
664] have already died. ASF is a viral disease affecting both domestic
and wild pigs. It is highly contagious.

The affected areas include Chiweta, Mhuju, Nchenachena, Bolero and
Katowo in Rumphi and Emfeni in Mzimba. So far 4600 pigs in Rumphi and
365 pigs in Mzimba have died due to the suspected outbreak, Nyasa
Times reports.

Typically pigs with swine fever have difficulty walking, breathe
abnormally and have a bluish chest, Chief Animal Health Officer Jacob
Mwasinga said.

Mr Mwasinga said swine fever which was detected in Tanzania 3 months
ago crossed over to Malawi through illegal transportation of pigs or
pork.

"In Karonga and Chitipa districts which border Tanzania about 6000
pigs have died. So far there is no vaccination but we bar the
transportation of pigs or pork but we have not been successful because
the disease is here in Mzimba district about 225Km [140 miles] from
Karonga," he said

Mr Mwasinga said they have enlisted the help of the police to ensure
that pigs or pork are not transported from one area to another.

"There is no effect on people who eat meat from infected animals
apart from the fact that they become [mechanical] carriers of the
disease and can easily pass it on if they enter a pig sty or come into
contact with pigs," he explained.
