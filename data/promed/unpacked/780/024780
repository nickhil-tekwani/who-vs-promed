[1] Pfizer vaccine possible side effect
Date: Thu 15 Apr 2021

Herpes zoster reactivation -- a.k.a. shingles -- following COVID-19 vaccination in 6 patients with comorbid autoimmune/inflammatory diseases may be a new adverse event associated with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine, suggested a new report.

At 2 centers in Israel, there have been 6 cases of herpes zoster developing shortly after administration of the Pfizer vaccine in patients with disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis since December 2020, according to Victoria Furer, MD, of Tel Aviv University, and colleagues.

Little has been known about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines among patients with rheumatic diseases, because immunosuppressed individuals were not included in the initial clinical trials, they explained.

Accordingly, an observational study has been conducted at the Tel Aviv Medical Center and the Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, monitoring post-vaccination adverse events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and myositis. This interim analysis included 491 patients and 99 controls, with events reported during the 6-week post-vaccination monitoring period. The prevalence among patients was 1.2% versus none in controls, Furer and colleagues reported in Rheumatology.

"We haven't seen any additional cases so far," Furer told MedPage Today. However, "further surveillance of potential adverse effects following anti-COVID-19 vaccination in patients with rheumatic diseases is warranted," she added.

The Cases
Case 1 was a 44-year-old woman with Sjogren's syndrome who was being treated with hydroxychloroquine. She had a history of varicella and had not received a shingles vaccine. Three days after the 1st dose of the vaccine, she developed a vesicular skin rash with pruritus, along with low back pain and headache. The symptoms resolved spontaneously within the subsequent 3 weeks without treatment, and she was given the 2nd dose 4 weeks after the 1st.

Case 2 was a 56-year-old woman with a long history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis who had received a variety of biologics and had achieved low disease activity with tofacitinib (Xeljanz) beginning in 2014. She had a history of varicella and had not been given the shingles vaccine. After the 1st dose of the vaccine, she reported malaise and headache, and 4 days after the shot she developed severe pain in the left eye and forehead, along with a rash along the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the V cranial nerve -- herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Ocular examination revealed hyperemic conjunctivitis sparing the cornea. She was given a 2-week course of acyclovir and analgesics, and symptoms gradually cleared by 6 weeks. Tofacitinib was withdrawn for 2 weeks, but she did not experience an arthritis flare. She declined the 2nd dose.

Case 3 was a 59-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis who had not responded to several biologic therapies and baricitinib (Olumiant), but 6 months earlier she initiated treatment with upadacitinib (Rinvoq) plus prednisone 5 mg/day and had a partial response. She had a history of varicella and had been given the live attenuated zoster vaccine in 2019. Two days after receiving the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine, she reported pain and had a vesicular skin rash on the lower abdomen, inguinal area, buttock, and thigh, and was given valacyclovir. The antiviral was given for 3 days but was discontinued because of adverse effects, and the skin lesions healed slowly over a course of 6 weeks. The upadacitinib had been discontinued with the zoster eruption, and she experienced a severe rheumatoid arthritis disease flare affecting multiple joints, and her arthritis treatment was subsequently switched to etanercept (Enbrel).

Case 4 was a 36-year-old woman with a long history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis plus interstitial lung disease. For the previous 2 years she had been treated with rituximab (Rituxan), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), and prednisone in doses of 7 mg/day. She had a history of varicella and had not been given the shingles vaccine. Ten days after receiving the 1st COVID-19 vaccine dose, she reported pain and a vesicular rash on the abdomen and back along the T10 dermatome and was given acyclovir for 7 days. The rash resolved within 6 weeks, and she was given the 2nd vaccine dose 4 weeks after the 1st. She had no further adverse effects to the vaccine and did not experience a rheumatic disease flare.

Case 5 was a 38-year-old woman with undifferentiated connective tissue disease and antiphospholipid syndrome who was being treated with aspirin and hydroxychloroquine. She had prior varicella exposure and had not received the shingles vaccine. Two weeks after receiving the 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, she developed an itchy vesicular rash on the right breast and was given a week's course of acyclovir. Her zoster symptoms resolved within 3 weeks, and she received the 2nd vaccine dose on schedule with no further side effects or disease flare.

Case 6 was a 61-year-old woman with a long history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, who was being treated with tocilizumab (Actemra) and prednisone 5 mg/day at the time of the 1st dose of the vaccine. Two weeks later, a rash appeared along the T6 dermatome, and she was given valacyclovir for a week, which resulted in resolution of zoster symptoms within 10 days. However, she did report a mild flare of arthritis, and the prednisone dose was increased to 7.5 mg/day. The 2nd dose was given uneventfully as scheduled.

Patterns and mechanisms
Furer and colleagues noted that there had been no reports of herpes zoster in the clinical trials of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and that, to their knowledge, this is the 1st case series of these events among patients with autoimmune/inflammatory diseases.

The pattern of disease was relatively mild, with no patients experiencing disseminated disease or post-herpetic neuralgia. It was notable, the researchers pointed out, that one case was in a patient who had received the shingles vaccine 2 years before the COVID-19 vaccination.

"Cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in the prevention of varicella zoster virus reactivation. Declining cell-mediated immunity with age or disease is associated with a reduction in varicella zoster virus-specific T cells, disrupting immune surveillance and increasing the risk of reactivation, with age being the major risk factor for 90% of cases of herpes zoster," the researchers wrote. Nonetheless, these cases were among relatively young women, whose mean age was 49 and whose rheumatic disease was mild or stable.

Other factors are also likely to have been involved. For instance, the risk of herpes zoster in the rheumatic disease population is higher than healthy individuals, with a pooled incidence rate ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 2.4-3.3). In addition, the risk among patients with rheumatoid arthritis specifically has been estimated to be 2-fold higher than in the general population.

Further raising risk are increased levels of disease activity and high doses of prednisone. Moreover, double the risk of herpes zoster has been reported for patients being treated with JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib, as was the case with 2 patients in this series.

COVID-19 infection itself has been linked with varicella-like rashes, suggesting that the infection can interfere with the activation and function of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, which can influence immunity against viruses.

"Potential mechanisms that might explain the pathogenetic link between mRNA-COVID-19 vaccination and herpes zoster reactivation are related to stimulation of innate immunity through toll-like receptors," the researchers wrote. They also noted that the vaccine can stimulate type I interferons and cytokines that can interfere with antigen expression.

A limitation of this analysis was that the diagnosis of herpes zoster was made solely on clinical grounds. Also, with only a small number of cases, causality cannot be assumed.

"Abstract

"Objectives
As global vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 disease commence, vaccine safety needs to be closely assessed. The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness to reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD.

"Methods
The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in 2 Rheumatology departments in Israel.

"Results
The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49 +/- 11 years with stable AIIRD: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4), Sjogren's syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the 1st in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the 1st vaccine dose in 5 cases and after the 2nd vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of HZ-related symptoms up to 6 weeks. Five patients completed the 2nd vaccine dose without other adverse effects.

"Conclusion
Epidemiologic studies on the safety of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in patients with AIIRD are needed to clarify the association between the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and reactivation of zoster."

"Discussion
...Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, varicella-like exanthem (13) and HZ (14-21) have been globally reported in the context of COVID-19 infection. The suggested pathogenetic mechanism relates to an observation that SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage the function of CD4+ T cells and promote excessive activation and possibly subsequent exhaustion of CD8+ T cells (22). Together, these perturbations of T cell subsets may eventually diminish host antiviral immunity (23). Potential mechanisms that might explain the pathogenetic link between mRNA-COVID19 vaccination and HZ reactivation are related to stimulation of innate immunity through toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3,7 by mRNA-based vaccines (24). TLR signaling has been implicated during reactivation of herpesviruses, a process essential for these viruses to maintain themselves in the host (25). Defects in TLR expression in patients suffering from diseases caused directly by herpesvirus infection highlight the importance of these signaling pathways during infection and eventual disease progression (25). The vaccine stimulates induction of type I INFs and potent inflammatory cytokines, which instigate T and B immune responses but may negatively affect antigen expression potentially contributing to HZ reactivation."

This is an important study because it takes a step towards filling the gap regarding immunosuppressed individuals who were not included in vaccine clinical trials. While no unvaccinated individuals with comorbid autoimmune/ inflammatory diseases were included in this small observational study, controls who likely were not immunosuppressed and vaccinated were included and did not experience varicella-like exanthem (13) or HZ (14-21) in this case series, but numbers were low. Fortunately, the events were mild and resolved themselves, but it is important to keep track of this potential side effect to advise individuals with such diseases. The phenomenon is not new, as HZ reactivation was reported following trivalent influenza, hepatitis A, and rabies vaccines, suggesting vaccine-modulated immunomodulation (4).

Here is one of the papers that the above paper addresses:
Heneghan CJ, Spencer EA, Brassey J, et al.: SARS-CoV-2 and the role of airborne transmission: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: 1 not approved]; F1000Research. 2021; 10:232 https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.52091.1.

Abstract
Background: Airborne transmission is the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in the air. We carried out a systematic review to identify, appraise, and summarise the evidence from studies of the role of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: We searched LitCovid, MedRxiv, Google Scholar, and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 Feb to 20 Dec 2020 and included studies on airborne transmission. Data were dual extracted, and we assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool.

Results: We included 67 primary studies and 22 reviews on airborne SARS-CoV-2. Of the 67 primary studies, 53 (79%) reported data on RT-PCR air samples, 12 report cycle threshold values and 18 copies per sample volume. All primary studies were observational and of low quality. The research often lacked standard methods, standard sampling sizes, and reporting items. We found 36 descriptions of different air samplers deployed. Of the 42 studies conducted in-hospital that reported binary RT-PCR tests, 24 (57%) reported positive results for SARs-CoV-2 (142 positives out of 1403 samples: average 10.1%, range 0% to 100%). There was no pattern between the type of hospital setting (ICU versus non-ICU) and RT-PCR positivity. Seventeen studies reported potential air transmission in the outdoors or in the community. Seven performed RT-PCR sampling, of which 2 studies report weak positive RNA samples for 2 or more genes (5 of 125 samples positive: average 4.0%). Ten studies attempted viral culture with no serial passage for viral culture.

Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected intermittently in the air in various settings. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on airborne transmission are needed. The lack of recoverable viral culture samples of SARS-CoV-2 prevents firm conclusions over airborne transmission.

[2b(i)] Recent superspreader events suggesting airborne transmission

B.1.1.7 variant linked to 100-plus person 'superspreader' outdoor party near Maple Creek, Sask.

[Comment by Mod.LK on this report, which was posted yesterday:

The large number of cases at this single event strongly suggest airborne transmission of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 variant. The gathering of people in large crowds, many of whom are not vaccinated, is a major barrier to stopping virus spread, but this is difficult to control when everyone is anxious to be together with others after the long 'lockdown' period. To counter this, masks and physical distancing should be required, the latter almost impossible with large crowds. Epidemiologically, airborne spread is the most likely explanation for such high transmissibility. - Mod.LK]

[2b(ii)] Australia: church singing
Date: 21 Jun 2021 early release

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/6/21-0465_article


Ref. Katelaris AL, Wells J, Clark P, et al.: Epidemiologic Evidence for Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during Church Singing, Australia, 2020. Emerg Infec Dis. 27(6). June 2021; DOI: 10.3201/eid2706.210465.

Abstract
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection occurred among church attendees after an infectious chorister sang at multiple services. We detected 12 secondary case-patients. Video recordings of the services showed that case-patients were seated in the same section, up to 15 m [49 ft] from the primary case-patient, without close physical contact, suggesting airborne transmission.

Conclusions
We detected 12 secondary case-patients linked to an infectious case-patient at church services on 2 days. Secondary case-patients were seated in the same area of the church, up to 15 m [49 ft] from the primary case-patient, with whom there was no evidence of close physical contact. We believe that transmission during this outbreak is best explained by airborne spread, potentially the result of by 3 factors. 1st, singing has been demonstrated to generate more respiratory aerosol particles and droplets than talking (7). 2nd, minimal ventilation might have enabled respiratory particles to accumulate in the air, and convection currents might have carried particles toward the pews where secondary case-patients were seated. 3rd, the primary case-patient was likely near the peak of infectiousness on the basis of low Ct values (8) and symptom onset occurring around the exposure dates (9). Although we cannot completely exclude fomite transmission, this transmission would not explain the spatial clustering of case-patients within the church over 2 days.

This cluster occurred despite adherence to guidelines requiring microphone use and a 3 m [9.8 ft] cordon around singers. Guidelines for places of worship were tightened after this cluster was detected, including increasing the distance required around a singer to 5 m [16.4 ft]. However additional mitigation measures might be necessary to prevent airborne infection during church services and singing, including increased natural or artificial ventilation (12) or moving activities outdoors.

[As with the other superspreader events, the interpretation of means of spread is circumstantial. Animal studies in the laboratory also provide evidence of airborne transmission with cage-to-cage transfer of virus. Genetic analysis supports spread from a single source to multiple individuals, but that does not confirm airborne transmission. If isolation of virus is not successful, this should not disprove the hypothesis. In mosquito- and tick-borne virus surveillance, frequently infectious virus cannot be isolated even with repeated passage in cell culture, when RT-PCR cycle threshold values are high (less virus). - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, India (275 306), Turkey (55 802), Brazil (42 937), and the USA (32 335) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9049 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 16 Apr 2021 to late 17 Apr 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include India, Turkey, Brazil, the USA, France (29 344), Iran (21 644), Columbia (16 871), Argentina (16 267), Germany (13 123), Italy (12 688), Poland (12 151), Ukraine (10 282), and Philippines (10 081). A total of 54 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 54 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 13.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 0.21%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 2.4% decrease in daily reported cases and 25.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approximately 700 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 141.99 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.03 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
