[The addition of these 3 newly confirmed cases and one death of a previously confirmed case brings the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2019 to 140 including 31 deaths (reported case fatality rate 22.1 percent). All 3 of the newly confirmed cases are classified as primary cases, with one giving a history of camel contact. These latest cases involved 2 from Riyadh city in Riyadh region and one from Jeddah city in Makkah region.

It appears as though the person-to-person transmission cycles of recent weeks has been interrupted, with the most recent secondary case having a date of confirmation report on 17 Apr 2019, one day shy of 2 incubation periods prior to today (14 May 2019).

MERS situation update, April 2019
----------------------------
At the end of April 2019, a total of 2428 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 838 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 34.5%), were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (2037 cases, including 760 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 37.3%). During the month of April [2019], a total of 29 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported globally. All the 29 cases were reported from Saudi Arabia with 11 associated deaths.

This month [April 2019], Saudi Arabia has not reported any new cases related to the Wadi Aldwaser city outbreak. The outbreak has presumed to have stopped due to the effective response measures taken by Saudi Arabia. The country reported a new outbreak this month, in Al-Khafji city and one of its hospitals, with 13 reported cases and 6 associated deaths. The cases are linked to 2 clusters: the 1st cluster has 10 cases (and 3 deaths) including 5 health care workers that contracted the infection in the hospital (with one death), 3 hospital acquired cases (with 2 deaths), and one household contact.

The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of reported cases, when compared during the same corresponding period of 2013 to 2019, do not show any significant difference or change, except for the increase in the number of secondary cases and healthcare worker cases due to the current hospital outbreak.

The age group 50-59 years continues to be at highest risk for acquiring infection of primary cases. The age group 30-39 years is most at risk for secondary cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age group 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.

[According to the above update, the global total of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO since 2012 is 2428, including 838 deaths (reported case fatality rate 34.5 percent), with 2037 or 83.9 percent of the cases having been reported by Saudi Arabia. I look forward to seeing an updated spreadsheet of reported cases, as it appears as though my own spreadsheet is missing 7 cases, (I show only 22 cases reported in April 2019 and 12 cases reported from Al-Khafji during the month of April 2019 and one reported in the end of March 2019).

For those interested in the updated tables and graphs of this outbreak, I strongly recommend going to the original source URL. - Mod.MPP]
