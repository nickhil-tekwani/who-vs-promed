There followed a list of references none of which offered, from the
abstracts, a single but of *evidence* that antibiotic use in animals was
implicated in resistance. It would be very interesting to know what
antibiotics are included in american cattle feedlot diets, and how this
relates to the pattern if resistance seen in EC O157. It seems to be
generally agreed that European cattle have a tiny exposure to
antibiotics, and yet ECO157 is apparently resistant in Europe.
I am afraid that blaming animal usage incorrectly may well turn out to
be a dangerous delusion. As far as I can see resistance occurrs most
widely where antibiotics are most used, and where multiple antibiotics
are used we see the widest resistance. Hospitals and TB sufferers being
very good examples. We find resistance to malarial drugs worse where
they are used the most. The only way to reduce resistance is to use
antibiotics less, but they are most needed where the problem is worst.
We have had fifty years of protection from bacterial infection. This is
a good run. However I understand that very little work is being carried
out by pharmaceutical companies on new ones and one suspects that they
will be more toxic than the old. I hope the world is getting prepared
for a big problem that banning use in animals will not prevent at all.

Regarding the apparent association of antibiotics and the production of the
SLT toxin of E. coli O157:H7, this may be the result of release due to cell
lysis; SLT=shiga-like toxin, this is the toxin that is produced by E. coli
O157:H7 and is likely the agent that causes hemolytic uremic syndrome. This
clearly would be assumed with beta lactams.
The fact that Ciprofloxacin is effective in increasing toxin might also be a
release issue. Cells treated with ciprofloxacin form long filaments and
these may be more prone to lysis. Since ciprofloxacin is an inducer of the
SOS response in E. coli, there could be increase if the toxin's promoter is
normally part of this response (or an element similarly regulated by SOS).
