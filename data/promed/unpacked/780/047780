Bluetongue disease has been diagnosed in a beef farm in the canton of
Bern in Switzerland on 28 Oct 2007. Six out of 19 bovines have tested
positive for BT virus (BTV). One animal had to be put down because of
severe clinical disease.

A 20-km protection zone has been established around the affected holding.

Most probably, the BTV involved is BTV-8, similar to the one spread
throughout neighboring France and Germany. A laboratory confirmation
is expected.

Switzerland has become Europe's 8th country infected by BTV-8. The
others are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and UK. - Mod.AS]
