Locals in Uplistsikhe, in Georgia's Kartli region, threaten that they will block the central highway near Gori because sheep that [were] returned from Jordan [are] dying from an unknown disease.

Teo Tlashadze, member of the local council in Gori, told Interpress News that tens of thousands of sheep were sent to Jordan a few weeks ago but were rejected for unclear reasons. The sheep were then returned. Farmers now claim their sheep are infected with a disease and that thousands of them have died.

Tlashadze said a few days ago that the sheep have been examined, but people don't know the results yet. "People are in panic because tens of thousands of sheep died, and they had to bury the sheep in pits." She said they want help from the government, otherwise they plan to block the highway.

[The accurate numbers of sick/dead animals, the morbidity/mortality percentages, and their relevance to the travel history of the animals are in need of clarification.

What are the clinical symptoms/post mortem findings? What are the age, breed, sex of the susceptible population and of the affected animals? Are these males (for immediate slaughter/fattening), breeding female animals, otherwise, or mixed? Any medical treatments applied prior or during the travel (drenching, spraying, vaccinations)? What were the dates of export/import? The mode of transportation? Density on vehicles? Reason of rejection? Last but not least: What was the diagnosis?! - Mod.AS
