["HPAI H5N6 viruses first emerged in China in 2013 and have been reported by several Asian countries. The Asian lineage H5N6 causes severe clinical signs in poultry and associated mortality. The outbreaks in these countries have led to significant destruction of poultry for control measures by the veterinary authorities. This group of H5N6 viruses has also been associated with human infection, including a number of deaths."

Viet Nam's HPAI control policy is based upon stamping out. - Mod.CRD
