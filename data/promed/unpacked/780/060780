_Pepper chat fruit viroid_ intercepted by quarantine in traded tomato seed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
_Pepper chat fruit viroid_ (PCFVd) was intercepted by Australian quarantine authorities in shipments of tomato seed sent from countries in the Middle East and Asia in recent weeks. Samples from the shipments were tested by reverse transcription PCR and genetic sequences were matched to PCFVd sequences in the international databases.

The test results showed that very small numbers of PCFVd infected seeds were mixed with many thousands of healthy seeds in some shipments, confirming the need for sensitive testing of large seed samples.

Contaminated shipments intercepted were destroyed or re-exported. Australian authorities have not intercepted PCFVd before and have not detected it in field surveys. Australia has been testing for _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) for some years and has recently validated detection of pospiviroids in tomato seed using generic PCR primers.

More details about this detection will be published shortly on the website of the International Plant Protection Convention (https://www.ippc.int/index.php).

[_Pepper chat fruit viroid_ (PCFVd; genus _Pospiviroid_, type member _Potato spindle tuber viroid_) was described in 2009 as a new pathogen from glasshouse grown capsicum (_Capsicum annuum_) crops in the Netherlands (see link below). Symptoms on capsicum may include up to 50 per cent reduction in fruit size; distortion, discolouration, and necrosis of leaves; and stunting of plants. The viroid can also infect tomatoes (leaf necrosis and distortion) and potatoes (spindly tubers, leaf necrosis), and probably additional solanaceous crop and weed species.

PCFVd can be spread with infected plant material (including tissue cultures), by seed and mechanical means. Information on possible insect transmission does not appear to be available yet. Disease management may include plant hygiene measures (removal of pathogen reservoirs), crop rotation, and use of certified clean seed and other propagation materials.

Previously, infected tomato seeds were suspected as sources of serious PSTVd outbreaks, for example, in Western Australia (ProMED-mail post 20101201.4322) and the USA (ProMED-mail post 20101117.4174) when PSTVd certification schemes appeared to have failed. Quarantine measures based on reliable diagnostic methods, as mentioned above, are needed to prevent viroid introductions into new areas.
