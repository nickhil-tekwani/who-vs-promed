Five people diagnosed with anthrax in Black Sea village
-------------------------------------------------------
Five people have been diagnosed with anthrax in the Black Sea province of Giresun this week, with authorities undertaking medical examinations in the neighborhood.

Four people were diagnosed with anthrax in the village of Ortakoy in the Yaglidere district on [3 Jun 2015]. Two of them were sent to Ankara for further tests and medication. On [4 Jun 2015], one more person from the same village was diagnosed with anthrax and hospitalized immediately, Giresun public health department head sagligi [health. - Mod.SH] Dr Fazil Ozden said.

"Our health teams did medical checks on everyone in the village, particularly those who had contact with animals. We did not detect anyone infected with this disease," said Ozden. The Giresun Food, Agriculture and Breeding Directorate said in a written statement [3 Jun 2015] that the 4 infected people worked as cattle slaughterers and went to a health center on [26 May 2015] due to lesions on their skin.

The statement said that the disease might have come to the village via straw brought from outside Giresun province, adding that all animals in the village had undergone medical screenings and showed no sign of the disease.

[There is no mention in this report of any significant veterinary investigation but there is a picture of someone injecting a young heifer. I would be more impressed if they had retroactively vaccinated all the cattle in that village. That no sick animals were found is not unlikely as the slaughtermen had probably butchered an infected carcass around 20-21 May 2015 and it was long gone by 3 and 4 Jun 2015. Of course if someone had had a quiet word to find out who had had an animal slaughtered and butchered then by this time all would have been revealed. And the district veterinarian needs to make sure this village's cattle are vaccinated next spring and the year after to prevent a recurrence.

These cutaneous lesions are characteristically on the hands and forearms. Photo of typical eschar on finger: http://www.uwyo.edu/vetsci/undergraduates/courses/patb_4110/1-10/class_4.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
