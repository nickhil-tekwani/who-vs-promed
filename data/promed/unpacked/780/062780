A 33 year old man returned home to the Australian state of Victoria on 11
Mar 2006, after a 3 week holiday to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria
and France. On 17 Mar 2006, he developed symptoms typical of measles,
including a maculopapular rash, fever, dry cough and coryza. Measles IgM
serology was positive, and viral RNA was recovered from a combined nose and
throat swab collected 5 days after the onset of illness.

Infection during a short stopover in Singapore on the return flight was
discounted since this occurred outside the accepted incubation period of
measles (7-21 days [1]). Standard molecular analysis identified measles
virus genotype B3 [2]. Recent reports from Europe have documented
transmission of this genotype, supporting the hypothesis that the patient
was infected while in Europe between 25 Feb and 11 Mar [3-6].
Epidemiological investigation initially linked the patient's virus strain
to one of the countries that he visited. The patient traveled by train
between Munich and Zurich, during which he disembarked at Stuttgart station
for several minutes, suggesting a link to an outbreak in the Stuttgart area
of infections of the B3 strain of measles[3]. [The current status of the
measles outbreak in Germany can be found in an article in the 11 May 2006
edition of Eurosurveillance Weekly
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2006/060511.asp>. - Mod.CP]

The nucleotide sequences of genotype B3 strains circulating in Europe were
requested from measles reference laboratories in Germany and England to
determine the source country of the virus importation. Comparative sequence
analysis of the patient's strain and several European genotype B3 strains,
carried out at the WHO Global Specialised Laboratory for Measles & Rubella
in the United Kingdom (UK), revealed 100 per cent sequence agreement at the
nucleotide level between the strain in the Australian patient and a strain
identified in the UK [5]. The UK strain differed from the Stuttgart strain
[3] and a strain that recently caused an outbreak in Denmark and southern
Sweden [6] by 7 nucleotides each; of these differences only 3 were shared
between the Stuttgart and Scandinavian strains. The patient had not
travelled to the UK. This case has provided useful information for our
European colleagues by raising the possibility that this strain may be
circulating undetected in other European countries as well as in the UK.

Endemic measles transmission in Victoria was interrupted in the early 1990s
[7]. The last national measles outbreak occurred in 1993 during which
Victoria reported few cases, suggesting reasonable measles control in the
state at that time. In 1998 Australia conducted a national measles catch-up
campaign targeting all children aged between 12 months and 11 years. In
1999, several months after the completion of the campaign, an outbreak of
measles in Victoria was initiated by the return of a 21-year-old infected
Australian tourist from Bali, Indonesia. This outbreak involved 75 people,
mostly young adults, and highlighted the underlying susceptibility of young
Australian adults, born between 1966 and 1981, to measles infection due to
inadequate vaccination or non-infection during childhood because of a
reduction in virus circulation after the vaccine was introduced [8,9].

The case reported here was detected during the 18th Commonwealth Games,
held in Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, on 15-26 Mar 2006, and which
involved more than 4000 athletes and over 100 000 Australian and overseas
visitors. Enhanced surveillance measures, such as emergency department
syndromic surveillance in conjunction with existing enhanced laboratory
surveillance [10], were implemented during the Games, and did not detect
any measles virus transmission related to this case. As part of the
enhanced surveillance for measles that was introduced in Victoria in 1997,
medical practitioners and laboratories are required to notify the
Department of Human Services (DHS) immediately upon presumptive or
confirmed diagnosis of measles. In addition the DHS staff actively follow
up all informal reports of measles or rash illness received from child care
centres and schools. All cases are interviewed and details of contacts who
may be susceptible are sought for follow up. Specimens for laboratory
confirmation are encouraged and collection of specimens is facilitated by a
home visit from a paediatric phlebotomist [10].

These investigations demonstrate how difficult outbreak investigations can
be in the absence of molecular data. If possible, molecular epidemiological
investigations are undertaken with all cases of laboratory-confirmed
measles infection in Victoria. Such investigations enable the examination
of imported virus genotypes and help clarify transmission pathways,
especially if several measles infections are detected within the same
time-frame, and it is unclear if these represent a single importation with
ongoing local transmission or multiple importations with few locally
acquired infections. It is essential for measles control in Australia to
determine whether cases represent the return of endemic measles virus
transmission or whether the interruption of measles virus transmission is
being sustained. The Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory
(VIDRL) is part of the World Health Organization global measles laboratory
network. VIDRL scientists collaborated with our European colleagues to
investigate this chain of transmission. Such collaborations will become
increasingly important as several WHO regions strive to achieve measles
elimination.
