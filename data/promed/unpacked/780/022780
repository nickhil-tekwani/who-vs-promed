The number of dengue fever patients is steadily increasing in the city,
with the total number of patients registered at 601, including 590
admissions and 11 outpatients, on Saturday [6 Oct 2007] since August this
year [2007].
Dr Shakil Malik, additional health secretary and oordinator, Dengue Fever
Monitoring Cell of Sindh Health Department, told Associated Press of
Pakistan on Saturday [6 Oct 2007] that 98 dengue fever patients are
currently hospitalized in different health care facilities of Karachi.
The data made available to media was said to be based on daily reports from
10 - 13 different hospitals of Karachi. "As per available data, 272 of the
601 dengue cases were positive, 206 negative and 126 cases are yet to be
confirmed," the monitoring cell coordinator said. He appealed to all
hospital administrators as well as general physicians to support the Cell
in data compilation.
"This will ultimately help the public, as we would be able to chalk-out an
effective preventive strategy in accordance to serotypes of the ailment
identified among each of the patients," he said.
Dr Shakil in this regard also appealed to all the medical facilities to
apprise the cell of the exact nature of dengue cases being brought to them
and also the associated deaths. He acknowledged confusion with regard to
deaths reported by the media and mentioned that there had been an instance
when a man, fully recovered from dengue fever, died of a heart attack but
was claimed to be a victim of dengue.
It is through media we come to know of cases and dengue induced deaths, but
these are never officially reported to us, thus creating distress among the
masses. "The disease is there, but the fact also remains that it is
preventable, and each of us in our individual capacities has to protect
ourselves against it," the additional health secretary said.
To a query regarding instances of malaria, he said cases of both
falciparium malaria and vivax malaria were reported during the recent past,
and that the health department has a strategy in place and measures
strictly adopted to contain and prevent these cases. He said that while
malaria-causing mosquitoes flourish in stagnant filthy water, the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes breed in clean water stored in uncovered tanks,
buckets, utensils, flower vases etc.
"We can definitely get rid of the ailments through concerted efforts on
part of government, civic agencies and citizens in their individual
capacities," he commented. He advised people to ensure spraying
insecticides or even discarded motor oil on pools and puddles of water so
that a screen is created preventing breeding of mosquitoes.
Application of mosquito repellent oil, coils, use of mosquito nets, hygiene
and cleanliness, ensuring that all parts of the body are duly covered to
avoid mosquito bites and timely referral to doctors in case of persistent
fever and cold were also strongly advised by the health department official.

[This report is somewhat confusing. This article indicates that there were
601 registered dengue cases reported, although 206 of these were listed as
negative. So it is not clear if these 206 were dengue cases or not.
Although it is useful to know which dengue virus serotypes are circulating
in the population, it is not necessary to have this information in hand
before mounting a vector mosquito control effort. Elimination of water
catchments to prevent aedes mosquito breeding is the same irrespective of
the dengue viruses being transmitted. Insecticide fumigation of adult
mosquitoes may also provide temporary reduction of virus transmission, but
unless breeding sites are eliminated, the epidemic is likely to continue as
new adults are recruited into the vector population. Where aedes mosquitoes
are breeding in drinking water storage containers, motor oil application
should not be used.

The government has issued a nationwide dengue fever alert after recording
more than 4000 cases in the 2nd week of September [2007], the health
department said yesterday [3 Oct 2007]. It had recorded 24 689 cases of the
mosquitoborne disease in all since January [2007], with 283 deaths.
The head of the National Epidemiology Center, Eric Tayag, said in the
statement that he expected a sharp increase in the number of cases in
September and October 2007: "It's during this period that we expect the
disease to proliferate due to the wet weather," he said.
In Cebu City, regional and city health officials warned the Cebu City
Council that the worst is yet to come after the city recorded its 1000th
dengue case.
As of 30 Sep [2007], 73 of Cebu City's 80 barangays have already been
affected by the dengue virus, infecting a total of 1000 individuals, mostly
children aged 6-10 years old. There have been 25 deaths recorded in Cebu
City from 1 Jan to 30 Sep [2007].
Central Visayas also saw an increase of 214 dengue cases in just one week.
The number of cases is 48 per cent higher than the same period last year
[2006].
Cebu City has the largest number of dengue cases in the region. The city
has been declared a hotspot, particularly in Barangays Pardo and Bulacao.
The total number of dengue cases from 1 Jan to 29 Sep this year [2007]
reached 3420 cases, according to the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance
Unit (Resu) 7 of the Department of Health (DOH).
The previous Resu report was for 22 Sep [2007], with 3216 cases.
In the same period last year [2006], there were only 2316 cases, or 48.1
per cent fewer. There were also 86 deaths in the region this year compared
with last year's 51.
Cebu City officials will meet later this week to come up with plans on the
most efficient way to fight dengue, especially after families reportedly
spent at least P30 million [USD 673 733] to treat the 1000 patients.
During the council session yesterday [3 Oct 2007], Vice Mayor Michael Rama
said he was surprised to learn about the number of dengue cases in the
city, which make up 34.2 per cent of the 3216 cases recorded in Central
Visayas as of 22 Sep [2007]. Rama is worried that the increasing number of
dengue cases could turn off tourists from coming to the region, considered
the country's tourism hub.
Dr Jonathan Neil Erasmo, DOH 7 dengue program coordinator, and City Health
Department Chief Fe Cabugao urged the councilors to pass measures that will
help in the dengue prevention campaign, such as intensifying the waste
segregation and other sanitation programs as a way of eliminating the
breeding sites of mosquitoes.
Cabugao also said that contrary to what the councilors are hoping, Cebu
City cannot be dengue virus-free since it is already endemic to the city,
which means dengue cases will arise throughout the year.
The health officials also urged the public to implement the 4-S in the
campaign against dengue: search and destroy breeding sites of mosquitoes,
seek immediate consultation, self protection and saying "no" to
indiscriminate fogging unless there is a dengue outbreak in the area.

An outbreak of a deadly mosquitoborne virus in Yap has prompted local
health officials to be on the lookout for the possible transmission of the
disease to the island.
At least 6 cases of the dengue fever virus in Yap have been confirmed --
including one fatal case -- since the samples were tested late last month
[September 2007], according to a release from the Guam Department of Public
Health and Social Services.
With the rainy season in full swing and the routine transit of people to
and from Yap, Public Health is pushing forward with its campaign to prevent
the disease from occurring on the island, said Rosanna Rabago, an
environmental health specialist supervisor with the Bureau of Animal and
Vector Control. The island has had just one case of dengue fever reported
so far this year [2007]. The individual contracted the disease while in the
Philippines, Rabago said. The preventive measures also are in response to
the warning from the World Health Organization that an outbreak of dengue
in the Western Pacific would be likely in the upcoming years.
The outbreak also comes at a time when Yap continues to battle the Zika
virus, which is similar to dengue but with milder symptoms. Public Health
also has kept watch for that mosquitoborne disease on Guam, Rebago said.
"Guam, by far, has been very lucky," Rabago said. "We're fortunate that we
have not had to worry about any of these diseases establishing on the
island, and we hope that remains the case. We need to be vigilant and
continue to increase public awareness and education in regards to
mosquitoborne disease education."
Mosquitoes breed in areas with standing water, a major concern for Public
Health since it has continued to rain on the island over the last few
months, she said. "People need to be aware that even the smallest container
that holds water can have the potential to be a mosquito breeding site,"
Rebago said. "It's just more prevalent during the rainy season."

Honduran sanitary authorities called the government to supply funds to
fight the dengue epidemic. Official reports number the cases at 22 123,
including 1060 with the hemorrhagic strain, and 12 have died. The current
figures surpass the 2006 reports, with 5200 cases of classic dengue, 63
with hemorrhagic and 5 fatalities.
Interim health minister Jenny Meza requested some USD 423 000 to assist the
capital and 3 departments [equivalent to states or provinces. - Mod.TY]
that already issued an alert since the rainy season is not over.

Dozens of children and adolescents ill from dengue are interned in public
and private medical centers in this city, which, in the past 3 weeks, has
caused great absenteeism from schools.
Just in the Nuestra Senora de Regla hospital, 10 infants were admitted with
classic dengue fever, 3 were released and one was referred to the Robert
Reid Cabra Children's Hopital in Santo Domingo.
The disease is mainly attacking the childhood population 2-14 years of age.
Although the illness preferentially attacks the population in poor
neighborhoods, this time the outbreak extends to sectors [of the city] of
the middle class, such as Las Marias and Riviera del Sur.
The children hospitalized in the pediatric isolation unit of the hospital
are between 2 and 13 years of age and come from the Villa Majega, Santa
Cruz, Pueblo Nuevo y Santa Elena neighborhoods, while others come from
rural areas such as Galion, Matanzas, Sombrero and others.
The epidemiologist of the Provincial Health Directorate, Dr Agustina
Martinez, said that the number of cases has increased considerably, "it
seems that new [dengue] cases are appearing in children who are infected
[with dengue virus] for the 1st time." She said that the situation is most
serious in those areas where potable water is not available so that the
neighbors necessarily have to store water, and these storage sites become
permanent [mosquito] breeding areas.
Both Drs Tolentino and Fremio Casado, the pediatrician in charge of the
pediatric unit of the Nuestra Senora de Regla hospital, agreed in signaling
that dengue is everyone's problem, affirming that, "the population has to
cooperate in the elimination of the [mosquito] breeding sites in their
[household] patios and other places [since ] the [government] authorities
do not have the capability to go to all homes and sites of mosquito
breeding at the same time."

[The situation in the poor neighborhoods without piped water illustrates
the need to store water in and around homes which, in turn, provides
breeding sites for aedes mosquito vectors. Public education and cooperation
are essential to reduce vector populations and halt dengue virus transmission.

Humberto Flores Munoz, epidemiologist in Sanitary Jurisdiction 06,
announced that the disease [dengue] has been detected in the Jose R
Mijares, Polvorera, Camilo Torres and other bordering neighborhoods [which]
are being fumigated in order to protect the inhabitants [from dengue virus
transmission].
There are about 40 [dengue] cases. Fortunately, the disease has not spread
to other populated areas of the city.
To avoid dengue spread, it is recommended that citizens observe all the
recommendations of the health authorities. Firstly, that they do not have
receptacles where water accumulates, which is where the mosquito vector breeds.

Dengue, a mosquitoborne virus that causes high fever, nausea, and painful
body aches, is reaching epidemic levels in the Caribbean and Latin America,
health officials say. Changing weather patterns as well as increased
tourism and migration have raised its prevalence, according to a Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) report released this week.
The disease is raging now during the wettest time of year for most
countries in the region. The virus, which has 4 distinct strains [there are
4 distinct dengue viruses. - Mod.TY], usually keeps victims bed-ridden for
a week with painful flu-like symptoms. About 5 per cent of cases develop
into the more severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhagic form marked by
internal and external bleeding.
Victims can also die from dehydration if they do not receive prompt
treatment, which normally includes bed rest and hydration. Severe cases can
require hospitalization.
PAHO expects dengue cases in the hemisphere to top one million this year
[2007]. It has logged 630 356 cases so far this year [2007], 11 per cent
more than for all of 2006. Of those, 12 147 were of the severe hemorrhagic
type, and 183 people died.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued a dengue
outbreak notice that included Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mexico,
Nicaragua, and Brazil.
Puerto Rico's health department on Friday [5 Oct 2007] said it was seeing
more than 500 new cases weekly and had recorded 6175 so far this year, with
4 confirmed deaths. With no vaccine available, public health experts rely
on fumigation and other campaigns to control mosquitoes. On Friday [5 Oct
2007], Health Department employees handed out educational material on
street corners, urging people to eliminate potential breeding grounds for
mosquitoes and seek medical attention at the 1st sign of the disease. "We
need the commitment and participation of all sectors of society to be able
to prevent and control dengue," Puerto Rico state epidemiologist Enid
Garcia Rivera said. "Given the amount of rain these days, the dengue
mosquito can reproduce at astonishing speed."
The Dominican Republic has reported more than 6000 cases and 30 deaths this
year [2007], according to local press reports.
Mexico has reported 67 562 cases, with 5212 developing into the hemorrhagic
form, according to PAHO.
Guadeloupe registered 899 cases. Health officials in Martinique declared a
dengue epidemic last month [September 2007] with more than 1300 cases
reported, and Jamaica has had about 100 cases.
A report delivered at the PAHO conference this week in Washington
identified unprecedented population growth in crowded urban areas, where a
lack of basic services can help mosquitoes breed, as one factor behind the
surge. Travel and tourism help also spread the disease, according to the
report, "Dengue Prevention and Control in the Americas." It also cited
"radical, destabilizing" climate changes as a result of global warming, as
well as cyclical weather patterns that have increased the intensity and
duration of the region's rainy seasons.
Dr Raul Castellano, the PAHO coordinator in Puerto Rico, said nearly every
country in the region was trying to control the disease but greater efforts
were needed. "It's very difficult because it takes changing people's
behavior. Fumigation in the streets won't work because we have to go inside
people's houses," he said. "We have to break the chain of the mosquito
[reproduction and virus transmission. - Mod.TY]."
