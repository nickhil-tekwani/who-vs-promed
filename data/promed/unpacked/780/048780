Further to the comments about the possibility of West Nile virus infecting
a hawk when it ate an infected animal. I note that Duane Gubler says "it
hasn't been described before". Admittedly, we didn't report it with West
Nile virus but we did refer to infection of grouse chicks when they ate
ticks infected with louping ill virus (I think we sent it originally to the
Arbovirus Information Exchange) and it is well known from experimental
evidence (not necessarily published), that many mosquito-transmitted
flaviviruses may infect susceptible animals by the oral route. The
reference to the tick paper which mentions oral feeding is:
Hudson, P. J., Norman, R., Laurenson, M. K., Newborn, D., Gaunt, M., Jones,
L., Reid, H., Gould, E. and Dobson, A. (1996). Persistence and transmission
of tick-borne viruses: _Ixodes ricinus_ and louping-ill virus in red grouse
populations. Parasitology 111, S49-S58.
There was a paper on oral immunisation of mice with Japanese encephalitis
virus.
The reference is:
Ramakrishna et al (1999) Vaccine 17, 3102-3108.

[Much better than no reference at all but Duane Gubler was talking about
West Nile virus exclusively, not about flaviviruses in general.
Immunization of animals by one route or the other is not evidence that the
animal became infected. That's the root question with the N.Y. hawk.
If all this stuff is unpublished, it can serve as a model for those who do
not publish their work because it is essentially useless. I must add that
I am embarrassed to have Ernie mention his report in the Arbovirus
Information Exchange. I remember it and, as I recall, I was the Editor of
that newsletter at that time. Ouch! - Mod.CHC
