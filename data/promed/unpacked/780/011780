Around 80 people got food poisoning from a pasta meal at a soccer tournament this past month [August 2022] in Sweden. An investigation into the incident in Gammelstad on 5 Aug [2022] revealed people fell ill after eating spaghetti bolognese from a restaurant in the city of Lule책.

An investigation by officials from Lule책 Municipality to determine the cause included studying the symptoms of those affected, interviewing patients, visiting the food company, and sampling leftovers. Food had been prepared at a restaurant the day before the event and stored in a refrigerator. On 5 Aug [2022], it had been reheated for transporting to and serving at the tournament.

Testing of the bolognese left at the restaurant was found to be satisfactory. Samples were also taken in Gammelstad where serving took place. High levels of bacteria were detected in the pasta, plus the presence of toxins that can cause food poisoning. Food had been left at room temperature for some time after serving, which provided an opportunity for bacterial growth. _Bacillus cereus_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_ were found in the pasta meal. Symptoms experienced by those sick matched what would be expected with such contamination.

Staphylococcal food poisoning is caused by eating foods contaminated with toxins produced by the _S. aureus_ bacteria. If this bacteria ends up in food that is stored at the wrong temperature for too long, it can multiply and form a heat-resistant toxin that can make people sick. Based on the short period from when food was delivered to people eating it, officials said it was likely that bacteria were present before delivery. However, from information provided by the restaurant, it was not possible to pin down how such bacterial and toxin growth occurred. To increase knowledge about such outbreaks, follow-up analyses will be carried out at Livsmedelsverket (the Swedish Food Agency), and further controls of the business will be done by authorities.

[Foodborne gastrointestinal diseases due to _S. aureus_ or _B. cereus_ are both toxin-mediated diseases related to inappropriate storage of foods.

_B. cereus_ has 2 recognized types of foodborne illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis between 0.5 and 5 hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of _S. aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is caused by a high-molecular-weight protein while the emetic or vomiting type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is caused by a low-molecular-weight and heat-stable protein. In some outbreaks there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the emetic types of illness.

Lule책 is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden.
