2 people exposed to the saliva of a raccoon that has tested positive for
rabies are undergoing treatment.
The Northeast District Department of Health said the raccoon was submitted
for rabies testing Wednesday. It gave no indication where the rabid raccoon
was found in the town and did not identify the 2 people undergoing treatment.
Patricia M. Beckenhaupt, district health department director, said raccoons
continue to be the most frequently reported rabid wildlife species,
especially on the East Coast.
Beckenhaupt reminded residents to be cautious about wild, stray, or
unfamiliar animals, which should be regarded as potential rabies
carriers.Anyone exposed to sick animals or animals displaying abnormal
behavior should call state police, their local animal control officer, or
the health director.
She said the abnormal behavior includes unprovoked aggressiveness,
fearlessness, disorientation, excess salivation, and paralysis.
If rabies is not treated, the disease has an almost 100 percent fatality
rate in humans, Beckenhaupt said.
The most common animals associated with rabies in the region include dogs,
cats, raccoons, foxes, skunks, and bats. However, Beckenhaupt said, almost
any warm-blooded animal may carry the virus.
She urged parents to teach their children never to handle unfamiliar
animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. Although some
rabid animals look or act sick, others that are infected may appear normal
and be friendly to humans.
People also should be especially careful when handling a family pet that
has been in a fight with a stray or wild animal. Do not try to physically
separate the fighting animals unless wearing heavy gloves. They should call
the animal control officer to remove any stray animals from their neighborhood.
Beckenhaupt said people should wash any wound from an animal thoroughly
with soap and water and immediately seek medical attention. She also urged
pet owners to have dogs, cats, and ferrets vaccinated against rabies and to
keep their rabies vaccinations current.

[One can only assume that the treatment referred to in this article is
Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP). There is no recognized treatment, per se,
for rabies.
There are also two forms of rabies. The type described above is often
referred to as the furious form of rabies. However, there a form called
"dumb rabies," in which the animal's behavior is very withdrawn and
subdued. Furthermore the animal may not salivate excessively.
Ultimately, it is wise to have the family pets, including horses,
vaccinated annually, or according to your state law if otherwise. - Mod.TG]
