Turkey Tests 6 People for Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
6 people in eastern Turkey, 4 of them children, are being tested for
possible avian influenza, the state Anatolian news agency said on Sun
1 Jan 2006.
The agency said that a 35-year-old woman and a 5-year-old child had
been sent to the hospital, on Sun 1 Jan 2006, in the city of Van,
near the Iranian border. Earlier, 4 children, aged between 11 and 15
and from the same family, were admitted to the Van hospital after
exhibiting "flu" symptoms and failing to respond to antibiotics, the
Hurriyet newspaper said.
All 6 patients come from the district of Dogubayazit, a remote rural
area near Turkey's border with Armenia. Anatolia quoted local
officials as saying they had banned all transportation of poultry in
Dogubayazit and that culling of birds would begin shortly as a
precautionary measure.
Turkey, which lies on the path of migratory birds that are believed
to spread the virus, has suffered 2 outbreaks of the highly
contagious [avian] disease in the past 3 months. No humans are known
to have contracted the disease there, although the 6 from Dogubayazit
are not the 1st to undergo such checks.
The Zaman daily said authorities in Erzurum province, also in eastern
Turkey, have culled more than 700 poultry as a precautionary measure,
after 15 chickens died "in suspicious circumstances."
The reports from Van and Erzurum came days after Turkey's Agriculture
Ministry announced an outbreak of the disease in chickens in Igdir
province, also near the Armenian border, and ordered a precautionary
culling of nearly 400 birds. That strain has been identified as the
H5 type, but authorities are conducting further tests to establish
whether it is the deadly H5N1 strain that has killed more than 70
people in Asia since 2003 and forced the slaughter of millions of
birds. Turkey has sent samples from Igdir to the World Health
Organization and the European Union for more tests.
An outbreak of avian influenza in October [2005] in more densely
populated northwest Turkey triggered the culling of more than 10 000
birds. That outbreak was identified as [caused by] the deadly H5N1
strain. The Agriculture Ministry declared northwest Turkey free of
avian influenza in early December [2005], but experts say the country
remains vulnerable because of the movements of migratory birds.

[The diagnosis of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection appears to be
based on clinical assessment and lack of response to treatment with
antibiotics. Previous human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection recorded in East Asia have been sporadic in distribution
and have rarely involved more than a single person. The simultaneous
occurrence of 6 cases in the same region would be unprecedented,
particularly in the absence of on-going extensive infection of
domestic poultry. Furthermore, there has been no report of direct
infection of a human from migratory birds. Further details are
awaited concerning the outcome of laboratory tests and concerning the
extent of avian disease in the region.
