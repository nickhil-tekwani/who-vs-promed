"How about trying anaerobic cultures for _Clostridium perfringens_? The
problem is telling the beta toxin+ from those that are non toxigenic."
I can't comment on the likelihood of this being perfringens-associated, but
examination of isolates, by PCR, for the beta toxin gene is as effective as
demonstration of the toxin itself. The method is well-established, and is
in use in numerous veterinary diagnostic labs in North America, and even in
the occasional human clinical lab.
I assume that the reference to "...non toxigenic...." means not
beta-toxigenic. Isolates of perfringens which produce no toxins may well
not exist, and even those producing none of the major toxins (alpha, beta,
epsilon, and iota) are extraordinarily rare. If perfringens is a possible
etiology in these cases, consider the possible involvement of type A. I
realize that normal flora isolates are type A, but remember that the only
criterion for membership in type A is failure to produce beta, epsilon, and
iota toxins. It seems very likely that type A is anything but homogeneous,
and excluding "a member of the normal flora" from consideration as an
etiologic agent of gut disease may be shortsighted.
