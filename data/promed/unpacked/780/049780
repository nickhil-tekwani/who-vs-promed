If your horse has grainy skin and swollen mucous membranes around the eyes, it could be periocular habronemiasis--a unique form of "pink eye" caused by parasites.

More common in tropical and subtropical climates, periocular habronemiasis appears as granulous lesions around the eye as a result of parasite infestations. But the invasive little nematodes aren't limited to these warmer, more humid climates. A new study by researchers in the Netherlands has revealed that they can affect horses as far north as northwestern Europe.

"When an apparently simple conjunctivitis does not resolve after treatment, and there is increased conjunctival swelling or maybe even granuloma formation, keep this diagnosis in mind," said Nicole Verhaar, DVM, an equine surgery resident at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover Equine Clinic, in Germany. She completed the study when she was a researcher at the Utrecht University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, in the Netherlands.

While still quite rare in northern climates, periocular habronemiasis occurred in 5 confirmed cases at the Utrecht referral hospital between 2001 and 2016, including 4 cases in 2015 and 2016 alone, Verhaar said. The disease also affects horses in North America, with 63 cases reported in the U.S. 15 years ago by Nicola Pusterla, DVM, PhD, Dipl. ACVIM, of the University of California, Davis.

Scientists have detected these worms in horses all over northern Europe, including the Netherlands, since the 1990s without noting significant clinical disease. Why the _Habronema_ larvae are now affecting horses in these regions is not yet known, Verhaar said.

Flies transport the _Habronema_ larvae and deposit the worm onto the horse's eye area by direct contact, Verhaar said.

In their study, Verhaar colleagues investigated the 5 cases seen in their clinic. A Shetland pony, an Arabian stallion, a draft horse, and 2 Warmblood riding horses all had grainy lesions in the conjunctiva and some on the skin around the eye, Verhaar said. One of the horses had habronemiasis around both eyes.

Their owners had been treating all the affected horses with anthelmintics based on fecal egg counts for strongyle eggs, but _Habronema_ eggs will not show up on standard fecal egg counts, Verhaar said. The last ivermectin (or similar) treatment had been given within a few months (except for the draft horse, which had last been dewormed a year earlier).

The Shetland pony recovered with eye flushes and topical anthelmintic treatment, after an initial treatment with the moxidectin and antibiotic ointments, Verhaar said. The Arabian and the 2 Warmbloods underwent debulking surgery to remove the affected tissue (standing for the 1-sided cases and under general anesthesia for the horse having had disease in both eyes, due to the surgery's complexity and the horse's character). The horses were also treated with anti-inflammatory medication--which is critical, she said, given the fact that the main issue is actually the horse's immune reaction to the larvae--and anthelmintics.

The draft horse, however, had challenges. He had 1 grainy bright-red lesion stretching from just below his eye down to his nose, close to the nostril; it covered most of the left side of his face. Medical treatment didn't help, the lesion actually seemed to get worse at first, and he was not a surgical candidate, said Verhaar.

"His situation had progressed so far by time we were on the case, surgical debulking would have been difficult because of the major surface the lesion encompassed," she said. "Furthermore, we were also bound by the financial constraints of the owner." But, fortunately for this horse, the disease process regressed spontaneously during the winter, said Verhaar. That's not because the worms themselves didn't survive the cold, however. "In most lesions the worms have already died, and it is the inflammatory reaction of the horse itself that creates and continues the lesion," she said. "So the reason for regression in winter is not clear. We suspect it has something to do with modification of the inflammatory response together with less new stimuli (from flies and/or new larvae being deposited)."

By spring, the draft horse's lesion had resolved with just some scarring remaining, Verhaar said.

However, that kind of spontaneous recovery doesn't happen frequently, and a "wait-and-see" treatment approach can lead to detrimental complications.

"It is impossible to predict which cases will improve and which won't," Verhaar said. "The indication for surgery is definitely there, because leaving it to grow further might damage the eye. A possible consequence may be complete destruction of both openings to the tear ducts leading to a permanent teary discharge below the eye (which would also attract flies), and it may also increase the risk of conjunctivitis.

"Furthermore, the sulphur-like granules may scratch the cornea and possibly cause corneal ulceration," she continued. "This can have severe consequences, ranging from long topical treatment regimes, scarring of the cornea, or, in the worst-case scenario, having to take the eye out. Therefore, I would always recommend immediate treatment, which may include surgical debulking."

Rapid disease recognition and appropriate treatment could also help prevent the need for surgery, she added. "If the horse is well monitored by the owner, the disease will probably not progress severely without staying unnoticed, because the disease is in places where it is readily seen," said Verhaar. "When the correct diagnosis is then made by the veterinarian, this disease can be treated well, and usually no permanent damage will have been done. Hence the importance of awareness (but not panic) for owners and vets, because delaying therapy or instituting the wrong one could allow the disease to progress."

Good prevention includes a good deworming program and effective fly control, she said.

[The article does a good job of explaining the parasite and the problems it causes. There are some good pictures on the original article.

However, aside from sprays to protect your horse, especially around the eyes, try a face mask. Take the time, and the financial investment to get a good one to protect your horse's eyes. Sometimes it takes trying several to find the right size/brand to fit your particular horse. It does not take them long to adjust to wearing these. My horses wear them much of the year. Be sure to check the bands to ensure no chaffing or foreign material which could rub the horse and form uncomfortable lesions.

Also use sprays specific for horses to control the flies on/around your horse. If you choose to spray your horse's face, 1st spray your hand and then rub around the eyes, nose and ears. Do not spray around your horses head as you can affect the eyes, and cause the horse to become afraid of sprays around the head.

While this is a nice article, it may serve as a notice of new issues for some and as a reminder for others. Some of us, such as in the US Midwest region and southern regions have been aware of this situation for a long period of time. - Mod.TG]
