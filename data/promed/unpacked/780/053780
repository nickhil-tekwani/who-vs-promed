The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has confirmed that a 15 year old warmblood mare from Sacramento County tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV) after exhibiting severe neurologic signs of disease.

"The mare initially showed signs of colic on [Fri 21 Apr 2017]], and was transported to a veterinary clinic for veterinary care," the CDFA's [28 Apr 2017] update noted. "While in isolation at the veterinary clinic, the mare started displaying neurologic signs, became recumbent, and was subsequently euthanized due to the severity of signs. Quarantine biosecurity measures were immediately implemented at the home premises.

"With neurologic signs and detection of EHV-1, this horse meets the case definition for an equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) case, which is reportable and actionable in the state of California," the CDFA continued. "CDFA issued a quarantine for 31 exposed horses which requires implementation of biosecurity measures including twice daily temperature taking and observation of horses. No exposed horses have displayed signs of disease. (The) CDFA continues to monitor the situation onsite."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[This is another sad case. The biosecurity measures must be stepped up for any one owning horses. This disease seems to invade silently but attacks with a vengeance. Fever is frequently the only early sign of the disease. Hopefully none of the horses in quarantine will be come ill. - Mod.TG
