The Slovenian Veterinary Administration said on Monday [20 Mar 2006] it
suspects that deadly bird flu virus may have spread to domestic poultry at
a small farm in northeastern Slovenia.
This would be the first example of the virus in domestic poultry in
Slovenia after the lethal H5N1 avian influenza virus has been confirmed in
24 wild birds since 16 Feb 2006.
"The veterinarian in charge suspects bird flu virus in domestic poultry on
a farm in Hotinja Vas where 10 out of 14 hens died overnight," the
Veterinary Administration said in a statement.
Hotinja Vas lies some 10 km (6 miles) south of Maribor and is in the area
where all wild birds infected with bird flu virus were found. [Map at

The veterinary administration expects test results that will show whether
the poultry was infected by the H5N1 virus within 3 days.
Veterinarians killed the remaining 4 hens at the farm and restricted
movement to prevent contact between farmworkers and other poultry farms.

[In 4 notifications to the OIE between 16 Feb 2006 and 9 Mar 2006, Slovenia
reported the identification of infection in 11 wild birds: 10 mute swans
(_Cygnus olor_) and one Grey heron (_Ardea cinera_). The current outbreak
in domestic fowl may be perceived as a clear-cut evidence for the role of
wild birds in the epidemiology of the avian influenza panzootic. Obviously,
other routes -- in other cases -- may have played their crucial roles.
Further spread of the disease agent from Hotinja Vas might occur by any
means, prescribing strict quarantine measures and biosecurity.
Final tests results are anticipated. - Mod.AS]

[2] Kazakhstan, swans

The deadly H5N1 bird flu strain has been found among dead swans in western
Kazakhstan, an agriculture ministry official said on Monday [20 Mar 2006].
"We took samples and a few days ago 2 laboratories confirmed the
diagnosis," the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Birds in Kazakhstan were hit by an H5N1 outbreak in 2005. None of the
country's 15 million citizens were infected then. Bird flu is essentially
an animal disease which occasionally infects people who come into direct
contact with infected poultry.
It has killed up to 98 people since late 2003, most of them in East Asia.

[3] Pakistan, poultry: H5N1 confirmed

Pakistan's first 2 cases of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in chickens
in the country's North West Frontier Province have been confirmed by lab
tests, the government announced Tuesday.
The samples containing H5N1 bird flu virus were taken from chickens at 2
farms late in February 2006, private Geo News television channel reported
on Tuesday [21 Mar 2006].
Tests conducted in Britain confirmed the sub-type to be H5N1.
"They (the British lab) have also endorsed the finding of our laboratory
that infection was avian influenza H5N1," an Agriculture Ministry statement
said.
The flocks have since been culled, and officials say they have not found
any other incidents of bird flu.
No human cases were detected, said Mohammad Afzal, spokesman for the Food,
Agriculture and Livestock Ministry.
Pakistan early this month culled 25 000 chickens on farms in the towns of
Charsadda and Abbottabad after confirming the presence of the H5-type
virus, and had since been awaiting the test results.

[A similar newswire has been received from Joe Dudley.
In an "Immediate notification report" of 3 Mar 2006, Pakistan indicated
that the event started on 23 Mar 2006 and the diagnosis, H5 by PCR testing,
obtained on 27 Feb 2006. See
