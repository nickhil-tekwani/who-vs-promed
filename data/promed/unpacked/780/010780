[Though the total number of outbreaks presented in the WOAH report is 6 (in 5 locations), according to the media and unofficial reliable professional sources, FMD has spread throughout the West Bank, affecting a 3-digit number of affected villages (see commentary in 20220421.8702742) and 4-digit mortality figures ("The Palestinian ministry has officially confirmed around 2000 animal deaths as a result of the FMD strain this year (2022). But farmers and the agriculture ministry official said livestock deaths were likely far higher than the acknowledged toll" (https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinian-farmers-sound-alarm-over-foot-and-mouth-outbreak-101654408897561.html). The discrepancy with the WOAH report data may be explained by the latter being restricted to outbreaks which were tested/confirmed by the Central Veterinary Laboratory, PSE National Laboratory.

The FMD event in Israel, which started on 1 Feb 2022, is continuing, mainly in the northern districts. On 30 Jun 2022, the (acting) director of the field veterinary services submitted a circular to practitioners and stakeholders, informing a new suspected outbreak in Ein Ayala (18 km south to Haifa) affecting fattening calves has been lab-confirmed; this is to become Israel's 90th outbreak in the winter-spring of 2022, the largest event since 1981.

According to Israel's follow-up report no. 13, submitted to WOAH on 29 Jun 2022, the 89 outbreaks confirmed so far affected cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. The affected holdings included a total of 77 293 susceptible animals of the 4 species, 4614 clinical cases, and 1006 deaths. The new follow-up report, with a map, is available at https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=56397.

The virus circulating in Israel was found to be identical to the strains in Jordan and the PA, namely, ME-SA PanAsia-2 ANT-10. The immunity conferred by the multivalent vaccine applied in Israel last year (2021) seems to be less than optimal in relation to this strain. In most outbreaks, the morbidity rate was low, though very high mortalities were seen in offspring of sheep and goats. - Mod.AS
