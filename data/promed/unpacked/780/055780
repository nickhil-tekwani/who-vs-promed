Biosecurity New Zealand has been called in to investigate the mystery
deaths of birds in Hawke's Bay as the numbers grow.
The alarm was raised after scores of dead birds were found in
Havelock North's Anderson Park. There have also been reports of dogs
and cats being found either dead or very sick.
Hawke's Bay Regional Council, which is coordinating the response to
the dead birds, confirmed reports have been received of birds dying
or close to death in other parts of Havelock North, including the Te
Mata Peak area. Residents had also reported dead birds being found
near Guthrie Park, about 2 km away from Anderson Park.
Regional council group manager Mike Adye told Hawke's Bay Today that
birds found at the park were still being tested, but the tests may
not be conclusive.
"Clearly, we are concerned about the number of birds that have died,
but we have been unable to identify the reason," he said. "We hope
that the tests will give us at least some leads. If we are able to
find a cause, it may help us to take steps to minimize the risk if it
occurs again."
Mr. Adye said that pet owners needed to consider how best to keep
their pets safe. He said mass deaths of birds were not uncommon but
that it was unusual to have such a variety of birds affected.

[There is very little detail in this. It could be avicides, or
botulism or some other toxin that is lethal to birds. We would
appreciate an authoritative response providing more details. What
tests are being run and on what samples? How quickly did the birds
die? It has been suggested that the companion animals that have
become ill or died did so after consumption of the bird carcasses.
Have any tests been run on the deceased animals? How many companion
animals are ill or dead? It is our sincere hope that someone close to
this investigation will share more information.
