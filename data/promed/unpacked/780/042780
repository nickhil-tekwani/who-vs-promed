New developments
----------
- Baghdad and Basra: Despite the rigorous epidemiological, clinical,
and laboratory scrutiny no secondary cholera confirmed cases were
reported from Baghdad and Basra following the 2 cases reported 12 days ago.
- Dahuk: On 23 Sep 2007, Dahuk health authority reported the 1st
laboratory confirmed _Vibrio cholerae_ in a 5-year-old female child
from Bardarash district in Dahuk governorate. It is important to note
that the 1st index case for the 1999 outbreak (over 900 cases)
started in the same area, which the WHO requested to visit during the
last mission to north Iraq; however, the request was denied. The case
was detected during the routine testing of cases presenting to health
facilities with watery diarrhea. Further investigation of contacts
and water supply was negative for the _V. cholerae_ organism.
- Diala: During the 15-30 Sep 2007 period, reports of a new focus of
acute watery diarrhoea in Diala province were received, which is
south of the original [foci] in Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk. In this new
focus, 31 patients presented to Baladruz, Salah ad Din, Hibhib,
Al-Udhem, and Baquba hospitals with severe dehydrating diarrhea with
renal failure in one of them. Unfortunately, specimen collection was
done late after patient had antibiotics in the majority of cases. The
results of 22 cases tested negative to _V. cholerae_ while 9 are
still pending. Negative isolates have been sent to the Central Lab in
Baghdad for further testing. Despite the difficult security situation
the DoH (Department of Health) surveillance staff were able to visit
affected areas, supply them with fresh CB (Cary-Blair) transport
medium, and train them on the correct method of collection and
shipping of samples.
- Tikrit: During 11-29 Sep 2007, 1617 diarrhea cases were reported;
1143 stool specimens collected, 8 of them were positive for _V.
cholerae_, 4 were symptomatic, and 4 were healthy carriers.
- Wasit: A cholera case was confirmed in Wasit on 25 Sep 2007.

At least 20 people have died from cholera in the past 2 weeks in the

health official said Thu 27 Sep 2007.

ministry of health, said 15 of the deaths were recorded in the
northern district of Kambia, near the border with Guinea, while 5
were registered in a village on the outskirts of the capital Freetown.
Emergency health workers have been drafted to both areas to step up
treatment and prevention campaigns to stem the outbreak that has
struck dozens of people, he told reporters.

killing at least 77 people over a 3-month period between the months
