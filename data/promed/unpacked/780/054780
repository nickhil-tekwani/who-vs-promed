Suspected outbreak
------------------
This emergency report is based on information reported on 14 Dec 2001 from
Dr Mate Brstilo, director of the Veterinary Administration, Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry, Zagreb:
The Veterinary Directorate of Croatia has received findings from the
Croatian Veterinary Institute, the national Reference Laboratory for
bluetongue, relating to the detection, using competitive enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (cELISA), of specific antibodies to bluetongue virus in
3 sheep flocks, on the basis of which a strong suspicion of bluetongue
occurrence has been established. The 3 flocks, ranging from 20 to 120
sheep, are located in Dubrovnik district (zupanija Dubrovacko-neretvanska).
The definitive diagnosis of the disease will be established after isolation
and identification of the virus in organ samples by fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) in the national reference laboratory. The OIE
Reference Laboratory for bluetongue (Pirbright, United Kingdom) will be
asked to confirm the results.
Bluetongue has never before been detected in the territory of Croatia. No
source of infection has been determined. Epidemiological investigations are
in progress. Until the diagnosis of bluetongue has been confirmed, the
following veterinary-sanitary measures are being applied:
- ban on the movement and trade of all ruminants, and semen, ova and
embryos of ruminants, from and within the territory of Dubrovnik district,
except for animals being sent directly to a slaughterhouse in the territory
of the same district under the supervision of a veterinary inspector;
- clinical and serological testing of ruminants in the protection zone and
surveillance zone;
- sanitary slaughter of positive animals in registered slaughterhouses
designated by the competent veterinary inspector;
- compulsory disinfection and dis-insectisation of the affected farms;
- prohibition on the holding of fairs, exhibitions, competitions,
collections of animals and other animal gatherings.
