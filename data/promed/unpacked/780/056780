SARS-CoV-2 Variant -- United Kingdom
------------------------------------
On [14 Dec 2020], authorities of the United Kingdom (UK) reported to WHO that a new SARS-CoV-2 variant was identified through viral genomic sequencing. This variant is referred to as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (variant under investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01). Initial analysis indicates that the variant may spread more readily between people. Investigations are ongoing to determine if this variant is associated with any changes in the severity of symptoms, antibody response, or vaccine efficacy.

A total of 1108 cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 have been detected in the UK as of [13 Dec 2020]. The variant was picked up as part of an epidemiological and virological investigation initiated earlier in December 2020 following an unexpected rise in COVID-19 cases in South East England. It was characterized by a more than 3-fold increase in the 14-day case notification rate from epidemiological week 41 to week 50 ([5 Oct 2020] to [13 Dec 2020]). On average, between 5-10% of all SARS-CoV-2 viruses have routinely been sequenced in the UK and 4% routinely sequenced in South East England since the beginning of the pandemic. From [5 Oct 2020] to [13 Dec 2020], over 50% of isolates were identified as the variant strain in South East England. Retrospective analysis traced the 1st identified variant to Kent, South East England, on [20 Sep 2020], which was followed by a rapid increase of the same variant identified later in November [2020]. Most COVID-19 cases from whom this variant has been identified have occurred in people under 60 years of age.

The variant is defined by the presence of a range of 14 mutations resulting in amino acid changes and three deletions. Some of these mutations may influence the transmissibility of the virus in humans:
- One of the mutations identified (N501Y) is altering an amino acid within the 6 key residues in the receptor binding domain (RBD). According to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database, this same receptor binding domain mutation (N501Y) has been independently reported in several countries including South Africa (n=45) and Australia (n=37). Sequence analysis revealed that the N501Y mutation of the virus reported in the UK and South Africa originated separately.
- Another mutation of biological significance, P681H, has been found in the RBD.
- Finally, the deletion at position 69/70 has been found to affect the performance of some diagnostic PCR assays that use an S gene target. Most PCR assays worldwide use multiple targets and therefore the impact of the variant on diagnostics is not anticipated to be significant.

The new VUI-202012/01 variant has been identified in several countries including Australia, Denmark, Italy, Iceland, and the Netherlands.

Preliminary reports by the UK are that this variant is more transmissible than previous circulating viruses, with an estimated increase of between 40% and 70% in transmissibility (adding 0.4 to the basic reproduction number R0, bringing it to a range of 1.5 to 1.7). Laboratory studies are ongoing to determine whether these variant viruses have different biological properties or alter vaccine efficacy. There is not enough information at present to determine if this variant is associated with any change in severity of clinical disease, antibody response or vaccine efficacy.

Public health response
----------------------
The authorities in the UK are conducting epidemiological and virological investigations to further assess the transmissibility, infection-severity, risk of reinfection and antibody response of this new variant. As one of the mutations (N501Y) is in the receptor binding domain, the authorities are urgently investigating the neutralization activity of sera from recovered and vaccinated patients against this variant to determine if there is any impact on vaccine performance.

Genomic data of this variant has been uploaded to GISAID by the authorities of the UK and genomic surveillance of the virus continues across the country to monitor the situation.

On [19 Dec 2020], authorities in the UK announced that affected areas would be subject to Tier 4 restrictions including reduced social gatherings, tighter movement restrictions, requests to work from home wherever possible, and closures of non-essential businesses.

WHO risk assessment
------------------
All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time, but most of these mutations or changes do not have a direct benefit to the virus or may even be detrimental to its propagation. Further laboratory investigations are required to more fully understand the impact of specific mutation on viral properties and the effectiveness of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. These investigations are complex and require time and collaboration amongst different research groups.

The sharing of full genome sequences is facilitating detailed analyses by partners. The WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group is working with colleagues from the UK to better understand the available results and support further studies.

Further epidemiological and laboratory-based studies are rapidly required to understand the implications of these viruses in terms of available SARS-CoV-2 clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development.

WHO advice
----------
The preliminary findings by the UK signal the broader issue of SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations, and WHO underscores the importance of prompt sharing of epidemiological, virological, and full genome sequence information with other countries and research teams, including through open-source platforms such as GISAID and others.

WHO advises that further epidemiological and virological studies be conducted to understand the specific mutations described by the UK and other countries to further investigate any changes in the function of the virus in terms of infectivity and pathogenicity. WHO advises all countries to increase the routine sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses where possible, and sharing of sequence data internationally, in particular, to report if the same mutations of concern are found.

WHO would like to draw attention to the concern about the reported loss of performance of PCR assays that target the spike (S) gene of the virus. Laboratories using commercial PCR kits for which the targeted viral genes are not clearly identified in the manufacturer's instructions are advised to contact the manufacturer for more information. Laboratories using in-house PCR assays that target the S gene of the virus should also be aware of this potential issue. In order to limit the impact on the detection capacities in the countries, an approach using different assays in parallel or multiplex assays targeting different viral genes is also recommended to allow the detection of potential arising variants.

All countries need to assess their level of local transmission and apply appropriate prevention and control activities including adapting public health and social measures as per WHO guidance.

It is important to remind communities and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections:
- avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
- frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
- people with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands);
- within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments; and
- wearing masks where appropriate and ensuring good ventilation.

WHO recommends the health measures as listed above for all travelers, including to and from the UK. In case of symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness either during or after travel, travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Health authorities should work with travel, transport, and tourism sectors to provide travelers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections, via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators, and at points of entry.

In line with the advice provided by the Emergency Committee on COVID-19 at its most recent meeting, WHO recommends that States Parties should regularly re-consider measures applied to international travel in compliance with Article 43 of the IHR (2005) and continue to provide information and rationale to WHO on measures that significantly interfere with international traffic. Countries should also ensure that measures affecting international traffic are risk-based, evidence-based, coherent, proportionate, and time limited.

WHO has recently published an interim guidance -- "Considerations for implementing a risk-based approach to international travel in the context of COVID-19", to provide countries with a risk based approach to decision-making process for calibrating travel related risk mitigation measures in the context of international travel, aiming at reducing travel-associated exportation, importation and onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic.

WHO recommends that countries take a risk-based approach. National authorities are encouraged to publish their risk assessment methodology and the list of departure countries to which restrictions apply, and these should be updated regularly. In all circumstances, essential travel (such as emergency responders; providers of public health technical support; critical personnel in transport and security sector such as seafarers; repatriations; and cargo transport for essential supplies such as food, medicines, and fuel) identified by countries should always be prioritized and facilitated.

ref: Rambaut A, Loman N, Pybus O, et al, on behalf of COVID-19 Genomics Consortium UK (CoG-UK). Preliminary genomic characterisation of an emergent SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the UK defined by a novel set of spike mutations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Recently a distinct phylogenetic cluster (named lineage B.1.1.7) was detected within the COG-UK surveillance dataset. This cluster has been growing rapidly over the past 4 weeks and since been observed in other UK locations, indicating further spread.

Several aspects of this cluster are noteworthy for epidemiological and biological reasons and we report preliminary findings below. In summary:
The B.1.1.7 lineage accounts for an increasing proportion of cases in parts of England. The number of B.1.1.7 cases, and the number of regions reporting B.1.1.7 infections, are growing. B.1.1.7 has an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein. Three of these mutations have potential biological effects that have been described previously to varying extents:
- Mutation N501Y is one of six key contact residues within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and has been identified as increasing binding affinity to human and murine ACE2.
- The spike deletion 69-70del has been described in the context of evasion to the human immune response but has also occurred a number of times in association with other RBD changes.
- Mutation P681H is immediately adjacent to the furin cleavage site, a known location of biological significance.

The rapid growth of this lineage indicates the need for enhanced genomic and epidemiological surveillance worldwide and laboratory investigations of antigenicity and infectivity.

Lineage-defining mutations & rate of evolution
----------------------------------------------
The B.1.1.7 lineage carries a larger than usual number of virus genetic changes. The accrual of 14 lineage-specific amino acid replacements prior to its detection is, to date, unprecedented in the global virus genomic data for the COVID-19 pandemic. Most branches in the global phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 show no more than a few mutations and mutations accumulate at a relatively consistent rate over time. Estimates suggest that circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages accumulate nucleotide mutations at a rate of about 1-2 mutations per month (Duchene et al. 2020).

A preliminary analysis of these observations is provided in Figure 2 [available at the source URL], which shows a regression of root-to-tip genetic distances against genome sampling date, for lineage B.1.1.7 and for a selection of related outgroup genomes. The rate of molecular evolution within lineage B.1.1.7 is similar to that of other related lineages. However, lineage B.1.1.7 is more divergent from the phylogenetic root of the pandemic, indicating a higher rate of molecular evolution on the phylogenetic branch immediately ancestral to B.1.1.7. Further, inferred nucleotide changes on this branch are predominantly amino acid-altering (14 non-synonymous mutations and 3 deletions). There are 6 synonymous mutations on the branch. This is suggestive of a process involving adaptive molecular evolution, although a role for increased fixation rates through relaxed selective constraint cannot be currently ruled out.

What evolutionary processes or selective pressures might have given rise to lineage B.1.1.7?
High rates of mutation accumulation over short time periods have been reported previously in studies of immunodeficient or immunosuppressed patients who are chronically infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Choi et al. 2020; Avanzato et al. 2020; Kemp et al. 2020). These infections exhibit detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA for 2-4 months or longer (although there are also reports of long infections in some immunocompetent individuals). The patients are treated with convalescent plasma (sometimes more than once) and usually also with the drug remdesivir. Virus genome sequencing of these infections reveals unusually large numbers of nucleotide changes and deletion mutations and often high ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes. Convalescent plasma is often given when patient viral loads are high, and Kemp et al. (2020) report that intra-patient virus genetic diversity increased after plasma treatment was given.

Under such circumstances, the evolutionary dynamics of and selective pressures upon the intra-patient virus population are expected to be very different to those experienced in typical infection. First, selection from natural immune responses in immune-deficient/suppressed patients will be weak or absent. Second, the selection arising from antibody therapy may be strong due to high antibody concentrations. Third, if antibody therapy is administered after many weeks of chronic infection, the virus population may be unusually large and genetically diverse at the time that antibody-mediated selective pressure is applied, creating suitable circumstances for the rapid fixation of multiple virus genetic changes through direct selection and genetic hitchhiking.

These considerations lead us to hypothesise that the unusual genetic divergence of lineage B.1.1.7 may have resulted, at least in part, from virus evolution with a chronically-infected individual. Although such infections are rare, and onward transmission from them presumably even rarer, they are not improbable given the ongoing large number of new infections.

Although we speculate here that chronic infection played a role in the origins of the B.1.1.7 variant, this remains a hypothesis and we cannot yet infer the precise nature of this event.

Potential biological significance of mutations
----------------------------------------------
Table 1 provides details of the B.1.1.7 lineage-specific non-synonymous mutations and deletions. We note that many occur in the virus spike protein. These include spike position 501, one of the key contact residues in the receptor binding domain (RBD), and experimental data suggest mutation N501Y can increase ACE2 receptor affinity (Starr et al. 2020) and P681H, one of 4 residues comprising the insertion that creates a furin cleavage site between S1 and S2 in spike. The S1/S2 furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 is not found in closely related coronaviruses and has been shown to promote entry into respiratory epithelial cells and transmission in animal models (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, and Pöhlmann 2020; Peacock et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020). N501Y has been associated with increased infectivity and virulence in a mouse model (Gu et al. 2020). Both N501Y and P681H have been observed independently but not to our knowledge in combination before now.

Also present is the deletion of two amino acids at sites 69-70 in spike - this mutation is one of a number of recurrent deletions observed in the N terminal domain of Spike (McCarthy et al. 2020; Kemp et al. 2020) and has been seen in multiple lineages linked to several RBD mutations. For example, it arose in the mink-associated outbreak in Denmark on the background of the Y453F RBD mutation, and in humans in association with the N439K RBD mutation, accounting for its relatively high frequency in the global genome data (approximately 3000 sequences).

Table 1: Non-synonymous mutations and deletions inferred to occur on the branch leading to lineage B.1.1.7 lineage. [available at the source URL]

Outside of spike, the ORF8 Q27stop mutation truncates the ORF8 protein or renders it inactive and thus allows further downstream mutations to accrue. Early on during the pandemic multiple virus isolates with deletions leading to loss of ORF8 expression were isolated worldwide, including a large cluster in Singapore with a deletion leading to both a truncated Orf7b and ablated ORF8 expression. The Singaporean strain, which had a 382nt deletion, was associated with a milder clinical infection and less post-infection inflammation, however this cluster died out at the end of March [2020] after Singapore successfully implemented control measures (Young et al. 2020). Subsequent work has found that the ORF8 deletion has only a very modest effect on virus replication in human primary airway cells compared to viruses without the deletion, leading to a slight replication lag compared to viruses with the deletion (Gamage et al. 2020). As ORF8 is usually 121 amino acids long it is likely the stop codon at position 27 observed in lineage B.1.1.7 results in a loss of function.

Conclusion
----------
We report a rapidly growing lineage in the UK associated with an unexpectedly large number of genetic changes including in the receptor-binding domain and associated with the furin cleavage site. Given (i) the experimentally-predicted and plausible phenotypic consequences of some of these mutations, (ii) their unknown effects when present in combination, and (iii) the high growth rate of B.1.1.7 in the UK, this novel lineage requires urgent laboratory characterisation and enhanced genomic surveillance worldwide.

[We are now in a wait and see mode, pending further investigations. There is a global panic related to this mutation, based primarily on hypotheses. As I mentioned in yesterday's comment, there was a similar panic that resulted with the D614G variant that became dominant. Fear it was more transmissible and would it lead to more serious diseases were key concerns then. This didn't happen. Key concerns at present deal with 'are the changes in the spike protein going to impact on the vaccine efficacy' and what is the real impact of this variant virus on clinical course? Interestingly, some of the mutations were seen in the Danish mink farm outbreak which also produced a panic response (see COVID-19 update (501): Denmark, Netherlands, mink, human-animal interface 20201122.7963766 and COVID-19 update (520): Denmark, Netherlands, mink, human-animal interface, WHO 20201204.7994061). These mutations occurred in the absence of pressure from vaccine, but rather "spontaneous", under pressure of widespread infections with pharmaceutical interventions. Studies are underway to address the concerns re: vaccine efficacy (see section [2] below). - Mod.MPP]

[2] Polyethylene glycols and vaccine allergies
Date: Mon 21 Dec 2020
Source: Science, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/suspicions-grow-nanoparticles-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-trigger-rare-allergic-reactions


Severe allergy-like reactions in at least 8 people who received the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech over the past 2 weeks may be due to a compound in the packaging of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that forms the vaccine's main ingredient, scientists say. A similar mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna, which was authorized for emergency use in the United States on Friday [18 Dec 2020], also contains the compound, polyethylene glycol (PEG).

PEG has never been used before in an approved vaccine, but it is found in many drugs that have occasionally triggered anaphylaxis - a potentially life-threatening reaction that can cause rashes, a plummeting blood pressure, shortness of breath, and a fast heartbeat. Some allergists and immunologists believe a small number of people previously exposed to PEG may have high levels of antibodies against PEG, putting them at risk of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.

Others are skeptical of the link. Still, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was concerned enough to convene several meetings last week to discuss the allergic reactions with representatives of Pfizer and Moderna, independent scientists and physicians, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

NIAID is also setting up a study in collaboration with FDA to analyze the response to the vaccine in people who have high levels of anti-PEG antibodies or have experienced severe allergic responses to drugs or vaccines before. "Until we know there is truly a PEG story, we need to be very careful in talking about that as a done deal," says Alkis Togias, branch chief of allergy, asthma, and airway biology at NIAID.

Pfizer, too, says it is "actively seeking follow-up." A statement emailed to Science noted it already recommends that "appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available" in case a vaccinee develops anaphylaxis.

Anaphylactic reactions can occur with any vaccine but are usually extremely rare -- about one per 1 million doses. As of [19 Dec 2020], the United States had seen 6 cases of anaphylaxis among 272 001 people who received the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a recent presentation by Thomas Clark of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the United Kingdom has recorded 2. Because the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines use a new platform, the reactions call for careful scrutiny, says Elizabeth Phillips, a drug hypersensitivity researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who attended an NIAID meeting on [16 Dec 2020]. "This is new."

News reports about the allergic reactions have already created anxiety. "Patients with severe allergies in the US are getting nervous about the possibility that they may not be able to get vaccinated, at least with those 2 vaccines," Togias wrote in an invitation to meeting participants. "Allergies in general are so common in the population that this could create a resistance against the vaccines in the population," adds Janos Szebeni, an immunologist at Semmelweis University in Budapest, Hungary, who has long studied hypersensitivity reactions to PEG and who also attended the [16 Dec 2020] gathering.

Scientists who believe PEG may be the culprit stress that vaccination should continue. "We need to get vaccinated," Phillips says. "We need to try and curtail this pandemic." But more data are urgently needed, she adds: "These next couple of weeks in the US are going to be extremely important for defining what to do next."

Toothpaste and shampoo
----------------------
Pfizer's and Moderna's clinical trials of the vaccines, which involved tens of thousands of people, did not find serious adverse events caused by the vaccine. But both studies excluded people with a history of allergies to components of the COVID-19 vaccines; Pfizer also excluded those who previously had a severe adverse reaction from any vaccine. People with previous allergic reactions to food or drugs were not excluded but may have been underrepresented.

The 2 vaccines both contain mRNA wrapped in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that help carry it to human cells but also act as an adjuvant, a vaccine ingredient that bolsters the immune response. The LNPs are "PEGylated" -- chemically attached to PEG molecules that cover the outside of the particles and increase their stability and life span.

PEGs are also used in everyday products such as toothpaste and shampoo as thickeners, solvents, softeners, and moisture carriers, and they've been used as a laxative for decades. An increasing number of biopharmaceuticals include PEGylated compounds as well.

PEGs were long thought to be biologically inert, but a growing body of evidence suggests they are not. As much as 72% of people have at least some antibodies against PEGs, according to a 2016 study led by Samuel Lai, a pharmaco-engineer at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, presumably as a result of exposure to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. About 7% have a level that may be high enough to predispose them to anaphylactic reactions, he found. Other studies have also found antibodies against PEG, but at lower levels.

"Some companies have dropped PEGylated products from their pipeline as a result," Lai says. But he notes that the safety record of many PEGylated drugs has persuaded others that "concerns about anti-PEG antibodies are overstated."

Szebeni says the mechanism behind PEG-conjugated anaphylaxis is relatively unknown because it does not involve immunoglobulin E (IgE), the antibody type that causes classical allergic reactions. (That's why he prefers to call them "anaphylactoid" reactions.) Instead, PEG triggers 2 other classes of antibodies, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), involved in a branch of the body's innate immunity called the complement system, which Szebeni has spent decades studying in a pig model he developed.

In 1999, while working at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Szebeni described a new type of drug-induced reaction he dubbed complement activation-related pseudoallergy (CARPA), a nonspecific immune response to nanoparticle-based medicines, often PEGylated, that are mistakenly recognized by the immune system as viruses.

Szebeni believes CARPA explains the severe anaphylactoid reactions some PEGylated drugs are occasionally known to cause, including cancer blockbuster Doxil. A team assembled by Bruce Sullenger, a surgeon at Duke University, experienced similar issues with an experimental anticoagulant containing PEGylated RNA. The team had to halt a phase III trial in 2014 after about 0.6% of 1600 people who received the drug had severe allergic responses and one participant died. "That stopped the trial," Sullenger says. The team found that every participant with an anaphylaxis had high levels of anti-PEG IgG. But some with no adverse reaction had high levels as well, Sullenger adds. "So, it is not sufficient to just have these antibodies."

At the NIAID meeting, several attendees stressed that PEGylated nanoparticles may cause problems through a mechanism other than CARPA. Just last month [November 2020], Phillips and scientists at FDA and other institutions published a paper showing patients who suffered an anaphylactic reaction to PEGylated drugs did have IgE antibodies to PEG after all, suggesting those may be involved, rather than IgG and IgM.

Other scientists, meanwhile, are not convinced PEG is involved at all. "There is a lot of exaggeration when it comes to the risk of PEGs and CARPA," says Moein Moghimi, a nanomedicine researcher at Newcastle University who suspects a more conventional mechanism is causing the reactions. "You are technically delivering an adjuvant at the injection site to excite the local immune system. It happens that some people get too much excitement because they have a relatively high number of local immune cells."

Others note the amount of PEG in the mRNA vaccines is orders of magnitude lower than in most PEGylated drugs. And whereas those drugs are often given intravenously, the 2 COVID-19 vaccines are injected into a muscle, which leads to a delayed exposure and a much lower level of PEG in the blood, where most anti-PEG antibodies are.

Nevertheless, the companies were aware of the risk. In a stock market prospectus filed on [6 Dec 2018], Moderna acknowledged the possibility of "reactions to the PEG from some lipids or PEG otherwise associated with the LNP." And in a September [2020] paper, BioNTech researchers proposed an alternative to PEG for therapeutic mRNA delivery, noting: "The PEGylation of nanoparticles can also have substantial disadvantages concerning activity and safety.'"

Katalin Kariko, a senior vice president at BioNTech who co-invented the mRNA technology underlying both vaccines, says she discussed with Szebeni whether PEG in the vaccine could be an issue. (The 2 know each other well; both are Hungarian and in the 1980s, Kariko taught Szebeni how to make liposomes in her lab.) They agreed that given the low amount of lipid and the intramuscular administration, the risk was negligible.

Kariko emphasizes that based on what we know so far, the risk is still low. "All vaccines carry some risk. But the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk," she says.

Szebeni agrees, but says he hopes that's also true in the long run. He notes that both mRNA vaccines require 2 shots, and he worries anti-PEG antibodies triggered by the 1st shot could increase the risk of an allergic reaction to the 2nd or to PEGylated drugs.

Stay for 30 minutes
-------------------
To understand the risk, Phillips says, it's crucial to unravel the mechanisms underlying the immune reactions and find out how often they are likely to occur. The known US cases are currently under study, but key clues may have vanished: Anaphylactic reactions produce biomarkers that only remain in the blood for a few hours. At the NIAID meeting, participants discussed ways to ensure that blood samples from future cases are taken immediately and tested for those markers.

If PEG does turn out to be the culprit, the question is, what can be done? Screening millions of people for anti-PEG antibodies before they are vaccinated is not feasible. Instead, CDC guidelines recommend not giving the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine. For people who have had a severe reaction to another vaccine or injectable medication, the risks and benefits of vaccination should be carefully weighed, CDC says. And people who might be at high risk of an anaphylactic reaction should stay at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after their shot so they can be treated if necessary.

"At least [anaphylaxis] is something that happens quickly," Philips says. "So, it's something that you can be very much alerted to, prepared to recognize early and be prepared to treat early."

[Sellaturay et al published a case series of 5 cases of anaphylaxis associated with PEG (polyethylene glycol) containing medications in October 2020, citing the 1st case series. Allergy to the PEGs was confirmed through skin testing. (ref 1). All individuals had a history of multiple medication allergies prior to the event, but all medications were known to contain PEGS.

Wylon et al published a case report in 2016 of an individual with a history of multiple medication allergies (local anesthetic, a progesterone containing injection both with allergic responses. A year later a different local anesthetic led to an anaphylactic reaction. Skin prick tests, intradermal tests, and an oral challenge (double blinded) identified PEG as the allergic trigger. Confirmation was done through intradermal testing which suggested an IgE dependent reaction. (ref 2).

In 2019, Jover Cerda et al noted that PEGs were used in preparation of medical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, industrial, and food products and that the polymers had numerous names for the products, such as macrogol, oxyethylene polymer, and laureth-9. They had a case report of an individual with severe reaction to PEG containing products including skin application (betadine), ingestion of a cough syrup, moisturizing skin creams, and soap. All containing PEGs but under different nomenclatures. The authors conclude the lack of standardized nomenclature facilitates not recognizing PEG as the allergen in these multiple episodes. (ref 3).

Reading these reports one can understand why PEGs are being speculated as the allergens leading to the anaphylactoid reactions following receipt of the mRNA vaccines. We await further information and studies on affected individuals.

Months of lax attitudes and false alarms have ended with a genuine outbreak southwest of Bangkok which has now spread to at least 7 provinces, including the capital.

A whopping 821 cases have now been linked to the Mahachai Market in Samut Sakhon province, health officials announced just before noon. North of the capital in Saraburi province, 3 people, all related, were confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 by health officials this morning [21 Dec 2020] after visiting a large seafood market where the virus has ripped through dormitories mostly housing migrant workers from Myanmar. The outbreak has now reached Bangkok where 4 infections have now been found, as well as Samut Prakan, Nakhon Pathom, Suphanburi, and Ratchaburi provinces.

The total number of cases is in flux as health officials are conducting mass testing on upward of 10 000 people there. The total caseload since the pandemic began has increased by nearly 20% from where it stood just days ago.

In the capital, schools near Samut Sakhon have been ordered closed until [4 Jan 2021], according to Bangkok Gov Aswin Kwanmuang. He also asked people who commute between the 2 provinces to work from home. The city's large-scale New Year's Eve events have been canceled, and Aswin asked for both private and public party organizers to consider doing so as well, along with temples hosting customary gatherings to pray in the new year.

Dancing is to be prohibited and lapsed social-distancing measures are to be imposed on entertainment venues such as pubs and clubs, and. People who insist to do so have to propose measure plans to health officials. No orders have been issued regarding private gatherings and events.

Markets are being told to practice zero tolerance toward those without masks.

Mahachai Market was shut down Friday [18 Dec 2020] after a 57-year-old Thai seafood vendor tested positive for the virus. Health officials quickly discovered a large outbreak underway among the migrant worker community. Much like Singapore's massive outbreak earlier this year [2020], living conditions are poor-to-squalid in the Mahachai dormitories, with little-to-no health care available. Singapore essentially jailed its large migrant population in response while the virus coursed through their communities, sickening tens of thousands. It took months to bring under control.

Though Thailand had recorded scant cases of local transmission in over 6 months, the numbers skyrocketed over the weekend with more than 700 found there. The authorities are also testing migrant workers and vendors who frequent Samut Sakhon at more than 472 of Bangkok's markets, according to Aswin.

The 3 people in Saraburi were infected after they drove to Mahachai to buy seafood for their restaurant last week. A woman, the mother, became ill Wednesday [16 Dec 2020] followed by the rest, but they continued to run errands locally and at nearby provincial markets. All 3 went to the Saraburi Hospital yesterday [20 Dec 2020] after their illness didn't go away.

This is a developing story and may be updated without notice.

An investigation recently pointed out that 2 of 3 new COVID-19 patients in Saraburi province had visited a seafood market in Samut Sakhon province. The patients included a man, his wife, and their daughter. They were found infected at Saraburi Hospital on Sunday evening [20 Dec 2020].

The father and daughter travelled from their hometown and reached Samut Sakhon's Talay Thai seafood market at 11.30 pm on [14 Dec 2020], according to the officially revealed timeline. They visited the market to purchase seafood products in order to sell in their buffet restaurants. The father and daughter returned home on [15 Dec 2020] at 4 am. On [16 Dec 2020], the mother visited a private hospital in Saraburi as she was ill.

The father and daughter travelled from Saraburi to Talay Thai market again and reached the place at around 10 am. They returned home at 4 am on [17 Dec 2020]. At 8 am that day, the wife visited a pork stall in a fresh market in Saraburi's Muang district. She went to a branch of their buffet restaurants later in the evening. On the same day, the daughter and father were slightly ill. They visited local clinics at 5 pm and 6 pm, respectively.

On [18 Dec 2020], the woman visited a pork stall again, while the man went to Pathum Thani province, to shop at a flea market in Nong Sua district. The daughter stayed at home. On [19 Dec 2020], the 3 persons were at home recovering. They decided to visit Saraburi Hospital next day, as their health did not improve.

High-risk persons from these cases consisted of the couple's son, who lived in the same house, and 21 customers of the buffet restaurant.

https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30399942


The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has announced 10 measures to curb the transmission of COVID-19 and has launched a proactive hunt for migrant workers who may be infected. BMA has also closed 3 schools that are on the border of Samut Sakhon province.

The new measures ordered by Bangkok governor Asawin Kwanmuang are:
- All schools and preschools in areas close to Samut Sakhon, such as Bang Khunthien, Bang Bon, and Nong Khaem districts will be closed for 14 days (21 Dec 2020 to 4 Jan 2021) with classes being held online.
- Government officials or BMA personnel who commute from Samut Sakhon will need to isolate themselves and work from home.
- No gatherings are allowed for the New Year celebration. If events need to be held, organisers must submit a disease control plan to obtain permission from the BMA health department.
- Screening checkpoints have been set up on Petchkasem, Rama II, Borommaratchachonnani, and Liap Khlong Phitthayalongkon roads to monitor migrant workers entering Bangkok.
- Parks can be used for exercise, but not gatherings.
- All migrant workers at construction sites will be screened for COVID-19.
- All 472 fresh markets in Bangkok will be checked for active COVID-19 cases, with a special focus on delivery personnel and middlemen dealing with seafood from Samut Sakhon province.
- Places of worship and religious locations in Bangkok have been asked to refrain from activities until the situation is resolved.
- Schools will help search for parents who are migrant workers to undergo tests for the virus.
- Entertainment establishments, restaurants, hotels, shopping malls as well as pubs and karaoke bars need to strictly screen clients, ensure masks are worn, tables kept apart, customers refrain from dancing and the areas are cleaned regularly according to the Public Health Ministry's guidelines.

Everybody is required to wear a mask in public as well as track their movements using the Thai Chana application so it will be easier for health officers to detect and investigate cases in case an infection is detected in the area.

[B] Background discussion (not from the regional network)
Date: Mon 21 Dec 2020
Source: Asia Times [edited]
https://asiatimes.com/2020/12/migrant-cluster-breaks-thai-covid-winning-streak/


Is the recent revelation of the largest daily number of COVID-19 infections in Thailand a full-blown outbreak, or a chance discovery of a malady that has been there for quite some time? That is the key question after more than 700 people living and working around a shrimp market in Mahachai in Samut Sakhon, a province southwest of the capital Bangkok, were found over the weekend [19-20 Dec 2020] to be COVID-19 positive.

Either way, migrant workers, most of them from Myanmar, are at the center of the ruckus with cases being discovered even in Bangkok, from where people travel to Mahachai to buy shrimps and other seafood. That will only make their already precarious and marginalized situation in Thailand even more treacherous.

Contrary to what some Thai newspapers have reported, this is not likely something they brought with them from Myanmar, where authorities have struggled to contain a spreading outbreak. There are rising concerns that Thai authorities may lurch to impose a new national lockdown, including over Bangkok, if numbers continue to climb in the days ahead. Thailand's land borders with all its neighbors have been closed since March [2020] and the migrant workers in Mahachai went there long before any Covid-19 cases were discovered first in Wuhan, China and then in the rest of the region and the wider world.

Since the 1st cases were discovered in Samut Sakhon in mid-December [2020], Thailand's highly efficient health authorities have carried out massive testing in the affected area and placed it under at least a partial lockdown. Since nearly all of those who have tested positive for the virus are asymptomatic or have very mild signs of the disease, it would have been hard to discover it earlier.

But the discovery of cases fits a pattern that has also been seen in many European capitals: migrants, newly arrived refugees, and otherwise dispossessed people who live closely-packed together in ghetto-like conditions are among those hardest-hit by the pandemic. In those communities, where health services are likewise inadequate, it doesn't take more than the arrival of a few infected people for any disease to spread like wildfire and then be out of control.

While many Thais have gone to work in Europe, Taiwan, Israel, South Korea, and other foreign countries, even larger numbers of workers from Thailand's impoverished neighbors have come to the kingdom to look for jobs. The exact number is not known but believed to be in the range of 4-5 million, the vast majority of whom are from neighboring Myanmar. They dominate the labor force in Mahachai's seafood processing plants as well as on fishing boats off Thailand's coasts and in the tourism industry at favorite beach destinations for foreign travelers such as Koh Samui and Phuket.

The factories in and around the border town of Mae Sot have been a constant magnet for migrant workers and in the northern city of Chiang Mai most construction laborers are ethnic Shan from Myanmar, as are many farmworkers in the province and nearby Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son. Thousands of migrant workers returned to Myanmar when the COVID-19 crisis hit Thailand in the beginning of the year [2020]. That -- coupled with thousands more returning from China -- is most likely the origin of the now fast spread of the disease in their home country.

As of [20 Dec 2020], Myanmar had 113 082 known infections and 2443 deaths, according to official statistics. But because testing is carried out almost exclusively in urban areas in central Myanmar, those figures are likely only the tip of the iceberg of the true number of cases, according to regional health experts. Myanmar does not have the means to carry out nationwide testing, tracking, and treatment of its entire population. It has remained an almost exclusively domestic problem for Myanmar.

The 1st spread of the disease to any neighboring country occurred when 2 migrant workers from Myanmar tested positive in the Chinese border town of Ruili in September [2020], leading to the testing of some 200 000 people in that area, a local lockdown and border closure.

In December [2020], a group of about 50 Thai women who had worked in an entertainment center in Tachilek near Thailand's northern border, tested positive when they were apprehended after most of them had crossed the border illegally without going into mandatory 14-day quarantine for all arrivals into the kingdom. That "outbreak" caused a near-panic in northern Thailand when it was discovered that some of the returned had visited shopping malls and movie theaters in Chiang Mai and elsewhere.

What should be seen as the outcome of years-long neglect of the welfare of the migrant workers, businesses in Samut Sakhon are already hurting badly from the Covid-19 publicity. Amphai Harnkraiwilai, chairwoman of the provincial chamber of commerce, was quoted in the local Bangkok Post of [21 Dec 2020] as saying that losses caused by the market's closure already amount to a billion Thai baht, or USD 33.4 million, a day. It's not only the seafood industry that has been badly affected. Related businesses and services have also had to close down, a local festival had to be canceled, and schools have suspended their classes.

More gravely, there is also the possibility of a backlash against Myanmar migrant workers who have remained in Thailand after the initial COVID-driven exodus earlier this year [2020]. It seems clear that the migrants caught the disease in Thailand and did not bring it with them from Myanmar, but rational thinking is a scarce commodity in times of crisis -- and nothing as severe as the COVID-19 pandemic has been experienced across the globe in recent memory [see comment below].

The problem for Thailand is that it needs migrant workers who work in industries as diverse as fishing to construction, to revive its COVID-hit economy. On the other hand, one positive upshot of Thailand's latest COVID-19 scare is that migrant workers are being tested and, if necessary, can get the treatment they need.

[It is curious that the same article has a photograph with the following caption: "People line up to have their temperatures taken as a preventive measure against the spread of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus at the Ministry of Transport at the border crossing over the 2nd Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge in Mae Sot in Tak province on [29 Oct 2020]. Photo: AFP/ Lillian Suwarnrumpha," suggesting that the borders have not been hermetically sealed. Recognizing that this virus has is transmitted when people may not be symptomatic, but may either be asymptomatically infected or pre-symptomatic (infected but symptoms haven't started), temperature screening at border crossings is not fool proof in preventing "entry" of the virus into a country. Yes, silent transmission could well be ongoing in a country for several weeks before the "symptomatic explosion becomes noticed," but to speculate 9 months of silent transmission...

The individual starting the transmission chain may well have been a Thai national returning to the country from another country where transmission may have been ongoing and the individual slipped through the quarantine net. One thing these outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2 have done is to highlight the high risk groups with limited access to healthcare services and living in conditions that favor virus transmission. - Mod.MPP]

Key countries not reporting cases today include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway in the European Region.

The Americas and European Regions still maintain their dominance. At the country level, in each region the profiles for the dominant countries remain the same, but actual case counts are lower due to reduced reporting during the weekends.

[Weekend reporting decreases are still noted. While the number of non-reporting countries has decreased, the reporting remains reduced in key transmission countries. Among the countries not reporting any new cases in the past 24 hours include Sweden, Kazakhstan, and Venezuela. In the past 24 hours, the USA (206 137), UK (33 364), and Russia (29 350) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9359 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (19-20 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, UK, Russia, Brazil (25 621), Germany (19 333), India (19 174), Turkey (19 103), Spain (12 662), Netherlands (11 168), Italy (10 869), Colombia (10 845), and Switzerland (10 002). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (down from 60 countries on Fri 18 Dec 2020); 25 of the 50 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 13.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.5%. (influenced by Turkey's high backlog reporting 12 days ago) - figures appear to be stabilized. The USA is also showing reduced reporting. Similar comparative averages for the USA show a decrease of 2.7% in reported cases and an increase of 6.7% in reported deaths. - Mod.MPP]
