Bird flu outbreak registered on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The H5N1 strain of avian flu, which can be fatal to humans, has been
detected in fowl at a farm on Ukraine's Black Sea Crimea peninsula,
emergency officials said Friday [18 Jan 2008].

The farm in the village of Rivne had been placed under quarantine
after more than 150 chickens died of the virus, the Emergency
Situations Ministry said in a statement.

The last registered outbreak of bird flu in Ukraine was in June 2006.
No human cases have been recorded in the country.

Bird flu strain claims 5th swan
---------------------------------
A 5th swan at a sanctuary in Dorset has tested positive for the
virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu, environment department Defra has
said. A total of 4 mute swans found dead at the Abbotsbury Swannery,
near Chesil Beach, also tested positive for the strain.

John Houston, of Abbotsbury Tourism, said: "We are expecting to have
a run of positives and negatives while [the virus] works its way
through the herd."

Restrictions on the movement of birds, imposed last week [7-11 Jan
2008], remain in place.

Earlier, Defra said there was currently no evidence to suggest the
disease was widespread among wild birds in the area, but officials
were closely monitoring the situation. The Abbotsbury Swannery will
be given the all-clear if no birds test positive for the virus after
21 days. The 1st cases of the disease were found on 10 Jan 2008.

The swannery is part of an area of wetland recognised to be of
international importance. The Health Protection Agency has monitored
about 12 staff at the swannery for signs of the disease, although the
risk of infection is said to be low. Workers have been given a course
of anti-viral drug Tamiflu as a precaution.

[The seasonal upsurge of H5N1 is gaining pace. The Autonomous
Republic of Crimea -- a peninsula and an autonomous republic of
Ukraine -- suffered a major outbreak which started in December 2005,
continuing during the first 4 months of 2006, with grave economical
losses. For more details refer to ProMED-Mail posting 20060705.1852.

Since the beginning of 2008, new introductions of H5N1 have been
reported from Israel, UK (England), India (West Bengal) and Iran
(where the disease, reportedly, started in December 2007), while
further spread of existing outbreaks has been reported from Egypt,
Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Pakistan and China. - Mod.AS]
