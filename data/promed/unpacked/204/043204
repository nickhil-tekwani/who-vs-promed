Virus slams 2013 California tomato yields
-----------------------------------------
Bob Gilbertson, University of California, estimates last year's [2013] tomato crop was reduced by about a million tons because of BCTV [_Beet curly top virus_]. Tomatoes with curly top symptoms began showing up in late March [2013; ProMED-mail post 20130607.1760251].

"We were seeing curly top in areas where we typically don't see it," Gilbertson said. He noted that the disease affected different areas to varying degrees. While particularly bad in counties Kern, Kings, and Fresno, it was seen to a lesser degree in the rest of the San Joaquin Valley. The virus was not seen in the Sacramento Valley. "To illustrate just how bad it was -- we saw it in cucurbits, which we never see. In over 20 years this was the 1st year I've seen it in crops like cantaloupe and honeydew."

He suspects a combination of favorable conditions for the leafhopper [vector] and hosts for the virus in the foothills. "The state's spray program was certainly not enough to manage the disease," he said.

There are also hypotheses of new, more virulent strains of BCTV that have a wider host range or are able to be transmitted more effectively. Historically, BCTV was a severe problem in sugar beets until the industry developed resistant beets, he said. "In the early-mid 1900s, curly top was one of the most devastating diseases of sugar beets. One of the reasons is beet leafhoppers love sugar beets. They really don't like tomatoes." [But] as sugar beet production declined, curly top did not disappear.

A comprehensive research program has been initiated to develop an effective, integrated pest management program for curly top.

[Curly top disease of tomato is caused by _Beet curly top virus_ (BCTV; genus _Curtovirus_). The virus has a wide host range and also affects other crops, including beans, capsicum, spinach, sugar beet, cucurbit vegetables, as well as a range of ornamental and weed species. Symptoms may include distortion (curling) and yellowing of leaves, necrosis of phloem tissue, as well as stunting and distortions of roots and plants. The disease reduces plant vigour and yield can be severely affected, or plants may die all together.

BCTV is spread by the beet leafhopper (_Circulifer tenellus_) and can also be transmitted by grafting. The virus overwinters in the vector insects which remain infective for life. The leafhoppers migrate in spring and spread the virus. Weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as vector and pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult but may include control of vector insects and reservoir plants by pesticide/herbicide sprays or cultural methods. No genetic resistance has been found in tomato so far and all commercial cultivars are susceptible.
