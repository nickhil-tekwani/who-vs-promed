Weekly summary of epidemiological data
Week 21 (20-26 May 2019)

For the week of 20-26 May 2019, we recorded
- 2056 suspected cases investigated and tested in the laboratory;
- 88 new confirmed cases;
- the main outbreak epicenters are in Mabalako, Butembo, and Katwa;
- 6 new probable cases validated (the 3 probable cases from Masereka had been erroneously reported from Butembo);
- 57 confirmed deaths. Of these, 25, or 43.9%, were community deaths and 32 occurred in an ETC; and
- 16 new recoveries released from ETCs.

News
Diplomatic visit to Butembo
---------------------------
- Swedish ambassador to the DRC, Maria Hakansson, and British foreign minister, Harriett Baldwin, visited the Ebola response teams in Butembo on Mon 27 May 2019. After the courtesy of the mayor of the city, the 2 guests visited different sites of the Ebola response starting with a vaccination site. They also visited the ETC and the ETC nursery in Butembo. After all these visits, the Swedish ambassador and the British foreign minister visited the Auberge, the Butembo coordination center, and discussed with the teams the situation of the epidemic, the challenges, and the constraints of the response. They also had discussions with Butembo's women leaders and representatives of religious denominations, including representatives of Catholics, Muslims, and Protestants.

Support for providers of the Mabalako sub-coordination office
-------------------------------------------------------------
- The Ministry of Health warmly thanks all the local providers who are the main architects of the Ebola response despite the many risks and difficulties they face. All agents involved in the response are entitled to receive their bonus in accordance with the scale in effect since the beginning of this response.
- The Ministry of Health was informed of the decision of some health workers in Mabalako to go on strike on Mon 27 May 2019. The strike ended on Tue 28 May 2019. These agents are demanding supposed unpaid Ebola premiums between August and December 2018 by the Health System Development Program (HSDP). Based on information collected from the Ministry of Health and the HSDP, there are no Ebola premium arrears for the year 2018.
- However, the situation of these providers needs to be clarified. In fact, after analyzing the lists of strike providers sent to the national coordination by Mangina's sub-coordinator, it appears that they are providers working at the Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Mabalako. As a reminder, the management of the ETC Mabalako was entrusted successively to 2 international NGOs who have ensured the organization of services and payment of Ebola premiums from providers since the beginning of the response. In the future, it will be important to clarify the contract transfer procedure of providers when an agency or organization leaves a health zone to avoid misunderstandings.
- It is important to note that the Ministry of Health has developed, with support from the World Bank, a manual of simplified human resource management procedures related to the response to the EVD epidemic. The manual states that bonuses are not cumulative, and any case of fraud, or attempted fraud, will now be followed by sanctions or even disciplinary measures. The manual also provides several types of control for the payment of premiums. Monitoring missions are carried out every month in the different sub-coordination offices to check the lists of providers and the evidence of service rendered (attendance lists). The last mission is from the beginning of May [2019] to validate the payment lists for the month of April 2019. However, during the various checks carried out since January 2019, the 40 Mabalako service providers who announced the strike do not appear at all on lists of staff to be supported by the HSDP.
- Discussions continue with Mabalako's sub-coordination office to determine the merits of these claims. In order to avoid such situations in the future and to ensure greater transparency in the management of human resources, all the agents involved in the response will have to sign standard contracts, which will be included in a single database for all organizations involved in the response to Ebola.

Figures of the response
-----------------------
- 126 084 vaccinated persons;
- 617 people vaccinated on 27 May 2019;
- of those vaccinated, 34 726 are high-risk contacts (HRC), 61 763 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 29 595 are 1st-line providers (FLP);
- persons vaccinated by health zone: 32 639 in Katwa, 25 294 in Beni, 16 391 in Butembo [total number of people vaccinated can be seen at the source URL above];
- the only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018;
- 61 391 293 people under control;
- 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (OHC);
- 106 contaminated health workers;
- one health worker in Katwa, unvaccinated (refusal), is one of the new confirmed cases and one of the new deaths (community deaths); and
- the cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 106 (5.5% of all confirmed/probable cases), including 36 deaths.

[WHO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/democratic-republic-congo-ebola-virus-disease-external-situation-58

Situation update; data as reported by 26 May 2019
-------------------------------------------------
Weekly numbers of confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases have slightly decreased in past weeks. Over the past 7 days, a total of 88 new confirmed cases were reported, compared to the previous week, where 121 new confirmed cases were reported. Katwa, one of the epicentres of the outbreak, reported fewer cases this week, while other health zones such as Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Mandima have seen an increase in case reporting. Active transmission was reported in 14 of the 22 health zones that have been affected to date. Other initial encouraging findings such as a lower proportion of reported nosocomial infections, a lower proportion of community deaths, and a higher proportion of registered contacts at case detection have also been reported. However, this decrease in the number of reported cases should be interpreted with extreme caution, given the complex operating environment and fragility of the security situation. Weekly fluctuations in these indicators have been reported in the past, and uncertainties remain with regards to the ability of the surveillance system to identify all new cases in areas faced with ongoing insecurity. Operations are still regularly hampered by security issues, and the risk of national and regional spread remains very high.

Mabalako reported 23% (73/320) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Nine out of the 12 Mabalako health areas have reported new confirmed cases during this period. In the 21 days between 6-26 May 2019, 88 health areas within 14 health zones reported new cases, representing 49% of the 179 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 320 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (23%, n=73), Butembo (19%, n=61), Katwa (14%, n=45), Kalunguta (12%, n=37), Beni (11%, n=35) ), Musienene (7%, n=23) and Mandima (7%, n=22).

As of 26 May 2019, a total of 1920 EVD cases, including 1826 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1281 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1187 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 1920 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1113) were female, and 29% (565) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 105 (6% of total cases).

- Fri 24 May 2019. MSF Ebola update.
[MSF (Doctors Without Borders; Médecins sans Frontières), edited]
https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/ebola-outbreak-drc-crisis-update-may-2019

Almost 10 months into the outbreak, the number of people with confirmed cases of Ebola cases continues to increase, and conditions in the affected areas are getting worse. Cases have been confirmed in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. This is the country's 10th outbreak of the deadly virus in 40 years. DRC's Ministry of Health officially declared the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease in North Kivu on [1 Aug 2018], but the outbreak likely began months earlier.

MSF remains an active player in the Ebola response. Following separate attacks on our Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in Butembo and Katwa -- at the epicenter of the outbreak -- earlier this year [2019], MSF is not currently running treatment centers. MSF is helping existing healthcare structures in North Kivu and Ituri provinces to prepare for and handle potential Ebola cases and managing transit centers where patients with suspected Ebola are tested and sent to ETCs if they test positive.

In addition, the organization is involved in prevention activities by working to implement and strengthen disease surveillance and infection prevention and control activities (IPC) in the region, as well as working with local structures to make sure they have the capacity and equipment to isolate possible positive cases.

Working closely with communities to identify and address their specific needs is critical. In addition to Ebola activities, MSF is helping to increase access to general healthcare to treat other common illnesses and improve water and sanitation to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. Increasing access to basic healthcare can help reduce the number of new cases of Ebola. It is safer to keep people out of hospitals, where they could come into contact with others who are infected with the virus.

The epicenter of the outbreak is in North Kivu province, a densely populated area in the country's northeast, with about 7 million people. Despite the challenges of rough terrain and bad roads, the population is highly mobile. North Kivu shares a border with Uganda to the east and sees a lot of trade as well as human trafficking and "irregular" crossings. Some communities live on both sides of the border and cross back and forth frequently to visit relatives or trade goods.

North Kivu has been an area of conflict for over 25 years, with more than 100 armed groups estimated to be active. Criminal activity, such as kidnappings, is relatively common, and skirmishes between armed groups occur regularly. Widespread violence has uprooted people and made some areas in the region quite difficult to access. While most of the urban areas are relatively less exposed to the conflict, attacks and explosions have taken place in Beni, a regional administrative center, sometimes limiting MSF's ability to run operations.

The current epidemic was first declared in the small town of Mangina, and the outbreak's epicenter has appeared to move toward the south, first to the city of Beni, and later to the larger city of Butembo, a trading hub. Nearby Katwa became a new hotspot near the end of 2018, and cases have been found further south. Meanwhile, sporadic cases have also appeared in neighboring Ituri province to the north.

All actors involved in the Ebola response have failed to build trust within the local community. Widespread mistrust, as well as violent attacks against the Ebola response, are hampering the efforts to control the epidemic. People are not seeking care in Ebola treatment centers. This has resulted in an increased likelihood that the virus could spread in other health facilities that aren't equipped with proper infection control procedures and equipment.

About half of all the new cases are community deaths, which means people are either dying at home or in general health care facilities. This is an indication of the persistent lack of trust in the intervention. People dying of Ebola in the community also present a significant risk of transmission to others.

Also violence and unrest -- such as fighting between the army and armed groups in early May [2019] and the killing of a WHO doctor in April [2019] in Butembo -- have brought many activities to a standstill. For instance, vaccination of contacts, contacts of contacts, and frontline workers in Butembo and Katwa is sometimes temporarily suspended because of threats to the safety of vaccination teams. It will not be possible to end this outbreak if there is no trust built between the Ebola response and the affected people. We have to listen to the needs of communities, restore their choice when it comes to managing their health, and involve them in every aspect of the Ebola response.

Overall, the geographic spread of the epidemic appears to be unpredictable, with diffuse small clusters of cases potentially occurring anywhere in the region. This pattern makes ending the outbreak even more challenging. Given the appearance of new confirmed cases further to the south, the risk of the epidemic reaching Goma, the capital of the province, is another reason for concern.

MSF is extremely worried about the lack of visibility on the actual epidemiological situation, as more than 80% of new confirmed cases have not been identified as contacts. Additionally, as few as 32% of the new confirmed cases were linked back to known contacts. This means that the listing of contacts and surveillance are not effective. Contact tracing is essential to control the evolution of the outbreak. This also means that while the number of new cases being reported is high, the real number is likely to be even higher.

- Wed 29 May 2019. Decline in Ebola cases
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Response and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/decline-ebola-cases-comes-amid-fragile-security-situation
[byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Decline in Ebola cases comes amid fragile security situation
------------------------------------------------------------
It its latest weekly Ebola assessment WHO said Ebola cases have dipped slightly in the past weeks, but it warned that the decline should be interpreted with extreme caution, due to the complex environment and fragile security situation. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry yesterday [28 May 2019] reported 6 more cases, pushing the outbreak total to 1926 cases.

Encouraging glimmers or ongoing fluctuations?
---------------------------------------------
Part of the decline reflects fewer cases in Katwa, which has been the main Ebola epicenter over the past several weeks. At the same time, smaller hot spots such as Mabalako, Kalunguta, and Mandima are experiencing rising cases. For example, WHO notes that Mabalako has reported 23% of newly confirmed cases over the past 3 weeks.

Aside from a drop in cases, WHO said in its latest situation report that it sees other encouraging signs, including lower proportions of nosocomial (healthcare-related) infections and community deaths. Also, it said outbreak responders are reporting higher proportions of contacts registering when cases are detected.

It said, however, that weekly fluctuations in the indicators that health officials track have been reported in the past, and it's still not clear if the surveillance system has the ability to identify all new cases in areas with ongoing security problems. "Operations are still regularly hampered by security issues, and the risk of national and regional spread remains very high," WHO said.

New cases in 3 hot spots
------------------------
In a daily update yesterday [28 May 2019], the DRC's health ministry said the 6 new cases include 2 in Katwa, 2 in Butembo, and 2 in Mabalako.

In other outbreak region developments, health workers in Mabalako went on a 1-day strike on 27 May 2019 over claims that they weren't paid their bonuses in August and December [2018]. The ministry said there appears to have been a mix-up with nongovernmental organizations that were involved in managing the Mabalako treatment center and, adding that it's important to clarify transfer procedures when an agency leaves a health zone.

Officials note that discussion are still under way with the Mabalako sub-coordination office to assess the merits of the health workers' claims.

- Thu 30 May 2019. Children
[Reuter's, abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-ebola-children/congos-ebola-epidemic-inflicts-heavy-toll-on-children-idUSKCN1T00IS
[byline: Alessandra Prentice]

The Ebola outbreak in Congo -- the 2nd largest on record -- has inflicted an unusually heavy toll on children. More than a quarter of the confirmed and probable cases identified as of early April [2019] were children under 15, compared to 18% in the last major outbreak in West Africa in 2013-2016, according to figures compiled by WHO.

The disease can progress rapidly, crippling the immune system and shutting down vital organs. Young children and babies are especially vulnerable. Their small bodies are less well equipped to cope with extreme fluid loss brought on by common symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and bleeding, said Daniel Bausch, an infectious disease specialist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

More than 2 out of every 3 children infected in this outbreak have died compared with just over half the adults, WHO said. As of 26 May 2019, the death toll stood at 1281 people, including at least 541 who were under 18. Fatality rates are highest for children under 4 who died at a rate of around 80% in West Africa, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015 [see reference below].

Ebola cases would typically be divided more or less equally between male and female patients. But in this outbreak, women and girls account for 58% of cases, down from a peak of 62% in December [2018], WHO said. The reason more women and children have fallen sick remains a bit of a mystery. But experts suspect it may be because the Beni area, where the outbreak began in August [2018], was also battling malaria at the time.

Malaria can cause severe complications in pregnant women and children, requiring treatment at medical facilities where they risk exposure to undiagnosed Ebola patients, said Mike Ryan, who heads the WHO's health emergencies program. "Transmission within the healthcare setting has been a major factor driving this outbreak," Ryan said. "Unfortunately, women and children have been the unwitting victims of that reality."

Healthcare standards in Congo vary widely due to lack of oversight over a system that includes many unregistered private clinics and traditional healers operating out of their homes. A key part of the Ebola response effort involves decontaminating health facilities, educating health workers on how to protect themselves and their patients, and persuading residents to seek treatment at specialized centers. But these efforts have been hindered by outbreaks of violence and a deep mistrust of outsiders.

"The shorter incubation period in children, the relatively high risk of death among children younger than 5 years of age (as compared with older children), and the more rapid progression to death highlight the importance of including children among case contacts for follow-up, of examining children for early signs of disease during active case finding, and of explaining the risk of EVD to parents, guardians, and caregivers. All persons in whom EVD is suspected, but especially children, need the earliest possible referral for diagnostic testing, and children need age-appropriate treatment. The causes of the relatively rapid disease progression and relatively high CFR in the youngest children requires further investigation." - Mod./LK]

EVD cases in under 5 year olds
------------------------------
WHO periodically conducts in-depth epidemiological analyses so that data can help reveal any gaps and drive evidence-based response improvements. An in-depth analysis of EVD cases in children under five-years of age demonstrated some noteworthy trends. As of 28 May, children under the age of five accounted for 15% (300/1949) of EVD cases reported, with children under 1 year of age accounting for 6% (118/1949). Of the 300 cases in children under the age of 5, 19 were probable cases (19/94, 20% of all probable cases).

Data indicate that children under the age of five are being brought into healthcare facilities sooner than cases over the age of 5 (2.4 days vs 3.2 days, respectively), but most of these cases are not being referred to ETCs, and instead attend multiple local healthcare facilities. These cases visited on average 1.5 healthcare facilities, compared to 1.2 healthcare facilities for cases aged over 5 years of age.

With regards to contact-tracing, 28% of EVD cases under 5 years of age are registered as contacts, compared to 41% in cases over 5 years of age. Although EVD cases under 5 years of age are less frequently listed as contacts, proportions of cases both below and over 5 years of age are under surveillance remain similar (18% vs. 20% respectively). The reasons underlying these low figures are unclear at this time and further investigations are ongoing.

As of 28 May 2019, the overall case fatality rate (CFR) of EVD cases in children under the age of 5 stands at 77%. This CFR was notably higher than that of EVD cases over 5 years of age at 57%. These figures are in line with those observed in the 2014 West Africa EVD outbreak.

[3] Response
- Mon 27 May 2019. Two journalists threatened with death by militia in eastern DR Congo
[Actualite, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://actualite.cd/2019/05/27/deux-journalistes-menaces-de-mort-par-des-miliciens-lest-de-la-rd-congo

Journalist in danger (JED) is extremely worried about the situation of two journalists forced to live in hiding after receiving a series of death threats by Mai Mai militia in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. They are David Munyanga, director of Radio Ondese FM, a community station in Kiliba, South Kivu province; and Fiston Matsanda, a journalist with Bashu Community Radio in Beni territory, North Kivu province.

According to our sources, David Munyanga went into hiding on 22 May 2019. The day before, his home was attacked by a group of Mai Mai militia armed with firearms. After brutalizing him, one of his attackers wanted to shoot the journalist. David Munyanga was saved thanks to the intervention of his neighbors. These militants reproached him for having disseminated information that would be the basis of the arrest of a Mai Mai element by the Armed Forces of DR Congo (FARDC). While preparing to leave the locality of Kiliba, David Munyanga received a phone call from a militia leader who made threats to him: "We did not want to kill you that day because you were with your children. Your radio will be burned and you will be murdered if our element is not released."

Contacted by JED, David Munyanga said it's been more than a month since he saw threats from these militiamen. "In April [2019], I was ambushed by the Mai Mai militia in the Ondes-Kabulimbo section. These gunmen took me to the bush where I was detained for about 5 hours. I got my release thanks to the intervention of the local authorities who made phone calls to my captors. My laptop and my phone have been confiscated until today. 2 days after my release, the same Mai Mai chief seriously threatened me on the phone for allowing my radio to broadcast information about my kidnapping. Faced with this series of death threats, I officially seized the head of the city whom I asked for protection."

For his part, Fiston Matsanda of Bashu Community Radio in Beni, fearing for his life, has been forced to live in hiding with his family since 2 May 2019. The Mai Mai militias reproach him, among other things, for having been actively involved in the fight against Ebola through his reports. According to our information, since the beginning of this disease in the east of the country, Fiston Matsanda has broadcast several reports in connection with the sensitization of the local population to eradicate this disease at the base of several deaths. His involvement in the campaign against this disease is at the root of a series of death threats he is currently suffering.

Journalist in Danger (JED) vigorously denounces these death threats against these journalists by individuals without faith or law. JED urges the provincial authorities of South and North Kivu to do their utmost to ensure the physical safety of these 2 journalists and to put an end to the threats they face.

This Actualite.cd report, published in the safety of Kinshasa, may also help to explain the silence of Radio Moto Butembo-Beni since 16 May 2019: Two journalists threatened with death by militia in eastern DR Congo.

I have been looking for other North Kivu-Ituri radio stations with websites and found none. A region with 10 million people has many radio and TV stations, but so far I've found only sites dead for years or no sites at all. Now I suspect that even those still operating are saying very little about Ebola or the response, rather than see their reporters killed and their stations burned down. - Mary Marshall]

- Wed 29 May 2019. Congo Ebola response must be elevated to maximum level, UN told
[The Guardian, abridged, edited]
< https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/29/congo-ebola-response-must-be-elevated-to-maximum-level-un-told>

The UN has been urged by charities to ramp up Ebola prevention work in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the highest level of emergency response.

Only 3 crises -- Yemen, Syria, and Mozambique -- are treated as the equivalent of a level-3 response, activated when agencies are unable to meet needs on the ground. Charities including Mercy Corps and Oxfam said the same declaration should also be made in DRC, following a recent acceleration in the spread of Ebola.

Almost 2000 cases of Ebola have been recorded since the outbreak began in August. As of [Mon 27 May 2019], 1287 people have died from the disease. Violence by armed groups and community mistrust have severely undermined attempts to halt the epidemic, forcing health workers to suspend vaccination and treatment work. Whitney Elmer, country director of DRC for Mercy Corps, said that declaring the equivalent of a level-three emergency would bring "manifold benefits" by clarifying the roles of agencies, allowing greater access to resources and attracting greater global attention. "There has never been an epidemic of this complexity or size in the DRC," said Elmer, adding that the crisis requires a new structure in line with its scale.

The global humanitarian coordination body, Inter-Agency Standing Committee, will consider the call when it meets on Wed. Among the factors to be considered are the scale and complexity of an epidemic, and the risk of a failure to respond effectively. A level-3 emergency, now known as a system-wide scale up, does not indicate the severity of the crisis, but is activated where there is a mismatch between need and agencies' ability to respond.

On [Tue 28 May 2019], Mike Ryan, assistant director-general of the World Health Organization's emergency preparedness and response programme, said progress had been made in fighting Ebola, including a drop in transmission of the disease in health facilities. But insecurity has continued to undermine the response, he added, repeatedly preventing work to identify and vaccinate people at risk of Ebola. There have been 174 attacks on health facilities so far this year [2019], a 3-fold increase compared with the period from August to December 2018.

In some areas, health workers are afraid to wear protective equipment because they fear they will be targeted by armed groups, according to WHO. Médecins sans Frontières warned it is "extremely worried" about the unpredictability of new cases.

- Tue 28 May 2019. WHO experts say violence preventing end of Ebola outbreak

Today [28 May 2019] experts from WHO said the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is being fueled by violent security incidents. "The outbreak could be stopped ... but without a secure environment it's not possible," said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, in a teleconference today.

Violent incidents have tripled
------------------------------
The past 5 months have seen 174 attacks on health clinics and health workers, alike, Moeti said. The attacks have caused 5 deaths and 51 documented injuries. When compared with the first 5 months of the outbreak, which began last August [2018], that's a tripling of violence, she said. Over the weekend [25-26 May 2019], a community health worker near Mabalako was killed. The worker was trained to carry out response efforts in Vusahiro village. On the evening of the attack, 3 houses in the village were also burned.

The attacks are the sole reason the outbreak is not coming to an end, Moeti said, as each violent attack disrupts surveillance and vaccination efforts. "The technical means to stop this Ebola outbreak are available, but without access, they can't be employed optimally," Moeti said.

This week [week of 27 May 2019] David Gressly, MBA, who was appointed last week as the United Nation's Ebola czar, will create a new structure that could "crack the code" on violence, Moeti said. Gressly will arrive in Butembo tomorrow [29 May 2019], and one of his key objectives is healthcare worker security.

Over the weekend, the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the DRC grew by 26 cases, passing the 1900 case mark to a total of 1920 cases, according to the DRC yesterday [27 May 2019]. Among the 1920 cases are 1281 deaths and more than 500 survivors. As of yesterday, the DRC said 252 suspected cases are still under investigation, and 125 467 people had been vaccinated against the virus.

Nosocomial transmission drop; pop-up vaccination
------------------------------------------------
While violent attacks are on the rise, Mike Ryan, the WHO's executive director of emergency programs, highlighted some encouraging figures in the latest epidemiologic updates on the outbreak. "6 or 7 weeks ago, 35% of cases were nosocomial, meaning they contracted Ebola in the healthcare setting," said Ryan. "In the last 21 days that rate has dropped to 16% and in the last week, 5%." Ryan said the goal is zero nosocomial transmission. He also touted the effectiveness of "pop-up" vaccination clinics and community health teams that are working on a "zone-to-zone" level in active outbreak regions. "In Katwa, it's almost a cellular, street level of community engagement," Ryan said.

Katwa and Butembo are still the outbreak epicenters, and Ryan said the outbreak remains geographically contained. But even with certain wins, Ryan said he refused to speculate on the outbreak. "We may still see another wave of cases," he said.

MSF questions surveillance efforts
----------------------------------
Late last week [week of 20 May 2019], Doctors Without Borders (Médecins sans Frontières; MSF), which pulled out of the region in February [2019] because of violence, issued a statement on the outbreak, suggesting that surveillance is not effective. "More than 80% of new confirmed cases have not been identified as contacts. Additionally, as few as 32% of the new confirmed cases were linked back to known contacts. This means that the listing of contacts and surveillance are not effective," the statement said. "This also mean that while the number of new cases being reported is high, the real number is likely to be even higher."

[It is very concerning that "more than 80% of new confirmed cases have not been identified as contacts." This means there are transmission chains that have not been identified. It will be very hard to get ahead of the outbreak with this pattern of transmission. Further exacerbated by the violence in the region, the control effort has major challenges that seem to be recognized, but the solutions are elusive. - Mod.LK]

- Wed 29 May 2019. Katwa: health worker

A health worker opposed to the vaccine against Ebola virus, which has affected the provinces of North-Kivu and Ituri for nearly 10 months, died of the virus on Mon [27 May 2019] in Katwa, North Kivu, the ministry of health said.

The unvaccinated (by refusal) health worker is among the 6 new confirmed cases and among the new community deaths reported on Tuesday evening [28 May 2019] by the ministry of health bulletin. "The cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 106 (5.5% of all confirmed/probable cases)," says the health authority in its bulletin.

Of these, 36 have already died. They are among the 1287 confirmed and probable cases that have died to date. The response to the Ebola outbreak is fraught with distrust and some kind of denial of disease by the people. They consider Ebola as a Western business, a strategy to exterminate them, or an act of witchcraft.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The authors conclude that "stopping this epidemic will require the alignment of the principal political and armed groups in eastern DRC in support of the response.

Conclusions. Global health and protection from global contagious threats rest on the public health capacity of each country. Even in the middle of intractable conflict, success in controlling Ebola must be achieved. We have the tools of global disease surveillance, rapid-response systems, and biomedical solutions -- if there is the political will to protect health workers in conflict zones while gaining the confidence of communities as primary partners in fighting outbreaks such as Ebola. Vigorous governmental leadership of the response must be balanced with attention to community concerns. The alignment of key political and armed groups behind the response effort is essential to stop the violence against health care and rehabilitate the humanitarian space required for outbreak control."
