Two more hippos have died of suspected anthrax in Queen Elizabeth National
Park, bringing the death toll to 29 since last Friday [11 Jun 2010]. The
New Vision reported on Tuesday [16 Jun 2010] that at least 27 hippos had
died of suspected anthrax.

The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) chief, Moses Mapesa, said he was still
waiting for the results from the samples sent for analysis at the
veterinary laboratory in Entebbe to find out what killed the animals. He
added that it would take several weeks to analyse the samples. [Sic,
usually it just takes hours to a couple of days. - Mod.MHJ]

The park's conservation manager, Tom Okello, said the new cases were found
near the Kazinga Channel in Katunguru. He said the wildlife authority had
deployed a team to monitor the situation.

Okello reiterated the authority's call on fishermen on lakes George and
Edward, and the Kazinga Channel, to report any carcasses floating on the
waters. He also warned cattle-keepers to desist from grazing their animals
in the park to prevent them from catching the disease. Okello also warned
against eating game meat.

Animals that die of the disease must be buried or burnt to prevent
contamination.

[I was informed by a knowledgeable contact at Entebbe that the UWA was
informed on Wednesday, 16 Jun 2010, of the results of their analyses.

Disposing of dead hippos in this part of Africa is not without problems,
whether burning or burying. Maybe a better solution would be to let the
carcasses float in the lake open water and prevent them coming to the
shore. Dragging them over land to a central burial or burning site would
create extensive contaminated areas (and people steal hippo teeth and sell
them as well). This option would involve 3 guys with a motorboat of
sufficient size and power to be capable of towing hippo carcasses, and some
very strong rope -- which is a pretty manageable logistical burden relative
to what anything else would require (trucks, backhoe, digging teams, etc).
They would have to stand by to check on them drifting ashore.

The African lakes are large. Away from the shore and the chances of
cannibalistic attacks from other hippos the likelihood of the carcass being
opened is much decreased; opening a carcass greatly increases sporulation.
Vultures are plentiful but are not strong enough to open the hippo skin,
though with the hippo carcass once opened the vultures will take advantage
to thoroughly scavenge it. Also crocodiles can have access BUT they don't
like to eat in open water AND if they open up the carcass, they do it from
below where immediately the blood will spill into large volumes of lake
water (there is limited sporulation in water because the necessary
nutrients are dispersed and the vegetative bacilli die quickly anyway).
Also towing the carcasses well away from shore would result in the hippo
intestines expelled through the anus through carcass bloating not being
available for other hippos to feed on -- let the crocodiles have them and
they can pull on them to their hearts' content.

Something to consider. This disposal procedure would not apply with rivers
because if nothing else the carcasses would very soon wash up on the riverbank.
