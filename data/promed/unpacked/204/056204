Suspected Hemorrhagic Fever Patient Travelled to Canada via New York
---------------------------------------------------------------------
HAMILTON: A woman who travelled from Africa and is now in a Hamilton
(Ontario) hospital may be North America's first human case of infection
with the dreaded Ebola virus. Health Canada confirmed last night it has
sent a blood sample from the woman, who is in serious condition, to a
laboratory in Winnipeg that tests for and studies [dangerous pathogens,
including Ebola virus [which is associated with lethal hemorrhagic fever in
Africa. It will take until Thursday [8 Feb 2001 for the laboratory to
confirm whether the woman, who recently arrived in the Hamilton area from
the Democratic Republic of Congo, has Ebola [fever, another viral
hemorrhagic fever, or severe meningitis.
Infectious diseases expert Mark Loeb said at a hastily convened press
conference at the Henderson Hospital that the immigration services are
trying to track down everyone who was in close contact with the
unidentified woman. Viral hemorrhagic fevers are spread through human
excretions such as blood, semen, saliva, and mucus, but are not as
contagious as [some other diseases such as tuberculosis, which is spread
by airborne water droplets. "It's not as if everybody on the plane would
have been exposed," Donald Low, chief of microbiology at Mount Sinai
Hospital, said from his home last night. "It's direct contact that's the
risk -- people who have made contact with the body fluids. The virus is not
going to jump through your skin".
Dr Douglas MacPherson, a Health Canada infectious disease specialist who is
in Hamilton monitoring the situation, said yesterday he didn't know yet how
many people were on the plane from Congo to New York nor from New York to
Pearson Airport in Toronto. "There are national and international health
care concerns, and national immigration services in the States have been
notified," he said. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation is
tracking down health care workers and patients who may have been in the
emergency room when the patient arrived there at 7:30 pm on Sunday 4 Feb
2001. The Hamilton Public Health Unit is attempting to locate anyone who
may have been in close contact with the woman before her arrival at
Henderson [Hospital. Health Canada's search for contacts begins at Pearson
Airport and "goes backwards" from there, Dr MacPherson said.
The woman flew from Congo and arrived in New York City on Friday, where she
stayed overnight. She flew from New York to Toronto, and, as far as
officials know, went directly from there to Hamilton. On Sunday evening,
she arrived at the emergency room of the Henderson Hospital and was
immediately admitted with symptoms doctors soon suspected were the result
of a tropical fever. Dr Loeb confirmed she has been isolated in a room with
negative air pressure and all medical personnel are taking extra
precautions while caring for her.
