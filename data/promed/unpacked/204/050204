_E. coli_ cases linked to pig roast
-----------------------------------
2 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ have triggered an investigation into a
possible outbreak of the bacteria. A 30-year-old and 3-year-old,
unrelated to each other, tested positive for _E. coli_ O157 after
attending a pig roast in Waldemar, 28 Aug 2004.
Although Cameron Clarke of the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Health Unit
says it is not a critical issue, 2 more persons who attended the
event have been diagnosed as probable carriers and 3 others are
suspect.
"We have a sense that it isn't an explosive outbreak," says the
program manager of the control of infectious disease. "But we call it
an outbreak right away when we have confirmed cases associated with
the same event."
More than 50 people attended the pig roast, and so far the health
unit has interviewed 29 to rule out any further cases. Clarke is
urging anyone who may have been present at the event to visit their
family doctor.
The [source] of the bacteria has not been identified by
investigators, and food samples from the party were not available for
testing. _E. coli_ O157 is most often spread through food, such as
undercooked meat, but the bacteria can also be transmitted from
person to person.
At this point it's likely that no more cases will come forward, he
says, but he encourages all people who attended the event to be
tested. There is no effective treatment for _E. coli_, and more
severe cases can lead to kidney failure or dysfunction.
The 2 persons diagnosed have suffered only mild symptoms, Clarke
adds, and will be monitored until the bacteria is shed. An outbreak
of _E. coli_ was last seen in the area about 2 years ago in Fergus,
when people at a home day care were exposed to the bacteria.
The Dufferin-Wellington-Guelph health unit reports about 20 to 30
isolated cases per year, which Clarke stresses are much less severe
than an outbreak.

[The animals most often associated with _E. coli_ O157 are cattle;
however, swine and deer, among others, have been found to carry the
organism. It is not stated whether ground beef was also served.
The posting mentions carriers of the organism, which is unusual.
These isolates could be from subclinical infections. - Mod.LL]
