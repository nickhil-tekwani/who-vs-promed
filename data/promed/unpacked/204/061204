A total of 8 adult cattle died suddenly in the
last weeks of December 2008 in a farm with 1100
head located in Estacion Alzaga, Gonzales-Chaves
Municipality, Province of Buenos Aires. All
animals had blood coming out from their natural
orifices. On 29 Dec 2008, the veterinarian took a
metacarpal sample and sent it to the laboratory
looking for a diagnosis. _Bacillus anthracis_ was
isolated. The culture was susceptible to the
usual veterinary antibiotics but it was resistant
to Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.

Nowadays it is the end of Argentinean spring, and
this season has been particularly dry in the
Province of Buenos Aires. The grazing is very
short, less than one fist in height. The animals
were not vaccinated, and the farm had no past
history of cases of anthrax. Two ranch hands who
had skinned the carcasses are currently receiving
medical therapy, since they had cuts on their
hands. To date the carcasses have not been
disposed of in the standard manner. [Covered in
lime and a tarpaulin, and left for 9 months. - Mod.MHJ]
