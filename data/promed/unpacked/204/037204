Police are combing the guest records of one of the world's most famous and expensive hotels in search of the alleged assassin who poisoned a Russian financier.

Alexander Perepilichnyy, a businessman who had turned supergrass [informer], died at his home in Surrey on the day he returned from a secretive trip to Paris.

British detectives had ruled out foul play but -- to their embarrassment -- French investigators have taken up the case. They believe Mr Perepilichnyy, 44, may have been poisoned in Paris up to 48 hours before his death.

A post mortem examination found traces of _Gelsemium elegans_, a slow-acting poisonous plant said to be favoured by Russian and Chinese assassins, in his stomach. Police have now established Mr Perepilichnyy checked into the prestigious Bristol Hotel in Paris for 3 nights before his death.

Sources have told The Telegraph that police are now examining the Bristol's records to see who else was staying there when Mr Perepilichnyy was in Paris. He died on 10 Nov 2012, at his rented home on the high security St George's Hill estate in Weybridge, Surrey.

It is understood French officials have also made a request to British police to secure his mobile phone records for the period up to and during his stay in the French capital.

Mr Perepilichnyy, a father of 2, came to the UK in 2010, apparently in fear of his life, and brought with him a series of damning documents that exposed a massive fraud perpetrated in Moscow.

On the day of his death, he had complained to his wife he was feeling ill after arriving at his home and had gone for a jog to shake off the effects. He then collapsed and died.

Despite serious concerns about his death, Surrey police ruled out murder in June 2013, despite not being able to determine the cause of death.

The examination showing traces of _Gelsemium_ was only found by a specialist plant expert at Kew Gardens, carrying out tests on behalf of [the victim's] life insurance company. An inquest in May [2015] was postponed and is due to resume in September [2015].

Concerns over the man's death were first raised by Bill Browder, an Anglo-American financier. Hermitage Capital, which Mr Browder founded and which now operates from London, had its Moscow branch raided by police in 2007 and it is alleged USD 230 million worth (GBP 148 million) of assets was stolen from the fund. Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer working for Mr Bowder who exposed corruption at senior levels, was subsequently arrested in Moscow and beaten to death in a prison cell in November 2009.

Eight months later, Mr Browder approached [the Hermitage Capital financier's] lawyers with documents that claimed tax officials in Moscow had gone on a multi-million-pound spending spree on kickbacks earned from the Hermitage fraud.

Mr Browder told The Telegraph: "It beggars belief that the British police continue to refuse to reopen the investigation, given the evidence he may have been poisoned and given that French police have now opened their own murder investigation. What are they waiting for?"

It is understood Mr Perepeilichnyy booked 2 hotel rooms in Paris; one at the Bristol and another at an as yet unknown 3-star hotel. One possibility is he stayed at the cheaper hotel and paid for a representative of the Russian gang to stay at the Bristol in an attempt to broker a peace deal that would keep the gang from going after him.

Surrey police declined to comment.

[_Gelsemium elegans_ is also known as _Bignonia sempervirens_, Carolina jasmine, evening trumpet flower, false jasmine, faux jasmin, Gelsemie, Gelsemie toujours verte, Gelsemii rhizoma, Gelsemin, Gelsemio, _Gelsemium nitidum_, _Gelsemium sempervirens_, _Gelsemium Toujours_.

Gelsemium is a plant. Some people call it "woodbine", which can be confusing because American ivy and honeysuckle are also known as "woodbine." If you want gelsemium, look for its scientific name, which is _Gelsemium sempervirens_, _Gelsemium nitidum_, or _Bignonia sempervirens_.

Despite serious safety concerns, the root and underground stem (rhizome) of gelsemium are used to make medicine. Gelsemium is used as a painkiller for migraine headaches and for face pain caused by certain facial nerves (trigeminal neuralgia). It is also used for asthma and other breathing problems.

Gelsemium is UNSAFE. All parts of the plant are very poisonous. Even small amounts can cause serious toxicity, including death. Symptoms of poisoning include headache, vision problems, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, muscle problems, seizures, breathing problems, slowing of the heart, and others.

Gelsemium comes in 3 flowering varieties -- 2 native to North America and 1 to China. All 3 can be deadly. The most toxic variety of gelsemium, _Gelsemium elegans_, only grows in Asia, and is also known as "heartbreak grass".

Initial symptoms from an overdose would typically include dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, and convulsions. At larger doses, it causes paralysis of the spinal cord, leading to almost complete loss of muscular power and eventually asphyxia.

Previous cases of poisoning with "heartbreak grass" have revealed telltale traces of gelsemium alkaloids in the blood and urine of the victim. The appearance of these chemicals in the latest toxicology report give weight to the theory that Alexander Perepilichnyy may have been the victim of foul play.

The toxic agent of gelsemium are 2 alkaloids (gelseminine and gelsemine) that exert analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. At a lethal dose, the alkaloids produce violent clonic convulsions that lead to respiratory failure. Since the convulsions could be prevented by pentobarbital or diazepam and potentiated by reserpine, it is postulated that the alkaloids act centrally against GABA [gamma-aminobutyric acid] action.

The alkaloid is a spinal convulsant, acting much the same way as strychnine. The drug is a powerful spinal depressant; its most marked action being on the anterior cornus of grey matter in the spinal cord.

The drug kills by its action on the respiratory centre of the medulla oblongata. Shortly after the administration of even a moderate dose, the respiration is slowed and is ultimately arrested, this being the cause of death.

Poisonous doses of gelsemium produce a sensation of languor, relaxation, and muscular weakness, which may be followed by paralysis if the dose is sufficiently large. The face becomes anxious, the temperature subnormal, the skin cold and clammy, and the pulse rapid and feeble. Dropping of the upper eyelid and lower jaw, internal squint, double vision, and dilatation of the pupil are prominent symptoms. The respiration becomes slow and feeble, shallow and irregular, and death occurs from centric respiratory failure, the heart stopping almost simultaneously. Consciousness is usually preserved until late in the poisoning, but may be lost soon after the ingestion of a fatal dose. The effects usually begin in half an hour, but sometimes almost immediately. Death has occurred at periods varying from 1 to 7.5 hours.

The feelings described in the paragraph above may be why the victim felt like he was ill, but why he would go for a run, when feeling ill, seems illogical. In fact it may have hastened his death.

The treatment of gelsemium poisoning consists in the prompt evacuation of the stomach by an emetic, if the patient's condition permits; secondly, and equally important, artificial respiration, aided by the early administration, subcutaneously, of ammonia, strychnine, atropine, or digitalis.

An allied species, _G. elegans_ (Benth.) of Upper Burma, is used in China as a criminal poison and its effects are very rapid.
