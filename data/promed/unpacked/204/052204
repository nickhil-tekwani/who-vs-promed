The Junta [Council] de Extremadura has confirmed, through the Algente Regency National Laboratory, the detection of epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) on a cattle farm in the municipality of Villanueva del Fresno in Badajoz.

After the 8 cases reported in Spain since 18 Nov 2022 in the provinces of CÃ¡diz, Seville, and Huelva, this would be the first detected in Extremadura.

The suspicion arose after a report to the Official Veterinary Services of the Jerez de los Caballeros region about a bovine with clinical signs compatible with the disease. After the clinical review, samples were taken for confirmation at the National Reference Laboratory.

EHD is a non-contagious infectious vector disease, transmitted by insects of the genus _Culicoides_ that affects wild and domestic ruminant animals, but doesn't affect humans.

In cattle, it can produce moderate and self-limiting symptoms for about 2 weeks. Sheep are susceptible to infection, which mostly remains subclinical. Goats are similarly susceptible. EHD seriously affects white-tailed deer and can also affect fallow deer and roe deer.

Historically, EHD has circulated in North America, Australia, Asia and Africa, but it had never been detected in Spain or the European Union until 10 Nov 2022, when the Italian authorities reported the detection of the virus on cattle farms on the island of Sardinia and later in Sicily.

[The spread of EHD from Spain's autonomous community Andalusia northwards into Extremadura should not surprise. This _culicoides_-borne orbivirus is expected to follow the spread route of another orbivirus, namely Bluetongue, transmitted by the same vector species. BTV-4 started its recent spread in southern Spain in late September 2022, clinically affecting mainly sheep. Differences between the clinical signs caused by BTV and EHDV in cattle are rather indiscernible. It has been suggested that both BTV and EHDV have been transmitted to the south European territories by airborne vectors from the African continent/Maghreb.

EU member states and some non-members have been applying vaccination against certain serotypes of bluetongue virus, according to the EU's regime. A similar policy may be considered in relation to EHD, to control its further spread within the affected territories and beyond. At present, no licensed vaccine against EHD in cattle is commercially available. Serotyping results of the virus involved are anticipated. - Mod.AS
