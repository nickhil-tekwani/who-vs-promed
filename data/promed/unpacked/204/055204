According to Mongolian local media reports on 14 Sep 2022, on 12 Sep 2022, the laboratory test report of a suspected case of plague previously reported by Mongolia was released. The results showed that the above-mentioned case was changed from suspected to confirmed.

At present, although the 11 people who have had close contact with the confirmed case have no symptoms of infection, the plague prevention and control medical team has taken home isolation and preventive treatment measures for them.

[No clinical or geographical information is given regarding the reported case of _Yersinia pestis_ infection.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Although the term bubonic plague is used in the post, no mention of swollen lymph nodes is given, suggesting perhaps septicemic plague instead.

Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing, and even prophylactic antimicrobials, if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_, or "mountain mouse." - Mod.LL
