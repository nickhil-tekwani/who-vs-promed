This weekly report provides an overview of West Nile virus (WNV) epidemiology in the EU/EEA and EU-neighbouring countries during the WNV transmission season (expected to be June-November). Following a One Health approach, WNV infections in humans and outbreaks in equids and birds are included in the report. Visit the dedicated webpages for more information on WNV infections and ECDC's seasonal WNV surveillance.

Epidemiological summary
-----------------------
Since last week's update, and as of 24 Aug 2022, European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries reported 101 human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection and 4 deaths related to WNV infections. Cases were reported by Italy (70), Greece (24), Romania (6), and Germany (1). Deaths were reported by Greece (2), Italy (1), and Romania (1). EU-neighbouring countries reported 28 human cases of WNV infection in Serbia and 3 deaths related to WNV infections in Serbia.

This week, among the reporting countries, the following NUTS 3 or GAUL 1 regions have reported human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time: Harz in Germany and Lucca in Italy.

Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season and as of 24 Aug 2022, EU/EEA countries have reported 394 human cases of WNV infection as follows: Italy (299), Greece (83), Romania (8), Austria (2), Germany (1), and Slovakia (1). There have been 21 deaths in EU/EEA countries reported in the following countries: Italy (15), Greece (5), and Romania (1). From EU-neighbouring countries Serbia reported 81 cases, of which 6 have died.

During the current transmission season, within the reporting countries, human cases of WNV infection were reported from 58 different NUTS 3 or GAUL 1 areas, of which the following reported human cases of WNV infection for the 1st time: Harz in Germany, Pistoia and Lucca in Italy, and Moravicki in Serbia.

Since the beginning of the 2022 transmission season, 19 outbreaks among equids and 99 outbreaks among birds have been reported by EU/EEA countries. Outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (16), Hungary (2), and France (1). Outbreaks among birds have been reported by Italy (98) and Germany (1).

-------
Data on human cases are collected via The European Surveillance System (TESSy) managed by ECDC. Only locally acquired cases with known place of infection are included in this report. The following EU-neighbouring countries report human cases of WNV infection to ECDC: Albania, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey.

Animal data (i.e. outbreaks among equids and birds) are collected through the Animal Disease Information System (ADIS) of the European Commission. Reporting of WNV in equids and birds is mandatory at the EU/EEA level.

The distribution of human infections covers EU/EEA and EU-neighbouring countries, whereas outbreaks among equids and birds covers only EU/EEA countries.

*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence

Ten West Nile Fever patients have been moved to the ICU in a Padua hospital amid a concerning rise in the mosquito-borne disease in Veneto, medical sources said Monday [22 Aug 2022]. There are now 15 people with the fever in the Padua hospital in all.

The hospital said some of those in the ICU were relatively young, at around 50-60 years of age. "The rest are elderly, hard hit by this virus, which seems particularly aggressive this year [2022]", said the director-general of the Azienda Ospedale Università Padova, Giuseppe Dal Ben.

Meanwhile, a 3rd case was reported in Tuscany in a 16-year-old boy.

A 74-year-old woman died of West Nile Fever in Reggio Emilia overnight, the local health authority said Wednesday [17 Aug 2022]. The woman had been severely immuno-depressed. She had been in hospital since [7 Aug 2022]. She died late Tuesday night [16 Aug 2022] from West Nile associated meningoencephalitis and a concomitant infection from COVID-19. It was the 2nd death from the fever in Emilia-Romagna after the recent death of an 88-year-old man in Ferrara.

Another man died of West Nile Fever near Brescia on Thursday [18 Aug 2022]. He was from Cigole, south of Brescia. He had been hospitalised recently. He was one of the 2 more serious patients of 4 West Nile cases in and around the Lombardy city. His death brought to 11 Italy's death toll from the virus since the start of June [2022].

West Nile virus cases have risen 53% in Italy in the last 7 days, the Higher Health Institute (ISS) said Thursday [18 Aug 2022]. The number of cases has risen from 94 to 144, from the beginning of June [2022] to Tuesday [9 Aug 2022], the ISS said.

Four people have now died of the virus in the last week, taking the overall death toll up to 11, all in northern Italy. There have been 6 deaths in Veneto, 2 in Piedmont, 2 in Lombardy and one in Emilia-Romagna.

West Nile virus (WNV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes West Nile fever. It is a member of the family Flaviviridae, from the genus Flavivirus, which also contains the Zika virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, mostly species of _Culex_.

The primary hosts of WNV are birds, so that the virus remains within a "bird-mosquito-bird" transmission cycle. The virus is genetically related to the Japanese encephalitis family of viruses.

There have been 71 fresh West Nile Fever cases, and 2 more deaths from the virus in Italy in the last 7 days, the Higher Health Institute (ISS) said in a weekly report updated to 23 Aug 2022.

There have now been 301 cases in the country, and 15 deaths, since the beginning of June [2022], the report said.

Infections from the Usutu virus remain at 3.

Of the 301 cases, 160 have been of the neuro-invasive form (85 in Veneto, 37 in Emilia-Romagna, 19 in Piedmont, 8 in Lombardy, 7 in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, 3 in Tuscany, and 1 in Sardinia). Some 45 cases have been found in blood donors (23 in Veneto, 11 in Emilia-Romagna, 6 in Lombardy, and 5 in Piedmont).

Some 186 mosquito pools have been identified, 15 hotbeds in equine species and 142 infected birds.

No bird farms have been affected, the report said. Ten West Nile Fever patients have been moved to the ICU in a Padua hospital amid a concerning rise in the mosquito-borne disease in Veneto, medical sources said earlier this week.

There are now 15 people with the fever in the Padua hospital in all. The hospital said some of those in the ICU were relatively young, at around 50-60 years of age.

[According to the latest European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) report in item [1], 394 WNV cases have been reported in Europe this year (2022). But the data reveals an alarming fact: of those 394 cases, 299 have been reported in Italy alone. That's more than 3 times the cases reported in Greece (83), which has the 2nd highest number of cases among the 6 countries in Europe that have reported the virus in their territories. The other countries include Romania (8), Austria (2), Germany (1), and Slovakia (1).

Of greater concern is that, of those who contracted the virus and developed West Nile fever, there were 15 deaths in Italy as of 24 Aug 2022, also the highest in Europe.

Since the beginning of the year (2022), Italy have reported outbreaks of the virus among equids (horses and others - 16 outbreaks) and birds (98 outbreaks).

The best way to prevent West Nile is to protect yourself from mosquito bites; people should use insect repellents, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, treat clothing and gear, and take steps to control mosquitoes indoors and outdoors. - Mod.UBA]
