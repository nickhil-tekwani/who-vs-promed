While the winter chill has brought down the number of [dengue] cases last week, warmer days as predicted by the [Pune] Met department has again spiked up the cases with ten new infections being reported on Sunday [24 Nov 2013].

Dr S T Pardeshi, acting medical chief of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) attributed this rise to variations in weather. On several days the morning chill is soon offset by warm weather during the day, he said. According to IMD, the trend of rising temperature is likely to continue for the next 24 hours. The minimum temperature is likely to be go up to 15 degree Celsius [59 F], a release said.

"We are picking up new cases daily as the health department has been collating data from private hospitals. Earlier, we would get cases only from state run Sassoon general hospital or PMC run hospitals," Pardeshi admitted.

According to Dr Rajesh Gadia, consulting physician at KEM hospital, it is a known fact that cases of [chikungunya and dengue virus] infections rise post monsoon. The sudden rain few weeks ago also led to accumulation of stagnant water with the existing garbage, he said. Pardeshi said that their ongoing survey has detected a large number of [_Aedes_ vector mosquito] breeding spots at households. Doctors admit though that the cases have been mild with few being hospitalized. As against the large number of dengue cases, there have been 38 cases of chikungunya from January till date, Pardeshi said.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in India and causes sporadic outbreaks in various parts of the country. Not surprisingly, Pune is having a mixed outbreak of chikungunya and dengue virus infections since both viruses are transmitted by the same vector mosquito. If the chikungunya virus vector mosquitoes, _Aedes aegypti_, are relatively abundant as is likely, the occurrence of additional cases can be expected unless the vector control efforts are effective or temperatures decline further. Although the fatality rate for chikungunya virus infections is low to nil, morbidity can be high with persistent arthralgia that can last weeks to months. There is no commercially available chikungunya virus vaccine.
