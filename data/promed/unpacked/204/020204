[Most African countries declare to be free of Classical swine fever (CSF) for
decades if not generations; see OIE's multiannual CSF status Africa in
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/sit_mald_freq_pl.asp?c_cont=1&c_mald=14>.
The situation in Africa was reviewed in 20010803.1518, which concluded
(moderator's remark): "There is patently a widespread risk of this wildlife
disease infecting domestic swine in many countries in Africa." Unfortunately,
this has come true in South Africa, a country which has not seen CSF since
1918, now detected and duly notified. Enhanced vigilance is required in
other countries in the region. - Mod.AS]
