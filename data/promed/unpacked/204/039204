[It has now been 23 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan, 9 days more than one incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). In today's (26 Apr 2020) report, there was 1 new locally transmitted infection in Heilongjiang reported. With an additional 2 imported cases, the total number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours is 3. It has now been 33 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 21 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from both Guangdong and Heilongjiang are decreasing, with no newly confirmed cases reported from Guangdong today (26 Apr 2020).

According to the report above, a total of 82 830 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 3 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (25 Apr 2020) report, and there was 1 newly reported death. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 25 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 1 was in an imported case. There were no conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 974, and 131 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 197 675 cases, including 26 664 deaths, up from 195 351 cases and 26 384 deaths reported on 25 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 25 and 26 Apr 2020 was 2324 newly confirmed cases, compared with 2357 newly confirmed cases between 24 Apr 2020 and 25 Apr 2020, a slow, vacillating, but steady decline. Numbers of hospitalized cases and numbers of cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 70.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 39.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont, 2 other provinces(Liguria and Tuscany) have reported more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 7 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 5 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

[4] Iran: 90 481 total cases, 5710 deaths
Date: Sun 26 Apr 2020
Source: Channel TV, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.channelstv.com/2020/04/26/iran-says-covid-cases-pass-90000/


The number of novel coronavirus cases in Iran has passed 90 000, according to official figures released Sunday [26 Apr 2020], as Tehran announced its lowest number of new deaths in weeks.

Health authorities have registered 1153 new cases of the COVID-19 illness since midday Saturday [25 Apr 2020], bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 90 481, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a daily news briefing.

60 additional fatalities were recorded, with the overall death toll reaching 5710, he added. It is the country's lowest number of officially declared deaths since [10 Mar 2020].

Iran announced its 1st novel coronavirus cases in February [2020], and is the worst-hit country in the Middle East. Jahanpour said Iranians needed to continue to respect health and social distancing measures, despite the decreasing death toll.

Since [11 Apr 2020], authorities have allowed the phased reopening of some businesses and have relaxed some domestic travel restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the virus. Schools, universities, mosques, Shiite shrines, cinemas, and sports stadiums, however, remain closed.

Meanwhile, some health officials in the Islamic republic have warned of the risk of a fresh outbreak. Alireza Zali, the anti-coronavirus coordinator for the capital, criticised "hasty reopenings" that could "create new waves of sickness in Tehran and complicate efforts to bring the epidemic under control", in comments quoted Saturday [25 Apr 2020] by semi-official news agency ISNA. Another senior health ministry official has expressed similar fears for other hard-hit provinces.

Iranian authorities no longer provide provincial breakdowns of coronavirus cases and deaths, but Tehran province is considered to be among the worst affected.

[In the 24 hours from 25 to 26 Apr 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 89 328 to 90 481, an increase of 1153 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 5650 to 5710, an increase of 60 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 26 Apr 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 8th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, and Turkey, having surpassed China. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening.

In another media report, an authorized representative of the Health Ministry in Gilan Province mentioned that now that family gatherings are permitted, there has been an increase in cases in families, mentioning his province has confirmed 700 new cases in the past 4 days.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 987 160, including deaths, an increase from 960 651 cases and 54 256 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 293 991 (29.8%) cumulative case reports and 5678 (21.4%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 153 204 as of 2:00 PM on 26 Apr 2020, including 11 460 confirmed deaths and an additional 5213 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (3515 -- 13.3%), Illinois (2126 -- 8.0%), Massachusetts (1590 -- 6.0% of total), California (1190 -- 4.5%) and Pennsylvania (1011 -- 3.8%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Connecticut.

The US military has confirmed 6213 cumulative cases, with 0 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 6860 cumulative cases and 168 new cases today (26 Apr 2020).

[Yesterday's [25 Apr 2020] update used the summation of the PCR- and antibody-positive as well as asymptomatic cases. Hence, the reported numbers in the table above are less than previously reported and reflect only cases confirmed by PCR. There is no information in tabular form on the Spanish MoH website providing the number of antibody confirmed infections with the SARS-CoV-2, only a colored bar on an epidemic curve that is together with Table 1 at the source URL. Perhaps the WHO update for tomorrow will have the combined numbers as today's has combined numbers for yesterday's report (25 Apr 2020).

That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 1729 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 25 hours bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 207 634 as compared with 205 905 PCR confirmed cases yesterday (25 Apr 2020). Eliminating the antibody confirmed cases from the totals makes it difficult to determine if reported cases are decreasing until we have more days of following these numbers.

As of today (26 Apr 2020) and as per the Spanish health webpage, 207 634 total cases and 23 190 deaths have been reported, up from 205 905 cases and 22 902 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (25 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 88.49, a continual slow decrease over the past 14 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 88.49 today (26 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 207 634 cases, approximately 80 150 (38.6% have been hospitalized and 8528 (4.1%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). Caution should be taken in interpreting this rise due to the decreased denominator.
