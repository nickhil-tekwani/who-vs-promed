[1] COVID-19 variants
[A] UK ex South Africa

The UK has detected 2 cases of another new variant of coronavirus, the health secretary Matt Hancock says. The cases in London and northwest England are contacts of people who travelled to South Africa, where the variant was discovered.

Travel restrictions with South Africa have been imposed. Anyone who has travelled there in the past fortnight, and anyone they have been in contact with, are being told to quarantine immediately.

The variant has been causing mounting concern in South Africa, where health minister Zweli Mkhize warned that "young, previously healthy people are now becoming very sick."

He said the country "cannot go through what we went through in the early days of the Aids pandemic."

Clinicians have been providing anecdotal evidence of a shift in the clinical epidemiological picture, in particular noting that they are seeing a larger proportion of younger patients with no co-morbidities presenting with critical illness.

Scientists in South Africa say the variant has "spread rapidly" and became the dominant form of the virus in parts of the country.

The variant is still being analysed, but the data are consistent with it spreading more quickly.

It was detected for the 1st time in the UK on Tuesday [22 Dec 2020].

'Explosive outbreaks'
---------------------
This variant shares some similarities to the one that has already been detected in the UK, although they have evolved separately.

Both have a mutation -- called N501Y -- which is in a crucial part of the virus that it uses to infect the body's cells.

Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: "I think the greatest concern of ours at the moment is the South African one.

"There's certainly anecdotal reports of explosive outbreaks for that virus and very steep increases in case numbers."

At the Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said the new variant was "highly concerning" and that anyone told to quarantine must avoid "all contact with any other person whatsoever."

At the same briefing, he announced millions more people were being moved to Tier 4 [non-essential shops, hairdressers, and leisure and entertainment venues must close, with a new "stay at home" message introduced...; https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/24/covid-tier-4-rules-in-england-latest-restrictions-explained] on Boxing Day [26 Dec 2020] in an effort to control the virus.

Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said "both look like they are more transmissible" but said they were "still learning" about the variant imported from South Africa.

She said she was "pretty confident" the quarantine and travel rules would control the spread of the new variant.

Prof Lawrence Young, from Warwick Medical School, said: "The standard measures to restrict transmission (hands, face, space) will prevent infection with this variant.

"The move to harsher levels of restriction across the country is inevitable."

How is South Africa responding?
-------------------------------
The government tightened restrictions for the festive season, including closing beaches along the famous Garden Route in Western Cape province.

It faced resistance from the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), and some lobby groups, who challenged the decision in the courts, arguing that the closure of beaches would have a devastating effect on small businesses.

But judges upheld the restrictions, saying the government had a duty to protect the health of people.

Western Cape premier Alan Winde said hospitals in the province were under "severe strain." The province had more COVID-19 cases this time around than during the 1st wave.

South Africa has so far recorded about 950 000 cases and more than 25 000 deaths, the highest in Africa.

[Based on the GISAID database, "by 21 Dec 2020, 301 new virus genomes collected in South Africa since [1 Nov 2020] were submitted to GISAID, with 182 genomes from clade GH; 89% of these viruses have 3 mutations in the spike receptor binding site (K417N, E484K, and N501Y). 27% of the 182 have a 9-nucleotide deletion in NSP6 in addition to the 3 mutations. Spike mutation N501Y is also found in the novel UK variant under investigation, which is from a different clade.

"It has been reported, based on high-throughput experiments, that all three spike receptor binding site mutations (K417N, E484K and N501Y) were shown to mildly increase receptor binding. Because receptor binding interfaces are also common epitopes, receptor binding interface mutations could also affect binding of some antibodies to the virus and, in rare cases, have the potential to affect vaccine response. A triple mutant at the interface has not been observed yet in larger outbreaks" (https://www.gisaid.org/references/gisaid-in-the-news/novel-mutation-combination-in-spike-receptor-binding-site/). This requires more sequence data on outbreak samples and an in-depth investigation of what is driving multiple mutational events in a relatively short period. - Mod.UBA]

[B] South Africa: media briefing
Date: Sat 19 Dec 2020

https://twitter.com/DrZweliMkhize/status/1339970259332325383


We have convened this public briefing today [19 Dec 2020] to announce that a variant of the SARS-COV-2 virus -- currently termed 501.V2 variant -- has been identified by our genomics scientists here in South Africa.

This genomics team, led by the Kwazulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform, or KRISP, has sequenced hundreds of samples from across the country since the beginning of the pandemic in March [2020].

Clinicians have been providing anecdotal evidence of a shift in the clinical epidemiological picture, in particular noting that they are seeing a larger proportion of younger patients with no co-morbidities presenting with critical illness.

The evidence that has been collated, therefore, strongly suggests that that the current 2nd wave we are experiencing is being driven by this new variant.

Karim [Salim Abdool Karim, Network for Genomics Surveillance]: "What we are seeing now is that the rate of increase in cases is similar as the 1st wave, but the 2nd wave has now overshot the peak of the 1st wave."

Karim: "The 2nd wave has now hit all provinces with some early signs of it spreading faster than the 1st wave."

Karim: "The 2nd wave is showing early signs that it is spreading faster than the 1st wave. It is not clear if this 2nd wave has more or less deaths. We have not seen any red flags looking at our current death information."

Karim: "This new 501.V2 variant has become dominant in South Africa. This new variant has 3 mutations."

Karim: "The higher viral load in swabs may translate to higher efficiency of transmission."

Karim: "We are seeing a much higher proportion of the new variant than the rest of the world."

Karim: "We don't know where it originated. What we do know is that we first found it in Nelson Mandela Bay."

Mkhize [Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize]: "We knew it was coming, but none of us expected for it to come as quickly as it did. There was no specific projection. It comes at a time when the behaviour over the festive season is likely to worsen the spread of the virus."

Mkhize: "We have noticed a degree of complacency with mask-wearing and hand sanitizing. The 2nd wave is increasing during this season, but we believe it is most likely to increase after this season. It may well have another bump where numbers are showing an increase."

Mkhize: "We appeal to all the media and medical and scientific community to focus on the facts and avoid entering into speculation or issue unproven statements and generate panic and disinformation."

[C] Denmark: N439 K variant
Date: Wed 23 Dec 2020
Source: Avian Flu Diary [abridged, edited]
https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2020/12/denmark-ssi-report-on-covid-19-variant.html


Although the UK (VUI-202012/01) and South African (501Y.V2) COVID variants are currently at the top of our pandemic watch list, there are other evolutionary changes occurring within the SARS-CoV-2 virus that are worthy of our attention. One change, which has been reported this fall across parts of Europe is the N439K substitution -- where asparagine is replaced by lysine -- at the 439th site of the spike protein.

While not growing as rapidly as the UK or South African variants, N439K has been linked to increased binding to ACE receptors and may be better able to evade the neutralizing effects of some monoclonal antibodies (see Nov 5th preprint [Thomson EC, Rosen LE, Shepherd JG, et al.: The circulating SARS-CoV-2 spike variant N439K maintains fitness while evading antibody-mediated immunity. bioRxiv. posted 5 Nov 2020; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842 This article is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed.]).

On Monday [21 Dec 2020], we looked at the COG-UK update on SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations of special interest, which described N439K as follows:

There is no evidence for a faster rate of growth for the 439K variant beyond that already determined for the D614G mutation which is also found in all variants carrying 439K. N439K enhances 5 binding affinity to the hACE2 receptor and is able to escape the neutralising activity of some mAbs, including one in clinical trials, and from some antibodies present in sera from a sizable fraction of people recovered from infection. By looking at the medical interventions needed/outcomes for patients carrying either 439N or 439K, no increased disease severity was observed. Furthermore, there is no evidence that this mutation will allow the virus to escape immunity triggered by vaccines.

Also on Monday [21 Dec 2020], Denmark's Serum Statens Institut published a 6-page analysis of this N439K variant, one which is slightly less certain about the susceptibility of this variant to the current vaccine than some others we've seen.

Epidemiological report - Brief summary:

There is increased focus on SARS-CoV-2 with Spike variant N439K, as a new study shows that N439K the variant indicates decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies and has been found in several European countries. There is therefore a concern about how effective a vaccine will be against this variant.

We do not know if this is the case at present. It is therefore relevant to keep an eye on how widespread the infection with this variant is in Denmark and whether it has spread among particularly vulnerable groups at risk of a serious disease course.

The variant with the N439K mutation in the Spike protein has been found in 1624 samples from 8 Aug to 6 Dec 2020. Proportion of the N439K variant out of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced samples has, since week 46, been about 10% of all sequenced samples. SARS-CoV-2, Spike variant N439K is in Denmark, primarily found in and around Copenhagen and in South Jutland. The gender and age distribution is similar to the gender and age distribution for the total SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark. The admission rate for the N439K variant is lower compared to the total SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark. No deaths have been recorded among persons with SARS-CoV-2, Spike variant N439K in Denmark at present. There is nothing in this variant which suggests that it has affected a particular population group or that it is more serious than the general picture we see for COVID-19 in Denmark. We will at SSI going forward keep an eye on this variant.

Background
----------
The N439K is a variant of the SARS-CoV-2. This variant was first seen in Romania (May 2020). There is increased focus on the N439K variant in the Spike gene, as a new study shows that N439K [apparent translation error removed for clarity - Mod.JH] decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Besides Denmark, the N439K variant is found in large parts of Europe but is most common in Ireland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and England. Furthermore, cases have been found in Australia and New Zealand. The purpose of this descriptive analysis is to look at how widespread the N439K variant is in Denmark and whether it affects specific population groups. Furthermore, to look at whether the variant seems to cause one more serious disease course.

Description of COVID-19 variant N439K
-------------------------------------
So far, there is nothing in this variant to suggest that it has affected a particular group of the population. Or that it is more serious than the general picture seen for COVID-19 in Denmark.

This variant has nothing to do with the mink variants of COVID-19 that have been found in the past, or the British COVID-19 variant that is mentioned these days.

A new study shows that N439K, found in several countries in Europe, shows signs of decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) has taken a closer look at it in a new report: SARS-CoV-2, Spike protein variant N439K (https://www.ssi.dk/-/media/arkiv/subsites/covid19/sars-cov-2-spike-variant-n439k_21122020.pdf; in Danish).

"There is concern about how effective a vaccine will be against N439K. We do not know at this time. Therefore, it is relevant to keep an eye on how widespread the infection with this variant is in Denmark and whether it has spread to particularly vulnerable groups," says department head Tyra Grove Krause from SSI.

Found in 1624 samples
---------------------
The N439K mutation has so far been found in 1624 samples from [8 Aug to 6 Dec 2020]. The figures also show that the proportion of the N439K variant since week 46 has been stable at around 10% of all sequenced samples.

Observed throughout the country
-------------------------------
Looking at the geographical distribution, the N439K variant has been observed throughout the country, but it has primarily been found in and around Copenhagen and in South Jutland.

"In terms of gender and age, the N439K variant is distributed in the same way as SARS-CoV-2 as a whole does in Denmark. The hospitalization rate is lower than for SARS-CoV-2 overall," says Tyra Grove Krause.

No deaths
---------
Finally, SSI's report shows that no deaths have been registered in Denmark among people with SARS-CoV-2 with the N439K variant in the Spike protein.

"There is therefore nothing in the prevalence of this variant in Denmark that indicates that it has affected a certain group of the population. Nor does it indicate that the N439K variant gives a more serious disease course than the general picture we see for COVID-19 in Denmark. But we will also keep an eye on the N439K variant in the future," says Tyra Grove Krause.

Facts about the N439K variant
-----------------------------
- The N439K variant has the mutation N439K in the Spike protein.
- It was 1st seen in Romania in May 2020.
- There is increased focus on the N439K variant because a new study suggests that it may be less sensitive to neutralizing antibodies.
- N439K is found in large parts of Europe.
- However, it is most prevalent in Ireland, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and England.
- In addition, cases of N439k have been found in Australia and New Zealand.

Reassuringly, we haven't seen evidence that any of the SARS-CoV-2 variants to date are able to evade the current vaccine, although the UK and South African variants -- along with N439K and some others -- are still being investigated.

While I remain cautiously optimistic that the current vaccine will -- at least for the time being -- remain effective against COVID-19, the only defense a virus has against rising community immunity and its own inevitable demise is its ability to reinvent itself. Which means we should be prepared to see more variants emerge in the months ahead, and be ready to adjust our response accordingly.

[2] Immunocompromised patients
Date: Thu 23 Dec 2020 2:30 PM

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/uk-variant-puts-spotlight-immunocompromised-patients-role-covid-19-pandemic


In June [2020], Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge, heard about a cancer patient who had come into a local hospital the month before [May 2020] with COVID-19 and was still shedding virus. The patient was being treated for a lymphoma that had relapsed and had been given rituximab, a drug that depletes antibody-producing B cells. That made it hard for him to shake the infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Gupta, who studies how resistance to HIV drugs arises, became interested in the case and helped treat the patient, who died in August [2020], 101 days after his COVID-19 diagnosis, despite being given the antiviral drug remdesivir and 2 rounds of plasma from recovered patients, which contained antibodies against the virus. When Gupta studied genome sequences from the coronavirus that infected the patient, he discovered that SARS-CoV-2 had acquired several mutations that might have allowed it to elude the antibodies.

Now, his analysis, reported in a preprint on medRxiv earlier this month [December 2020; (1)], has become a crucial puzzle piece for researchers trying to understand the importance of B.1.1.7, the new SARS-CoV-2 variant first found in the United Kingdom. That strain, which appears to spread faster than others, contains one of the mutations that Gupta found, and researchers believe B.1.1.7, too, may have originated in an immunocompromised patient who had a long-running infection. "It's a perfectly logical and rational hypothesis," says infectious disease scientist Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust.

Scientists are still trying to figure out the effects of the mutations in B.1.1.7, whose emergence led the UK government to tighten coronavirus control measures and other countries in Europe to impose UK travel bans. But the new variant, along with research by Gupta and others, has also drawn attention to the potential role in COVID-19 of people with weakened immune systems. If they provide the virus with an opportunity to evolve lineages that spread faster, are more pathogenic, or elude vaccines, these chronic infections are not just dangerous for the patients, but might have the potential to alter the course of the pandemic.

It's still very unclear whether that is the case, but Farrar believes it's important to ensure doctors take extra precautions when caring for such people: "Until we know for sure, I think, treating those patients under pretty controlled conditions, as we would somebody who has drug-resistant tuberculosis, actually makes sense."

Researchers' concern mostly focuses on cancer patients being treated for chemotherapy and similar situations. "We don't yet know about people who are immunocompromised because of HIV, for instance," Farrar says.

Foreshadowing the future
------------------------
B.1.1.7 attracted scientists' attention because it was linked to an outbreak in England's Kent county that was growing faster than usual. Sequences showed that virus had accumulated a slew of mutations that together caused 17 amino acid changes in the virus' proteins, 8 of them in the crucial spike protein. Among them are at least 3 particularly concerning ones.

One is 69-70del, a deletion that Gupta also found in his Cambridge, UK, patient whose virus seemed to evade the immune system. It leads to the loss of 2 amino acids in the spike protein. In lab experiments, Gupta found that lentivirus engineered to carry the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with this deletion was twice as infectious.

The 2nd is N501Y, a mutation that evolutionary biologist Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has shown to increase how tightly the protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, its entry point into human cells. The mutation is also present in 501Y.V2, a variant discovered by researchers in South Africa who investigated rapidly growing outbreaks in 3 coastal provinces. "We found that this lineage seems to be spreading much faster," says Tulio de Oliveira, a virologist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal whose work first alerted UK scientists to the importance of N501Y. "Anytime you see the same mutation being independently selected multiple times, it increases the weight of evidence that that mutation is probably beneficial in some way for the virus," Bloom says.

The 3rd worrisome change is P681H, which alters the site where the spike protein has to be cleaved to enter human cells. It is one of the sites on spike where SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, and the change there may allow it to spread more easily. "This one is probably as important as N501Y," says Christian Drosten, a virologist at Charite University Hospital in Berlin.

So far, SARS-CoV-2 typically acquires only one to 2 mutations per month. And B.1.1.7 is back to this pace now, suggesting it doesn't mutate faster normally than other lineages. That's why scientists believe it may have gone through a lengthy bout of evolution in a chronically infected patient who then transmitted the virus late in their infection. "We know this is rare, but it can happen," says World Health Organization epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove. Stephen Goldstein, a virologist at the University of Utah, agrees. "It's simply too many mutations to have accumulated under normal evolutionary circumstances. It suggests an extended period of within-host evolution," he says.

People with a weakened immune system may give the virus this opportunity, as Gupta's data show. More evidence comes from a paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine on [3 Dec 2020; (2)] that described an immunocompromised patient in Boston infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 154 days before he died. Again, the researchers found several mutations, including N501Y. "It suggests that you can get relatively large numbers of mutations happening over a relatively short period of time within an individual patient," says William Hanage of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, one of the authors. (In patients who are infected for a few days and then clear the virus, there simply is not enough time for this, he says.) When such patients are given antibody treatments for COVID-19 late in their disease course, there may already be so many variants present that one of them is resistant, Goldstein says.

The question is whether the mutations arising in such patients could also help the virus spread more rapidly. In research published a few years ago, Bloom showed some of the mutations that arose in influenza viruses in immunocompromised patients later spread globally. "It's totally possible that what's happening in immunocompromised patients could foreshadow what happens in the future" with the pandemic, Bloom says. But adaptations that help a virus outperform other viruses in a patient can also be very different from what a virus needs to better transmit from patient to patient, he says.

UK scientists and others were initially cautious about concluding that B.1.1.7's mutations made the virus better at spreading from person to person. But the new variant is rapidly replacing others, says Muge Cevik, an infectious disease specialist at the University of St Andrews. "We can't really rule out the possibility that seasonality and human behavior explain some of the increase," she says. "But it certainly seems like there is something to do with this variant." Drosten says he was initially skeptical, but has become more convinced as well.

But exactly what impact each mutation has is much more difficult to assess than spotting them or showing they're on the rise, says Seema Lakdawala, a biologist at the University of Pittsburgh. Animal experiments can help show an effect, but they have limitations. Hamsters already transmit SARS-CoV-2 virus rapidly, for instance, which could obscure any effect of the new variant. Ferrets transmit it less efficiently, so a difference may be more easily detectable, Lakdawala says. "But does that really translate to humans? I doubt it." A definitive answer may be months off, she predicts.

One hypothesis that scientists are discussing is that the virus has increased how strongly it binds to the ACE2 receptor on human cells, and that this allows it to better infect children than before, expanding its playing field. But the evidence for that is very thin so far, Cevik says. Even if children turn out to make up a higher proportion of people infected with the new variant, that could be because the variant spread at a time when there was a lockdown but schools were open. Another hypothesis is that P681H helps the virus better infect cells higher up in the respiratory tract, from where it can spread more easily than from deep in the lungs, Drosten says.

One important question is whether the South African or UK lineage might lead to more severe disease or even evade vaccine-induced immunity. So far there is little reason to think so. Although some mutations have been shown to let the virus evade monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and natural infections both appear to lead to a broad immune response that targets many parts of the virus, says Shane Crotty of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. "It would be a real challenge for a virus to escape from that." The measles and polio viruses have never learned to escape the vaccines targeting them, he notes: "Those are historical examples suggesting not to freak out."

At a press conference yesterday [22 Dec 2020], BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin pointed out that the UK variant differed in only 9 out of more than 1270 amino acids of the spike protein encoded by the messenger RNA in the very effective COVID-19 vaccine his company developed together with Pfizer. "Scientifically, it is highly likely that the immune response by this vaccine also can deal with the new virus," he said. Experiments are underway that should confirm that in the 1st week of 2021, Sahin added.

Sebastien Calvignac-Spencer, an evolutionary virologist at the Robert Koch Institute, says this marks the 1st time countries have taken such drastic actions as the UK lockdown and the travel bans based on genomic surveillance in combination with epidemiological data. "It's pretty unprecedented at this scale," he says. But the question of how to react to disconcerting mutations in pathogens will crop up more often as genomic surveillance expands, he predicts. People are happy they prepared for a category 4 hurricane even if predictions turn out to be wrong and the storm is less severe, Calvignac-Spencer says. "This is a bit the same, except that we have much less experience with genomic surveillance than we have with the weather forecast."

Although the rise of B.1.1.7 in the United Kingdom is troubling, Farrar says he is equally concerned about the other variant spreading quickly in South Africa and that has now been detected in 2 travelers in the United Kingdom as well. It includes 2 further mutations in the part of the spike protein that binds to its receptor on human cells, K417N and E484K. These could impact the binding of the virus to human cells and also its recognition by the immune system, Farrar says. "These South African mutations I think are more worrying than the constellation of the British variant." South African hospitals are already struggling, he adds. "We've always asked, 'Why has sub-Saharan Africa escaped the pandemic to date?'" Answers have focused on the relative youth of the population and the climate. "Maybe if you just increase transmission a bit, that is enough to get over these factors," Farrar says.

To Van Kerkhove, the arrival of B.1.1.7 shows how important it is to follow viral evolution closely. The United Kingdom has one of the most elaborate monitoring systems in the world, she says. "My worry is: How much of this is happening globally, where we don't have sequencing capacity?" Other countries should beef up their efforts, she says. And all countries should do what they can to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the months ahead, Van Kerkhove says. "The more of this virus circulates, the more opportunity it will have to change," she says. "We're playing a very dangerous game here."

The report above is an excellent analysis of the current concerns regarding the 'sudden' appearance of SARS-CoV2 evolved strains with multiple mutations. It is indeed sudden if we consider that these multiple mutations have appeared in a relatively short amount of time; considering the evolutionary clock of the virus since its 1st emergence in 2019, we already have a very diverse phylogeny of the virus with numerous geographically widespread clades [S, L, V, G, GR, GH, GV, and others; https://gisaid.org/hcov-19-analysis-update]. The last report by GISAID notes "the currently most common receptor binding mutations S477N (part of large Melbourne outbreak from clade GR and some Central European clade GH clusters), N439K (long lasting UK outbreak with clade G and European spill over), N501Y (part of new UK variant VUI-202012/01 in clade GR as well as a recent clade GH outbreak in South Africa), and Y453F (mink adaptation and part of limited outbreaks), as well as combinations of these mutations with deletions altering the spike protein surface.

"As has become evident, these few S gene mutations and some deletions are found in multiple genomic contexts (different clades in different countries) that may be an early indication for some potential advantage for these viruses but needs to be verified and does not necessarily mean change in clinical severity or transmission efficiency." - Mod.UBA]

[A] Iran: 6208 new cases, 187 deaths, detection of new variant COVID-19 strain
