Since 17 Mar 2010 indigenous cases of chikungunya have been identified
on Reunion Island. The epidemiological surveillance has been
reinforced on several zones of the island according to the
geographical location of the confirmed cases.

Since 9 Jun [2010], the date of the last epidemiological bulletin, 6
new cases have been confirmed and 3 new probable cases have been
identified. The new confirmed cases are from the communes of Saint
Denis (1 case), Saint Andre (2), and Saint Paul (3; 1 case at
l'Ermitage and 2 cases at St-Gilles-les-Bains).

In total, between 17 Mar-23 Jun 2010, at 12.00 hrs surveillance has
identified 122 locally acquired cases of chikungunya [virus infection]:
- 94 confirmed cases
- 28 probable cases (2 cases were excluded after complementary investigations)
Other cases are under investigation and [await] biological confirmation.

The austral [southern] winter is approaching and the temperatures will
be less favourable for the vectors. Nevertheless local transmission is
still ongoing, particularly on the west coast (Saint-Gilles-les-Bains,
L'Ermitage)

In the course of the week [of 21 Jun 2010], 2 confirmed cases resident
in the same part of Saint Andre, with a date of onset of symptoms
between 12-15 Jun [2010] have been identified and surveillance has
been reinforced in this community. (An alert has been sent to all
doctors to report all dengue-like cases).

The area of Plateau de Caillou has not shown any [disease] activity
since week 18 [week of 19 May] of 2010.
