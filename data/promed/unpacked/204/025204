Wyoming social media reports the death of a 55-year-old man who succumbed to botulism after being conscious but also completely paralyzed for several weeks in a Salt Lake City hospital. He was a popular outdoorsman and river guide in Jackson Hole, WY. His death is blamed on a solo camping trip to Idaho, where he consumed a can of soup that was not properly refrigerated. The doctors in Salt Lake City who fought to keep him alive came to believe that the single can of soup was the source of the botulism toxin he consumed.

Well known in Jackson Hole, he was a kayaker, paraglider, rock climber, fisherman, and guide for Mad River Boat Trips and a bus driver for Lewis and Clark Expeditions. He was an expert on the whitewater areas of Wyoming and Idaho who always put safety 1st.

The botulism-contaminated soup that led to the man's paralysis and death was said to have trapped him in his own body in that he could not move, a nightmare that began with a can of soup.

The outdoor enthusiast, river runner, and guide was diagnosed with botulism, a rare bacterial toxin disease that undermines the body's nerves, preventing breathing and causing paralysis of muscles. It left him unable to breathe, talk, or open his eyes.

[There is not much in the post describing whether the canning was done commercially or at home. If canned properly, canned goods do not require refrigeration until opened. While the incident was tied to a trip to Idaho, it is not clear whether symptoms began in Idaho, Wyoming, or Utah.

Most cases of foodborne botulism occur from home-prepared foods that are stored or canned improperly. No information is given whether anti-botulinum antitoxin was given during the hospitalization.

Foodborne botulism usually occurs when preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract, and when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT's (botulinum toxin's) high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II. - Mod.LL
