Looking for some confirmation of the number of cholera cases in Peru
reported in my previous post I found in the WHO bulletin (Feb. 27, 1998)
the report that in the first four weeks of 1998 2,863 cases with 16 deaths
had been reported compared with 174 cases and one death during the same
period of 1997. In that report the increase in cases was attributed to El
Nino.
