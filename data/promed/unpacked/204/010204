Bad news is arriving in the mail this week for nearly 5000 people treated in a Utah emergency room. The patients, most of who live in Utah but some out of state, could have been exposed to a rare strain of hepatitis C, genotype 2b.

Hepatitis C is a chronic condition and can lay dormant for up to 25 years and then may cause serious liver problems such as liver failure and eventually death. The possible window for exposure was from June 2013 to November 2014 at Ogden's McKay-Dee hospital.

Hepatitis C is a reportable disease, so when the Utah State Health Department received a hepatitis case report in 2014, they started researching its origins, The strain was a rare one that when tracked came up with a match. It led to a nurse who was fired from McKay-Dee hospital. The health department started looking at the Ogden hospital then after they'd ruled out every other possibility in a hepatitis C case they were tracking.

Doctor Angela Dunn with the health department notes that the most common way of getting hepatitis C in the US is "through IV drug use. And other less common ways are tattoos or piercings from unlicensed parlors or being born to a mother with hepatitis C." Anyone who received a blood transfusion prior to 1992 can also be at risk. None of these risk factors were present with the man who tested positive, and that's what led investigators to the ER at McKay-Dee hospital where the man had been admitted.

The time this patient was in the ER was the same time a nurse who has since been fired was working. The health department asked the hospital to test anyone they knew who had risk factors that could present with hepatitis C. The former nurse was tested and came back positive with hepatitis C- genotype 2b, the same as the initial reported case.

Dunn says they "don't know exactly how it happened in this case but that a concern is that needles could be reused and spread infectious diseases."

Hepatitis C is transferred in blood-to-blood contact. The former nurse was let go for "divergence," or using what are assumed to be hospital issued drugs or syringes without a prescription. It is possible that needles or syringes were used by the nurse and then re-used for patients, though it is tough to prove how the disease was spread.

The disease is serious and can spread to others even when symptoms are not present, and that's why it is so important that anyone who was treated in the time frame with certain medications be tested.

According to Dunn, hepatitis C "does not have symptoms usually at the beginning, so it is very important if you were exposed to get tested."

Notifications, 4800 of them, were dropped in the mail on Fri 6 Nov 2015. Dunn said it is "out of an abundance of caution we cast a very broad net." She and hospital officials encourage "anyone who received a letter" to "definitely get tested." If a test comes back positive, treatments can be administered before a patient gets sick. Dunn says "there is really good treatment for hepatitis C" and calls it a "curable disease."

[That the alleged healthcare worker and a patient both have genotype 2b does not definitively link them without analyzing each virus's RNA genome.

Bloodborne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV can be transmitted by the contamination of multidose vials with a syringe containing blood harboring the virus. If the viruses are genetically identical, not just the same genotype, this suggests that the patient was injected by a syringe containing the medicine (likely a strong analgesic, such as an opiate, that had been previously contaminated by the healthcare worker's blood).

Regarding the significance of genotypes of HCV, the following is derived from a USA Veterans Administration publication http://www.hepatitis.va.gov/provider/reviews/genotypes.asp#S1X [the comments about response to therapy also relate to the newer anti-HCV modes of therapy]:

An important variable for all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the "genotype" of HCV with which they are infected. This is the strain of the virus to which they were exposed when they were infected, often many years prior to their evaluation, and it is determined by a simple blood test. Genotypes of HCV are genetically distinct groups of the virus that have arisen during its evolution (1). Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1 of the virus (subtypes 1a or 1b), and 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers of patients infected with genotypes 4, 5, or 6 (2). Most patients with HCV are found to have only one principal genotype, rather than multiple genotypes (3-5). Genotype 4 is much more common in Africa than in many other parts of the world, genotype 6 is common in Southeast Asia, and each area of the world has its own distribution of genotypes (6).

Genotype generally has not been found in epidemiological studies to play a large role in liver disease progression due to HCV. Rather, genotype is of clinical importance principally as a factor in response to HCV treatments. With all treatments tested to date, patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are more than twice as likely as patients with genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virological response to therapy (2-5, 7). In addition, when using combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, patients with genotypes 2 or 3 generally are treated for only 24 weeks, whereas it is recommended that patients infected with genotype 1 receive treatment for 48 weeks.
