The number of cases of the bacterial equine infection, strangles, has reached 40 to date in 2017, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, with 5 recent cases reported.

As reported by the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC), the latest cases were reported from Manatee, Volusia, and Indian River counties. Here are the details:

On 4 Dec 2017 the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services confirmed 3 premises in Manatee County, Florida, were placed under quarantine for clinical signs of strangles. All 4 horses began showing clinical signs after a trail ride event on 18 Nov 2017 in Citrus County. These are the 1st 3 cases of strangles in Manatee County and the 36-38th cases for the state of Florida.

On 5 Dec 2017 the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services confirmed one premise in Volusia County, Florida, was placed under quarantine for clinical signs and positive PCR confirmation of Strangles. The index case became clinical on 2 Dec 2017. All other horses on the premise are free of clinical signs at this time. This is the 1st case of reported strangles in Volusia County and the 39th for the state of Florida.

On 6 Dec 2017 the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services confirmed one premise in Indian River County, Florida, was placed under quarantine for clinical signs and positive PCR confirmation of strangles. The index case became clinical on 20 Nov 2017 after residing at a training facility in Lee County. All other horses at both locations are free of clinical signs. This is the 1st case of reported strangles in Indian River County and the 40th for the state of Florida.

The highly contagious upper respiratory disease of equids, known as Strangles, is caused by the Gram-positive Î²-hemolytic bacterium _Streptococcus equi_ ssp _equi_.

The organism, _S. equi_ ssp _equi_, can be transmitted via direct contact with nasal or ocular secretions or lymph node discharge from infected horses or via indirect exposure to contaminated trailers, stalls, riding equipment, buckets, halters, lead ropes, brushes, clothing, etc.

The incubation period typically ranges between 2 and 6 days but may last up to 14 days.

Classic signs may include fever (103 deg F [39.4 deg C] or higher), mucopurulent nasal discharge, lymphadenopathy (+/- abscessation), general malaise, pharyngitis, dysphagia, upper airway stridor, and respiratory distress.

Clinical signs are often age-related, with older horses exhibiting milder signs of shorter duration.

[There is a vaccine for strangles and none of these cases seem to have been vaccinated. Owners could save themselves some problems if they would just vaccinate their animals. - Mod.TG
