Differential Diagnosis Should Include Rift Valley Fever
-------------------------------------------------------
I would like to [suggest that] Rift Valley fever (RVF) [be] considered in
the differential diagnosis of this case. Some of the clinical symptoms and
observed laboratory findings tend to strongly indicate RVF. This has also
been suggested in the literature. Indeed, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) was one of the major diseases to be excluded in the differential
diagnosis by the CDC labs that confirmed the first outbreak of RVF in Saudi
Arabia (Shoemaker, T., et al., 2001). Access to detailed history of the
patient's environmental exposure to potential vectors while in South Africa
could prove useful in this regard. RVF is endemic in South Africa, though
the absence of unreported cases in the country should not exclude ongoing
subclinical disease and transmission in such an endemic population.

[Shamsudeen Fagbo's suggestion deserves serious consideration. Rift Valley
fever virus is zoonotic and causes human disease in association with
outbreaks of disease in domestic animals (sheep, cattle, and camels). The
human disease has a short incubation period of 2 to 6 days followed
by fever, headache, chills, myalgia, diarrhea, vomiting, and hemorrhages,
lasting 4 to 6 days with slow recovery. About 1 to 2 per cent of patients
develop severe disease with liver necrosis, hemorrhagic pneumonia, and
meningoencephalitis. In the case of patients with hemorrhagic disease, the
case-fatality rate may reach 10 percent.
According to information posted previously in ProMED-mail by Professor
Swanepoel (see: Rift Valley fever - South Africa 19990208.0177), human
infections in southern Africa result mainly from contact with infected
tissues of livestock, and rarely seem to be associated directly with
mosquito bite. Rift Valley fever occurs in South Africa at irregular
intervals of many years when particularly heavy rains favour the
occurrence of population explosions of the floodwater-breeding aedine
mosquito vectors of the virus. Past outbreaks in South Africa have tended
to start in February, after mosquito populations and virus circulation have
built up during the early part of the wet season, are at their peak in
March and April, and decline sharply after the first frosts in May suppress
mosquito activity.
All of these factors indicate that Rift Valley fever should be considered
in relation to the unfortunate death of the young person recently arrived
in Pakistan from South Africa. - Mod.CP]
