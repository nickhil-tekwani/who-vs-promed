Another 35 students at a Brisbane girls' school have fallen ill from a mystery
virus. St Margaret's school on the city's northside closed last week after 50
students became ill. St Margaret's reopened yesterday [Mon 13 Feb 2006] after
being closed on Thursday [9 Feb 2006] because of a virulent gastrointestinal
illness.
But yesterday 11 day students were sent home sick and 12 boarders were
quarantined in the school infirmary. In the afternoon, parents of another 12
students phoned the school saying their girls were not well. Today 14 students
reported in sick.
Principal Vicky Waters says the school is liaising with Queensland Health to
determine the cause of the illness. Normal classes are being held but the
school pool has been closed.

[Information on the final diagnosis of this outbreak of gastroenteritis would
be appreciated. In the Northern Hemisphere norovirus infection,
causing "winter vomiting disease," might be the expected verdict. - Mod.CP]
[The incubation period for norovirus infection is 10-50 hours, so the day
girls who fell ill on the school reopening day could not have become infected
at the school, and in fact several reported sick before leaving home. The
boarders apparently suffered a 2nd wave of illness the day the school
reopened. The epidemiology of this episode, in girls connected to an
institution, strongly suggests mass sociogenic illness -- see refs. below. -
