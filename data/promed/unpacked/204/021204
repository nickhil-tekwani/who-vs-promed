As winter tightens its grip, producers in the Monaro [a plateau region of New South Wales] are still reeling from the effects of a wet summer, which paved the way for a footrot outbreak.

16 holdings in the South East Local Land Services region are in quarantine for the bacterial disease, with a further 32 properties quarantined across the state -- including 7 in the Riverina [an agricultural region of New South Wales with an ample water supply].

This time in 2014 there were just 31 cases in the state.

In 1988 the NSW sheep industry implemented the NSW Footrot Strategic Plan with the aim of eradicating virulent footrot. At the time more than 6000 cases existed in NSW.

By August 2009 the entire state was declared a Protected Area, with less than 1 per cent of the state's flocks infected (just 18 cases).

Department of Primary Industries senior veterinary officer animal biosecurity Samantha Allen said even with 48 properties in quarantine this only accounted for 0.25 per cent of flocks in NSW.

"It is not unusual to see an increase in footrot cases in an area that has experienced very good seasonal conditions after prolonged dry conditions," Ms Allen said. "While it's disappointing, it's not unusual."

In NSW, sheep producers have a legal obligation to notify a Local Land Services (LLS) district veterinarian if they suspect footrot and then work towards eradication.

Control depends on each individual situation, but generally the sheep on each affected property are subject to inspection and cull.

Destocking infected mobs [herds or flocks] could also be used in smaller numbers or if infected mobs have been isolated from the rest of the flock.

Treatment with antibiotics will generally only mask clinical disease so it is not used once an eradication program is in place.

South East LLS vet Petrea Wait has been busy in recent months performing inspections of reported and confirmed flocks with footrot. She said while 16 properties are quarantined in the area, 98 per cent of properties are free of the disease.

Bombala producer Charlie Maslin, "Gunningrah", is in the minority. He first noticed footrot in his flock of Merinos in November. He decided to "take to it with a heavy hammer" by selling almost half of his flock early in January 2015 to reduce the number of sheep he had to treat later.

"We sold 6000 straight to abattoirs but of those very few really had symptoms of footrot at the time," Mr Maslin said.

"We had a fairly big mob of wethers [castrated male sheep] which we used as pressure relievers so they went straight away and we kept a fairly good core group of breeding ewes."

Mr Maslin invested in a herd of Angus cattle to bolster production.

"It has cost us AUD 20 [USD 15.39] per dry sheep equivalent, and when we factor in the swap over to cattle, it has cost us AUD 100 000 [USD 77 000] so far," he said. "When you add in the labour and the time we haven't spent doing other things you could add on another AUD 40 000 [USD 31 000]."

Fellow Bombala producer John Murdoch also turned to cattle to get out of trouble.

His Merino flock contracted footrot on 2 of 3 of his properties (that he runs in partnership with his parents Andy and Jane) last April.
Initially, he sold 1200 ewes in lamb but the disease returned during summer, forcing him to sell another 1400. "I estimate it has cost me AUD 250,000 [USD 192 000]," Mr Murdoch said.

"Because we were selling young genetic stock (2- and 3-year-old ewes in lamb) that was a big cost in terms of genetic progression and lambs on the ground."

Mr Murdoch said the situation had stretched the labour limits of the business. "Ideally we want to get back to running a full Merino ewe operation with a terminal sire to simplify the enterprise."

A wet summer has caused huge upheaval for Charlie and Anne Maslin, "Gunningrah", Bombala, who first noticed footrot in their Merino flock in November 2014.

Their property was quarantined and they made the decision in January 2015 to sell 6000 Merino wethers to the abattoirs to reduce the size of the flock that required treatment.

Between culling infected sheep, shifting their enterprise toward cattle and labour costs, it has cost them about AUD 40,000 [USD 108 000]
"Thankfully the fortunes of the cattle market are going in our favour," Mr Maslin said.

He said the Local Land Services (LLS) had been great help in the initial stages of managing the bacterial disease but he later sought an independent consultant for further advice.

"Our district vet has been run off her feet doing inspections and giving advice. She was helpful in getting an eradication program going for us but we felt we needed an expert to give us more direction as to what we should do." They banded with 2 other producers to help pay for the consultant's services. "We have used his advice to the letter to go on with it," said Mr Maslin.

The Maslins have further inspections of their flock planned this week and if found to be clear by the LLS they are expecting to be released from quarantine status within months.

[Foot rot is a contagious bacterial disease of sheep and goats, caused by the organism _Dichelobacter nodosus_ in association with a number of other bacteria.

There are many strains of _D. nodosus_ and they vary in the severity of the disease they cause. In an infected flock, several strains of _D. nodosus_ may be present. For regulatory purposes, foot rot infection is classified as either benign or virulent at the flock level.

With full expression, virulent foot rot is a severe, debilitating disease with significant economic loss from reduced wool growth and quality, poor ewe fertility, poor growth rates, losses from blowfly strike, and reduced value of sale sheep. In infected flocks, there are also significant costs associated with the control of the disease.

Because of these animal welfare and economic impacts, virulent foot rot is a notifiable disease in NSW with regulatory support for compulsory eradication programs in infected flocks.
Topics include:
- The NSW Foot rot Strategic Plan
- Foot rot - the disease
- Strain differentiation
- Distinguishing between the forms of foot rot
- Foot rot scoring guide
- Dealing with foot rot
- Phases of an eradication program
- Foot rot in goats
- Foot rot in cattle

Foot rot eradication strategies in southern NSW are based on a predictable spread period in spring, combined with hot dry summers that provide a reliable non-spread period suited to undertaking eradication inspections.
