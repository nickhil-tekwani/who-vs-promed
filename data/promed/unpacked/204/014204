Facilities for Comprehensive Diagnosis of Hemorrhagic Fevers Lacking in
Kenya
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapid diagnosis for Ebola, Marburg and Lassa hemorrhagic fevers cannot be
carried out adequately by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI).
KEMRI, however, does have facilities for the rapid diagnosis of yellow
fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever.
The current issue of the World Health Organisation(WHO) Collaborating Centre
for Arbovirus and Viral Hemorrhage Fever Reference and Research also reveals
that a person in Western Kenya died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever early
this year. This [endemic disease, which was diagnosed by KEMRI and the
results confirmed by the South African reference laboratory, is transmitted
by ticks [from domestic & wild anmals.

[The timing of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever death referred to in this
article suggests that it is unrelated to the more recent reports of
undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever in the Rift Valley and Central Provinces of
Kenya. It is clear from this article that comprehensive facilities for the
diagnosis of hemorrhagic fevers are not available in Kenya and that
diagnostic tests for Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fevers have to be undertaken
elsewhere. This is clearly an unsatisfactory situation in view of the
potential presence of these dangerous fevers in this region, which can only
be controlled by rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of affected
individuals. - Mod.CP
