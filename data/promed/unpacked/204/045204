From 27 Mar 2022 to 4 May 2022 (39 days), the Rethy health zone, located in Djugu territory, Ituri province, DR Congo, continued to report cases of plague. A total of 101 suspected cases of bubonic plague with 2 deaths (case fatality rate 1.9%) have now been reported.

To date, 2 health areas continue to report human cases of plague: Lokpa at 97 cases or 96% and 1 death; Rassia at 4 cases or 3.9% and 1 death. Of the 11 villages affected, Dzavikpa remains the most affected (47 cases or 46%), followed by Nioka forest (11 cases or 10.9%). The majority of people who contracted the plague were in the age group > 5 years (87 cases or 86%) compared to 13.9% (14 cases) in the < 5 years age group.

During the week of 18-24 Apr 2022, the Uketha Health Area reported 77 dead rats in 17 households. One household in Godu village, reportedly lost its entire guinea pig farm of 50 individuals. The investigation team was able to collect a sample from a black rat (_Rattus rattus_) that tested positive for plague using RDT (rapid diagnostic test). The response team immediately proceeded to disinsectize these households with deltamethrin.

A 35-year-old patient from Belenju village caught our attention this week. He was admitted to the health center on 14 Apr 2022 with fever and painful swelling in the left armpit. He was undergoing outpatient treatment with gentamicin 80 mg daily for 5 days and doxycycline 200 mg 3 times daily for 10 days. On 24 Apr 2022, he was declared cured at the health center based on the disappearance of clinical signs, but was found sicker on 2 May 2022 at home. He was brought back to the health center where a large bubo in the left armpit was found and the puncture tested positive for plague with RDT. This reiterates the need for strain genotyping and antimicrobial resistance testing.

Currently, no partner has yet come to the rescue of the Rethy health zone management team, which is suffering from a lack of medication and other consumables necessary to organize a good response. Although shaken by insecurity, the Rethy health zone needs urgent support from health partners for an adequate response to prevent further spread.

[It is not stated whether antimicrobial resistance had a role in relapse although the patient in the report above did respond to initial therapy.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. Bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. The pneumonic form of infection can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
