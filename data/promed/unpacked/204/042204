According to this story, the city of Chilliwack, B.C., won an award last
year for the cleanliness of its water. This week, 35,000 residents of the
Fraser Valley municipality were ordered to boil their tap water because of
ten cases cryptosporidiosis among residents of Chilliwack since Wednesday.
Health officials were cited as saying that the final number of confirmed
infections may be ten times higher.
George Rice, a senior health officer with the Fraser Valley Health Region,
was quoted as saying the infection caused by the tiny parasite "is usually
mild" and involves diarrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting over several days.
The story adds that public health warnings have prompted dozens of calls
from other residents reporting the same symptoms, but there have been no
reports of more serious illness or harm to people already suffering from
illnesses or weakened immune systems.
The town system is usually fed by deep underground wells with occasional
supplements from mountain streams. City engineer Andrew Henry was cited as
saying it is suspected that feces from an infected animal entered the city
system from a stream which was being used to supplement the city reservoirs
last week.
The suspect stream source has been shut off and the deep-well water is
being used to flush the entire city's piping system.

[While livestock faeces can contaminate local water supplies, the recent
history of this disease is that contamination is more likely from defects in
municipal water handling and chlorination procedures. Either way, diarrhea
follows. - Mod.MHJ]
