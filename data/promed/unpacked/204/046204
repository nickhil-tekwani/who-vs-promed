SASA confirmed an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Sifontes
----------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Katthywana Araque, Epidemiology Chief of SASA, the Autonomous
Service for Animal Sanitation (according to its Spanish initials:
Servicio Autonomo de Sanidad Animal), confirmed the occurrence of
[type] A virus, which, together with [type] O virus, accounts for
cases occasionally detected in Venezuela.

After the laboratory diagnosis, SASA received a confirmatory report
indicating that the problem observed in some cattle herds from 7 farms
in Tumeremo is foot and mouth disease (FMD). It was indicated that the
virus is controlled and a quarantine has been established, and also
sanitary surveillance activities in the affected area are being
carried out.

We contacted Dr. Katthywana Araque, Epidemiology Chief of SASA, by
phone, and she confirmed the occurrence of FMD caused by virus A. She
pointed out that this A virus, together with the O virus, correspond
to viruses occasionally detected in Venezuela. She said that "it is a
manageable virus, and we have been acting properly since the problem
was detected. Even though we suspected that this was not FMD, we did
not make any announcement until having the laboratory test results.
The affected area is under quarantine and every specifically
indicated sanitation measure has been implemented and applied. The
sanitation procedure executed form the very 1st moment when the virus
occurred, the fact that affected animals are recovering indicates
that the virus is under control."

When Dr. Araque was asked about the origin of the outbreak, she said
that the investigation is to be completed, but she indicated that
there may have been some kind of failure in vaccination.

Was there any failure in the vaccine or in its cold chain?
----------------------------------------------------------
"The vaccine used is safe, since it undergoes testing. The vaccine
used does not have any problem, and a proof of this is that the
outbreak occurred in a specific area, not in a widespread mode. The
most likely cause for this is some kind of failure in vaccination".

Dr. Araque requested people to keep [the vaccine] cool. She emphasized that
sanitary measures are being properly applied.

Inadequate manipulation of the vaccine
--------------------------------------
During the press conference, Colonel Jose Ramon Delfino, President of
Sifontes Farmers Association, was accompanied by Denis Regaldia and
Juan Ramon Matos, technicians from SASA. They pointed out that this
situation occurred because the vaccination plan was not properly
executed by farmers. They said that some farmers do not take enough
care of their animals. For example, they said, that knowing there is
an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, free roaming animals are found
on public roads. They requested their fellow farmers to comply with
the vaccination plan as it had been originally planned, complying with
the cold chain; in other words, vaccine transport must take place
keeping a tight control of a cold environment.

Colonel Delfino, Mr. Matos and Mr. Regaldia publicly acknowledged
support from deputy colonel Quijada Caraballo, chief of Fort Tarabay,
who dispatched soldiers in order to maintain sanitary controls in la
Bomba, which is a place with access to affected farms.

Farmers' responsibility
-----------------------
Coronel Jose Ramon Delfino, President of Sifontes Farmers Association,
made some clarifications on his own, and he said that it is a mistake
to blame the Farmers' Association or SASA.

"If we farmers earn a living thanks to our cattle, we are the 1st
ones interested in protecting our animals, and we will not wait for
someone to take care of our cattle. SASA designs sanitary programs,
particularly vaccination plans, but every farmer is responsible to
immunize and monitor his animals. The very 1st problem arising now
with this outbreak is lack of timely vaccination. Farmers from the
area where the outbreak occurred did not pay attention to requests
for vaccination. Of the 7 affected farms, only 2 had vaccination and
during the past vaccination campaign, only 3 of the farms responded.
We must also take into account that within this area there are more
than 1000 farms, but only 110 are registered in our Association".
