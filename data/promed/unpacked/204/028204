A rise in the number of cases of a flesh eating virus in dogs has prompted a warning to owners.

The potentially fatal flesh disease known as Alabama rot can cause skin lesions on the paws or legs and owners are advised to wash their pets thoroughly -- especially after muddy walks.

A new case has now been confirmed in the UK as fears grow about its spread.

In serious cases it can lead to kidney failure and is known medically as idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy [CRGV].

The disease was first documented in America in the late 1980s, affecting greyhounds, and it then spread to other parts of the world.

Now worrying new cases have been found in Devon and Cumbria, with both areas never having reported problems with the killer disease before.

It has now been found in 27 counties across the UK since 2012.

David Walker, from Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists, said: "The cause of Alabama rot is still unknown and sadly there is no known way to prevent a dog from contracting the disease.

"It's important that vets inform us of any suspected cases of Alabama rot in the UK, so we can continue to learn more about this dreadful disease."

A total of 81 cases have been confirmed in the UK, including new cases from Carlisle [Cumbria], Caldicot in Monmouthshire [Wales], and Raymond's Hill in Devon.

David added: "There have been a number of cases confirmed by vets, but unless we carry out analysis of the tissues, we will never be able to 100 per cent confirm the disease.

"Only tests on a kidney from a dog suspected to be suffering from the disease will give confirmation."

Dr Huw Stacey, director of clinical services at Vets4Pets, outlined symptoms dog owners should look out for. He said: "The 1st sign is normally seen is a skin sore that isn't caused by a known injury.

"Most commonly these sores are found below the elbow or knee and appear as a distinct swelling, a patch of red skin or are open or ulcer-like".

[It remains to be assessed if the cases above of CRGV in dogs in Devon and Cumbria (in England) and Monmouthshire (in Wales) represent a spread of the fatal condition to hitherto unaffected regions or rather a reflection of intensified awareness of the owners and of practitioners
