Thousands of domestic poultry have been destroyed in and around the southern
Sudanese capital of Juba in an attempt to contain an avian flu threat
reported in the region several months ago, officials have said. Samson
Kwaje, the southern Sudan information minister, said a team had been
visiting homes to check poultry and destroy suspected cases. The team would
also determine how the affected farmers should be compensated. "A
surveillance team has been visiting homes where there are reports of strange
poultry deaths," Kwaje said on Fri 19 Nov 2006. "When they go there they
destroy the birds, then government compensates the affected farmers."
However, he added, southern Sudan did not have big poultry farms. The team,
including health officials, was concentrating on small subsistence farmers
who own a few dozens of birds. "This might have been a blessing in disguise,
because the loss has not been that great. We have been assessing the
situation of individual farmers and destroying the birds there if the
situation is suspicious, so the impact economically has not been that
pronounced," Kwaje added.
Authorities in southern Sudan announced in September that they had found the
H5N1 strain in chicken and in the owner of an affected farm. The farmer was
hospitalised with avian flu symptoms and later tested positive, prompting
the World Health Organization to send a team into the impoverished country.
Neighbouring Uganda responded by restricting movements of bird and poultry
products along the border with Sudan. It also asked its district officials
to be on alert for suspected cases of the disease.
Health ministry spokesman Paul Kaggwa said a national task force was
maintaining a high state of vigilance. At the same time, he added, Uganda
had embarked on a community education programme, encouraging the general
population to be vigilant as well. "The task force on avian flu meets
frequently to assess the situation. We have embarked on a programme to reach
out to the communities disseminating information about the disease and how
we can control its spread if it were to strike," Kaggwa said, adding that
the health ministry was using a film van to reach out to the community. The
ministry, he added, had also trained medical personnel to handle the
situation if the disease was detected in the east African country. The
Uganda Wildlife Authority was also observing the movement of birds from the
north and taking samples.
Uganda and southern Sudan are situated on a major migratory route of birds
moving to southern Africa from Europe and West Africa. There was also cause
for concern as traffic between Uganda and southern Sudan has increased in
the recent past as many businessmen travel on the route.

[IRIN is a UN humanitarian news and information service, but may not
necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations or its agencies. The
single suspected human cases of H5N1 influenza virus infection in the Juba
area of southern Sudan tested positive in September 2006, but there has been
no verification by the WHO team dispatched to the region. Nor has there been
any independent confirmation of this report. Therefore for the present it
must be treated with extreme caution.
