A number of cases of _E. coli_ O157 in travelers returning from
Benidorm [province of Alicante, community of Valencia] in Spain are
being investigated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). The HPA is
aware of 14 confirmed cases of the gastrointestinal infection. All the
confirmed cases are adults and 4 people are known to have been
admitted to hospital after returning to the U;2 have been discharged.

The agency is working with the Spanish health authorities to
investigate the cases of the illness. The HPA will conduct interviews
with those people affected in the UK to help identify a possible source.

After being infected by the _E. coli_ bacterium, it usually takes 3 to
4 days before symptoms develop, but it can be between 1 and 14 days.

The HPA is advising any travelers who have recently returned from
Benidorm and who suspect that they may have the _E. coli_ O157
infection to contact their doctor as soon as possible. The agency also
said in a statement that as the source of infection has not yet been
identified, it is possible that future cases of _E. coli_ O157 linked
to the Spanish resort may be identified in the coming weeks.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the extent of the
outbreak as well as the vehicle of transmission. Although cases are
only reported from the UK, it is indeed likely that the infection
related to the resort will be found in other countries in the EU or
elsewhere.

Benidorm (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benidorm>) is a Valencian
coastal town and municipality located in the province of Alicante,
Spain, by the western Mediterranean Sea. It can be seen on the
