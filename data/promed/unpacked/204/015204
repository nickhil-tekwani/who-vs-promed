Abstract
--------
The range of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ continues to expand, putting more than 2 billion people at risk of arboviral infection. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has been used to successfully combat agricultural pests at large scale, but not mosquitoes, mainly because of challenges with consistent production and distribution of high-quality male mosquitoes. We describe automated processes to rear and release millions of competitive, sterile male _Wolbachia_-infected mosquitoes, and use of these males in a large-scale suppression trial in Fresno County, California. In 2018, we released 14.4 million males across 3 replicate neighborhoods encompassing 293 hectares [724 acres]. At peak mosquito season, the number of female mosquitoes was 95.5% lower (95% CI, 93.6-96.9) in release areas compared to non-release areas, with the most geographically isolated neighborhood reaching a 99% reduction. This work demonstrates the high efficacy of mosquito SIT in an area 9-fold larger than in previous similar trials, supporting the potential of this approach in public health and nuisance-mosquito eradication programs.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been detected in an increasing number of California localities over the past 4 years. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. The sterile insect technique has been successful for some other insect pests but technical difficulties have made it a challenge as a control approach for _A. aegypti_.

The report above indicates that these challenges have been overcome. It will be interesting to see if the approach that they describe will be successfully applied in other localities in California where this mosquito is present and then, if successful, more widely in tropical areas where it transmits dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. - Mod.TY
