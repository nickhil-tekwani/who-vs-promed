A range of foods have been identified as potential causes of a painful epidemic of food poisoning that has hit the country.

Environmental and Scientific Research (ESR) have provided the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) with an update of its studies into the possible source of what is causing the stomach bug, _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_. ESR reports have identified a range of potential foods that could be linked to the bug.

There are 127 confirmed cases of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and 38 people have been hospitalized as a result of the infection. However, ESR are still not able to identify a specific food as the source, MPI said.

Earlier this week it was reported the infection was related to consumption of packaged carrots and lettuces, however this was yet to be confirmed.

Some foods have been consumed by a significant proportion of those who have become ill, however they are foods that are also regularly consumed by people who are not ill, MPI said. There is no single food that has been consumed by 100 per cent of those who have fallen ill with the bug, the ministry said.

[It remains uncertain if the bagged carrots and lettuce is the vehicle for transmission in this outbreak.

Most individuals affected with _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ are children or young adults. The most common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis, with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.

Although many associations had been previously made, one of the strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and food was published in 2004 from Finland (1). The editorial commentary (2) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of infections associated with fresh produce.

The diagnosis of infection with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric organisms, including some salmonellae.
