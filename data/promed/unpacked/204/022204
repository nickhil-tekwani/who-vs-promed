Chief Medical Officer Dr Rohit Doon yesterday [25 Feb 2008] said
there have been 108 confirmed dengue cases reported for the 1st 7
weeks of this year [2008]. He said the cases were "generalised"
throughout the country, with poor hygiene contributing to the
transmission of the fever [virus]. Speaking to reporters following a
media briefing for the Health Ministry's 100-day plan update at
Crowne Plaza, Port-of-Spain, Doon said most clusters of dengue cases
occurred in places "where the hygiene is bad."

He said community hygiene and reduction of breeding places were key
to preventing dengue. Referring to the cases which occurred recently
at Freeman Road, St Augustine, Doon said this was an "unplanned
community where people stored water in barrels, and again the risk of
breeding was found in these containers filled with water." Doon said
hygiene in unplanned communities tends to be bad.

He said 4 confirmed dengue cases have been detected in Freeman Road.
He said the atypical dry season was also contributing to the breeding
of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which loves clear standing water.
"The transmission opportunities are much greater than they would be
in a typical dry season, and that's a real event for us to learn how
to cope with the real risk of transmission in this atypical dry season."

Doon said spraying for the infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito was
taking place in Cunupia and other areas with reported cases of dengue
fever. He said the aim was to break the cycle of transmission and
knock down the adult mosquitoes.

In the metropolitan region of Belem in the state of Para in 2007, 15
387 cases of dengue were registered, of which 56 were dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and with 16 deaths. This year [2008], some
4838 cases of the disease have been reported, 16 of them DHF. In
2008, 6 deaths by this disease now have been confirmed.

According to the coordinator of the State Program of Dengue, Isa
Cruz, the result has been positive. "The number of notifications
increased due to awareness of medical and health professionals. This
indicates not that there are more cases of dengue this year [2008],
but comparing 2007 with 2008, 2008 had a greater monitoring by
professionals," she explained. [A sad situation, not looking ahead to
hide the obvious; it may be worse than it may appear. - Mod.LJS]

According to notes released by the Secretariat of Public Health of
Para [state], the Metropolitan region of Belem has 32 percent of the
resident population of Para. In the past 3 years, the city recorded
40 percent of cases of the disease and 50 percent of the DHF deaths.

Currently, there are 13 municipalities with outbreaks of the disease
in the state. Cases in the capital are under-reported, says the
Secretariat of Health of the State.

While in Brazil the number of dengue cases dropped 39.7 percent in
the 1st 2 months of this year [2008] in relation to the same period
of 2007, according to data from the Ministry of Health, Bahia
recorded an increase of nearly 110 percent in [numbers of] notified
[dengue cases].

According to the State Secretariat of Health (SESAB), from 1 Jan - 25
Feb 2008, there were 3263 [dengue case] notifications. In the same
period last year [2007], the number was 1563. In Salvador, the survey
done by the Municipal Health Secretariat (SMS) did not correspond to
the projection by the state and portrays a decline of nearly 60
percent. The data, however, are disputed by SESAB.

According to the SMS, in January this year [2008], there were only 70
[dengue case] notifications against 170 in the same period of 2007.
Up to 10 Feb 2008, there were recorded only 113 [dengue case] notifications.

However, the SESAB coordinator of vector transmissible diseases,
Jesuina Castro, has stated that there has been under-reporting in the
state Capital on account of constant strikes by community health
officials who are responsible for control of the disease. "These
numbers do not correspond to reality. We believe that these 70 cases
should be multiplied by 10," she asserted. She also mentioned that
the municipal health posts are not forwarding their data frequently.

According to SESAB, the situation in Bahia is worrying. Currently,
there are 13 municipalities with outbreaks of the disease.

Throughout state, there have been 12 suspected serious dengue cases,
with 5 confirmations. Of the others, 4 were discarded, and 3 are
under investigation by the Central Laboratory of the state. Two
suspected dengue deaths also are being investigated.

In 2008, there is considerable chance of a DHF epidemic to occur.
"There is a great chance of that happening," says the coordinator of
Health Promotion and Protection of the state government Secretariat
of Health (SESA), Manoel Fonseca. The increasing proportion between
the 2 manifestations [classical dengue and DHF] is frightening. In
1999, for every case of DHF, there were 3252 cases of classical
dengue. In 2007, the relationship was one to 83. "With more people
sensitized now from having contracted the disease before, [we] could
more easily see serious forms of dengue," says medical expert Ivo
Castelo Branco. Over the past 7 years, the numbers of DHF cases
increased 7350 percent in the State.

"We have to learn to live with DHF. What we do not want is the number
of deaths increase," says Fonseca. Last year [2007], there were 126
more cases than in 2006, a total of 298 cases and 10 deaths. The case
fatality rate was 3.3 percent and was an improvement over 2006, when
8.7 percent of patients (15 individuals) with DHF died. But the
fatality rate may reach less than one percent with early diagnosis
and proper treatment.

A team of health officials have a list of 3000 buildings considered
strategic points in the control of _Aedes aegypti_ in Fortaleza.
Among them are vehicle tire places, deposits of construction
materials and scrap, to be visited 5 times a year.

In the Capital, 75 000 private homes are closed, which hinders the
access of the officials.

In Ceara, 72 percent of the municipalities have high risk of dengue;
21 percent are of medium risk; 6 percent are considered at low risk,
and 1.4 percent not at risk.

Usually, an epidemic occurs after the entry of a new dengue virus
serotype, as in 2003. The following year, the natural trend is that
the number of cases decreases as the population becomes immune. Many
people had the disease caused by [dengue] virus 2, for example. The
problem is that of the 4 types of dengue viruses, 3 are currently
circulating in Ceara. For 3 years, the state has had a high number of
cases, more than 20 000.

_Aedes aegypti_ is becoming resistant to insecticides; only 30
percent of the mosquitoes die [presumably after insecticide treatment
- Mod.TY].

The fatality rate from DHF in Brazil is the highest in Latin America,
at 10 percent. Worldwide, the fatality rate is 5 percent. Ceara
recorded a case fatality rate of 3.3 percent in 2007.

Some features of Ceara that hinder the fight against dengue include
the need to store water, including in the capital, and the use of
water coolers in many homes.

The state of Rio de Janeiro has already registered 14 deaths from
dengue this year [2008]. Of these, 12 were reported in the capital;
one in Duque de Caxias, in the Baixada Fluminense; and the other in
Campos in the northern part of the state.

According to the Secretariat of Health, most deaths are children.
Just in the city of Rio de Janeiro, of 12 deaths, 9 were children.
According to the latest survey by the Secretariat of Health, the
disease has affected 8485 people in the state just in January 2008.
Last year [2007] during the same period, 3229 cases were recorded. In
the city in 2008, there have been 7202 confirmed dengue cases versus
2926 for the same period of 2007.

Those who have had dengue virus type 3, which has been the most
common virus since 2002, who then contract dengue virus 2 have a
greater chance of developing a severe form of the disease. Among
children who died of DHF this year [2008], 4 lived in neighborhoods
that have had an outbreak of disease, with an incidence of over 300
cases for every 100 000 inhabitants.

Mar 2008 issue of Terra
<http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/ultimas/0,,OI2642249-EI715,00>
that indicated that another child died from dengue, reinforcing the
fact that 30 percent of dengue cases are in children, according to
the Secretariat of Health of Rio. Of 6027 registered dengue cases,
1800 were in children under 15 years of age. Most victims are between
5 and 9 years. Of the total of 14 deaths in the municipality, 12 are
of children in this age range. - Mod.TY]

[ProMED-PORT Mod.LJS commented: "It is now known that dengue causes
more and more serious cases with each year that passes and becomes a
childhood disease. That is what has happened in Southeast Asia and is
easily explained by what is known of dengue epidemiology and pathogenesis.

Perhaps the millions of reals (Brazilian currency) that are applied
without results trying to control _Aedes aegypti_ should be applied,
at least in part, in improving assistance to patients with dengue.
Currently, having dengue is a problem, and dying of it is a disgrace.]

[Unfortunately, in the absence of effective dengue virus vaccines,
the only preventive measure available currently is mosquito vector
control. Because _Aedes aegypti_ is so widely spread within
communities at risk of dengue outbreaks, public involvement is
essential in eliminating water catchments in which this mosquito
breeds in and around houses and other buildings. This is a gargantuan
task for public health officials to accomplish alone. - Mod.TY]

The numbers of deaths from severe dengue disease given by the
Ministry of Health comes to 225, but there were 101 more deaths than
those registered by the Ministry.

Dengue in Brazil has killed more than shown in reports released by
the Ministry of Health and state and local governments. The real
number of deaths by disease in 2006 and 2007, 326, is 45 percent
higher than the total of 225 deaths reported in the latest 2 years in
[Ministry] bulletins on the epidemiological situation for dengue, as
shown by newly reported data.

The Ministry as well as state and municipal governments in reports
disseminated to the public included only deaths from DHF. These
reports did not provide information on deaths by other forms of the
disease, which also can kill: classical dengue and dengue with
complications; classifications which are defined by the World Health
Organization (WHO).

According to the publication, WHO works only with DHF in order to
facilitate comparison between countries. The addition of data on
deaths from other forms of the disease (which increases the numbers
of dengue cases significantly) for last year [2007] indicates that
epidemics were recorded in 5 states, with more than 500 000 suspected
dengue cases, which increases the number of deaths from DHF. The
Ministry of Health said that in 2008, there has been a decrease in
the incidence of the disease by 40 percent.

The latest bulletin from the Secretariat of Health of Sao Paulo,
which compiled data through January this year [2008], reported that
last year [2007], the country registered 158 dengue deaths but did
not include deaths from other forms of the disease. However,
according to the information obtained from the internal report by the
state, there was a total of 210 dengue deaths, 33 percent more, 14 of
them from classical dengue and 82 from dengue with complications.

In epidemiological week 06 [week of 10 Feb 2008], there has been
notification of 1406 classical dengue cases, 59 percent from the
Loreto health district. To date, 16 health directorates have reported
locally acquired dengue cases.

The Lima health district has reported 23 [dengue] cases, of which 4
have been confirmed, but these have been imported from Loreto (3
cases) and Ucayali (one case), areas where there are outbreaks
currently. The remainder of these (Lima) cases are probable. Of
these, 12 are probable classical dengue cases, have not been outside
of Lima, and are currently under investigation.

An analysis of the dengue epidemiological situation countrywide
indicates that there are dengue epidemic alert situations in the
health directorates of Loreto, La Libertad and Ucayali. There also
has been a case of DHF in Loreto and in Ucayali. In the Loreto
district, there has been notification of 831 classical dengue cases
through epidemiological week 06.

Control of _Aedes aegypti_, the dengue virus vector, faces serious
limitations due to lack of area treatment [fumigation] equipment, and
there is a high transmission risk due to the vector being disbursed
in 30 zones into which the city of Iquitos is divided, with an
average _Aedes_ index of 10 percent [presumably a household
infestation rate - Mod.TY].

[8] New Caledonia

<http://www.mvariety.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=7723&format=html>


The dengue fever epidemic which was declared last month [February
2008] in New Caledonia has now affected some 104 persons since the
beginning of this year [2008], according to latest counts at the weekend.

Most of the known cases are concentrated in the capital Noumea and
its greater area, as well as other reported hotbeds in the
northeastern island of Lifou, part of the Loyalty group, and on the
Isle of Pines, south of the capital Noumea.

Health authorities in New Caledonia have last week stepped up the
status of what was formerly a "pre-epidemic" situation to a fully
fledged "epidemic" with regards to dengue mosquito-borne hemorrhagic fever.

Last week, as the number of known cases was only 72, New Caledonia
health director Dr. Jean-Paul Grangeon was already considering the
situation "worrying," mainly because of the apparently exponentially
increasing rate of the numbers of new cases.

The alarm comes as New Caledonia and its greater region are facing
severe weather conditions characterized by high humidity and heavy
rains, which are triggering factors for mosquito-borne diseases such
as dengue fever and malaria. The humid weather conditions entail the
persistence of still water spots.

The New Caledonia Health and Prevention department has for the past
few weeks stepped up its prevention and awareness campaign against
the potentially deadly virus, mainly because of the heavy rains and
the hot and humid conditions currently affecting New Caledonia.

As part of the prevention campaign, Noumea's health and hygiene
services have also deployed, since the beginning of this month [March
2008], a team of a dozen officers whose main task is to visit house
and property owners and convince them to clean any potential mosquito
breeding sites, such as still water contained in old tires and plant
pots or any bushy area on their compound that could also become a
nest for mosquito larvae.

An earlier dengue fever epidemic in 2003 killed as many as 20 persons
in New Caledonia.

In French Polynesia, health authorities are also closely monitoring
development of the dengue front.

Since the beginning of the year [2008], more than a dozen persons
were also reported infected.

Efforts are also underway in Wallis and Futuna, the 3rd French
Pacific territory, to closely monitor movements of persons to and
from neighboring New Caledonia, where over 20 000 residents of Wallis
and Futuna origin are permanently established.

Locally, information awareness campaigns have also been stepped up.

Despite the heightened campaign against dengue, the Department of
Health (DOH) in Negros Oriental recorded an increase of 70 percent in
cases this year [2008]. Records from DOH's epidemiology surveillance
unit showed there were 174 dengue cases reported from 1 Jan - 26 Feb
2008 compared to 101 cases for the same period last year [2007].

The reported cases were based on the number of dengue patients
confined at the 3 major hospitals in Dumaguete City. There were no
reports of deaths this year [2008] unlike last year's [2007] 2 cases,
according to Epidemiology chief Dr. Socrates Villamor.

History shows that Negros Oriental experienced the highest number of
dengue cases in 1998, 2001, and 2005.

In 1998, DOH declared an outbreak in Negros Oriental after recording
almost 2000 dengue cases and 28 deaths.

Nearly 4000 individuals were infected with dengue fever this year
[2008], representing a 10 percent increase compared to the same
period last year [2007], the Ministry of Health said.

The disease, caused by _Anopheles_ mosquitoes [incorrect, see below -
Mod.TY], recently rose to 450 cases a week in the country and is
spreading mostly in the central and southern provinces, of which Ho
Chi Minh City, Tien Giang and Ben Tre are hardest hit.

Half of the current victims are adults, an abnormal phenomenon for
the disease that in previous cases had mostly befallen children.

The agency also forecast that up to 100 000 individuals may be
afflicted with transmission in 2008.
