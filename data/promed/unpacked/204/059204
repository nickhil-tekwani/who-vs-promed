"Deaths of cattle in the Kostanai region have nothing to do with the death of saiga antelopes", journalists were told by the Deputy Akim [see comment] Bazylev Zhakupov.

Starting in mid-April 2015, 58 head of cattle, mostly young, died on 4 farms in the Zhangeldinskogo area, said the official. In 2 of the cases, rabies was found to be the cause of death. For the remaining cases the diagnoses are yet to be completed. The preliminary cause of mortality, according to the authorities, is thought to the harsh climatic conditions this winter and the lack of feed, reports Astana TV.

Citing Bazylev Zhakupov, the Deputy Akim of the Kostanai region, Astana TV reported: "Perhaps some owners ran out of feed for livestock. On top of that, the heavy rains were accompanied by high temperatures (35-38 centigrade). All this has affected the health of farm animals".

["Akim", in Kazakhstan, is the term for a provincial governor (appointed by the president). Kazakhstan is divided into 14 Provinces and 2 municipal districts (Almaty and Astana). For the location of the province Kostanai, centre-north, please refer to the map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Kazakhstan.

Results of the investigations into the above bovine mortality are anticipated.

The mentioned recent mass mortality of Saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan (more than 13 000!) has been attributed by the authorities, in an OIE notification, to Hemorrhagic septicemia (_Pastuerella multocida_). The exclusiveness of this bacterium as the sole causative agent of the unusual event has been debated (please see commentary in posting 20150607.3414297). - Mod.AS]
