Toxic algae blamed for mass flamingo deaths in Tanzania
---------------------------------------------------
A species of potentially toxic feeding algae has been blamed for poisoning
over 16 000 lesser flamingoes to death in Tanzania, local newspaper Daily
News reported on Tuesday.
The newspaper quoted a report from the University of Dar es Salaam as
saying that a heavy bloom of the potentially toxic blue-green algae, which
is the main food of flamingoes, may be the major cause of the mass deaths
of the tropical waterfowl in Lake Manyara and Lake Momella in northern
Tanzania between June and August 2004.
The report compiled by 3 scientists said that samples from Lake Manyara's
drying pools have higher salinity, which provides optimum conditions for
rapid growth of the algae known by its scientific name as _Arthrospira
fusiformis_. These algae can produce toxins when overgrown.
The 3 scientists, Charles Lugomela, Harish Pratap, and Yunus Mgaya, have
found high concentrations of blue-green algae in Lake Momella, and sediment
samples from the dried part of Lake Manyara showed the algae had indeed
existed when that part was submerged.
According to an earlier study, these toxins had been found in the birds'
livers 20 years ago when 400 000 flamingoes died in Kenya.
The report attributed the over-growing of blue-green algae partly to heavy
metal pollution in Lake Manyara that is close to a growing town and
Tanzanite gem mines.
The Tanzanian National Park Authority is set to establish a long-term
program based on this report for protecting Tanzanian flamingoes, even
though the investigation by a German institute is still yet to conclude.
The lesser flamingo, scientifically known as _Phoeniconias minor_, is a
pink waterfowl endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, though it is also seen in
tropical regions.
Lake Manyara has an estimated population of 3 million pink flamingoes, and
the spectacular scenes of red cloud-like flocks of flying flamingoes
attract thousands of tourists each year.

[Cyanobacterial toxins can be found in lake phytoplankton and in isolated
monocyanobacterial strains of _Arthrospira fusiformis_. This particular
blue-green algae can produce hepatotoxic agents and neurotoxic
agents. Since _A. fusiformis_ mass developments are characteristic of
alkaline-saline lakes, health risks to wildlife -- especially the
_Arthrospira_-consuming Lesser Flamingo -- may be expected.
The Lesser Flamingo is approximately 40 inches (101 cm) in height with deep
pink plumage. The deep-keeled bill is a dark carmine-red with a black tip,
and the bird has striking orange eyes.
They are most common on alkaline lakes in East and Central Africa,
sometimes present in vast numbers, generally in the millions. Seldom are
they found in the coastal regions.
These birds are herbivorous, feeding only on _Spirulina plantensis_, one of
the blue-green algae growing within a very limited range of pH: 10.4 -
10.5. They will feed on other algae as well, particularly _A.fusiformis_
Flamingoes are surface feeders, filtering the top 1 or 2 inches of water,
where the spirulina is to be found, with the deep-keeled bill that is
specialized for very fine food particles. They swim well and are able to
forage over the complete surface of a lake. Sometimes their technique of
feeding is referred to as the swim and skim technique.
