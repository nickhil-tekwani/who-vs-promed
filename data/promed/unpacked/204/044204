On 1 Sep 2017, the San Diego county public health officer declared a local public health emergency due to the ongoing hepatitis A outbreak in the county. The outbreak is being spread person-to-person and through contact with fecally contaminated environments. The majority of people who have contracted hepatitis A during this outbreak have been homeless and/or illicit drug users. Efforts of the county and its community partners to halt the hepatitis A outbreak focus on 3 key areas: vaccination, sanitation, and education

In the past week, 17 cases have been reported with 1 additional death. Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. The epicurve published last August 2017 (Hepatitis A - USA (20): (CA) fatal 20170817.5256184) showed that the outbreak had been continuing at a relatively stable rate of about 15-20 new onset cases/week. The San Diego county government after starting a vaccination program for the high risk cohort had started recommending hepatitis A vaccination for food handlers. The vaccine recommendation has also been expanded to those who work in health care in addition to prior recommendations for those who work in public safety, sanitation, homeless shelters, and behavioral and homeless service providers. The county has also set up handwashing stations in high risk areas. Given an incubation period of 15-45 days with a mean of 28 days, the immunizations, as well as increased environmental cleaning and hand washing stations, these methods may be taking effect. Only time will tell.

It appears that indeed a change in the paradigm of prevention of hepatitis A was necessary to attempt to curb this large outbreak. As the globe warms and the ecology of many food/water and arthropod spread infections changes with it, similar changes in the paradigm of prevention of other infectious diseases will be needed as well.

The latest countrywide HAV surveillance data published by CDC are shown below

Between the ongoing outbreaks of hepatitis A in southern California and eastern Michigan, a total of 904 HAV cases have been reported. Although the Michigan outbreak began in 2016, a majority of the cases have occurred in 2017.
