Opisthorchiasis has been found in the Obskoye Sea (Novosibirsk oblast,
Russia). It was long believed that fish from this Novosibirsk reservoir are
free from _Opisthorchis_ because of the reservoir's hydrologic regime.
However, an investigation by the Clinical and Experimental Veterinary
Institute, specialists in animal ecology, has found otherwise.
According to preliminary data presented by Konstantin Fedorov, doctor of
biological sciences, 13 per cent of the reservoir's bream are affected by
opisthorchiasis, along with 70 to 80 per cent of dace, 15 per cent of
roach, and 75 per cent of ide [dace, roach, and ide are types of European
freshwater cyprinid fish]. The main source of opisthorchiasis is the lower
stream of the Ob river, in the Hanti-Mantiyskiy region. Novosibirsk itself
is now becoming a source of opisthorchiasis, however, because of its sewage
disposal system -- the cities of Kamenka, Elzovka, and Tula are all dumping
their contaminated sewage into the Ob river.
_Opisthorchis_ eggs in the sewage collect on the bottom of the great
Siberian river. _Opisthorchis_ larvae penetrate into the fish's body and
collect there for years. The Vengerskiy region has the highest human
opisthorchiasis rate -- 1030 people have been diagnosed with this parasite.
This is not a precise prevalence rate, however, because it was obtained
from among people in high-risk groups. Once they reach the human liver,
_Opisthorchis_ larvae can mature into the parasite and live for 25 years.
