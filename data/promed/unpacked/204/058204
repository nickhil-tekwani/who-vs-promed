The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed an additional case of virulent Newcastle disease in backyard exhibition chickens in San Bernardino county, California.

A complete list of confirmed cases is available on our website at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/vnd.

Virulent Newcastle disease has not been found in commercial poultry in the United States since 2003.

No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected. Symptoms are usually very mild and limited to conjunctivitis. Infection is easily prevented by using standard personal protective equipment.

Samples from the flock were tested at the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS). The APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirms all findings. APHIS is working closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture to respond to the finding and to conduct an epidemiological investigation. Federal and State partners are also conducting additional surveillance and testing in the area.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at Biosecurity for Birds.

[This would appear to be case number 14. So it clearly appears the adage of "seek and you shall find" is in full force here. So the question is: When will USDA declare an emergency? Or is the hope to control it prior to it reaching any commercial poultry? - Mod.TG
