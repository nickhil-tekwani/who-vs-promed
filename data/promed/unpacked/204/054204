A 75-year-old man died in a nursing home in the town of Cordova in Taninga and 8 other people had to be hospitalized by an intoxication that, according to preliminary reports from the Ministry of Health of Cordoba, was caused by the intake of food contaminated with insecticide. The incident occurred in the Posada del Cerro geriatric, in the village behind Taninga, from the Pocho department, which houses 28 elderly people. From the 1st clinical signs, the suspicion pointed to the intake of food contaminated with pesticides.

[This article does not give us any clue as to clinical signs. About the only thing this tells us is that it may have been at a nursing home, or assisted living or some type of housing for the elderly. Whether this was an accidental poisoning, such as mistaking nitrate for salt, or if this was some sort of spoiled food, or a contamination of food by a pesticide either accidentally or intentionally, we do not know.
