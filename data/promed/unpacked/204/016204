The number of persons suffering hepatitis A virus infection continues
to increase in Nizhniy Novgorod. According to all available
information, 356 persons have been hospitalized with hepatitis A in
several hospitals throughout the city, stated Eugeny Petrov, the
Chief Health Officer of the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast [region] on
Wednesday [14 Sep 2005]. The majority of the new cases live in the
Sormovskiy district [rayon] of the city; however, 18 persons are
residents of the Moscow district of the city.
According to health-care officials, a total of 196 cases of a
hepatitis A has been recorded in the Sormovskiy district of Nizhniy
Novgorod, including 31 children under 14 years old. Hepatitis A
patients have bee admitted to 3 infectious disease hospitals (No. 2,
No. 14 and No. 23) in the city, and a further 830 beds will be made
available for hepatitis A patients.
The 1st hepatitis A cases were diagnosed on 6 Sep 2005, and by
Tuesday [13 Sep 2005] the Chief Health Officer reported that 40-50
cases of hepatitis A were being registered weekly in Nizhniy
Novgorod. 60 percent of the hepatitis cases had been recorded during
the period from 10-12 Sep 2005. Eugeny Petrov also stated that staff
of the Russian health protection service had identified the source of
the infection. In order to contain the outbreak the health
protection service recommended city dwellers to observe strict rules
of personal hygiene and to boil water and disinfect produce.
The Chief Medical Officer intimated that several vaccination clinics
were about to be opened in the city to undertake preventative
hepatitis A vaccination. Staff of the Russian Health Protection
Service would be undertaking an epidemiological investigation of the
outbreak. In particular, studies of water quality and microbiology
were in progress, together with monitoring of food produce and
markets, local waterworks, sewage treatment plants, and the state of
facilities for provision of potable water.
According to the Russian health protection service, epidemiological
conditions favoring the spread of hepatitis A had developed in the
Nizhniy Novgorod region during 2005. During the first 8 months of
2005 the increase in hepatitis A morbidity in the region was 1.8
times greater than during the same period of 2004, and the morbidity
among children under 14 years was 2.5 times greater.

[Nizhniy Novgorod (in the Soviet period, known as Gorky) is the 3rd
largest city in Russia. For a map of its location see:
<http://www.russiatrek.com/r_nnovgorod.shtml>.
The increased incidence of hepatitis A in the city of Nizhniy
Novgorod during 2005 indicates that control of hepatitis A virus
infection has not made much progress. Although hepatitis A is endemic
throughout the world, in many places it is held at bay by judicial
use of vaccine and attention to social infrastructure, principally
provision of good-quality drinking water and adequate treatment and
disposal of waste water and sewage. In many parts of rural and urban
Russia these may be deficient, and hepatitis A vaccination is a
prudent precaution for travellers. ProMED-mail will not routinely
post information on outbreaks of hepatitis A in Russia, except when
there is an increased incidence, as in the present case. - Mod.CP]
