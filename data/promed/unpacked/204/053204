A comment on: Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Iran (02): (KV) abattoir workers
20090908.3166
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wish to make two comments regarding the report concerning Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus infection affecting Iranian abbatoir employees.

Firstly, as an official veterinarian I have had approximately 12 years
experience of dealing with CCHF virus infection. Accordingly I would like
to make the following comments. Although in the halal method of slaughter
more blood may be spilled in terms of risk analysis for infectious disease,
as for example bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the halal method of
slaughter has advantages over conventional Western procedure. For example,
the stunning process prior to slaughter is prone to produce contamination
of the carcass [see:
<http://www.oie.int/Eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.11.6.htm>], whereas in
the halal method meat and meat products are produced and handled in a
manner that ensures that such products are not contaminated . Consequently
in the more than 140 countries with undetermined BSE status a slaughter
method such as the Islamic halal method may be advantageous.

Bleeding is one of the most important steps of the Islamic halal slaughter
process and should be as complete as possible. The carcase may be perfectly
bled and bear blood splashes. Risk analysis can be applied to the Islamic
halal slaughter method, which forms part of the status quo of Iran. Iran
has more than 50 autonomous abattoirs comprising modern meat processing
facilities for halal slaughter, emergency slaughter, refrigeration,
condemned meat disposal, hide and skin storages, offal disposal, edible fat
collection, meat trimming rooms, changing rooms, and veterinary offices.

Secondly, in the final paragraph of the report, the correspondent expressed
a personal preference against consumption of anmal meat. I wish to point
out that the CCHF virus, and nairoviruses in general, are sensitive to pH
changes. Consequently when rigor mortis ensues (pH about 5.8) the carcases
of cattle in particular will be free of virus infectivity. Thus the lapse
of time between slaughter and consumption ensures that the meat will be
free of infectivity and an important factor in risk management.

Other important factors for control of CCHF infection are instruction of
the general population, training medical staff, rapid diagnosis and use of
ribavirin in treatment of patients, together with less dependence on the
use of acaricides.
