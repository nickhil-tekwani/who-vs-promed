Agriculture officials in North Carolina say a quarter horse in Pitt County has died after contracting eastern equine encephalitis [EEE].

A statement from the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services says the horse exhibited signs of weakness, stumbling, depression and inability to stand or eat. This is the 1st reported case of EEE in North Carolina this year [2016]; 2 cases have been confirmed in South Carolina.

EEE is a mosquito-borne disease that is preventable in equine by vaccination. Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3-10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

[Unfortunately, this is another case of a disease preventable by vaccination. The vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis. It is best for owners to vaccinate in the spring, just before the transmission season begins. Because immunity to EEE is short and wanes within about 3-4 months, owners are encouraged to vaccinate every 3 to 4 months.

The EEE case fatality rate in equine animals is quite high and those that survive may have neurological sequelae as severe as to require euthanasia.
