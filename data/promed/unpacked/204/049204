An additional student at Oregon State University [OSU] was recently diagnosed with meningococcal [serogroup] B disease, for a total of 5 cases associated with the current outbreak. I have forwarded an e-mail sent out to the student body regarding the infection for your records [appended below].

"Date: Sat, Nov 25, 2017 at 4:12 PM
"Subject: [OSU-students-Corvallis] Urgent vaccinations urged; 5th meningococcal B case reported.

"OSU Corvallis students,

"We are urgently writing to inform you that yet another undergraduate student attending Oregon State University in Corvallis is being treated for meningococcal disease. This is the 5th OSU student to be treated for meningococcal disease in the past year [since November 2016].

"It is important that you are aware of this latest case.

"If you have not done so, we urge you immediately to be vaccinated for meningococcal B disease, which requires at least 2 doses to be effective. If you have started a vaccine series it is important that you compete the series in the requisite timeframe.

"Please be aware that while meningococcal disease is uncommon, it is a serious disease. In 10 to 15 percent of all cases, death may result, as was the case with a University of Oregon student in February 2015. In 20 percent of cases, hearing loss, mental impairment, and limb loss can result. Those at highest risk include students aged 25 and younger who live in residence halls and in private cooperative group living units, or are members of -- or visit -- fraternal living groups associated with the university.

"While extremely serious, meningococcal disease is not highly contagious and is transmitted through direct contact with droplets from an ill person coughing or sneezing; other discharges from the nose or throat; or by sharing of eating and drinking utensils, smoking devices; or intimate contact.

"Health officials encourage everyone to monitor their own health and note the following symptoms specific to this disease: high fever, a rash, headache, stiff neck, exhaustion, nausea or vomiting. If these symptoms develop, seek prompt medical evaluation.

"The best way to prevent meningococcal disease is by vaccination.

"OSU Student Health Services (SHS) and the Student Health Pharmacy continue to provide students meningococcal B vaccines in Plageman Hall, 108 SW Memorial Place. Many other health care providers in the community have the meningococcal B vaccine available on request.

"Before seeking to be vaccinated, students (or their family members) are encouraged to contact their private insurance provider to verify insurance coverage for the vaccine. When speaking with an insurance representative, it is important to mention that OSU Corvallis campus has been designated an "outbreak" status by federal, state, and county public health officials.

"For those receiving vaccines, SHS will bill students' insurance plans, including the Oregon Health Plan. Vaccines for domestic and international students on OSU's 2 sponsored plans (Aetna Student Health or Pacific Source) will be fully covered.

"Many private insurance plans cover the cost of the meningococcal B vaccine, and SHS is working to ensure as many insurance plans as possible cover the vaccine when given at OSU. SHS will assist international students and others who have plans that do not cover the vaccine if provided at OSU to receive a vaccine at an alternate location. Students 18 or younger without insurance can receive the vaccination through benefits provided by the Oregon Health Plan.

"Regardless of your insurance status, it is essential that students immediately take the time to be vaccinated.

"Oregon State requires incoming students under the age of 22 to have the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (MCV4), which covers multiple strains of the disease but not the B strain. Starting this fall [2017], the university also began requiring incoming students aged 25 and under to receive the meningococcal B vaccine series due to 3 confirmed cases on campus during the last academic year.

"For questions about insurance coverage, please contact the SHS Billing Office at 541-737-8370. Please be sure to bring insurance information to SHS or the OSU pharmacy.

"More information on meningococcal disease is available by calling the OSU Student Health Services Nurse Advice line at 541-737-2724 or Benton County Health Department communicable disease nurses at 541-766-6835 or by visiting these websites:

Dan Larson. Interim Vice Provost, Student Affairs"

[ProMED-mail thanks Hannah Carey for submitting the information above regarding meningococcus group B disease on the Oregon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, Oregon.

In November 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report that 2 Oregon State University (OSU) students in Corvallis, Oregon were diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine 20161123.4649319) and in March 2017, meningococcal serogroup B meningitis was reported in a 3rd student on the Corvallis campus (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (OR) college, sg B, sg B vaccine, RFI 20170305.4881298).

In October 2017, we posted a report of a 4th OSU student on the Corvallis campus with IMD; although we were not told at that time what the serogroup of the pathogen was, it apparently was also serogroup B (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (OR) college 20171030.5412497). We are now told in the report above that a 5th OSU student has developed IMD due to serogroup B.

These cases occurred despite a campus-wide vaccination program with a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine started in November 2016 and the requirement that incoming students at OSU be vaccinated against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y. The news report above does not give the vaccination status of the latest OSU student with IMD.

OSU is a coeducational, public university; the main campus is located in the city of Corvallis in the Willamette Valley of the US state of Oregon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University#Main_campus_.28Corvallis.29). OSU has a total student enrollment of 30 354. - Mod.ML
