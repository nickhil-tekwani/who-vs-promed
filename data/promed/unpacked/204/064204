[1] Cholera - Iraq

UN agencies and the Iraqi government say the cholera outbreak is
under control, despite the fact that since August 2007 there have
been about 4200 laboratory-confirmed cases and 21 deaths from the disease.

"Iraqis have adhered to the rules to guarantee their safety against
cholera and numbers have dropped dramatically; in addition, more than
70 percent of reported cases are being treated with success," said
Taha Abdallah, a senior official at the Ministry of Health. "There
are some areas where sanitation is poor and there is a deficit of
potable water, leaving residents in a more dangerous situation, but
we are working hard to contain the problem. And with the end of the
summer season, the possible spread of the disease is lower," Abdallah
added. "An intense campaign was developed among displaced families to
prevent the spread of the disease among the most vulnerable."

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO)
are urgently calling on all Iraqis to follow the preventive measures,
which are simple and affordable and have proved to be effective in
warding off the risk of a cholera outbreak. So far 39 districts in 11
provinces have been affected, according to the Ministry of Health.

Shoubo Rasheed, UNICEF's communication specialist, said: "Reduction
in the number of cholera cases and deaths does not happen by chance.
However, each and every Iraqi can make a significant contribution to
combating the outbreak simply by following the rules of food, water,
and personal hygiene."

Kirkuk, Sulaymaniyah, Erbil, Dohuk, Tikrit, Mosul, Diyala, Basra,
Wasit, Baghdad, and Anbar provinces are affected by the cholera
outbreak. "Local health units have been struggling to stop the
disease from spreading and have obtained excellent results," Abdallah said.

Despite a decline in the number of cholera cases, both UNICEF and WHO
have continued their support for local health units by providing
technical support, training on case management, outbreak
investigation, and containment. The 2 UN agencies have also been
supporting awareness and hygiene promotion campaigns in the country.

Tens of people in the districts of al-Dhoha, al-Zaidia, al-Qanawis,
al-Zahra, and al-Lohaiya of Hodeidah have been plagued with diarrhea,
but no deaths registered by the districts public health offices, a
medical source said.

The reason of diarrhea refers to [perhaps - Mod.LL] changes in the
digestive system as the time of meals changed after the holy month of
fasting, Ramadan, the source told NewsYemen. The source did not offer
definite number of plagued people in infected areas, but said that
field teams have visited the affected areas, which have diarrhea
infections every year, according to the source.

A diarrhea outbreak in Nepal has led to 23 deaths as of Sat 20 Oct
2007, and brought the number of infected to 500 since the outbreak
began. According to Dhaulaguwa Village Development Committee (VDC) in
Kalikot the outbreak has particularly and severely affected this
impoverished district. Dysentery broke out after the Saptari district
was under floodwater for several months.

Because of the alarm the disease had brought, a medical team composed
of 7 members, including the chief of the Department of Epidemiology
and Transferable Diseases, Laxmi Bikram Thapa, flew into the region.

According to Himalayan Times, the disease had crossed 19 districts
including Madhepura, Bamangamapatti, Rupnagar, Odraha, Haripur,
Bathnaha, Mahdewa, and Madhavpur.

[4] Cholera - Senegal

As the number of cholera cases in Senegal in 2007 tops 2000, Red
Cross and UN officials say not enough has changed since a huge
epidemic 2 years ago that affected more than 30 000 people and killed 450.

According to the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), 12
deaths and 2231 cases of cholera have been registered since the
beginning of August 2007 in 6 regions of the country. "Every day,
we're getting new cases. Before, it was one or 2 cases a day. Now,
it's 60 or 70. It's alarming," said Mamadou Sonko, head of operations
for the Senegalese Red Cross.

The Red Cross will train 240 volunteers who will lead awareness
activities in different communities. It will also distribute
disinfectant, antimicrobial soap, bowls, buckets, and measuring cups
to families in Diourbel, Dakar, Louga, Saint Louis, Fatick, and
Kaolack, where cases have emerged.

According to Aissa Fall Gueye, IFRC's regional health manager for
Sahel countries, cholera cases appeared only sporadically and were
easily contained until the rainy season began in July [2007] and
floodwaters began pouring down on Senegal and other West African
nations. "It's during that period that we saw a big peak," Gueye
said. "The rainy season certainly had an impact."

The movement of people across cities and regions was another
important factor. Sonko said the 1st cases of cholera appeared in
Touba, the religious center of the country. One week after it rained
in Touba, and sewer waters overflowed onto the streets, a large
religious gathering took place in Saint Louis, on the northeastern
coast hundreds of kilometers away. "Within 3 days, the 1st cases
appeared in Saint Louis."
