From: Dick Hamilton <rihamilto@home.com>

Two corrections should be made to the posting (20000325213015 - Potato late
blight, etiology).
1) I inadvertently left out the name of one of the authors in the third
reference. The correct title for the third reference is as follows:
Ristaino, J. B., Parra, G. R., and C. Trout Groves. 2000. PCR
amplification of _Phytophthora infestans_ from 19th century herbarium
specimens. AAAS Annual Meeting, Washington, DC, Abstract No. 31, Life
Sciences Section.
2) My comment on the post was incomplete. The following sentence should be
added:
Sequencing DNA from herbarium samples of dried potato and tomato lesions
containing the potato late blight pathogen, _Phytophthora infestans_,
confirmed the identity of the pathogen.
