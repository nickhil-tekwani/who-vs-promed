First Report of White Leaf Spot of Dry Bean Caused by
_Pseudocercosporella albida_ in North America.
L. E. del Rao, C. A. Bradley, and R. S. Lamppa. Department of Plant
Pathology, North Dakota State University, Fargo 58105. Plant Dis.
87:1537, 2003; published on-line as D-2003-1003-01N, 2003. Accepted
for publication 23 Sep 2003.
In August 2002, white leaf spot disease was observed on red kidney
bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_ L.) at 3 fields near Staples, MN. Disease
incidence in these fields, calculated as the proportion of plants
showing visible symptoms, ranged from 20 to 100 percent. Symptoms and
signs consisted of abundant, white sporulation on the abaxial side of
leaves that was limited by secondary veins, resulting in
angular-shaped lesions.
Corresponding with fungal growth, yellow, angular spots were observed
on the upper leaf surface. In older leaves, lesions coalesced,
covering most of their surface, while younger leaves were relatively
free of symptoms. Heavily diseased plants senesced faster and
defoliated earlier than nonsymptomatic plants.
Identification of the pathogen was conducted by direct observation of
infected plant tissues with light andelectron microscopes. Conidia
were hyaline, filiform, rounded at their apex, and with no visible
scar at their point of attachment to the conidiophore. Conidia had
one to 4 septa, were 57 to 68 micrometers long, and approximately 2.4
micrometers in diameter. Conidia were produced at the tip of
colorless, short conidiophores that emerged through stomata in groups
of 5 or more.
These traits are in agreement with the description of
_Pseudocercosporella albida_ (Matta & Belliard) Deighton (1,2). A
sample of infected tissues has been deposited at the U.S. National
Fungus Collection (BPI 842303) at Beltsville, MD.
The impact of this disease on bean yields in Minnesota was not
estimated. However, in the cool highlands of Colombia, where white
leaf spot is endemic, yields can be reduced by as much as 47 percent
(3).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of this
pathogen on dry bean in North America.
