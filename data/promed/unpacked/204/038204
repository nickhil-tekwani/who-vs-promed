20 cases of rabies among animals were discovered in Mordovia (Russia)
-------------------------------------------------
20 cases of rabies among animals were discovered in Mordovia (Russia)
for the period of January-September 2003. For the same period of
2002, there were no registered cases of rabies.
According to the chief of the epizootic team of the Veterinary
Department of the Republic of Mordoviya, Ivan Shibaykin, this
infectious disease was diagnosed in 12 foxes, 3 dogs, 2 cats, and 2
cattle in Krasnobodskiy, Ichalkovskiy, Romodanovskiy,
Zubovo-Polyanskiy, Kovilkinskiy, Insarskiy, and Ruzaevskiy portions
of Mordoviya.
The vaccination rate among animals has been increased because of the
worsened epizootic situation. 23 000 cattle and almost 29 000 dogs
were vaccinated against rabies.
According to Shibaykin, this acute increase in the cases of rabies
among animals is connected with the migration of wild animals from
the regions of Nijegorodskiy, Ryazanskiy, and Penzenskiy as a result
of fire.
