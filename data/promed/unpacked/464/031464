A boy is believed to have died from avian influenza in Turkey, its
government said last night, while his sister was seriously ill with the
same virus. They are the 1st human cases outside southeast Asia, bringing
the spectre of the feared pandemic to the European border.
The boy, aged 14, died on Sunday [1 Jan 2006] amid initial assertions from
the Turkish authorities that he did not have the H5N1 virus which causes
avian flu. His sister was said at the time to be in a critical condition.
But the Turkish health minister, Recep Akdag, said yesterday that
preliminary tests had [detected] the H5N1 avian influenza virus. A 3rd
sibling is also suspected of having the virus.
The British government will be closely monitoring developments in Turkey
after the news, a spokesman for the Department of Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs said last night."The cases in Asia have been among people who
have been closely involved with sick birds. Close contact is needed to
transmit this from bird to human," he said. Poultry workers are urged to
minimise risks by maintaining good hygiene, washing hands, isolating any
birds that may be sick and alerting the authorities.
The Turkish Health Minister said the authorities had repeated the test in 2
separate laboratories after an autopsy on the boy. "There are 2 cases that
have been confirmed as positive by the laboratory," he said. "Another case
is suspected of being positive." As in China and Viet Nam, the boy who died
and his siblings had close contact with chickens. Their family raised them
and they handled them on a regular basis. The children's father told the
Anatolia news agency that the whole family had eaten sick birds, but that
only the children became ill. 2 days later, they developed nausea and a
high fever.
The boy, his brother, and 2 sisters were admitted to hospital in the
southeastern province of Van on Saturday [21 Dec 2005]. Huseyin Avni Sahin,
chief physician at the hospital, said a total of 11 people, including
members of the [boy's] family, were either being treated or under
observation for suspected avian influenza.
News of the cases will cause concern across Europe. Although there is no
evidence that the virus is being transmitted from one human to another,
which is the necessary precursor to a human flu pandemic, the more often
humans become infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus, the greater the
chances that it will find an opportunity to [evolve] into a form which has
that ability.
"This is disturbing information, but we expect to see sporadic cases of
bird flu in humans in an environment where there is significant bird flu
among poultry," Dr David Nabarro, coordinator for avian influenza at the
UN, said. "This is not the start of the pandemic. The pandemic starts when
there is human-to-human transfer, confirmed and sustained."

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday [5 Jan 2006] sent a team of
experts to Turkey to help investigate the deaths of 2 teenagers from
suspected avian influenza, a senior official said. The team, which had been
requested by Ankara, included epidemiologists who would try to verify the
source of the virus which is believed to have killed a brother and sister
in a remote rural district of Turkey near the Armenian border. WHO
officials say that there is little doubt that the deaths were due to the
H5N1 avian influenza virus, making them the 1st human cases to occur
outside China and Southeast Asia.
On Thursday, a 2nd test in Istanbul had supported the findings of an Ankara
laboratory that H5N1 was responsible, said Guenael Rodier, special adviser
on communicable diseases at the World Health Organisation.
While a final diagnosis would only come after samples were examined at a
laboratory in Britain later this week, the Istanbul lab had used a genetic
technique that was as good as a fingerprint of the virus, he added. "I
have no reason not to trust the result," he told Reuters by telephone from
the WHO's European headquarters in Copenhagen.
But the WHO, which had been expecting human cases after the virus was
detected amongst wild birds and poultry in Turkey and parts of southeast
Europe late in 2005, said that this did not mean a worldwide flu pandemic
had become more likely.
Scientists fear that the deadly virus, which still rarely escapes to humans
from poultry and other birds, could mutate and become more easily
transmissible. In this case, it could trigger a global epidemic in which
millions of people could die. The H5N1 virus has killed 74 people in China
and southeast Asia since 2003, but virtually all the cases involved people,
as in Turkey, who had been in close contact with infected poultry. Turkish
newspapers said officials suspected the 14-year-old boy and his 15-year-old
sister were infected by chickens they kept at home.
Tracing the source of the infection would be the job of the
epidemiologists, Rodier said, adding their conclusions could be expected
within the next 5 days. The official said that the United Nations' health
agency had no reason yet to raise its global pandemic alert from the
current 3 on a 6-point scale. For the WHO to move to level 4, there would
need to be evidence of human-to-human transmission, and there was none yet.
"From a distance it looks like we have no need to be concerned as it (the
Turkish case) looks very like what happened in Asia, but let the
investigators do their job," Rodier said.

6 people have been sent to hospital in a 2nd province in eastern Turkey
with suspected avian influenza, NTV commercial television reported on
Thursday [5 Jan 2006].
The news follows the death of 2 teenagers, a brother and sister, in Van
hospital in eastern Turkey overnight in the 1st [suspected] human cases of
bird flu outside China and Southeast Asia.
NTV said the 6 patients were from Igdir province on the Armenian border,
just to the north of Agri province where the 2 dead children came from. 7
other people from Agri are also being treated in Van hospital for suspected
avian influenza.

[Until the results of the independent tests in progress in the UK become
available, all these cases should be regarded as suspected human cases
only. Despite the reassuring statements from WHO sources and others, if
these cases are confirmed as human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection, the situation in Turkey is qualitatively different from that in
East Asia in terms of the number of people that may be involved. In East
Asia human cases have been sporadic and usually have affected single
individuals only. The situation in Turkey remains unclear. - Mod.CP]
