With regard to the die-off of common eiders and black-legged kittiwakes in Iceland recently reported on ProMED (archive number 20140708.2594607), the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) is collaborating with the University of Iceland's Snaefellsnes Research Centre and The Institute for Experimental Pathology at Keldur, as well as the West-Iceland Centre of Natural History to investigate the cause(s) of these mortalities.

Although the site of the common eider mortality and the site of the black-legged kittiwake mortality are approximately 9 km apart, we are considering the possibility that they may be related. Fresh carcasses of common eiders were sent to The Institute for Experimental Pathology and frozen carcasses were sent to the NWHC for diagnostic evaluation. Only a single intact black-legged kittiwake carcass was recovered, as all other carcasses located were heavily scavenged and not suitable for evaluation.

As indicated by the moderator, there is yet no evidence to support a diagnosis of botulism, and while it has been not ruled out, it is also not high on the list of differential diagnoses.

The NWHC is currently engaged in a multi-year collaboration with the Snaefellsness Research Center and others conducting research on the occurrence of avian influenza virus in wild birds of Iceland (see PLoS ONE 9(3): e92075) and has conducted sampling of the common eider population at the die-off location in past years.
