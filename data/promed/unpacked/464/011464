The detection of 3 new cases of tularemia in Villarramiel, Osorno and Palencia, brings to 23 the number of people affected by this disease associated with the overpopulation of voles in the province of Palencia, where they are studying 32 other possible cases.

The Epidemiology Surveillance Network of the Junta de Castilla y León confirmed on [Mon 12 Aug 2019] 3 new cases of tularemia in the province of Palencia, where 23 people have been affected since 3 Jul 2019, as reported by the territorial delegation of the Board in Palencia. The last confirmed cases have been detected in the Palencia towns of; Villarramiel, where there are already 4 people affected by tularemia; the basic health area of rural Palencia where the 2nd case has been detected; and Osorno, which recorded the 1st confirmed case of this sickness.

In total, the Epidemiology Surveillance Network has confirmed 12 cases of tularemia so far in August [2019] were added to the 11 confirmed throughout the month of July [2019]. The most affected localities are Paredes de Nava, with 11 confirmed cases, and Villarramiel with 4, while the basic areas of Saldaña, Palencia and Cervera de Pisuerga have confirmed 2 cases each and Villada and Osorno a single case in each locality. Only one of the people affected, in Cervera de Pisuerga, has needed hospital admission but has already been discharged.

In addition there are 32 other suspicious cases that are being studied while an active search for this disease, associated with overpopulation of voles, continues.

The Health Service does not expressly cite the overpopulation of voles that are currently in the province of Palencia, mainly in the region of Tierra de Campos, as a cause of this disease and points out that "environmental exposure could be the main factor."

[The manifestations of tularemia are not stated and it would not be surprising if oropharyngeal tularemia is occurring as this outbreak, given its size, may be waterborne.

Outbreaks of water-transmitted tularemia include 64 cases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49 cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2), an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to contamination of a water supply (3), improperly prepared water for washing in the Czech Republic (4), and a Swedish outbreak associated with a contaminated well used for drinking water (5). Additionally, during the period 1936 to 1963, there were approximately 30 outbreaks of water-borne tularemia reported from the then Soviet Union (6).
