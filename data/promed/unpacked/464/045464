The Democratic Republic of the Congo declares 14th Ebola outbreak over
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Democratic Republic of the Congo today [Mon 4 Jul 2022] declared the end of the Ebola outbreak that erupted less than 3 months ago in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur Province in the northwest. It was the 3rd outbreak in the province since 2018 and the country's 14th overall.

With greater experience in Ebola control, national emergency teams, with the support from World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, mounted a swift response soon after the outbreak was declared on [23 Apr 2022], rolling out key countermeasures including testing, contact tracing, infection prevention and control, treatment and community engagement. Vaccination - a crucial protective measure - was launched just 4 days after the outbreak was declared.

In all, there were 4 confirmed cases and 1 probable case - all of whom died. In the previous outbreak in Equateur Province that lasted from [Jun 2020 -- Nov 2020], there were 130 confirmed cases and 55 deaths.

"Thanks to the robust response by the national authorities, this outbreak has been brought to an end swiftly with limited transmission of the virus," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. "Crucial lessons have been learned from past outbreaks and they have been applied to devise and deploy an ever more effective Ebola response."

The just-ended outbreak saw a total of 2104 people vaccinated, including 302 contacts and 1307 frontline workers. To facilitate the vaccination rollout, an ultra-cold chain freezer was installed in Mbandaka which allowed for vaccine doses to be stored locally and safely and be delivered effectively.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has now recorded 14 Ebola outbreaks since 1976, 6 of which have occurred since 2018.

"Africa is seeing an increase in Ebola and other infectious diseases that jump from animals to humans impacting large urban areas," said Dr. Moeti. "We need to be ever more vigilant to ensure we catch cases quickly. This outbreak response shows that by bolstering preparedness, disease surveillance, and swift detection, we can stay a step ahead."

WHO supported the Democratic Republic of the Congo in implementing a strong national strategy developed early to guide response coordination; decentralizing operations to the lowest level to work closely with communities; basing the response on evidence, and regularly analysing the epidemiological risk to rapidly adjust the response.

Although the outbreak in Mbandaka has been declared over, health authorities are maintaining surveillance and are ready to respond quickly to any flare-ups. It is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following an outbreak.

The disease, which affects humans and other primates, is severe and often fatal. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks. However, with the currently available effective treatment, patients have a significantly higher chance of survival if they are treated early and given supportive care.

[Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and before this EVD outbreak, the country had reported 13 EVD outbreaks since 1976. The current outbreak is the 3rd EVD outbreak in Equateur province and the 6th in the country since 2018. The last outbreak in the Equateur Province was declared over in November 2020, after 130 confirmed and probable cases were recorded and nearly 6 months after the 1st cases were reported (more details, published in Disease outbreak news on 18 Nov 2020; see https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/ebola-virus-disease-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-draft.
(excerpted from https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON377).

This outbreak was small, thanks to the quick and efficient response. Sadly, it was lethal with 100% of 5 (4 confirmed, 1 probable) recognized cases fatal. With support from the WHO and partners, the DRC has honed its skills to respond to Ebola, quickly implementing contact tracing and vaccination. They have learned the importance of involving communities and following evidence-based science. This strong national strategy will serve the country well in attacking other infectious disease threats in the country including COVID-19, cholera, measles, TB, malaria, HIV/AIDS.

DRC is the country most affected by Ebola and is the only nation that has continually reported cases over the past 5 decades.

Unfortunately, the entrenched violence and poverty in the region have hindered the rapid improvement of the situation. But certainly, congratulations are in order for having gained control over Ebola so efficiently. - Mod.LK
