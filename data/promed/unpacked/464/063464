Hunters and landowners in Lawrence and Sharp counties have reported
some deer and livestock dying from a possible outbreak of hemorrhagic
disease [should read: epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) - Mod.AS].

"I was approached by a sportsman on Saturday [25 Oct 2008] at
Ravenden who had found 5 deer dead around a spring on the property he
hunts on the Lawrence/Sharp County Line in September [2008]," said
James Foster, area biologist for Big Lake Wildlife Management Area.
"To do any type of testing and confirm the case, we would need to
have fresh carcasses, but the symptoms described sounded like it was
probably [EHD]."

"A landowner in Lawrence County reported 20 [dead? - Mod.AS] deer on
his property," said Arkansas Game and Fish Commission Deer Program
Assistant Coordinator Cory Gray. "He also reported 19 of his goats
had died" [see comment]. According to the Southeastern Cooperative
Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia, cases of [EHD]
are routinely reported near the end of each summer.

"Small outbreaks like this are fairly routine and are nothing to be
alarmed about," said Brad Miller, AGFC deer program coordinator. "The
overall health of Arkansas's deer herd is very strong."

Hemorrhagic disease is caused by bluetongue virus and EHD virus,
which are spread by blood-sucking midges, known as "gnats" or
"no-see-ums." Infected deer may appear lame or lose their fear of
humans; swelling of the head, neck and tongue may be apparent as well
as excessive salivation. Dying deer are often found near water
sources, as the fever associated with infection leads to intense
thirst. Some deer survive and will exhibit "sloughing" or cracking
hooves and healing ulcers on the tongue and lining of the mouth. Deer
with signs of the disease are generally safe for human consumption,
but hunters should be careful because secondary bacterial infections
may cause the meat to be unsafe to eat.

EHD is not harmful to humans. Hunters are asked to report any deer
showing signs of the disease immediately to the AGFC at (800)
482-9262. Biologists may want to take a sample from the deer to
confirm the case.

[Though the timing (late summer/fall season) is highly indicative of
EHD, descriptions of the PM changes and laboratory results are needed
in order to ascribe the deer mortality to EHD. EHD is known to have
the potential of infecting also cattle and sheep, in most cases
sub-clinically. The 19 dead goats mentioned on the Lawrence County
premises do not necessarily indicate a connection to EHD; this event,
if verified, deserves a separate epidemiological investigation. In
any event, only laboratory confirmation of EHD in dead deer in
Arkansas will enable a reliable assessment of the events.
