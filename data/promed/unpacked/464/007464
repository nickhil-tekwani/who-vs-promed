2003/023 _Erwinia amylovora_ found on the south-western coast of Norway
The Norwegian NPPO informed the EPPO Secretariat of a new finding of
_Erwinia amylovora_ [Ea], the bacterium that causes fire blight (EPPO
A2 quarantine pest). In July 2002, the Norwegian Agricultural
Inspection Service detected Ea at several locations on the
southwestern coast of Norway. 2 years ago, Ea (thought to be extinct
in Norway) was detected in the southwestern counties Rogaland and
Hordaland (see EPPO RS 2000/135).
Eradication measures are being taken, including surveys to delimit
infected areas, destruction of all infected plants and nearby host
plants and restrictions on transportation of bee hives. The situation
of Ea in Norway can be described as follows: Present, found in
several locations on the southwestern coast, under eradication.

[Fire blight can be a serious disease on apple, pear, and other
rosaceous species. Ea overwinters in diseased tissue and cankers.
Spread of Ea is primarily by wind and rain. Disease management
involves use of resistant cultivars and removal and eradication of
infected shoots and cankers. Spraying blossoms with streptomycin
reduces incidence of floral infection. - Mod.DH]
