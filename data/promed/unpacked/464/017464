[The following was extracted from ProMED-mail Ebola virus disease - West Africa (48): Sierra Leone, more cases, preparedness 20140527.2501116]

From the Ebola Surveillance & VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] Preparedness - Metabiota Inc. Laboratory team at KGH [Kenema Government Hospital] in partnership with the MOHS [Ministry of Health and Sanitation] Lassa fever Laboratory of Kenema Government Hospital (supported by Tulane University): from 19 Mar to 20 May 2014 a total of 140 EVD [Ebola virus disease] suspected cases sampled in Sierra Leone tested negative for ebolavirus.

Suspected cases of Lassa fever and other potential VHF were also tested for ebolavirus when required, 14 samples tested positive for Lassa virus, and one for West Nile virus.

[This is the 1st report of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in Sierra Leone that ProMED-mail has posted. There is a report from neighboring Guinea, indicating that the virus is circulating in West Africa (ProMED-mail archive no 20121018.1349816). ProMED would be interested to know which tests were used in determining the Sierra Leone positive result mentioned above. If this is the result of a serological test, the specificity of that test is critical because of the risk of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. Demonstration of WNV RNA by PCR or isolation of the virus would be more conclusive.

A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Sierra Leone can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2506847,46. - Mod.TY
