[2] Congo DR cultural factors
- 24 May 2018 Vaccines alone won't beat Ebola
The Atlantic [edited] https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/vaccines-alone-wont-beat-ebola/561128/ [Byline: Ed Yong]

A deep understanding of the Congo's culture and time-honored public-health tactics are the keys to controlling the outbreak.

Three people who had been infected with Ebola recently left an isolation ward at Wangata Hospital against medical advice, according to the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Ministry of Health. The hospital lies in Mbandaka, a city of 1.2 million, where health workers are trying to contain the Congo's 9th Ebola outbreak. One patient was on the mend, but decided to leave on Sunday and didn't come back. Two more left with their families on [Mon 21 May 2018] and went to church. One died at home, before his body was returned to the hospital for safe burial. The other returned voluntarily, before passing away at the hospital.

Choices like these make it harder to control this outbreak, which had already spread to 58 possible cases, as of Wednesday evening [23 May 2018]. But they are also understandable.

On a recent trip to the Congo, I met several survivors of past Ebola outbreaks, several of which had left hospitals and gone home. Partly, that's because an isolation ward can be a horrendous place, with walls and floors sometimes covered with vomit, feces, and urine. But partly, it's also because the very concept of an isolation ward is an anathema to many Congolese people.

In the Congo, if you're sick, you're usually surrounded. Medical services are thin, so family members shoulder the burden of nursing their loved ones back to health. At one hospital I visited (well before the current outbreak), a family had camped outside a treatment building, waiting for their relatives inside to recuperate. Their laundry was drying on a washing line. "In an outbreak, you want to separate sick and healthy people, but here, if people are sick, everyone's there," one survivor told me. "Here, for we who live in communities, it is solitude that kills us."

That mindset continues after death. Families will clean and dress the bodies of their loved ones. They'll caress, kiss, and embrace them. Spouses might even spend a night next to their deceased partners. Through these bonds of affection, Ebola, which spreads through bodily fluids, can easily jump from one host into an entire family. The worst thing about the virus is not its deeply exaggerated bloodiness, but its ability to corrupt the bonds of community. It is a pathogen well-suited to a world where sickness and death are met with touch and affection.

To bill these choices and practices, and others like them, as superstitions is misguided. These are the result of deeply held religious and cultural beliefs. "If you're asking someone to not do the typical thing they do to grieve and mourn, you need to provide an appropriate alternative that achieves the same cultural end," says Maimuna Majumder, an epidemiologist at MIT. "That's usually the piece that goes missing. You can't do that if you're othering these kinds of practices."

Fortunately, the Ministry of Health understands that. "We can't forcibly prevent family members from touching a [patient]," says the spokesperson Jessica Ilunga. "So we've been really stepping up our community-engagement activities, by involving traditional and religious leaders. They have a huge influence on the community."

That is how outbreaks are contained -- without community buy-in, resources and fancy new technology won't be enough.

- 24 May 2018. Why DR Congo is confident it will halt Ebola
BBC News, Kinshasa [edited] http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44241338 [Byline: Anne Soy]

What is being done to halt Ebola
--------------------------------
A vaccination campaign has also been launched in the city and it is hoped this will help halt the spread of the disease.

Other strategies include public health messages through radio, schools, churches, and word of mouth, educating people about Ebola and how to prevent it.

Unicef has installed hand-washing units in more than 50 schools. The UN peacekeeping mission, known as Monusco, has also been roped in -- even though it is in the country for a different mission -- to stabilise the security in the troubled east.

The peacekeepers are helping provide a lot of air transport to affected areas.

And DR Congo has shown that it is possible to tackle Ebola even in a country with inadequate hospitals, most of which lack proper equipment and enough staff. 7 out of every 10 Congolese have little or no access to health care.

But the outbreak in Mbandaka is not the first in an urban area for the country. "In Kikwit it was also an outbreak in an urban area, less than 500 km [about 310 mi] from Kinshasa," recalled Health Minister Oly Illunga Kalenga.

Dr Muyembe remembers the incident in 1995: "One of our patients escaped from Kikwit and came to Kinshasa. He was received at the hospital and we did not have another case of Ebola." In 1976, he also flew with a nurse who had high fever from Yambuku -- the affected area -- to the capital. "She died and infected 2 other nurses," Dr Muyembe said.

There were no other cases. Given such a history, Dr Muyembe and the health minister have no doubts that the country has what it takes to stop an outbreak of Ebola.

Dr Yao of WHO sums it up: "They know what to do."

[3] Vaccine implementation
24 May 2018. DRC Ebola responders trace high-risk contacts in Mbandaka

Vaccine developments, challenges
--------------------------------
In an update yesterday [23 May 2018] on use of the investigational VSV-EBOV vaccine, the WHO provided more details about the campaign. It said Doctors Without Borders (MSF) will be supporting the health ministry with vaccination in Bikoro and Iboko, the rural locations were most of the cases have been reported, and the WHO will support the health ministry with vaccination in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur province that is home to 1.2 million people.

The WHO said trained social mobilizers will be part of ring vaccination teams and will visit the family and neighbors of confirmed patients to explain the immunization process to potential participants.

Based on the WHO's protocol for expanded use of the vaccine in the DRC, children younger than 6 years and pregnant and lactating women will not get the vaccine because of limited data on those subgroups. "Available data from previous trials suggest that they might be indirectly protected by vaccinating the ring," the group said.

In a New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) report yesterday [23 May 2018], 2 top officials from the MSF and the WHO spoke of the challenges they expect to encounter while conducting research in an emergency setting.

Rebecca Grais, PhD, director of research for the MSF Epicenter in Paris, said planning between the health ministry and teams from the MSF before the DRC's Ebola outbreak in 2017 paved the way for the current campaign. She said the protocol isn't the hard part, but rather making quick judgments in the field keeping in mind that responders are visitors and want information to be shared.

She said participants will be followed for 42 days, whether they opt to be vaccinated or not, and the MSF plans to include 500 people in the trial and start as soon as its teams are on the ground in the DRC.

The NEJM report notes that the MSF and WHO teams have slightly different approaches, with the MSF's intent primarily research and the WHO's intent focused a bit more on treatment, given dissemination of the vaccine's on a compassionate-use basis. The report notes, however, that both groups are eager to see the research integrated into response operations. The WHO's Salama told NEJM that otherwise, health officials won't learn what the best approach is.

He added that the greatest challenges will revolve around communication and logistics, with the vaccine going only to specific people and vaccinators needing to navigate the outbreak's dense forested setting that has few roads.

He praised the efforts of DRC Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, PhD, who personally saw that the vaccine that came from Geneva to Kinshasa went directly to cold chain storage.

"It is that level of commitment that it takes. And we don't often see that type of commitment anywhere around the world," he told NEJM.

[The NEJM report mentioned above is also worth reading, as it goes into more of the cultural and ethical considerations in implementing the vaccination campaigns:

[4] Case terminology
23 May 2018. Ebola: "The case at Mama Yemo is not a suspect case, it is an alert."
Radio Okapi [in French, machine trans., edited] https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/05/23/actualite/sante/ebola-le-cas-de-mama-yemo-nest-pas-un-cas-suspect-cest-une-alerte-selon

The case on alert of haemorrhagic fever admitted to the Kinshasa General Hospital (ex-Mama Yemo) is not yet confirmed as that of Ebola virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) country representative, Dr Allarangar Yokouide, made this clear on [Wed 23 May 2018] in Kinshasa at the UN conference.

"The case of Mama Yemo is not a suspect case, it is an alert. That's what you have to say first. And when there is an alert like that, there are teams that have been put in place that move immediately to investigate. And the case of Mama Yemo is currently under investigation, " said Dr Allarangar Yokouide.

He recalled that this is not the 1st case detected in Kinshasa. But after analyses, all these cases have always been negative:
"We have already had 2 or 3 situations of this kind. And every time we have cases, we go to the INRB [National Institute of Biomedical Research] who tells us if it is that or not. And the case of Mama Yemo will go through the same process. The investigation is in progress. I am sure that during the day, we will be given the results and you will be informed. "

Pending the results of the investigations, the WHO recommends that the people of Kinshasa remain alert and vigilant, strictly observing hygiene measures.

The Ministry of Public Health says it has deployed its health brigade teams along the river as well as at various entry points in the capital and other cities as part of prevention.

Case on alert, suspect case. What?
----------------------------------
What to understand by [the terms] "case on alert" and "suspect case?" Dr Allarangar Yokouide explains the difference:

"When someone has a headache or when someone has general fatigue in the context of the epidemic, it can be said that it could be Ebola. That's the alert and we have to get closer, collect other information, and it is this other information that could help to say whether it is a suspect case or not.

According to him, "a suspect case is that case that has, not all the signs, but most of the signs that define the case of Ebola".

[This article reports a "case on alert" of hemorrhagic fever that has been admitted to the main government hospital in Kinshasa. One would naturally be concerned if a bona fide -- or even strongly suspect -- case of Ebola surfaced in Kinshasa, Congo's capital city of 11 855 000 people. However, there are many causes of hemorrhagic fever in Congo, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever, and yellow fever.

This article also highlights the importance of case definitions and terminology. Here Dr Allarangar Yokouide takes pains to distinguish a "case on alert" (cas en alerte) from a "suspect case" (cas suspect). His definition of a "case on alert" is similar to one of the WHO "suspected case" definitions used during the 2014-2015 West African Ebola epidemic; namely any patient with fever and 3 out of a list of symptoms including headache, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. This was a broad definition intended to include anyone who might have Ebola, but because all of these symptoms are non-specific, many if not most WHO "suspected cases" referred and triaged to Ebola treatment units in fact turned out to have other diseases such as malaria, sepsis, typhoid, or TB. In contrast, "cas suspect" as used in the article above means a case with most of the signs and symptoms of Ebola. I am not aware of a precise English equivalent, but presumably a patient who has had high-risk exposure to a known Ebola case and then comes down with fever AND 3 or more other typical symptoms would be considered "highly suspicious" for Ebola. Thus "cas suspect" (variously translated as "suspicious case" or "suspect case") in this context should not be confused with the more general WHO "suspected case" definition. - Mod.LXL
