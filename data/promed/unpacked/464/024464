A total of 224 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium have been reported from 34 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Arizona (5), California (6), Colorado (24), Florida (2), Georgia (3), Illinois (1), Indiana (7), Iowa (5), Kansas (13), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (6), Massachusetts (2), Minnesota (2), Mississippi (4), Missouri (16), Montana (1), Nebraska (10), Nevada (1), New Hampshire (1), New Mexico (13), New York (15), North Dakota (5), Oklahoma (9), Oregon (10), South Dakota (7), Tennessee (1), Texas (26), Utah (4), Vermont (1), Virginia (1), Washington (17), Wisconsin (2), and Wyoming (2).

This outbreak of human _S._ Typhimurium infections is not related to the current outbreak of human _S._ Infantis, Lille, Newport, and Mbandaka infections linked to live poultry.

Among those who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between and 4 Mar 2013 and 20 May 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than one year to 81 years, and 62 per cent of ill persons are 10 years of age or younger. 51 per cent of ill persons are female. Among 141 ill persons with available information, 37 (26 per cent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback findings have linked this outbreak of human _S._ Typhimurium infections to contact with chicks, ducklings, and other live baby poultry purchased from multiple feed stores and sourced from multiple mail-order hatcheries. Investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the live poultry linked to this outbreak.

Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam. Do not let live poultry inside the house. Additional recommendations are available. These recommendations are important and apply to all live poultry regardless of the age of the birds or where they were purchased.

Mail-order hatcheries, agricultural feed stores, and others that sell or display chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry should provide health-related information to owners and potential purchasers of these birds prior to the point of purchase. This should include information about the risk of acquiring salmonellosis from contact with live poultry.

[Certain epidemiological associations are classical. Salmonellosis has been, is, and will be closely linked to the handling of chicks and ducklings, especially in the spring of the year, around Easter. - Mod.LL
