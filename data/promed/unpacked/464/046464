1st Report of Botrytis Blight of Peanut Caused by _Botrytis cinerea_ in
Georgia. J. E. Woodward, T. B. Brenneman, R. C. Kemerait, Jr., and A. K.
Culbreath, Department of Plant Pathology, University of Georgia, Coastal
Plain Experiment Station, Tifton 31793; and J. R. Clark, University of
Georgia Cooperative Extension Service, Baxley 31513. Plant Dis. 89:910,
2005; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0910C. Accepted for
publication 10 May 2005.
Because of the importance of spotted wilt caused by Tomato spotted wilt
virus (TSWV), most peanut (_Arachis hypogaea_ L.) breeding programs in the
southeastern United States are focusing on developing resistance to TSWV.
Many of the cultivars with improved resistance to TSWV are late maturing,
requiring 150 days to reach optimum maturity. This factor could greatly
impact disease problems at harvest.
During November of 2004, an unknown disease was observed on peanut cvs.
Georgia 02-C and Hull in a commercial field in Appling County. Symptoms
included wilting stems with water-soaked lesions and a dense, gray mold
growing on infected tissues. Final disease incidence was less than 5
percent. For isolation, diseased tissue was surface-sterilized by soaking
in 0.5 percent sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, air dried, plated on potato
dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 20C. _Botrytis cinerea_ Pers.:Fr.,
causal agent of Botrytis blight, was isolated from the margins of infected
tissue.
Mycelia were initially white but became gray after 72 h, at which time
tall, branched, septate conidiophores formed. Mature, unicellular,
ellipsoid, hyaline conidia (8.9 x 10.4 micrometers) formed in botryose
heads (1). Hard, black, irregular-shaped sclerotia formed after 2 weeks.
Stems of greenhouse-grown peanut plants (cv. Georgia Green) were inoculated
with PDA plugs colonized with either _B. cinerea_ or _B. allii_ Munn.
Inoculations were made 3 cm below the last fully expanded leaf on wounded
and nonwounded tissue. Noncolonized PDA plugs served as controls (n = 9).
Plants were arranged in a dew chamber at 20C in a randomized complete block
design.
Lesions and spore masses identical to those observed in the field appeared
3 to 5 days after being inoculated with _B. cinerea_. The _B. allii_
inoculations caused only superficial lesions. After 5 days, mean lesion
lengths for _B. cinerea_ were 59 and 37 mm for wounded and nonwounded
inoculations, respectively. _B. cinerea_ was recovered from 100 percent of
the symptomatic tissues. Botrytis blight is considered a late-season
disease that occurs in cool, wet weather (3).
Symptoms similar to those of Botrytis blight were observed on mature and
over-mature peanut in Georgia and have been cited as "unpublished
observations" (2); however, to our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the
disease in Georgia. Although Botrytis blight is not considered a major
peanut disease, it may become more prevalent at harvest as producers
utilize late-maturing cultivars to manage spotted wilt.

[Botrytis blight of peanut is a late-season disease that generally occurs
in cool, wet weather. Infected tissues rapidly develop a water-soaked,
brown appearance and are frequently covered by a greyish-brown mold.
Although all currently planted varieties are susceptible to Botrytis
blight, NC 17 appears to be highly susceptible to this disease. In the
United States, Botrytis blight occurs predominantly in certain areas of
West Texas. Symptoms of this disease closely resemble Sclerotinia blight.
Disease management is best accomplished by harvesting in a timely fashion
and avoiding plant injury so as to reduce symptom incidence and severity.
