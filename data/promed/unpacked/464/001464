FDA takes action against Iowa dairy
---------------------------------------
An investigation into illegal drug residues by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has led to a permanent injunction being filed
against an Iowa dairy.
Last week [8 Aug 2007], a Complaint and Consent Decree of Permanent
Injunction was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Iowa, Western Division, against Ysselstein Dairy Inc.,
Rock Valley, IA.
The injunction is based on 9 illegal residues in the edible tissue of
7 dairy cows sampled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food
Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) between 21 Jul 1992, and 10 Mar
2006. The drug residues found by FSIS included antibiotics such as
tetracycline, sulfadimethoxine, flunixin, oxytetracycline, and
penicillin at levels not permitted by the FDA.
The FDA is concerned about the sale of animals for human food that
may contain illegal levels of animal drugs because of the potential
for adverse effects on human health. The FDA approves new animal
drugs with requirements, including a specified time period to
withdraw an animal from treatment prior to slaughter, to ensure that
a drug has been depleted from edible tissue to a level safe for
humans.
Under the terms of the consent decree, the dairy must implement
systems to identify animals, keep accurate records, maintain drug
control, drug accountability, and drug residue withdrawal control.
Furthermore, if the dairy is found to not be in compliance with the
terms of the decree or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the
FDA may require the dairy to cease operations until they are in
compliance. The dairy also can be fined. To read the full press
release, go to:

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[Generally the FDA works with the states to insure that corrective
action occurs. As can be seen from this article there are a number of
violations over a period of time. Clearly the dairy did not follow
its corrective action plan, or the state was unsuccessful its
enforcement.
Since food safety is a priority of consumers, it is appropriate to
see the FDA taking action. It is also possible that if there are
tissue residues there would be milk residues of drugs as well. -
