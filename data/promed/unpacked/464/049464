Citation: Christophers B, Marin BG, Oliva R, et al. Trends in clinical presentation of children with COVID-19: a systematic review of individual participant data. Pediatr Res. [Epub 17 Sep 2020]. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-01161-3

Background: There are sparse patient-level data available for children with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, there is an urgent need for an updated systematic literature review that analyzes individual children rather than aggregated data in broad age-groups.

Methods: Six databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar, medRxiv) were searched for studies indexed from 1 Jan to 15 May 2020, with MeSH terms: children, pediatrics, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. A total of 1241 records were identified, of which only unique papers in English with individual patient information and documented COVID-19 testing were included. This review of 22 eligible studies followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of individual participant data guidelines.

Results: A total of 123 patients from 5 countries were identified; 46% were females. The median age was 5 years (IQR = 8). At presentation, 62% had a fever, 32% had a cough, 58% had a single symptom, and 21% were asymptomatic. Abnormal chest imaging was seen in 62% (65 of 105) of imaged and 76.9% (20 of 26) of asymptomatic children. A minority of children had elevated platelets, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer.

Conclusion: Data from this independent participant data systematic review revealed that the majority of children with COVID-19 presented with either no symptoms or a single, non-respiratory symptom.

Impact: This systematic review revealed that the majority of children with COVID-19 presented with either no symptoms or a single, non-respiratory symptom. By using an independent participant data approach, this analysis underscores the challenge of diagnosing COVID-19 in pediatric patients due to the wide variety of symptoms and seemingly poor correlation of imaging findings with symptomatic disease. The data presented from individual patients from case series or cohort studies add more granularity to the current description of pediatric COVID-19.

[In view of the ongoing efforts to ensure that schools and academic institutions are reopened with safe practices, a meta-review such as the above report can provide important insights into planning and management of the educational facilities and may be helpful in devising more practical screening strategies for suspected cases. As reported above, nearly 20% of the cases are asymptomatic -- are they spreaders contributing to transmission? What level of interaction in schools would be safe if we assume 1 in 5 children may be harbouring and/or spreading the virus? Many questions and still more information needed going forward.

The relevant WHO guidance in this regard, published on 14 Sep 2020, can be accessed at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/considerations-for-school-related-public-health-measures-in-the-context-of-covid-19. - Mod.UBA]

More than 30 million people around the world have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and 943 515 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. Some 20.4 million people have recovered.

- 14:25 GMT - Iran on coronavirus red alert due to rise in deaths
A senior Iranian health official has declared a coronavirus red alert covering the entire country as daily deaths and cases increase at an alarming rate, Iranian state TV reported.

Iran, one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the pandemic, has been divided up into white, orange/yellow and red regions based on the number of infections and deaths. The death toll rose by 144 to 23 952 on Friday [18 Sep 2020], while the total number of identified cases spiked by 3049 to 416 198, health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said on television.

"The colour classification doesn't make sense anymore. We no longer have orange and yellow. The entire country is red," deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said on television. In the northwestern city of Tabriz, for instance, the number of hospitalised patients had jumped from under 40 a day to 160.

- 14:01 GMT - Dutch register new 24-hour record in coronavirus cases
There were 1972 new coronavirus cases registered by Dutch health authorities in the past 24 hours, according to data published by health authorities, marking the 4th consecutive day of all-time highs in the country.

Case data are submitted by local health authorities across the Netherlands and published daily by the National Institute for Health (RIVM). Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government is expected to announce regional measures such as bans on large gatherings and early closures for bars and restaurants later on Friday [18 Sep 2020] in response to the rise in cases.

- 13:30 GMT - UK COVID-19 R rate rises
The reproduction "R" number of COVID-19 infections in the United Kingdom has risen to a range of 1.1-1.4 from last week's figure of 1.0-1.2, the government said.

"An R number between 1.1 and 1.4 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 11 and 14 other people," it said. It added that the number of new infections was growing by 2% to 7% every day.

- 11:31 GMT - Iceland orders pubs to close for 4 days
Iceland has ordered the closure of entertainment venues and pubs in the capital area for 4 days - 18-21 Sep 2020 - in order to counteract the spread of COVID-19, the government said in a statement.

- 10:50 GMT - EU endorses dexamethasone for patients on oxygen therapy
The European health regulator endorsed the use of widely known steroid dexamethasone in the treatment of COVID-19 patients on oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said based on its review of results of a study by UK researchers, it concluded that dexamethasone -- a commonly used drug against a range of inflammatory conditions -- can be considered a treatment option in adults and adolescents needing oxygen therapy.

The recommended dose in adults and adolescents, from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 kg (88 lb), is 6 milligrams once a day for up to 10 days, the EMA said.

- 10:30 GMT - Russia's R-Pharm secures approval for Coronavir
Russia has approved R-Pharm's Coronavir treatment for outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections and the antiviral drug could be rolled out to pharmacies in the country as soon as next week, said the company.

Coronavir's approval follows the green light for another Russian COVID-19 drug, Avifavir, in May [2020]. Both are based on favipiravir, which was developed in Japan and is widely used as the basis for viral treatments.

R-Pharm's announcement is another sign Russia is pushing hard to take a global lead in the race against the virus. It is already exporting its COVID-19 tests and has clinched several international deals for supplies of its Sputnik V vaccine.

- 09:55 GMT - French city tightens restrictions as cases soar
The city of Nice on the French Riviera will ban gatherings of more than 10 people in public spaces and tighten rules on alcohol consumption outdoors as it seeks to curb COVID-19 infections that are soaring in the region, according to local authorities.

France registered a record 10 593 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the health ministry data showed on Thursday [17 Sep 2020], the country's highest single-day count since the pandemic began.

- 09:25 GMT - US CDC testing guidance published against objections
US President Donald Trump's administration posted controversial recommendations on coronavirus testing to the website of the country's health agency against the objections of its scientists, according to a report by The New York Times, citing people familiar with the matter and internal documents.

The guidelines, which said testing was not necessary for people who were exposed to COVID-19 but not displaying symptoms, were criticised when they were issued last month [August 2020].

- 08:57 GMT - Czech Republic's daily cases surpass 3000
A surge in COVID-19 infections in the Czech Republic accelerated, with more than 3000 cases reported in a day for the 1st time, a day after the daily tally first exceeded 2000.

The country has seen one of the biggest spikes in new coronavirus infections in Europe, with daily case numbers quickly growing from the hundreds into the thousands. The government has reacted by tightening measures, including limiting bars' opening hours from Friday [18 Sep 2020], banning stand-up indoor events and widening mask use in schools.

- 08:35 GMT - Australia to ease border limits, allow more citizens home
Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, has said his government will increase the number of citizens allowed to return home each week to 6000 people.

Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting on Friday [18 Sep 2020], Morrison said states have agreed to boost quarantine capacity and that the cap on the number of people allowed into Australia each week will increase by 2000 by mid-October. The country's weekly limit is currently set at 4000 people.

- 07:59 GMT - Israel enforces 2nd lockdown
Israel is about to enter a 2nd nationwide lockdown at the onset of the Jewish holiday season, forcing residents to stay mostly at home amid a resurgence in new coronavirus cases.

The new lockdown, which is due to begin at 2 pm (11:00 GMT) and will last 3 weeks, coincides with the start of the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana, traditionally a time for large family gatherings and group prayer.

Under the new rules, Israelis must stay within 500 metres (546 yards) of home, with exceptions for activities such as commuting to work, shopping for essentials and walking outdoors for exercise. Workplaces will operate on a limited basis.

Social distancing and limits on the number of worshippers will go into effect at synagogues, usually packed for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, that begins at sunset on 27 Sep 2020.

- 07:45 GMT - Countries' latest figures
Russia: 1 091 186 cases (+5905), 19 195 deaths (+134)
Indonesia: 236 519 cases (+3891), 9336 deaths (+114)

- 07:27 GMT - Thailand reports 1st death in 100 days
Thailand reported its 1st coronavirus death in more than 100 days, a health official said, after an infected Thai citizen had returned from abroad earlier this month [September 2020].

The 54-year-old man, who was an interpreter based in Saudi Arabia working for the Thai labour ministry, had been treated in a Bangkok hospital for 2 weeks and died on Friday [18 Sep 2020], Somsak Akksilp, head of the Department of Medical Services, told Reuters.

- 06:45 GMT - COVID-19 admissions doubling every 8 days in UK
The coronavirus is accelerating across the country with hospital admissions doubling every 8 days, said the British health minister, adding that he is unable to answer whether another national lockdown would be imposed next month [October 2020].

Asked repeatedly by Sky News about the prospect of a 2nd national lockdown next month, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said lockdown was a last resort, but that the government would do whatever it takes to tackle the virus. "The number of people in hospital is doubling every 8 days or so...we will do what it takes to keep people safe," Hancock said. "We keep these things under review."

- 06:20 GMT - Work from home still highly recommended: French minister
Working from home remains highly recommended, said French employment minister, Elisabeth Borne, as President Emmanuel Macron's government battles to contain a likely 2nd wave of the COVID-19 virus. "It remains a practice that is highly recommended," Borne told local radio.

The comments were made after France registered a record 10 593 new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours. The death toll also rose by 50 to 31 095, the second-highest daily number of deaths in 2 months.

- 05:05 GMT - India logs another daily jump of more than 96 000 infections
India's coronavirus cases jumped by another 96 424 infections in the past 24 hours, showing little sign of levelling.

The health ministry on Friday [18 Sep 2020] raised the nation's total past 5.21 million, 0.37% of its nearly 1.4 billion people. It said 1174 more people died in the past 24 hours, for a total of 84 372 fatalities. India is expected to have the highest national total of confirmed cases within weeks, surpassing the USA, where more than 6.67 million people have been infected.

- 04:46 GMT - EU travel industry steps up quarantine pushback
Leaders of Europe's coronavirus-stricken travel and tourism industries have appealed to the EU's chief executive to press governments to end quarantine requirements and instead embrace coordinated restrictions and testing.

"This chaotic situation requires your immediate personal involvement," a broad ad-hoc group of more than 20 industry groups including airline body IATA told European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a letter seen by Reuters. The appeal came as data from airports' group ACI Europe, one of the signatories to the 17 Sep 2020 letter, pointed to a "double-dip" air traffic slump, with passenger numbers down 73% in the first 2 weeks of September [2020], after a 65% decline in August.

- 04:16 GMT - Australia looks set to ease border limits and allow more citizens home
The Australian government is expected to announce an increase in the number of citizens able to return home after a National Cabinet meeting later on Friday [18 Sep 2020], where states will be asked to boost quarantine capacity.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison is seeking to raise the cap on the number of people allowed into Australia each week by 2000 from next Friday [25 Sep 2020]. The country's weekly limit is currently set at 4000 people, but there are an estimated 25 000 stranded Australians wanting to return home which the government has pledged to facilitate before Christmas.

- 03:50 GMT - 1st case-free day for New Zealand in 5 weeks
New Zealand reported no new confirmed cases of the coronavirus for the 1st time in more than 5 weeks as hopes rise that an outbreak discovered in Auckland last month [August 2020] has been stamped out.

Friday's [18 Sep 2020] report also marked the 4th consecutive day without any cases of community transmission. All recent cases have been found among quarantined travellers returning from abroad. Authorities have still not pinpointed the origin of the August outbreak, which they believe was imported. New Zealand has reported a total of just over 1800 cases and 25 deaths.

- 02:56 GMT - Serbia sets new rule for arrivals from high-risk areas
Serbia will require all travellers returning from areas it considers high-risk for COVID-19 to fill in an online form ahead of time.

The measure will help authorities quickly trace returnees who develop symptoms of the coronavirus, Serbian media reported. It comes into effect at 6 pm local time on Friday [18 Sep 2020]. Returnees will not be required to enter quarantine or produce a negative test at the border.

- 02:42 GMT - China reports 32 new cases, all imported
Health authorities in mainland China reported 32 new COVID-19 cases, all imported cases, marking the highest daily increase in more than a month and up sharply from 9 cases reported a day earlier [17 Sep 2020].

Although the latest increase still remains well below the peaks seen at the height of the outbreak in China early this year, it is the biggest since 10 Aug 2020 and suggests continued COVID-19 risks stemming from overseas travellers coming into the country as the pandemic rages on in other parts of the world. Mainland China has not reported any local COVID-19 infections since mid-August [2020].

- 01:41 GMT - Australia's Victoria state reports 45 new cases
Australia's coronavirus hot spot of Victoria reported its biggest daily rise in coronavirus infections in more than a week as the state began relaxing lockdown restrictions.

Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, reported 5 deaths from COVID-19 and 45 cases in the last 24 hours. The state reported 8 deaths and 28 cases a day earlier [17 Sep 2020], its lowest daily rise in infections in nearly 3 months. The southeastern state started easing curbs this week after a hard lockdown helped bring down the daily rise in infections to double-digits after it touched highs of more than 700 in early August [2020].

- 01:12 GMT - California requires worker compensation for virus infection
Companies in the US state of California must compensate any workers who contract the coronavirus while on the job and must warn employees of any potential exposure to the virus under 2 laws that Governor Gavin Newsom signed on Thursday [17 Sep 2020].

The law on informing employees requires that businesses tell workers whenever they have been exposed to someone who has either tested positive, been ordered to isolate or died because of the virus.

- 00:43 GMT - Ontario clamps down on parties
Ontario, Canada's largest province, will fine people who hold social gatherings in defiance of new limits amid a spike in cases in the cities of Toronto and Ottawa, as well as a region just outside Toronto.

Starting on Friday [18 Sep 2020] in those 3 areas, only 10 people will be allowed to gather indoors -- down from the current limit of 25. The number for outdoor gatherings will drop to 25 from 100. The penalty for organisers of events that violate the limits will be 10 000 Canadian dollars (USD 7600). People attending the gatherings will be fined 750 Canadian dollars (USD 568).

- 00:03 GMT - Rise in virus cases among refugees on Lesbos
Greece reported 135 cases of coronavirus infections among migrants and refugees made homeless by a fire at a large refugee on the island of Lesbos. Notis Mitarachi, the migration affairs minister, said the infections were discovered after some 5000 migrants were escorted by police to a temporary new site and given rapid tests for the coronavirus.

"Within days from the devastating fires in Moria, the new camp in Mavrovouni (Kara Tepe) has been erected and more than 5000 people have found safe shelter within," he said. "They have also found the appropriate medical treatment and testing for coronavirus and 135 people have been found positive up to now, and they are being kept in special areas where they receive the appropriate medical conditions."

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (92 755), followed by the USA (42 533) and Brazil (30 913) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 52.4% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4953 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (18-19 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (0), France (13 498), Argentina (9276), Colombia (7927), Peru (6453), and Russia (6065), and 31 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. Five of the 10 top countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region; 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 8.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 9.9%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe showing major increasing transmission in many countries and the Americas region as well. - Mod.UBA]
