Thailand confirms death from EV-71 virus
----------------------------------------
Thailand has confirmed its 1st fatality this year [2012] from a virus that has killed hundreds of children across Asia. The 2-year-old girl who died at a Bangkok hospital last week had a form of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) known as [i.e., caused by] enterovirus 71 strain, or EV-71. The disease is common among children ages 2 to 5 and is usually mild. But the severe form of the illness caused more than 400 deaths in the 1st half of this year in China, Viet Nam and Cambodia.

Disease Control Department senior adviser Doctor Prasert Thongcharoen said Tuesday [24 Jul 2012] that laboratory tests showed the Thai girl was more vulnerable because she also had asthma.

The Public Health Ministry said about 16 000 children in Thailand contracted hand, foot and mouth disease this year.
