Further Comment on the Use of Novalgin
-----------------------------------------------
With regard to mention of 'Novalgin,' generic name 'dipyrone,' this is of
course an amidopyrine derivative and no longer marketed either in the US or
in most other countries because of the risk of agranulocytosis, which its
administration carries.
I was interested to see in my old 28th edition of 'Martindale' the comment
that "The use of Novalgin is only justified in serious or life-threatening
situations when no alternative antipyretic is available or suitable." This
would appear to cover its use in Ebola hemorrhagic fever, but I am
surprised to learn that it is still available in East Africa, as it is rare
to find it in an English-speaking country.
