Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - United Arab Emirates [21 Sep 2017]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 23 August 2017, the national IHR focal point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported one additional case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case
MERS-CoV case reported on 23 August 2017

[This is now the 2nd case reported from Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE) to WHO in the past 3 months. On 28 Aug 2017, WHO reported on a 54-year-old male from Al Ain who also had no identifiable known high risk exposures. Date of report to WHO of that individual was 29 Jul 2017 (see MERS-CoV (56): UAE, Saudi Arabia (JF, HA, RI), WHO 20170829.5280997 for details).

The current case, reported by WHO on 21 Sep 2017 is a 78-year-old male from Al Ain, who also had no identifiable known high risk exposures. The date of report to WHO of this individual was 23 Aug 2017.

Counting this newly reported case, there have now been 6 cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in the UAE this year (2017), Other reported cases in 2017 include the other case from Al Ain reported by WHO in August 2017, 2 previous cases in May 2017 from Al Ain, and 2 additional previous cases from Abu Dhabi reported in April 2017, bringing the total number of cases reported by the UAE since 2012 up to 85.

So an obvious question is, what is the high risk exposure ongoing in Al Ain, UAE? As both patients had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, is contact with the health care environment where the transmission is occurring, with patients having contact with others who are shedding the virus but not being diagnosed as having MERS-CoV infection?

As of [Thu 21 Sep 2017], there have been a total of:
1716 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
694 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.4 percent],
1006 recoveries, and
16 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Note that during this period since the last update, reporting on the MOH website has been significantly delayed. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [11 Sep 2017], there have been a total of:
0 newly confirmed case,
4 newly reported fatalities, and
2 newly reported recoveries.

[The most recent newly confirmed case from Saudi Arabia was reported on [Fri 8 Sep 2017] - 2 weeks ago, suggesting there are no identified chains of transmission ongoing in the country at this time. It's nice to have a "no cases" for 2 weeks report from Saudi Arabia.
