Health officials advise livestock handlers to be cautious
-----------------------------------------------
State Epidemiologist Kirby Kruger is urging people who work with
livestock to take precautions to avoid contracting anthrax from sick
animals.
The anthrax outbreak has affected animals in 9 eastern North Dakota
counties. There have been no human cases.
Kruger says the risk of anthrax being transmitted to humans is low.
But he says people who work with livestock should still take
precautions. They include wearing the proper clothing, washing hands
and exposed skin, and minimizing direct contact with the animals.

There are 10 counties and 69 premises as of today [Wed 3 Aug 2005].
There have been deaths reported after vaccination, at least that's
what I'm aware of in North Dakota.

[The main affected counties are Dickey, Lemore, Ransom, and Sargeant;
also Barnes, Griggs, Grand Forks, Steele, Trail, and Walsh.
The common experience with Sterne vaccine is that you will get deaths
up to 8 days post-vaccination because it is only at that point that
protection has been fully developed. And because of that 8-day risk
window, ranchers are encouraged to 1st treat their stock with
long-acting antibiotics to treat any apparently healthy animals that
are incubating an infection. LA200 gives a 3-day cover but cannot be
used with lactating dairy cows. Benzathine Penicillin with Penicillin
G Procaine gives a 48-hour cover and can be used with dairy cows.
Because the latter is shorter acting, it may not be as efficacious
and may need to be given twice or in larger doses than specified on
the bottle.
Anyway, if there have been deaths in a dairy herd, animals'
temperatures should be checked morning and afternoon when they come
in for milking until the vaccination has taken effect; any animal
with a temperature or seeming to be ill (dairymen know their animals)
should be taken out of the line and treated. There is no risk to
humans from the vaccine when they drink the milk from healthy
vaccinated cows.
If you use the antibiotics after the vaccine, it can stop the vaccine
from developing a full immunity by killing circulating live vaccine
organisms. So the best course of action is to 1st treat with
antibiotics, wait 7-10 days, and then vaccinate. If you use
antibiotics simultaneously with vaccine, you will have to revaccinate
the animals 2 weeks later to get any long term protection.
Once a herd has had anthrax, you should revaccinate each following
spring for at least 3 years because of any pasture contamination.
This also applies to ranchers who may not have had any anthrax deaths
but whose neighbors have. You cannot count on the latter remembering
to revaccinate next year, and when they are reminded by cows dying,
it may be too late for you to protect your animals. I have seen this
happen more than a few times.
Thanks to Susan for the update. - Mod.MHJ]
