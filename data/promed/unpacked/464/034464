B1 outbreak in Belluno
----------------------
[I am reliably informed by Antonio Fasanella, Istituto
Zooprofilattico Sperimentale (IZS) della Puglia e Basilicata, and
Michela Corro, IZS Padua, that in late October (2007) there was at
least one outbreak of anthrax affecting livestock near Belluno
(Veneto). Briefly, the outbreak involved one 2 1/2-year-old Simmental
cow that had just returned to the farm on 20 Oct 2007 from the summer
pastures in the mountains some 20 km (12.5 mi) away. She died on 23
Oct 2007 having suffered a 39 deg C (102.2 deg F) fever, rumination
block, tachycardia, and difficult breathing. She was diagnosed with
anthrax. This summer pasture is known to be a 'champs maudit' but the
last known outbreak was more than 20 years ago. The 20-cow herd had
been vaccinated annually but this was dropped 5-6 years ago. The herd
had been supplementally fed with the farm's own hay.

The interesting aspect of this outbreak -- other than it is in
Northern Italy where anthrax is frankly rarely reported these days --
is that it involved the B1 genotype. B1 is essentially limited to
southern Africa, so far as we know. In our global collection and
related studies we have come up with only 6 B1 isolates from outside
Africa: from California (Santa Clara, 2001), North Carolina (1939),
Germany, Norway (Oppland, 1976), and 2 from the UK (outbreak
associated with a Spanish mineral mix, 1972; multiple outbreaks
associated with "Senegalese" groundnut meal, 1978).

In December 2005/January 2006 there was a B1 outbreak on an isolated
farm in the Parcines commune in the Alto Adige region (Bolzano) in
housed stock; see ProMED-mail 20060127.0265. This farm at 1500 m
(4921 ft) altitude is reached by a private funicular railway or by a
seasonal dirt track. A cow and calf died as well as 4 goats and a
sheep. All had gross pathological signs typical of anthrax. The
latter sheep was submitted for laboratory analysis at IZS Bolzano and
_Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated. The farmer developed a skin
infection subsequent to butchering some of the affected animals. This
farm has a 10 has. (24.7 acres) hay pasture but had bought hay, of
which 95 percent came from specific farms in Belluno; it had been fed
to the cattle since the previous October (about 9 weeks) and to the
goats and sheep since the mid-November (about 5 weeks). The Parcines
farm is some 200 km (125 mi) from Belluno with a number of mountain
ranges in between; check it out on Google Earth ... an area one goes around.

So while the B1 strains in the Kruger National Park need alkaline
soils [KL Smith, V De Vos, H Bryden, L Price, M Hugh-Jones, & P Keim.
2000: _Bacillus anthracis_ diversity in Kruger National Park. Journal
of Clinical Microbiology 38(10):3780-3784] and are less flexible in
this than the A strains, it would seem that once established
elsewhere in an appropriate soil they can cause problems over an
extended period. One or more of such sites may be in the Belluno region.

Various aspects of this latest Belluno outbreak are under
investigation and we await their results with interest. - Mod. MHJ]
