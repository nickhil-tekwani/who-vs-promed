From: Jack Woodall <woodall@promedmail.org>

ProMED-mail erred in assuming that the cases from Zhambyl, Kazakhstan,
reported in the press as due to hemorrhagic fever must have been either
tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by a flavivirus, or hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by a hantavirus. Subsequent press
reports, plus confirmation from our Regional Moderator for the NIS/CIS,
give the diagnosis as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), caused by a
nairovirus -- see third ref. above.
This diagnosis doesn't make much difference to the poor patient, since they
are all severe diseases, but is important in planning control measures,
since TBE & CCHF are transmitted by ticks, HFRS by rodent excreta, &
different animal reservoirs are involved.

[Note on virus taxonomy: HFRS and CCHF are both members of the
famil_Bunyaviridae_. The former is classified in the genus _Hantavirus_ and
can be referred to as a hantavirus. The latter is classified in the genus
_Nairovirus_ and can be referred to as a nairovirus. These viruses should
not be referred to as bunyaviruses. The term bunyavirus should only be used
when referring to members of the genus _Bunyavirus_. -Mod -CP
