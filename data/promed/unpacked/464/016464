West Nile Virus Found in 2 More Birds in North Carolina
-------------------------------------------------------
RALEIGH: The State Public Health Laboratory last night reported that 2 new
birds collected by county health departments in North Carolina have tested
positive for West Nile virus - a blue jay found in Cabarrus County and a
crow found in Chowan County.
These 2 new cases bring North Carolina's total West Nile virus non-human
cases for 2001 to 9. Earlier findings of West Nile virus in the state this
year include a blue jay found in Cabarrus County that tested positive on 17
Sep 2001; 2 crows found in Camden County reported on 28 Sep 2001; 2 crows
found in Currituck County reported on 9 Oct 2001; one crow found in
Mecklenburg County reported on 9 Oct 2001; and one horse from Hyde County
reported on 9 Oct 2001. One horse from Camden County reported on October 9
also tested positive for West Nile virus, but has not yet been confirmed.
When West Nile virus was first detected in the state on 17 Sep, acting State
Health Director Leah Devlin issued a Public Health Warning advising
residents to be diligent in protecting themselves against mosquito bites.
This warning remains in effect.
North Carolina residents can help identify areas that might be at risk for
West Nile virus by reporting dead or dying birds to public health officials.
The 3 kinds of birds that are of particular concern are crows, blue
jays, and hawks, but residents should report any bird behaving strangely.
Birds reported should be no more than 48 hours dead. Residents are
encouraged to report birds to their local health departments.
West Nile Virus was first detected in North Carolina last year in a dead
crow found at Jordan Lake State Park in Chatham County by a conservation
biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is important to remember
that the virus is transmitted to humans when a mosquito bites an infected
bird and then bites a human. It is not known to pass directly from birds to
humans or from human to human.
West Nile Virus originates from Africa, west Asia, and Europe. It was first
found in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York City. Since
then West Nile Virus has spread down the eastern seaboard of the United
States and to Midwestern and Gulf states. With the addition of North
Carolina, 20 states and the District of Columbia have now reported evidence
of the virus. The other states are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,
Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island and Virginia. [According to the latest MMWR Report (see: West Nile
virus surveillance - USA (27) 20011018.2565, a total of 3695 crows and 1349
other birds with WNV infection have been reported now from 25 states and the
District of Columbia as of 16 Oct 2001. - Mod.CP
Any decision to spray for mosquitoes will be made by local health officials
based upon a number of factors including whether the area of concern is
densely populated and weather patterns. Experts with the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources' Public Health Pest Management Section
will collect and test mosquitoes and wild birds in the area to look for
further evidence of the virus. Surveillance for the presence of West Nile
Virus in the rest of the state through mosquito and dead bird collection and
testing will continue.
