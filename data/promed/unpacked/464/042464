[In ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human (30): Viet Nam 20090207.0557",
the 2nd confirmed case of human avian A/H5N1 influenza was described as a
male patient. Several other reports which have now appeared describe the
patient as a female and rank the case as suspected only. One of these
reports is reproduced below. - Mod.CP]

A 23 year old woman is suspected of contracting the H5N1 strain of bird flu
after suffering severe respiratory problems in northern Quang Ninh Province
on Saturday [7 Feb 2009], health officials said. The woman of Quang Ninh
Dam Ha District was admitted to the Quang Ninh General Hospital on Tuesday
[3 Feb 2009] with high fever, low blood pressure, and severe respiratory
problems, doctors said.

But doctors reported they were unable to conclude whether she had been
infected with the H5N1 virus. One test showed she carried it, but another
was negative. Health experts were dispatched on Saturday [7 Feb 2009] to
Quang Ninh to carry out further examinations. Work to disinfect Dam Ha
District also began Saturday. Quang Ninh, where the world renowned Ha Long
Bay is located, is about 150 km (93 miles) from Hanoi.

Before this latest case, an 8 year old girl in the northern province of
Thanh Hoa who fell sick after eating duck and chicken raised on her
family's farm was diagnosed with the bird flu. She has since recovered, but
her 13 year old sister died in the hospital earlier without being tested
for the virus before her burial, health officials said.

The Mekong Delta province of Ca Mau reported Saturday [7 Feb 2009] that
bird flu has spread among 4 local communes, prompting the culling of 3250
birds to contain the epidemic. The Ca Mau government also asked agencies
concerned to take further measures against the spread of the disease in the
province.

The Mekong Delta province of Soc Trang began disinfection work Saturday [7
Feb 2009] after 700 birds were recently reported to have died of the flu.

The avian flu has thus far infected poultry in 4 provinces in the country:
Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, and Soc Trang in the Mekong Delta region and Nghe An in
the north. H5N1 remains largely confined to birds, but experts fear it
could mutate into a form that is easily transmitted by humans and spark a
pandemic that could kill millions worldwide. Since 2003, Viet Nam has
recorded 52 human deaths from bird flu, the 2nd highest toll after
Indonesia, where the virus has killed 115 people.
