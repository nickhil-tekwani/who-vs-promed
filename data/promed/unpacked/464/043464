The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_) infections (listeriosis) linked to commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples. Listeria can cause a serious, life-threatening illness.

There are currently 2 cases of listeriosis in Canada with the same genetic fingerprint as seen in the US investigation (one case in Ontario, one case in Manitoba). The investigation continues to determine if these individuals consumed prepackaged caramel apples imported from the US.

The Public Health Agency of Canada and its federal partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada are investigating whether the products potentially linked to illnesses in the US may have been imported into Canada. As a precaution, the Public Health Agency of Canada is advising that Canadians do not eat commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples imported from the US until further notice. This includes plain caramel apples as well as those containing nuts, sprinkles, chocolate, or other toppings. These products could have a shelf life of one month.

Based on current information related to this investigation, the risk to Canadians is low. The Public Health Agency of Canada and its partners will notify Canadians of any increased risk to public health as new information becomes available.

The status of these [2 Canadian] individuals is not known at this time.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is working with its provincial and territorial partners to determine the source of these illnesses. At this time, it is not known whether these illnesses are linked to commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples imported from the US. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is working closely with US officials to determine if any potentially affected product may have been distributed in Canada. If products are identified, the Agency will inform the public and ensure that they are promptly removed from the marketplace.

If you have any commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apples imported from the US in your home, do not eat them. If you have a candy apple product and are unsure if it would qualify as a caramel apple, do not consume it. Secure the caramel apple in a plastic bag and throw it out. Then wash your hands thoroughly in warm soapy water. Securing it in a plastic bag will ensure that no animals consume the product from your garbage. Food contaminated with listeria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. If you suspect you have been ill from eating a commercially produced, prepackaged caramel apple, talk to your healthcare provider.

In the milder form of the disease [listeriosis], symptoms can start the following day after consuming a product with listeria. For the more serious form of the disease, the incubation period is generally much longer; on average about 21 days, but can be up to 70 days after exposure. Listeriosis can be treated with antibiotics, but early diagnosis is key, especially for people at high risk, such as pregnant women, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.

The Public Health Agency of Canada, in collaboration with federal, provincial and territorial partners, will continue to monitor for and investigate any new cases of [listeriosis] that may be related to this outbreak as part of its routine surveillance activities.

A Missouri company is recalling packaged caramel apples that may be linked to a [listeriosis] outbreak that has hospitalized 29 people and killed at least 3 in 10 states. Happy Apples of Washington, Missouri, recalled caramel apples carrying a best-use date between [25 Aug 2014] and [23 Nov 2014] that were sold in grocery, discount, and club stores in packs of one, 3, 4, and 8. In a statement issued on Wednesday [24 Dec 1024], the company said an apple supplier, Bidart Brothers, had notified it that "there may be a connection between this outbreak and the apples that they supplied" to a Happy Apples facility in California.

On Friday [19 Dec 2014], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned consumers to stop eating prepackaged caramel apples while it investigated the outbreak [due to] _Listeria monocytogenes_, a bacterium that causes the rare but sometimes fatal infection [listeriosis]. Older people, pregnant women, newborns, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to the pathogen. CDC said 9 of the illnesses occurred in pregnant women or newborns. 3 people have come down with meningitis.

In 2011, listeria in cantaloupes killed 33 people and sickened 147 in 28 states, according to CDC. In the current outbreak, no illnesses have been associated with uncoated apples or caramel candy, or with caramel apples that are not prepackaged, the agency said.

CDC originally linked the bacteria to 5 deaths, but the Food and Drug Administration, in an update posted on Thursday [25 Dec 2014], said only 3 deaths can be attributed to listeria. It is unclear whether a 4th death is connected to listeria, the FDA said, and the 5th was not caused by the organism.

On Monday [22 Dec 2014], Seattle food safety attorney Bill Marler filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Safeway grocery store chain over the death of 81 year old, who, Marler stated, bought a caramel apple shortly before Halloween and died [2 Dec 2014]. Listeriosis was the cause of death, according to the statement, which cited [the patient's] family. Safeway later pulled the caramel apples from its shelves.

Health officials still have not determined the location of the listeria contamination.

Happy Apples said the caramel apples were available in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin. The company ceased production of them at the end of October [2014]. They are no longer available in stores.

[A listeriosis outbreak has involved so far at least 3 deaths and 29 illnesses in 10 US states and has now been linked to eating Happy Valley Brand Caramel Apples made by the Happy Apple Company, which has manufacturing facilities are located in Orosi, California and Union, Missouri. Happy Apple Brand Caramel Apples have been sold at multiple retail, discount, and club store locations in 31 US states.

According to the 1st news report above, 2 Canadians have also developed listeriosis caused by listeria with the same genotype as a US outbreak strain. We are not told if the Canadian patients ate caramel apples while in the US or if contaminated caramel apples had been exported from the US and obtained locally in Canada. The recalled Happy Valley Caramel Apples were pre-packaged in clear, plastic containers, as a single, 3-, 4- or 8-pack. No illnesses have been associated with uncoated apples or caramel candy, or with caramel apples that are not prepackaged, according to the CDC.
