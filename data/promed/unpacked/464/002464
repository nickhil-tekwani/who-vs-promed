Chlamydia and neurological complications
---------------------------------------------------
Three species of Chlamydia have been implicated in the production of
neurological symptoms.
_Chlamydia pneumoniae_ has been reported to have caused cases of
meningitis/meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and
cerebellar ataxia, all of these on the heels of respiratory
infections. Additional serological evidence exists for central
nervous system involvement.
_Chlamydia psittaci_ is implicated in encephalitis involving several
cranial nerves. Additionally, Guillain-Barre syndrome, transverse
myelitis, and cerebellar ataxia have been associated with this
organism. Subsequent refinement of molecular techniques has
attributed a significant number of _C. psittaci_ cases to
_C. pneumoniae_.
_Chlamydia trachomatis_, most infamous for the sexually-transmitted
diseases it causes, has also been associated with meningo-
encephalitis. Such accounts are not just recent ones, but some are
from over 50 years ago. However, the advent of modern molecular
biology techniques is enabling more rapid and accurate identification
today.

Chlamydia and cardiovascular disease
---------------------------------------------
The link between _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ and at least a portion of
cardiovascular disease is likely to be as striking as was the
infectious link to ulcers. Cardiovascular disease has generally been
viewed as a "lifestyle disease," one associated with diet and
sedentary living. From several places around the globe, evidence
exists that antibodies to _C. pneumoniae_ occur at higher levels than
expected in coronary artery disease and heart attack patients.
Additionally, _C. pneumoniae_ has been isolated from diseased
coronary arteries.
Animal studies indicate that deliberate infection of test animals
result in the production of atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover,
antibiotic therapy prevents atherosclerosis in test animals. Normal
arteries fail to yield _C. pneumoniae_ upon sampling.
Chlamydia is an obligate intracelluar parasite and by its nature
potentially typifies the difficulty of providing unambiguous evidence
for its role in cardiovascular disease. A few responses I received
described some of the problems in Chlamydia testing. Due to its
intracellular chronic behavior, often amplification of genome
fractions is required by PCR. Failure to find _C. pneumoniae_ DNA
does not necessarily mean the organism is absent. Its antigen could
well be present. A few respondents mentioned the need for a "gold
standard" in Chlamydia detection. One test, the microimmuno-
fluoresence (MIF) test, was suggested for consideration.
These comments are not to minimize the link between _C. pneumoniae_
and cardiovascular disease. Rather, they are evidence of the process
of science.
