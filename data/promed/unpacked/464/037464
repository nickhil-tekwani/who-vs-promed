Iris yellow spot virus in onion bulb and seed crops in Washington

D-2003-1201-03N, 2004. Accepted for publication 30 Oct 2003.
The geographic distribution of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV, genus
Tospovirus, family Bunyaviridae) in onion (_Allium cepa_ L.) crops in the
western United States has increased with the most recent report in Colorado
(1,2). Furthermore, the incidence of IYSV has increased significantly in
onion crops in the Treasure Valley of southern Idaho and eastern Oregon,
where the disease was first detected in the United States (1,3).
Surveys of onion seed crops in Washington during the past 2 years showed
the presence of plants with symptoms characteristic of IYSV infection,
including distinct diamond-shaped chlorotic or necrotic lesions, as well as
indistinct circular to irregular, chlorotic or necrotic lesions of various
sizes on the scapes of flowering plants. To date, symptomatic plants have
been observed in 5 seed crops in Washington, at incidences ranging from 1
per cent to about 20 per cent in individual seed crops.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays carried out directly on symptomatic
onion samples collected in July 2002, and on _Nicotiana benthamiana_ plants
mechanically inoculated with sap from these symptomatic plants, did not
detect the presence of IYSV. In late July 2003, symptomatic plants were
collected from an onion seed crop in Grant County and tested for IYSV
infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Total nucleic acid was extracted from symptomatic areas of the scapes with
the procedure described by Presting and colleagues (4).
Primers specific to the nucleocapsid (NP) gene of IYSV were designed based
on sequences in GenBank: 5'-TCA GAA ATC GAG AAA CTT-3' and 5'-TAA TTA TAT
CTA TCT TTC TTG G-3' (sense and antisense polarity, respectively). The
RT-PCR assay produced an amplicon of the expected size (about 700 bp) that
was cloned and sequenced. Comparison with the GenBank IYSV gene sequences
showed 98 per cent sequence identity of the NP gene.
In August 2003, symptoms of IYSV infection were observed in 2 onion bulb
crops, each located within 2 miles of the symptomatic onion seed crop in
Grant County. The presence of IYSV in these crops was confirmed by RT-PCR
with cloning and sequencing of the amplicon, as described for the seed crop
samples.
To our knowledge, this is the first confirmation of IYSV in onion bulb and
seed crops in Washington, where 16 000 to 18 000 acres of onion bulb crops
and 700 to 900 acres of onion seed crops are grown annually (USDA National
Agricultural Statistics Service). The increase in prevalence of IYSV in the
Pacific north west highlights the need for additional research to clarify
the epidemiology of this potentially significant pathogen and to develop a
regional management program for iris yellow spot.

[In addition to infected onion crops in Washington and Colorado, IYSV is
present in Brazil, Iran, Israel, the Netherlands, and Slovenia. IYSV has
been endemic in south western Idaho and eastern Oregon onion, leek, and
chive seed production fields for over 10 years. It has also been detected
in onion seed plants from California and Arizona. The virus is vectored by
onion thrips (_Thrips tabaci_) but not by western flower thrips
(_Frankliniella occidentalis_), which are an efficient vector of the virus.
Although there is no cure, diseased plants can still produce reasonable
yields through irrigation and good soil fertility. Not much is known about
resistance to IYSV in onion.
