Anthrax vaccine production to end - Michigan, USA (03) (not yet archived]
According to Travel Immunizations by Shoreland, Inc. 1997, Edition 4, in the
Accelerated Immunization Schedules, Staff Reference, page 2, "For travelers
departing immediately who need both immediate and long-term protection, or
for persons requiring postexposure prophylaxis, hepatitis A vaccine may be
given simultaneously with IG" and "Persons traveling to high risk areas less
than 4 weeks after the first dose of hepatitis A vaccine should also be given
IG".
In my experience, the travel clinics still recommend IG to people who will
not travel frequently or who will travel to a high-risk area sooner than the
hepatitis A vaccine will be effective.
