A rare infection resulting from a dog bite cost an Ottawa woman her left arm and both legs, a Canadian newspaper said on Mon 22 Jul 2013.

The 49 year old was reportedly playing tug-o-war with her 3 year old Shih Tzu, when the dog accidentally "nicked" one of her knuckles while attempting to get a better grip on the rope. Her 3 other dogs came over and licked the wound. "It didn't seem like a big deal," she told the daily Ottawa Citizen.

Days later, she fell into a coma, and when she awoke in hospital 6 weeks later, doctors told her they would have to amputate 3 of her limbs after the infection spread.

The _Capnocytophaga canimorsus_ bacterium responsible for the infection is commonly found in dog [and cat. - Mod.LL] saliva but rarely leads to infection in humans. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, only 200 human cases have been reported worldwide since 1976.

[This organism is not a rare cause of human infections associated with dog bites but is not generally reported in the literature unless the infection is severe and because the organism is often found in mixed culture and can be difficult to identify. The medical literature emphasizes that the infection is much more severe in immune incompetent hosts including those with functional or anatomic asplenia [absence of a spleen] (Lutwick LI. Infections in the asplenic patient. In: Mandell, Douglas and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases, GL Mandell, JE Bennett, R Dolin (editors) 7th edition. Philadelphia PA: WS Saunders, 2010, pp 3865-3874.). Like this case, however, reports of severe bacteremia with vascular injury leading to the need for amputation are not unheard of, such as:

3. Australia (Victoria) 2007 http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/57/7/901.full. - Mod.LL
