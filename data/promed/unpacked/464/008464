The rapid spread of West Nile Virus across North America, most likely due
to the influx of migratory birds, begs a couple of questions:
1) Do we know which migratory birds are bringing the virus in?
2) If we know which birds, can we determine their point of origin?
3) If so, is there a WNV outbreak at the birds' migratory point of origin
in humans or other animals there?

[If any informed ornithologist can answer these questions it would be
appreciated. For myself, the recent CA case, which lacks any local avian or
equine isolates, near LAX airport confirms my belief that the present east
to west WNV movement has been largely through mosquitoes in container
traffic. Everyone talks about migrating birds, but they don't migrate east
to west, but north to south or vice versa, in season. The only latitudinal
movement will be to and from roosting to feeding sites and back each day.
Come the fall we will see bird migration, and their return in the spring.
It will be interesting to know which migrating species carry the virus and
the circumstances allowing this. - Mod.MHJ]
