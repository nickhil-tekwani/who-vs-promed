Dead freshwater crocodiles in Australia's Northern Territory were
once a rare sight. But since 2005, locals have witnessed mass
die-offs. Researchers now say the toxic and invasive cane toad (_Bufo
marinus_) is to blame.

Two surveys, in 2005 and 2007, suggested that the mass croc deaths
have progressively moved inland from the mouth of Victoria River, at a
pace that matches that of the cane toad invasion. The toads secrete a
milky-white toxin from glands behind their eyes and on their backs
which is lethal to many predators.

Mike Letnic of the University of Sydney and his team say a massive 77
percent of some populations of freshwater crocodiles -- or "freshies"
-- have died since 2005.

The numbers are particularly worrying, says Letnic, because removing
top predators like freshwater crocodiles (_Crocodylus johnstoni_) can
boost the number of their prey and trigger a cascade of ecosystem
changes that are difficult to predict.

Pest out of control
-------------------
Cane toads were introduced to Queensland in northeast Australia in
1935 to combat the cane beetle, a sugar cane pest, and have been
steadily marching westward across the continent since.

They are now considered invasive pests in their own right: they have
decimated populations of Australian monitor lizards and certain
species of snakes.

To try and understand the damage the toads are inflicting, Letnic and
his colleagues surveyed crocodiles in 4 regions of the Victoria River
in the Northern Territory.

Crocodile sightings in the Victoria River Gorge region, where the
invasion began, dropped from 156 to 49 between 2005 and 2007. The
toads moved upriver from the gorge, reaching the Longreach Lagoon
region in 2007. There, sightings dropped by 15 percent compared to
2005.

"We expected this. We first heard reports of dead freshies from
helicopter pilots flying over rivers in the Gulf of Carpentaria [east
of the Victoria River] where cane toad had invaded," says Grahame
Webb, director of Wildlife Management International in Darwin.

Wave of death
-------------
Proving a causal link between cane toads and crocodile deaths is
tricky, in part because crocs rapidly digest amphibians, so traces
are rarely found. But Letnic says the "wave of death" has moved
upstream with the toads, strongly suggesting the toads are the cause
of the dropping crocodile numbers.

Letnic's team is continuing the surveys. They say the freshies and
cane toads are often seen in close proximity to each other. This is
likely to be all the more true in dryer regions like the semi-arid
upper reaches of the Victoria River where the 2 species are forced to
share water holes, says Letnic.

If true, cane toads could pose an even greater threat to native
species as they move south into the dry interior of Australia and the
need for water brings them into close proximity.

The researchers say in the long term, the high death rate may
naturally select for crocodiles that have a higher tolerance to the
toad toxin. This has been seen to happen in some blacksnake
populations that have also been hit hard by the cane toads.

In the meantime, however, the toxin appears more lethal to younger
crocs, suggesting that the reproductive rate of the populations could
take a big plunge.

[Bufo toads produce a cardiac toxin and a neuron toxin. Dogs and cats
salivate profusely when they have encountered these amphibians.
Generally they spit the toad out but washing the mouth out may be
helpful.

The freshies may be absorbing the toxin transdermally or through
ingestion. We will be interested in any follow up reports. - Mod.TG

Chytridiomycosis, a fatal fungal disease, has been reported from the
cane toad (see ProMED ref. below), but cannot be used for biological
control because it is deadly to all frog & toad species. - Mod.JW.
