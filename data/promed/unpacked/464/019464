On Wed 6 Jul 2011, the Regional Health Agency (ARS) said 4 new
patients, including a baby in a coma, who have the same symptoms as
those hospitalized in recent weeks after an _Escherichia coli_
infection, were admitted between Monday [4 Jul 2011] and Tuesday [5
Jul 2011] at the University Hospital in Lille.

The baby, aged 20 to 30 months, was admitted to the ICU of the
hospital on a ventilator and dialysis, said the ARS
Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The other 3 cases, including 2 belonging to the
same family, were also reported on 4 and 5 Jul 2011, according to the
ARS, indicating that the food and microbiological investigations are
under way to determine whether this is an infection by the bacterium
_E. coli_.

Previously, between 14 Jun and 1 Jul 2011, 9 cases of hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), in children aged 12 months to 8 years who had
consumed frozen hamburgers in the days before the symptoms appeared
have been reported by the Lille University Hospital, according to ARS.
Among the initial cases, a child aged 2 years and a native of Oise
[department] is still in a coma, mechanical ventilation, according to
ARS.

Of the cases hospitalized with bloody diarrhea and renal failure 8
had the same _E. coli_ strain 0157, different from the bacterial
strain O104:H4 which has caused 50 deaths, including 48 in Germany. 7
of these patients consumed ground beef of the brand Steaks Country,
distributed by Lidl stores.

The 1st death from _E. coli_ in France was reported on Friday night
[1 Jul 2011]: in Bordeaux, a 78 year old woman died, but she was
infected with neither the O157 nor the O104 strains but a different
strain of _E. coli_, O145.

[2] Review of French O157 outbreak

On 14 Jun 2011, the pediatric nephrology service of the Lille
Regional University Hospital (CHRU) and the pediatrics department of
the Douai Hospital reported to the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (INVS)
[Sanitary Surveillance Institute] and ARS [Regional Health Agency] of
Nord-Pas-de-Calais 5 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that
occurred in mid-June 2011 in children residing in this northern
department.

The results of epidemiological, microbiological, and veterinarian
investigations show that this cluster of HUS cases was linked to the
consumption of Steaks Country hamburgers sold in Lidl stores.

In total, between 14 Jun 2011 and 1 Jul 2011, 9 cases of HUS for
which a food survey among the parents revealed the consumption of
frozen hamburgers in the days before the symptoms were reported by the
Lille University Hospital. For 7 of them, the burgers consumed were
purchased frozen and were of the Steaks Country brand distributed by
Lidl. The last case was admitted at Lille CHRU on 1 Jul 2011.

The 9 cases of HUS are children aged 12 months to 8 years. 8 children
reside in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and one in Picardie. The dates of
onset of symptoms (bloody diarrhea) of 9 children are distributed
between 6 and 27 Jun 2011. To date, 4 children are still
hospitalized.

The microbiology laboratory of the Lille University Hospital and the
2 reference laboratories (National Reference Center for _E. coli_ and
_Shigella_: Institute Pasteur, Paris and microbiology laboratory of
the Robert Debre, Paris) analysis showed that 8 cases of HUS were
infected with STEC belonging to serogroup O157. In 3 cases, strains
with similar characteristics were isolated but results are not
available yet.

Ground beef samples taken from the freezers of families of the cases
were analyzed at the National Reference Laboratory for _E. coli_ (NRL)
(Food Microbiology Laboratory of the National Veterinary School (ENV)
of Lyon) and _E. coli_ O157 was also found.

The results of back tracing conducted by the Directorate General for
Food (DGAL), show that the Lidl stores sold hamburgers produced by the
manufacturer of the suspect lot (with a use-by date of 11 May 2012):
59, 62, 76, 22, 29, 35, 56, 45, 58, 60, 72, 75, 77, 78, 25, 51, 52,
54, 55, 57, 70. The bulk of the suspect lot (83 per cent) was marketed
in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region.
