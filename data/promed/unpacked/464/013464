On 15 Dec 2011, a KPC [_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase-producing] microorganism was detected for the 1st time at the Hospital Celso Ramos, in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina state, in a patient with a urinary tract infection who had been [transferred] from another hospital in the region. As of 15 Feb 2012, 6 additional patients have been identified [with infections due to KPC-producing organisms]: 2 patients with bloodstream, 1 with surgical wound, 1 with respiratory, and 2 with urinary infections. Another 6 patients had colonization detected in fecal samples. Of the 13 patients, 5 died, 2 were discharged, and 6 remain hospitalized.

The isolates were susceptible to polymyxin and amikacin and showed intermediate susceptibility to tigecycline. Of the 13 patients, 9 were hospitalized in the surgical intensive and semi-intensive care units. Standard control measures for infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria were adopted: contact precautions until discharge for all [culture-]positive cases; an attempt to cohort employees; a separate intensive care unit for [culture-]positive cases and [culture-]negative cases; daily baths with chlorhexidine; education/training of medical and non-medical personnel; early hospital discharge; avoidance of invasive procedures such as bladder catheterization, endotracheal intubation, or deep venous catheterization, or remove these catheters as soon as possible; weekly rectal surveillance cultures in all patients in wards where there have been cases; closure of elective surgery areas for 10 days for cleaning of the environment; disposal of materials that are not for single-use; and surveillance cultures of sinks, stethoscopes, and employees. The infection control service continues to monitor the outbreak.

[KPC [_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase] is a beta-lactamase that degrades and thereby confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli.

There are several distinct carbapenemases, which fall into molecular classes, A, B, C, and D. Classes A, C, and D have serine at the active site and class B, zinc at the active site. KPCs are class A carbapenemases; IMP (imipenemase), NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1), and VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase) are class B carbapenemases; and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing) are class D carbapenemases.

KPCs (such as, KPC-1, _2, _3, and _4) are plasmid-encoded enzymes first found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name). Subsequently, KPCs have been found in other organisms, including _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. KPCs hydrolyze all beta-lactam antibiotics, that is, all penicillins, cephalosporins (including extended spectrum cephalosporins such as cefepime and ceftriaxone), and aztreonam, in addition to the carbapenems. The gene encoding KPC is frequently associated with other resistant genes (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones). KPC are now commonly encountered in the United States, and have also been reported in France, Colombia, Israel, China, and Brazil (Rio and Sao Paulo) (Andrade LN, Curiao T, Ferreira JC, et al: Dissemination of blaKPC-2 by the spread of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ clonal complex 258 clones (ST258, ST11, ST437) and plasmids (IncFII, IncN, IncL/M) among Enterobacteriaceae species in Brazil. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2011; 55(7): 3579-83; available at http://aac.asm.org/content/55/7/3579.long).

The report above from Dr Valter Araujo indicates that KPCs have now spread to the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina.

Patients at risk of infections caused by KPC-producing microorganisms include those with prolonged hospitalization, particularly in intensive care units, those who are critically ill and exposed to invasive devices (such as, ventilators or central venous catheters), and those receiving long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Infections caused by KPC-producing microorganisms are associated with increased cost and high rates of morbidity and mortality, and they are difficult to treat as these microorganisms are resistant to almost all available antimicrobial agents. Often these organisms are only susceptible to tigecycline and colistin.

These organisms are easy to transfer from patient to patient. Hand hygiene is key to prevent the spread of this KPC-producing organism and any other multi-drug resistant microorganism. Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of carbapenemase-producing isolates include their rapid recognition by the clinical microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance testing among high-risk patients (CDC: Guidance for control of infections with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58(10): 256-60; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm).
