Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture (MEWA) has suspended imports of livestock from Sudan and Djibouti following a bulletin issued by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) showing the emergence of the Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Sudan.

Meanwhile, a consignment from Djibouti was rejected by the quarantine department after testing positive for RVF antibodies.

MEWA, in the interest of protecting the public health, has stepped up quarantine measures against the disease, warned all veterinary teams and raised animal disease alert to the highest level, and upped community awareness about the disease. It reported that there was immediate coordination with OIE, the Ministry of Health, the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Saudi CDC), and neighboring countries to assess the current status.

MEWA called on all livestock breeders to report suspected infectious cases at 8002470000.

Bahrain announced that the kingdom will suspend imports of livestock and meat from the Republic of Sudan and Djibouti following the announcement of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) of the emergence of cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF).

This step came in line with the suspension of Saudi Arabia's imports when positive samples were found in one of the consignments, which were refused entry.

Dr. Khalid Ahmed, undersecretary of animal resources at the Ministry of Works, Municipalities Affairs and Urban Planning, announced that the precautionary measures at the veterinary quarantine are taken to ensure the safety of meat consignments entering Bahrain.

He stressed that the Livestock Agency gives high priority to the safety of meat imports of the utmost importance of its responsibilities ensuring the safety of citizens and residents.

[3] Egypt's concerns

Sudan's announcement of outbreaks of "Rift Valley fever" in some states of Sudan has raised serious concerns in neighboring countries that import live cattle from Sudan and raised alertness among quarantine and control agencies in Egypt for fear of transmission of the disease, which resulted in a disaster in 1977 [in Egypt].

Dr. Ibrahim El-Bendary, (formerly) director of preventive medicine at the Egyptian Veterinary Services Authority (formerly) told Sputnik that since Egypt started importing cattle from Sudan, the disease has spread to us in 1977. It was 1st reported in the southernmost province of Aswan and caused significant losses in livestock. At the time, it was equivalent to 82 million pounds, and there were cases of human deaths and injuries, where the injuries amounted to 18 000 cases, while the number of deaths was about 518. The disease is transmitted between humans and animals through mosquitoes and insects, and symptoms of the disease appear in the animal in 2 forms, namely abortions and, in the most severe form, the death of young animals.

Dr. Youssef Mamdouh, (formerly) head of the Central Reservation Department in the Veterinary Services, told Sputnik that when RVF emerges in any of the countries from which live livestock are imported, the animals should be quarantined, sampled, subsequently vaccinated, and kept for 3 weeks before being sent to their destination. He told Sputnik that in 2009 Egypt stopped importing livestock from Sudan because of the emergence of the disease. All quarantine procedures are to be applied in the territory of the exporting country, not in the importing country. It affects all types of livestock, including camels.

The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation announced that all precautionary measures were taken after the media circulated on the suspicion of cases of Rift Valley cattle disease in the northeastern areas of Sudan, which caused the death and stress of some cattle.

[4] Sudan discontinues exports of livestock

The newly appointed minister of Animal Resources, Alam al-Din Abdalla, on Wednesday [16 Oct 2019] named an urgent committee to probe into emergence of water-related diseases on animals and man. "We've banned export of livestock until newly emerged cases of Rift Valley fever are handled," the minister said in statements.

The ministry's undersecretary, according to SUNA [Sudan News Agency], pointed to some Rift Valley cases in Red Sea and River Nile states estimated at 10-15 heads of goats, confirming that all these cases have been dealt with in collaboration with World Health Organization-Animal.

[Sudan is a major exporter of live animals, mainly sheep and goats (Ref 1). In 2017, this export's value was more than USD 476 million; most of the export is destined for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. There is also export of camels, most of them going on the hoof to Egypt and Libya.

The transparency exercised during the current event by Sudan's Ministry of Health and the decision of the Agriculture Ministry to temporarily discontinue animal exports has, not surprisingly, met opposition, mainly by the economically involved parties (https://www.assayha.net/now/archives/18575/18575, in Arabic). The export-ban decision may, in the long run, positively contribute to the maintenance of uninterrupted exports, provided measures, in particular control upon intranational animal movements, and preventive mass vaccinations in hitherto not-infected regions, are undertaken at the earliest while consignments are certified in line with OIE's prescribed requirements.

FAO has advised veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in Sudan, South Sudan, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. Egypt, Libya, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, as well as Saudi Arabia and Yemen are also considered at risk of occurrence. The Egyptian 1977 disastrous RVF event should be kept in mind; it demonstrated how RVF-virgin regions may get infected when the virus is introduced, most probably by viraemic animals, into ecologically "receptive" regions when suitable environmental conditions for the RVF vector amplification prevail.
