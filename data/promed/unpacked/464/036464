One of every 5 New York City residents tested positive for antibodies to the coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], according to preliminary results described by Gov Andrew M Cuomo on Thursday [23 Apr 2020] that suggested that the virus had spread far more widely than known. If the pattern holds, the results from random testing of 3000 people raised the tantalizing prospect that many New Yorkers -- as many as 2.7 million, the governor said -- who never knew they had been infected had already encountered the virus, and survived. Mr Cuomo also said that such wide infection might mean that the death rate was far lower than believed.

While the reliability of some early antibody tests has been widely questioned, researchers in New York have worked in recent weeks to develop and validate their own antibody tests, with federal approval. State officials believe that accurate antibody testing is seen as a critical tool to help determine when and how to begin restarting the economy, and sending people back to work. "The testing also can tell you the infection rate in the population -- where it's higher, where it's lower -- to inform you on a reopening strategy," Mr Cuomo said. "Then when you start reopening, you can watch that infection rate to see if it's going up and if it's going up, slow down."

The testing in New York is among several efforts by public health officials around the country to determine how many people may have been already exposed to the virus, beyond those who have tested positive. The results appear to conform with research from Northeastern University that indicated that the coronavirus was circulating by early February [2020] in the New York area and other major cities.

In California, a pair of studies using antibody testing found rates of exposure as high as 4 percent in Santa Clara County and 5 percent in Los Angeles County -- higher than those indicated by infection tests, though not nearly as high as found in New York. Public health officials recently disclosed that a woman in Santa Clara who died on [6 Feb 2020] was infected with the virus.

In New York City, about 21 percent tested positive for coronavirus antibodies during the state survey. The rate was about 17 percent on Long Island, nearly 12 percent in Westchester and Rockland Counties and less than 4 percent in the rest of the state. State researchers sampled blood from the approximately 3000 people they had tested over 2 days, including about 1300 in New York City, at grocery and big-box stores. The results were sent to the state's Wadsworth facility in Albany, a respected public health lab.

Dr Howard A Zucker, the state health commissioner, said the lab had set a high bar for determining positive results, that it had been given blanket approval to develop coronavirus tests by the Food and Drug Administration and that state officials discussed this particular antibody test with the agency. He said that while concerns about some tests on the market were valid, the state's test was reliable enough to determine immunity -- and, possibly, send people back to the office. "It is a way to say this person had the disease and they can go back into the work force," Dr Zucker said. "A strong test like we have can tell you that you have antibodies." But he cautioned that the length of any such immunity remained unknown. "The amount of time, we need to see. We don't know that yet," he said, adding, "They will last a while."

Unlike so-called diagnostic tests, which determine whether someone is infected, often using nasal swabs, blood tests for COVID-19 antibodies are intended to reveal whether a person was previously exposed and has developed an immune response. Some tests also measure the amount of antibodies present.

Hours before Mr Cuomo's presentation, a top health official in New York City expressed general skepticism about the utility of antibody tests -- especially those on the private market -- when it comes to questions of immunity and critical decisions over social distancing and reopening the economy. Dr Demetre C. Daskalakis, the city's top official for disease control, wrote in an email alert on Wednesday [22 Apr 2020] that such tests "may produce false negative or false positive results," pointing to "significant voids" in using the science to pinpoint immunity. The alert, sent to medical providers and other subscribers, went on to warn that the consequences of relying on potentially false results may lead to "providing patients incorrect guidance on preventive interventions like physical distancing or protective equipment." Patrick Gallahue, a spokesman for the city health department, said the alert referred to "unvetted tests outside of a lab setting -- which is not what the state is doing." He added that there "isn't any daylight here" between the city and state.

Dr Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, praised the overall intent of New York's study, but said the results in this case probably skew to a higher estimate than is real because a survey of grocery store shoppers in a pandemic would not be representative. The sampling may disproportionately include those who have either already had the illness, or those who naturally tend to go out more and so are more likely to be exposed to the virus, he said. It would miss children, teenagers, and older adults who may be sheltering in place. "It's not a criticism. It's more of a comment that we have to be careful about interpreting supermarket customers as a representative sample when the state was in lockdown," he said.

State officials said the test had been calibrated to err on the side of producing false negatives -- to miss some who may have antibodies -- rather than false positives, which would suggest a person had coronavirus antibodies when they did not. Health experts have worried that if tests return high rates of false positives, they could encourage people to abandon protective measures and risk worsening the virus's spread. Others warn that the true value of coronavirus antibodies is still unknown.

The World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, recommends that antibody testing be used only in research settings, and not to make medical decisions such as to permit an individual to return to work. States and the federal government are not bound by the organization's advice. "I'm very ambivalent about these tests, because we don't really know yet through the science what it means to have an antibody," said Dr Joan Cangiarella, the vice-chair of clinical operations at NYU Langone Health's pathology department. "We are hoping these antibodies mean you will be immune for some time," she said. "But I don't think the data is fully out there to understand if that means that you're actually immune. And if these antibodies start to decline, what's that time frame? Does it decline in a year from now?" Mr Cuomo on Thursday [23 Apr 2020] did not talk about any potential for immunity among those previously infected.

But he did suggest, based on the survey, that if as many as 2.7 million New Yorkers had the virus, the death rate in New York from COVID-19 would most likely be far lower than previously believed, possibly 0.5 percent of those infected.

More than 15 000 people have died of the virus in the state, a figure that does not include an additional 5000 people in New York City who were never tested but were presumed to have died from the disease.

The number of deaths has been increasing less quickly, and new hospital admissions for the coronavirus have remained relatively flat over the past 3 days: about 1350 patients per day, down from over 2000 per day last week. More than 263 000 have tested positive for infection.

Mr Cuomo said antibody testing results, along with hospitalization numbers, would influence the state's reopening strategy, noting that the number of people being hospitalized was still too high to consider easing restrictions. The state's plan would involve tracking infections as restrictions are loosened on gatherings and businesses. Antibody testing would be used, Mr Cuomo said, for identifying coronavirus survivors who can donate convalescent plasma -- the part of the blood that contains antibodies. Doctors at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York and elsewhere have been testing this use of plasma for treating patients with the virus.

After the city's alert appeared on Wednesday night [22 Ap 2020] , the Greater New York Hospital Association, a powerful group with close ties to the governor, sent its own message to its member hospitals, suggesting that the city's warning was overblown and highlighting how it differed from the state Health Department's approach. Susan C Waltman, the association's general counsel, said the tests are valuable for the information they can provide about the virus, and contrasted the city's "absolute, rather dismissive terms" with what she described as an approach from the state that "tries to put the test results in perspective."

Last week [week of 13 Apr 2020], Ms Waltman, state health officials, and a group of senior doctors from 10 major academic and medical institutions across the state submitted a report to state health officials about how to roll out antibody testing. The discussions were led by Dr James Crawford, Northwell Health's senior vice president for laboratory services. Dr Crawford said in an interview that as of this week, the state's major medical institutions estimated that they could perform between 5000 and 10 000 antibody tests per day. They expect to increase that number significantly in the coming weeks and months, he said.

Dr Crawford said there was a "pressing need to have both parts of the equation -- who has the virus and who has mounted an immune response," but he cautioned against using antibody testing as a criterion to allow people into the world. "To use it as a fulcrum for when someone can travel or work," he said, "I think we have to be extremely careful as a society in doing that."

[More information is needed on the exact sampling methodology used as well as the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test that was developed by the state laboratory. The results are the highest seropositivity rates of the studies performed to date, and it is staggering to think that as many as 20% of the population in New York City may have been infected already. The ethnic distribution is also curious, supporting racial disparities in infection rates previously discussed. Missing in the data now is the demographic profile of all subjects tested. I look forward to seeing the full data presentation when it is available - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 23 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has launched a GOARN COVID-19 Knowledge hub. The hub is designed as a central repository of quality public health information, guidance, tools, and webinars which can be accessed freely at any point (https://extranet.who.int/goarn/).

- WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing yesterday, cautioned that "we have a long way to go. This virus will be with us for a long time." He added that "the world cannot go back to the way things were. There must be a "new normal" -- a world that is healthier, safer, and better prepared." His speech can be found at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19--22-april-2020.

- WHO has published guidance 'Addressing Human Rights as Key to the COVID-19 Response'. The guidance document highlights the importance of integrating a human rights-based approach into the COVID-19 response and highlights key considerations in relation to addressing stigma and discrimination, prevention of violence against women, support for vulnerable populations, quarantine and restrictive measures, and shortages of supplies and equipment (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/addressing-human-rights-as-key-to-the-covid-19-response).

- All available evidence for COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic source. Many researchers have been able to look at the genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 and have found that evidence does not support that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct. A constructed virus would show a mix of known elements within genomic sequences -- this is not the case. For more details, please see 'subject in focus'.

Subject in focus: Origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st human cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, subsequently named SARS-CoV-2 were first reported by officials in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Retrospective investigations by Chinese authorities have identified human cases with onset of symptoms in early December 2019. While some of the earliest known cases had a link to a wholesale food market in Wuhan, some did not. Many of the initial patients were either stall owners, market employees, or regular visitors to this market. Environmental samples taken from this market in December 2019 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, further suggesting that the market in Wuhan City was the source of this outbreak or played a role in the initial amplification of the outbreak. The market was closed on 1 Jan 2020.

SARS-CoV-2 was identified in early January and its genetic sequence shared publicly on [11-12 Jan 2020]. The full genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the early human cases and the sequences of many other viruses isolated from human cases from China and all over the world since then show that SARS-CoV-2 has an ecological origin in bat populations. All available evidence to date suggests that the virus has a natural animal origin and is not a manipulated or constructed virus. Many researchers have been able to look at the genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 and have found that evidence does not support that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct. If it were a constructed virus, its genomic sequence would show a mix of known elements. This is not the case.

Another coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, the cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, was also closely related to other coronaviruses isolated from bats. These close genetic relations of SARS-CoV-1, SARSCoV-2, and other coronaviruses, suggest that they all have their ecological origin in bat populations. Many of these coronaviruses can also infect several animal species. For example, SARS-CoV-1 infected civet cats and then humans, while the virus causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is found in dromedary camels, and has continued to infect humans since 2012.

All available evidence for COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic source. Since there is usually limited close contact between humans and bats, it is more likely that transmission of the virus to humans happened through another animal species, one that is more likely to be handled by humans. This intermediate animal host or zoonotic source could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.

All the published genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human cases are very similar. This suggests that the start of the outbreak resulted from a single point introduction in the human population around the time that the virus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China in December 2019. A number of investigations to better understand the source of the outbreak in China are currently underway or planned, including investigations of human cases with symptom onset in and around Wuhan in late 2019, environmental sampling from markets and farms in areas where the 1st human cases were identified, and detailed records on the source and type of wildlife species and farmed animals sold in these markets. Results from these studies are essential to preventing further zoonotic introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the human population. WHO continues to collaborate with animal health and human health experts, Member States, and other partners to identify gaps and research priorities for the control of COVID-19, including the eventual identification of the source of the virus in China.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
The Americas region reported 32 111 new cases (43.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 3038 deaths (45.4% of the global newly reported deaths). Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 74.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 7.8% and Canada at 4.8%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 30.9% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 19.1%, Peru at 18.7% and Mexico at 9.0%..

The European region reported 31 972 new cases (43.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 3383 deaths (50.6% of the global newly reported deaths). Russia reported 14.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 13.9%, Spain 13.2%, Italy 10.5%, and Turkey 9.6%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5101 new cases (6.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 143 deaths (2.1% of the global newly reported deaths). Iran reported 1194 new cases representing 23.4% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia at 22.3%, Pakistan at 15.0%, Qatar 11.9%, and the United Arab Emirates at 9.5%.

The African region reported 714 new cases (0.97% of the global newly reported cases) and 28 deaths (0.42% of the global newly reported deaths). there were 20 countries reporting no cases in this 24 hour period. That being said, South Africa reported 23.8%% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana at 15.7%, Algeria at 13.9%, and Guinea at 10.2%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1632 new cases (2.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 25 deaths (0.37% of the global newly reported deaths). Singapore reported 62.3% of the newly reported cases, followed by Japan at 25.9%, and the Philippines at 6.8%. Given the high proportion of cases reported by Singapore, removing Singapore from the denominator, Japan represents 68.7% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by the Philippines at 18.0, and Malaysia at 8.1%.

The South East Asia region reported 2127 new cases (2.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 71 deaths (1.1% of the global newly reported deaths). India reported 66.2% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 18.3% and Indonesia at 13.3%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 54.3% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 39.4%, Sri Lanka 2.8%, and Thailand 1.8%.

Figure 4. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through (23 Apr 2020]) at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend the European region increased following the weekend but to lower levels than the prior week. The America's region does not appear to have decreased. One sees a gradual increase in the number of cases from the Africa Region. One wonders if the cases globally may have peaked near 6 Apr 2020. Time will tell.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
