Nomenclature For Structures And Functions Associated With Transmissible
Agents in Slowly Progressive Diseases: The Issues of "Infections,"
"Multiplication" And "Slow Viruses"
---------------------------------------------
A comment by Martin Haditsch [see: "BSE and other prion diseases -- really
infections?", the fourth part of the post entitled BSE update (16) April
2001 20010419.0772 poses 4 important issues related to prions and other
infectious material that are implicated in some slowly progressive diseases
and syndromes. Various investigators have struggled to elucidate underlying
issues, along with implications for logic, methodology and philosophies of
science. My perspectives are cited below (references 1-4).
The first issue pertains to the notion of infection. Standard definitions of
the verb "infect" include "to contaminate with a disease-producing substance
or agent or "to invade (an individual or organ) usually by penetration." In
view of these definitions, I see no need to introduce a new notion of
"induction", as prions clearly are infectious. Moreover, Prusiner defined
the term to include the notion of infectiousness (5). Haditsch is correct in
citing the importance of semantics (cf. 2), although the issue of public
behavior is an entirely separate matter. Science should not shirk its
responsibilities merely to assuage public opinion.
The second issue cited by Haditsch pertains to whether "multiplication,"
"replication," or other underlying processes are implicated in the
infectiousness and pathology of prions. This has been the source of
considerable debate. The contentiousness derives from a general lack of
agreement on the nature of the infectious pathogen. The terms "slow virus,"
"virino," "viroid" "autotoxin," "autovirion" and "prion" are exemplars of
perspectives proffered in those debates. There is another factor that rarely
is cited (cf. 3). Regardless of the nomenclature, the determination of
changing titers virtually always involved "end-point titration" procedures.
Neither "multiplication" nor "replication" is adequately subsumed in
underlying findings (3).
Several of my unpublished studies, when coupled with obscure and
controversial reports by Pattison et al. (cf. 6-9), pointed to possible
sources of infectious material being derived from cofactors of "self" or
"other." Empirical and theoretical evidence strongly implicated cofactors
being necessary for all transmissible agents involving slowly progressive
infectious processes, including AIDS, prion diseases, along with at least
two other under-reported possibilities (3). There was a clear need to
identify parsimonious principles and nomenclature to account for all
conceptual possibilities (cf. 3-4). The term "autotoxin" (from autotoxicity)
was introduced to subsume the category of infectious entities associated
with "self." These would include autoantigens, prions and their
doppelgangers, and other infectious entities that do not "replicate" using
classic replication schema elucidated by Watson and Crick. The term
"autovirion" (from autovirulence) was introduced to include a category of
infectious molecular complexes that occasionally included nucleic acid
substituents derived from "other" or "non-self." The latter included the
delta antigen (associated with the hepatitis B virus [HBV), snRNPs composed
of EBV-encoded RNAs (EBER I and EBER II) and some adenovirus-encoded RNAs
(VA I and VA II), and other unnamed agents (3). The term "biological
fission" (3) was introduced to distinguish between replication and
increasing titers attributable to release of aberrant cellular substituents
or other components. In prion-related diseases, the remaining challenge is
to demonstrate the precise mechanism by which prions convert their
doppelgangers to prions.
There is a third issue Haditsch does not discuss. What should be the
nomenclature for the category of transmissible agents causing slowly
progressive infectious processes? My preference is to retain the notion of
"slow viruses," though with the emphasis on the notion of slowness. After
all, there are no structural features common to lentiviruses, prions, the
delta agent, autotoxins, autovirions and possibly hepatitis C virus (HCV).
These agents are categorized by their functional behavior, with mechanisms
of slowness being associated with known or unidentified cofactors. With HIV,
the cofactors are the opportunistic pathogens. HBV is the cofactor
associated with the delta agent. Prions and their doppelgangers (with
allowances for species variations) are cofactors. The underlying semantic
issue involves infectious material allowing for broad structural
possibilities, though with slowness (generally related to a cofactor) being
the definitive and distinguishing feature.
A final issue interwoven throughout this discussion is what Haditsch calls a
"matter of semantics." It should not escape one's attention that
"autotoxicity" and "autovirulence" provide a novel perspective on autoimmune
diseases (3,10). Rather than the immune system abnormally reacting to
"self," "self" is abnormally being presented to the immune system. A second
important semantic matter pertains to diseases associated with acquired
immune dysfunction. Is "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome" an adequate
description of disease in AIDS? Is the immune system susceptible to all
pathogens? Theoretical, clinical and epidemiological data suggest otherwise;
that of acquired abnormal tolerance for nascent pathogens (3,10). The
cofactors in AIDS are nascent pathogens, not all pathogens. This subtle
semantic distinction has profound implications for research, treatment and
the pursuit of science. A probable cure in AIDS may involve multivalent
(killed) vaccines against pathogens that would be opportunistic (10,11), not
a vaccine against HIV per se. Persons previously "infected," inoculated or
vaccinated with a pathogen often retain proper immunity after exposure to
HIV.
In regards to prion-related diseases, semantic issues are equally
instructive. Various possibilities associated with "biological fission"
(involving prions and their doppelgangers) point to (natural and artificial)
cannibalism, trauma, spontaneous-induction, and a variety of other potential
"causes" of BSE, scrapie, CWD, vCJD, etc. Indeed, sources of variation in
vCJD could be associated with titer, site of infection, developmental status
and the host's age. The latter possibilities suggest entirely different
experimental strategies than are now being pursued (R.W. Smith,
unpublished).
In summary, nomenclature and semantics are central to discussions of logic,
methodology and philosophies of science pertaining to all transmissible
agents associated with slowly progressive diseases. Parsimony and
verisimilitude should provide the framework for such discussions.
