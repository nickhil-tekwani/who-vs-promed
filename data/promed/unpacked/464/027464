The New Mexico State Department of Health has confirmed plague infections
in 2 Santa Fe County cats, and the agency says several people exposed to
the sick cats will be given antibiotics to prevent them from contracting
the plague.
Plague is generally transmitted to people through the bites of infected
fleas from rodents. The disease also can be transmitted by direct contact
with infected animals -- including rodents, wildlife, and pets. Symptoms of
bubonic plague in humans include fever, swollen lymph nodes, chills and
sometimes headache, vomiting and diarrhea. Health officials urge people to
regularly use flea control products on their pets.

[Although endemic in rodent populations the western United States, Plague
is most commonly seen in 2 regions: firstly, northern New Mexico, northern
Arizona, and southern Colorado and, secondly, California, southern Oregon,
and western Nevada (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/plagwest.htm>) for a map.
When sylvatic outbreaks occur in rodent populations, domestic cats can be
infected by fleas on the rodents or by direct contact with infected rodent
tissues as they chomp on squirrels or other rodents. The incubation period
in cats may be short, a day or 2, and marked by a fever of up to 41.5 C and
lymphadenopathy. Typical buboes often occur in the head and neck, which can
be mistaken for cat fight abscesses. Dogs are considered to be less
susceptible.
The report above mentions bubonic plague, which is of zoonotic concern, as
individuals may contract disease from either infected fleas or contact with
purulent discharges or blood from the cat. An even greater threat occurs
when the disease in cats progresses to pneumonic plague. This has been
documented in cats, including transmission to veterinarians and owners.
Antibiotic treatment is effective in cats, but the threat of plague is only
one of many reasons that people should keep their pets free of fleas. - Mod.PC]
