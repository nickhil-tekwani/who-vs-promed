The United Popular Front (UPF), a coalition of eastern Sudanese factions, and activists in the Red Sea state have reported a vast spread of the hemorrhagic fever throughout the state, while the state government has renounced to report about the case.

The UPF political secretary, Daoud Mahmoud, told Radio Dabanga that hemorrhagic fever has alarmingly spread in Red Sea state, "but the state government and health authorities have imposed a blackout on the disease, which kills people in eastern Sudan on a daily basis."

Mahmoud appealed to the World Health Organization and the Federal Ministry of Health to act immediately and save eastern Sudan, and in particular Red Sea, from the disease.

Viral hemorrhagic fever is a general term for a severe illness, sometimes associated with bleeding, that may be caused by a number of viruses.

[Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fevers have been reported sporadically in various parts of Sudan. If these are, in reality, of virus etiology, as the report indicates, cases may be caused by a variety of viruses the have been known to occur in Sudan. There is no information provided in the report above that suggests any specific virus, nor is it indicated that samples are being taken to permit laboratory diagnosis of the disease. It is not clear why the Sudan government has imposed a blackout on information concerning the disease in the Red Sea state. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information as it becomes available.

[ProMED-mail post Undiagnosed illness - Sudan (RS): RFI 20140617.2544550 is about an undiagnosed outbreak in Port Sudan (the capital city of the Red Sea state) where MERS-CoV is postulated. The media report did not provide any symptoms other than to postulate that it might be MERS-CoV. The possibility exists that these 2 outbreaks may in fact be one outbreak or 2 separate outbreaks or perhaps not a specific outbreak at all. - Mod.MPP]
