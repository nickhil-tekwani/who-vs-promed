Saturday [18 Jan 2020], National People's Health Commission of Hubei province, Wuhan Municipal People's Government
About the new cases of pneumonia of new coronavirus infection in Wuhan ([18 Jan 2020])
------------------------------------------
Issuing authority: Wuhan City health committee
On [17 Jan 2020], national and provincial experts screened some cases of unexplained pneumonia that were screened by community health service centers in the city and found and treated [these cases] in various hospitals based on their clinical manifestations, epidemiological history, and optimization. The positive results of the novel coronavirus nucleic acid detected by the subsequent detection kit were comprehensively judged, and 17 cases of pneumonia cases with new coronavirus infection were newly identified.

Of the 17 patients, 12 were males and 5 were females; 9 were under 60 years of age, 8 were 60 years of age and older, the youngest was 30 years old, and the oldest was 79 years old. The onset date was before [13 Jan 2020]; 1st symptoms [were] fever, cough, or fever with cough; 3 cases were severe, and the rest were stable. Except for 2 cases of severe illness, which were temporarily unsuitable for transfer, the remaining 15 cases had been transferred to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital for centralized treatment.

The epidemiological investigation of 17 new cases is in depth, and close contacts are also being tracked.

In the next step, the city will continue to expand the search scope, identify suspected cases, and conduct sampling tests.

[The Wuhan City Public Health authorities are expanding the surveillance in the city for more cases of febrile, respiratory illness/pneumonia associated with infection with the novel coronavirus. I suspect this will be a "seek and ye shall find" activity, as it appears as though there is ongoing transmission in Wuhan City as seen by the now 3 cases reported by Thailand (2 cases) and Japan (1 case) in individuals travelling from Wuhan, China. One of the major questions is whether there is evidence of spread of the virus to other cities in China, both in the present and recent past, while a major concern is the population movement associated with the upcoming Chinese New Year (25 Jan 2020). A media report mentions 3 suspected cases elsewhere in China (see section [2] below). It is still very early in the information ascertainment and surveillance efforts.

[2] China: suspected cases in Shenzhen and Shanghai - media report
Date: Sat 18 Jan 2020
Source: South China Morning Post [edited]
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3046681/china-coronavirus-least-three-suspected-cases-found-shenzhen


At least 3 suspected cases of the newly discovered coronavirus have been reported in Chinese cities outside Wuhan -- the epicentre of the outbreak -- according to sources with knowledge of the matter, raising concerns about the continued spread of the disease. Two Chinese visitors to Thailand and a Chinese man working in Japan have already been confirmed as having been infected, while authorities in Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have said they are monitoring a number of suspected cases.

The authorities in Wuhan announced on Sunday [19 Jan 2020] that 17 new cases were found on Friday [17 Jan 2020]; see section [1] above for official report], taking the total number to 62. It said the new cases were found by using new test kits. However, there have been no official reports of any infections or even suspected cases in any other mainland Chinese cities, despite there being more than 90 of the latter in Hong Kong and 4 in Taiwan.

Among the 62 confirmed cases, 19 have been discharged and 8 are in serious conditions. So far 2 have died.

According to health authorities in Wuhan, 681 among the 763 people known to have been in close contact with the 62 confirmed cases have been tested for the virus but given the all-clear. However, 3 separate sources have told the South China Morning Post that at least 2 suspected cases have been reported in the south China city of Shenzhen, and a 3rd in Shanghai, in the east of the country.

The 2 people in Shenzhen are currently in quarantine at the Third People's Hospital, which specialises in the treatment of infectious diseases, the sources said. A medical source said a person suspected of having been infected was being treated in Shanghai but did not elaborate.

According to medical experts, to be categorised as a suspected case, a patient must show symptoms resembling those experienced by people confirmed as having been infected with the new coronavirus, and have either visited Wuhan recently or been in close contact with a known patient.

In Hong Kong, 90 people have undergone a period of quarantine -- all but 14 have since been discharged -- but there have been no confirmed infections. There have also been 4 suspected cases in Taiwan, 3 in Singapore, 2 in Vietnam, and one in Nepal.

According to health authorities in Wuhan, 763 people known to have been in close contact with the 62 confirmed cases have been tested for the virus but given the all-clear. However, a study by researchers at Imperial College London published on Friday [17 Jan 2020] estimated that 1723 people were likely to have been infected with the new coronavirus. The figure was based on a number of assumptions, including the duration of the detection period, the catchment population of Wuhan airport, and the volume of international travelers, the report said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday [17 Jan 2020] that while it was unaware of any cases in Chinese towns or cities outside Wuhan, it had not ruled out the possibility that there were some. "To date there have been no reported cases in China outside Wuhan, but we are still in the early stages of understanding this new virus, where it came from, and how it affects people," it said in a written reply to the Post's questions. "There are many unknowns, and the situation may continue to evolve. We have seen cases in other countries, and it is possible there may be other cases reported in China too."

When asked to comment on the suspected cases, a doctor at the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital said he could not "disclose any information about the matter."

"You have to ask the health commission," he said.

A spokesman for the Shenzhen health authority said he had no comment beyond what had already been made public by the government.

The Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre in Jinshan, which specialises in the treatment of infectious diseases, also declined to comment.

Professor Benjamin Cowling, head of the epidemiology and biostatistics division at the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong, said there were practical difficulties for China in disclosing suspected cases. "In Wuhan and the nearby area, it is currently the peak influenza season, and there will be tens of thousands of people with a fever, due to an influenza virus infection, who have recently been to Wuhan," he said. As most of the cases were likely to turn out to be unrelated to the new virus, it would be more practical for the government to disclose only confirmed cases to avoid causing the public any unnecessary panic, he said.

For China's health authorities, the challenge of controlling the spread of the disease is about to peak, as hundreds of millions of people across the country prepare for the Lunar New Year holiday. More than 3 billion journeys are expected to be made over a 40-day period, starting Tuesday [21 Jan 2020], as people head home to celebrate with their families.

When the southern province of Guangdong was hit by the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2002-2003, Chinese authorities withheld information about it over the holiday period, but that only aided its spread, as the public was oblivious to the risks.

In the midst of the outbreak, which killed more than 700 people around the world, new measures were introduced in China making it compulsory for local authorities to report all cases to the central government. Beijing also pledged to disclose any information about SARS to the WHO in a timely manner. However, China's Law on Control and Prevention of Communicable Diseases stipulates that only the State Council or an authorised city or provincial health authority can publish information about outbreaks or epidemics of communicable diseases. All other institutions and individuals are banned from doing so.

As reports of people being hit with the new coronavirus overseas have reached Chinese social media, so the skepticism about the apparent absence of infections and suspected cases elsewhere in China has grown.

"There is some important information the authorities are failing to explain," a person wrote on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform. "So there is no increase of confirmed cases, but how about the suspected ones? Has there been an increase?"

Another asked: "So this virus travels internationally but not outside Wuhan?"

On [1 Jan 2020], 8 people were punished by police for spreading "untruthful" information about the pneumonia outbreak.

The strain of coronavirus found in Wuhan -- named 2019-nCoV by the WHO -- is the 7th of its kind to be identified. Of the 6 others, 4 cause only minor respiratory symptoms similar to those of a cold and 2, SARS and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), are deadly, with the latter accounting for more than 850 deaths around the world since 2012.

The new strain was found in samples taken from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, where many of the patients worked or visited frequently. But some of those who have tested positive have denied ever going to the market, raising fears that the disease might be able to jump from person to person. The WHO said it had not ruled out such a possibility. "Based on the current information, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission," it said in an earlier statement. "[But] at this stage, we cannot rule out the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission. This is an area requiring further investigation and information."

Dr Ho Pak-leung, an associate professor at Hong Kong University's microbiology department, said there were reasons to believe there had been some human-to-human transmission, and that there was more than one source of infection. He urged the Hong Kong government to introduce health declaration forms for all airline passengers arriving in the city from Wuhan.

[It is clear there is already concern elsewhere in China from the information of suspected cases in Shenzhen and Shanghai, and it's also being questioned on Weibo, the prominent social media platform in China. The point mentioned by Professor Benjamin Cowling regarding practical difficulties for China in disclosing suspected cases is a good one, as it is currently the peak influenza season with "10s of thousands" of individuals with a febrile respiratory illness due to influenza and not related to the novel CoV. Release of numbers on suspected cases may well lead to panic in the general population. That being said, good risk communication strategies permit keeping the population informed while hopefully relieving panic, especially through demonstrating that there are major efforts underway to ultimately control an ongoing outbreak.

[3] Kathmandu, Nepal: suspected case - hospital report
Date: Sat 18 Jan 2020
From: Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun <drsherbdr@yahoo.com> [edited]


Suspected 2019-nCoV case, Kathmandu, Nepal
------------------------
On [13 Jan 2020] a 31-year-old male with no chronic disease sought medical care for high-grade fever, shortness of breath, and dry cough after his return from Wuhan, China. In fact, he had gradually developed these symptoms since [5 Jan 2020], before his departure (from Wuhan, China). According to the WHO case definition, the patient was suspected of having 2019-nCoV and therefore kept under close observation. These symptoms lasted for 10 days. He was discharged without further complications. This novel virus, however, was not confirmed by specific laboratory testing until the day of his discharge [see comment below for further clarification].

The patient denied having visited seafood or live animal markets in Wuhan that linked to this outbreak, which is, at present, widely believed to be the source of 2019-nCoV, indicating that this novel coronavirus virus may [be] capable of human-to-human transmission. Usually cough triggers breathing difficulties, but conversely, he complained of dry cough followed by difficulty in breathing. Although we do not know about its exact origin, dynamic transmission, spectrum of disease, mortality rate, preventive measures, and possible global impact, it is wise to remain vigilant against this virus in the coming days.

[Our thanks to Dr. Sher Bahadur Pun for this report on the suspected case of pneumonia related to infection with the 2019 nCoV. Per follow-up with Dr. Pun, "the test itself is not available in Nepal. Thus the patient's samples [must be sent] abroad to confirm the virus. Hence the case, so far, remains suspected (clinically and epidemiologically) with no laboratory confirmation."

This report serves to demonstrate the extent of international travel in today's day and age and the level of surveillance ongoing internationally in response to the reports of this outbreak, and importations of infected cases into other countries.

V2 (updated to include 2nd Thai case)

Background
On [31 Dec 2019], the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China [1]. A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related to the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus has since been implicated [2].

As of [16 Jan 2020], 41 cases (including 2 deaths [3]) have been confirmed in Wuhan City with 3 confirmed cases in travellers detected in Thailand (2 cases) and Japan (1 case) [4-7]. Most cases have been epidemiologically linked to exposure at a seafood market in Wuhan, which has been closed since [1 Jan 2020] in efforts to contain the outbreak. Although both travellers have a history of travel to Wuhan City, they did not visit the seafood market implicated in the other cases [2].

Using the number of cases detected outside China, it is possible (see Methods) to infer the number of clinically comparable cases within Wuhan City that may have occurred thus far.

Summary
We estimate that a total of 1723 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (95% CI [confidence interval]: 427-4471) had onset of symptoms by [12 Jan 2020] (the last reported onset date of any case).

This estimate is based on the following assumptions:

- Wuhan International Airport has a catchment population of 19 million individuals [1].
- There is a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection, comprising a 5-6 day incubation period [8,9] and a 4-5 day delay from symptom onset to detection/hospitalisation of a case (the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were hospitalised 3 and 7 days after onset, respectively) [4,10].
- Total volume of international travel from Wuhan over the last 2 months has been 3301 passengers per day. This estimate is derived from the 3418 foreign passengers per day in the top 20 country destinations based on 2018 IATA data [11], and uses 2016 IATA data held by Imperial College to correct for the travel surge at Chinese New Year present in the latter data (which has not happened yet this year [2020]) and for travel to countries outside the top 20 destination list.

Caveats
- We assume that outbound trip durations are long enough that an infected Wuhan resident travelling internationally will develop symptoms and be detected overseas, rather than being detected after returning to Wuhan. We also do not account for the fact that international visitors to Wuhan (such as the case who was detected in Japan) might be expected to have a shorter duration of exposure and thus a lower infection risk than residents. Accounting for either factor correctly requires additional data but would increase our estimate of the total number of cases.

- We estimate the potential number of symptomatic cases with disease severity of a level requiring hospitalisation (both the cases detected in Thailand and Japan were moderately severe). Our estimates do not include cases with mild or no symptoms.

- The incubation period of 2019-nCov is not known and has been approximated with the estimates obtained for MERS-CoV and SARS [8,9].

- We assume that international travel is independent of the risk of exposure to 2019n-CoV or of infection status. If zoonotic exposure was biased towards wealthier people, travel frequency may be correlated with exposure. Also, some travel might be causally linked to infection status (to seek healthcare overseas) or the infection status of contacts in Wuhan (this may apply to the case detected in Japan) [10]. Accounting for either association would increase the probability of a case travelling and therefore reduce our estimates of the total number of cases.

Sensitivity analysis
- We explore the sensitivity of estimates of total cases to our assumptions about (i) the duration of the detection window (exploring a lower value of 8 days); (ii) the catchment population size of Wuhan airport (assuming it might be 11 million, the population of Wuhan city [12], rather than 19 million, the population of the entire metropolitan area [1]); and (iii) true exportations reported internationally (2, 3 and 4 cases). Table 1 [available at source URL] summarises the baseline assumptions and alternative scenarios explored. We note that the currently reported number of cases (44) is substantially lower than the lower bound of our most conservative scenario (190 cases, Scenario 3).

Table 1: Estimated case numbers based on the baseline assumptions and alternative scenarios explored out.

Conclusions
It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported. The estimates presented here suggest surveillance should be expanded to include all hospitalised cases of pneumonia or severe respiratory disease in the Wuhan area and other well-connected Chinese cities. This analysis does not directly address transmission routes, but past experience with SARS and MERS-CoV outbreaks of similar scale suggests currently self-sustaining human-to-human transmission should not be ruled out.

Methods
Using internationally reported cases, it is possible to infer the magnitude of comparable cases within Wuhan City that may have occurred thus far.

The total number of cases requiring healthcare is given by:

the total number of cases is equal to the number of cases detected overseas divided by the probability any one case will be detected overseas,

where the probability any one case will be detected overseas (p) is given by:

p = daily probability of international travel x mean time to detection of a case.

The daily probability of travel is calculated by:

the daily probability of international travel equals the daily outbound number of international travellers from Wuhan divided by the catchment population of Wuhan airport.

Finally, the mean time to detection can be approximated by:

mean time to detection equals incubation period plus time from onset of symptoms to detection.

Confidence intervals can be calculated from the observation that the number of cases detected overseas, X, is binomially distributed as Bin(p,N), where p equals the probability any one case will be detected overseas, and N is the total number of cases. N is therefore a negative binomially distributed function of X. The results in Table 1 are maximum-likelihood estimates obtained using this negative binomial likelihood function.

[These results from the Imperial College modelling are helpful in presenting a justification for suspecting the number of cases currently occurring in Wuhan City is greater than the number officially confirmed. One has to remember that while mild cases may have been detected in the official investigation surrounding the outbreak associated with the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, which involved active case surveillance, milder cases occurring in the community not directly associated with contact with the seafood market or with individuals involved in the seafood market cluster might well not come to the attention of the health sector and therefore would not be included in identified cases. This is a newly identified virus causing a febrile respiratory disease associated with pneumonia (but percentage of infected individuals presenting with pneumonia is not currently known). There is much to be learned, in spite of recognizing much has already been learned in a very short time. - Mod.MPP]
