The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a level 1 travel alert regarding the ongoing outbreak in Pakistan of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever.

This "practice usual precautions" travel alert published on [30 Sep 2019] is very important since XDR infections do not respond to most antibiotics, such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. And in rare cases typhoid fever can be fatal.

The CDC says people from the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Australia with a travel history to Pakistan have reported XDR typhoid infections. According to the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation, about 1.75 million tourists visited Pakistan in 2017 alone.

Pakistan is the world's 6th-most populous country with a population exceeding 210 million people, located in South Asia.

Pakistan's current XDR typhoid fever outbreak began in Hyderabad, which is a city of Sindh province, during November 2016.

The CDC says, "If you are going to South Asia, including Pakistan, protect yourself against typhoid infection by getting a typhoid fever vaccination." The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends 2 typhoid fever vaccines: an oral vaccine, Typhim, and an injectable vaccine, Typbar.

The oral vaccine Typhim is approved for people 6 years old or older, should be taken as directed, at least 1 week before departure. The injectable vaccine is approved for people 2 years old or older. Travelers should receive the injectable vaccine Typbar at least 2 weeks before departure.

Neither vaccine is 100% effective, so travelers should also practice safe eating and drinking while traveling abroad, says the ACIP.

Typhoid fever is a serious disease caused by the bacterium _Salmonella Typhi_ and spread by contaminated food and water. Humans are the only source of these bacteria.

The incubation period of typhoid and paratyphoid infections is 6 to 30 days, says the CDC. Symptoms of typhoid fever often include high fever, weakness, stomach pain, headache, cough, and loss of appetite. People may have diarrhea or constipation.

If you travel abroad and get sick while traveling, seek medical care as soon as possible. If you get sick after returning to the USA, seek medical care and tell your healthcare provider where and when you traveled. Do not prepare food for other people, says the CDC.

An estimated 26 million cases of typhoid fever and 5 million cases of paratyphoid fever occur worldwide each year, causing 215 000 deaths. In the USA from 2008 to 2015, approximately 350 culture-confirmed cases of typhoid fever and 90 cases of paratyphoid fever caused by Paratyphi A were reported each year.

Also, the CDC says to ensure you are up to date on several vaccinations before visiting Pakistan.

From a security perspective, the US Department of State issued a "reconsider travel to Pakistan" level 3 advisory regarding civil unrest on [9 Apr 2019]. Moreover, some areas of Pakistan have a "do not travel" level 4 advisory, such as Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to terrorism and kidnapping, and the Azad Kashmir area, due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.

[Multidrug-resistant (MDR) is defined as acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in 3 or more antimicrobial categories. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) is defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but 2 or fewer antimicrobial categories (i.e., bacterial isolates remain susceptible to only 1 or 2 categories). The typhoid fever strain causing the outbreak in Pakistan remains susceptible to carbapenems and azithromycin. Azithromycin may be used for treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever caused by this strain, but carbapenems should be used treatment of severe or complicated typhoid fever involving this strain.

As noted in the alert, cases of typhoid fever caused by this strain have occurred in travelers from the USA and from other countries as reported in the See Also section below. - Mod.DK
