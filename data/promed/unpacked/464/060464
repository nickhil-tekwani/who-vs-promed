Nagana Hits Tororo District
---------------------------
An outbreak of Nagana is threatening food security in Tororo, the
district veterinary officer, Mukongo Tegule, has said. He said the
disease, which is spread by tsetse flies and affects cattle, had
wiped out livestock in key areas that supply food to the district.
Tegule explained that the reduction in cattle had affected crop
production since farmers use ox-ploughs.

"With most of the bulls dead, farmers can not clear vast pieces of
land using hoes."

Mukongo said Nagana weakens the animals rapidly, causes loss of
appetite and makes them develop scarred hides.

West Budama county is the most affected. In Paya sub-county, the
infection rate is 11.4 percent, Mulanda sub-county 15.5 percent,
Nabuyoga sub-county 15.7 percent and Kirewa sub-county with 14.6 percent.

The district entomologist, Joseph Mutaya, said they were using the
trap method to reduce the flies.

"But the situation warrants a more radical measure if tangible
results are to be realised," he added.

However, the acting chief administrative officer, Francis Orono, said
the district had set aside sh9m to buy drugs for the infected animals.

"But the drugs can only cover a small portion of the affected
sub-counties. Our earnest appeal goes to all relevant authorities in
the Government to come to our aid."

The district agricultural officer, Patrick Okware, said the biggest
proportion of crops, including maize, millet and beans come from West Budama.

"With the epidemic, the district is automatically going to face a
food shortage," the agricultural officer added.

[Nagana is a tsetse fly- (Glossina spp) transmitted complex in cattle
caused by _Trypanosoma brucei_. The disease is fatal to horses,
mules, camels, and dogs. Cattle, sheep, and goats usually survive,
except when parasitized by certain strains. Many wild ungulates
native to Africa show no evidence of harm.

For further details, refer to chapter 2.3.15. 'TRYPANOSOMOSIS
