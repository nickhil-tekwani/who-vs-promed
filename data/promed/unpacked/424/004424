Detection Systems for Aflatoxins and [other Mycotoxins
--------------------------------------------------------
The Research and Technology Development Center (RTDC) of the Johns Hopkins
University, Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) has developed a compact
and easy-to-use sensor package that can be configured to detect either
aflatoxins [or other mycotoxins. (The target mycotoxin needs to be
fluorescent, either intrinsically or through derivatization in order to be
detected in the APL sensor. Other [scenarios are conceivable, but have not
been reduced to practice.) A short web description of the device is
available at URL: <http://www.jhuapl.edu/rc/sens/index.html#Aflatoxin%20Sensor>

Concerning the [origin of the word "mycotoxicosis":
"The word "mycotoxicosis" was proposed by Forjacs and Carll (1955) to
describe animal illness as a consequence of ingestion of moldy fodder."
[The reference below suggests that the term was already in use by 1955, as
I seem to remember Dr. Gajdusek using it with the same meaning (although it
has been years since I read this book.)
From the (US) Library of Congress catalog
<http://lcweb.loc.gov/cgi-bin/zgate>:
Author: Gajdusek, D. Carleton (Daniel Carleton), 1923-
Title: Acute infectious hemorrhagic fevers and mycotoxicoses in the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Published: Washington, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 1953.

[Thanks to both correspondents for their comments. Development of a
fluorescence sensor for mycotoxins is an advance in the field of
mycotoxicology. I will leave it to the historians in the field to sort out
when the word "mycotoxicosis" was coined, and by whom. The main point is
that the word has legitimacy. - Mod.DH
