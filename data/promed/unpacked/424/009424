I am interested in the observation that dengue-3 was isolated by the CDC
from Ecuador and may be associated with recent dengue fever cases there. In
1994 a new strain of dengue-3 from the Indian subcontinent was introduced
into central America (Nicaragua, Panama) and was associated with large
outbreaks of dengue (observation of Dr. Lanciotti and Dr. Gubler from the
CDC). I am not sure if this particular D-3 was
associated with DHF cases in Central America. I am curious to know how the
recent D-3 isolate from Ecuador is related to other D-3s? Is the Indian
subcontinent D-3 spreading into South America too? Also, is there any
information on recent D-3 genotypes in Colombia and Venezuela?
