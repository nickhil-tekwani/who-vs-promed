Concern over potato disease
---------------------------
A north-west [Tasmania farm has been quarantined after authorities in
Western
Australia found a potentially serious disease in a potato shipment.
Quarantine officers in Western Australia identified symptoms close to those
of a bacterial disease known as Ring Rot in one potato in the 28-tonne
consignment.
The disease which is widespread in North and South America and Europe has
not been detected in Australia before.
Samples from the suspect potato have been sent to pathologists in Queensland
and Tasmania for analysis.
Tasmania's quarantine manager, Danny Reardon, says until the results are
known in about 10 days, the property will remain under restriction.
