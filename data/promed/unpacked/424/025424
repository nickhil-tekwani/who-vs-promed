In continuation of the investigation of the cases of hemorrhagic
pneumonia of unknown etiology in residents of municipalities of the
state of Rio Grande do Norte, the Secretariat of Health Surveillance
(SVS/MS) announced that of the 29 cases initially reported, 25 were
ruled out based on clinical criteria and/or
laboratory/anatomic-pathological bases, leaving 4 cases under investigation.
Most of the cases that were ruled out were classified as dengue (8)
and bacterial pneumonia (8). The remainder presented different
diagnoses: sepsis (2), viral pneumonia (1), appendicitis (1),
meningitis (1), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1), acute abdomen secondary
to ascariasis (1), and some, in spite of not having a definitive
diagnosis, were discarded for not fitting the clinical definition of
a suspected case (2).
The median age of the 4 cases remaining under investigation is 5
years (ranging from 2 to 11 years) and all cases were male. The most
frequent signs and symptoms were dyspnea [shortness of breath],
bleeding, cough, and fever. These 4 cases all resulted in
death. The date of onset of the symptoms for the 1st case was 10 Mar
2006 (10th epidemiologic week) and the last [date of onset] was on 4
May 2006 (18th epidemiologic week). The average time between the date
of onset of symptoms and date of death was 10 days. Medical care was
provided at different hospitals in Natal (PAPI, Walfrido Gurgel
Hospital, and the Maria Alice Hospital) and the cases resided in
different municipalities: Natal, Parnamirim, Sao Gancalo do Amarante
and Sao Tome.
It is not possible to confirm with precision the succession of events
that led to these serious clinical pictures and progression to
fatalities. Clinical pictures of septicemia and of primary viral
infection can evolve in this form. In relation to the antecedents, 3
of these cases presented with a history of chronic diseases, such as
bronchial asthma and falciform anemia. None of the cases presented
with a history of travel to localities in common. There was no
evidence of transmission of the disease between affected persons,
their families or other persons that had contact with the
patients. Up to the present, no interrelation between these cases
has been identified, nor common exposures which would suggest an
outbreak of a specific disease. There is no possible common source
of transmission of the disease [identified at this point].
The investigation into the etiology of the disease seen in the
patients is ongoing, but none of the examinations conducted thus far
have provided a common etiologic agent. We await results of pending tests.
We note that there are no indications for restriction of foods,
habits, or travel within or outside of the state, nor any other
restrictive measures regarding visiting schools, work environments,
or public locales. All of the measures necessary for conclusion of
this investigation are being taken by the SVS, State Secretariat and
Municipalities Secretariats of Health.
Parallel to the investigation of these deaths, and in partnership
with the Ministry of Health, the State Secretariat and the
Secretariats of the municipalities are conducting other
investigations into the principal clinical syndromes of transmissible
diseases in the state: influenza-like illnesses, acute diarrheal
diseases, and dengue. In this regard, reporting and laboratory
confirmation of each case are important. In addition to the
reporting [of the cases], this will allow for knowing the true
magnitude of these events [disease occurrence], permitting a better
opportunity and effectiveness of control measures.
