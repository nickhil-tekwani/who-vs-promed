The displaced of camp Zamzam, south of El Fasher, capital of North Darfur, complain of an increase in those suffering from kala-azar* disease in the last 5 years. An activist told to Radio Dabanga that the rate of infection has risen from 150 cases in 2010 to 1800 in 2015.

He highlighted the death of a number of patients. He attributed the increase to the halt in spraying operations that used to be carried out by organisations, lack of care for the environment health, a lack of mosquito nets among the displaced, a shortage of specialist doctors, and soaring prices of kala-azar medicines.

A number of kala-azar patients of camp Zamzam said that the treatment of the disease costs a patient more than SDG [Sudanese pound] 1000 (about USD 165) in addition to the cost of medical examination, check-ups, and transportation to El Fasher.

They pointed out that the drugs require refrigeration, which is not available in the camp. Patients complained about the sharp deterioration in the health care, services, the lack of specialist medical staff, and the scarcity of medicines in the camp. They called on the Federal Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation to expedite the delivery and provision of treatment for patients.

* Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as "black fever", is a parasitic disease, killing nearly all of those infected. It is caused by the bite of sandflies. If blood containing leishmania parasites is drawn from an animal or human, the next person to receive a bite will then become infected and develop leishmaniasis. Months after this initial infection the disease can progress into the more severe form of kala-azar.

[Leishmaniasis is highly endemic in both Sudan and South Sudan. The situation described with a more than 10-fold increase over 5 years in the number of cases, highlights the breakdown of treatment and control measures in the refugee camps.

Visceral leishmaniasis in almost always fatal if untreated. ProMED-mail will be happy to post comments from the authorities in Sudan on the situation and future plans for control of leishmaniasis in the refugee camps in Darfur. - Mod.EP
