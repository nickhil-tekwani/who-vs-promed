This afternoon [19 Sep 2007], a Temporary Control Zone has been put around
one premises in Solihull. This is a precautionary measure. An assessment of
clinical symptoms by Animal Health veterinary staff has been carried out,
and laboratory test results are awaited.
At this stage, disease has not been confirmed. The containment and
eradication of FMD is our top priority.
It remains essential for animal keepers to practice the highest standards
of biosecurity, remain vigilant for disease and report any suspicions
immediately.

Tests are being carried out on livestock at a premises in the West Midlands
to find out whether foot and mouth disease is present. A temporary control
zone has been put around the site in Solihull, believed to be Woodhouse
Farm, as a precaution. Government vets have carried out an assessment of
the symptoms in livestock at the site and are awaiting the results of tests.
Control zones are still in place around 3 Surrey farms that had the virus.
September's outbreak was discovered after livestock at 2 farms nearby were
found to have the disease in August [2007].
A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
said the disease had not been confirmed at the site in Solihull, which is
just south of Birmingham International Airport. It added: "The containment
and eradication of foot-and-mouth disease is our top priority. It remains
essential for animal keepers to practice the highest standards of
biosecurity, remain vigilant for disease and report any suspicions
immediately."
David Catlow, president of the British Veterinary Association, said results
of the tests should be available soon. He said: "It would be a serious
development if it is confirmed, but at the moment, it's a report case, and
we have had more than 100 report cases from the start, with 5 confirmed
infected premises. So actually, though it sounds rather bizarre, we want
report cases. We want to know that farmers are being vigilant, looking out
for disease and reporting any clinical signs, and then we can rule out any
disease if necessary."
Earlier, chief veterinary officer Debby Reynolds urged farmers to increase
their vigilance. She said farmers should now check their cattle twice a day
rather than once a day, which was the usual recommendation. "It's a
requirement for animal welfare purposes to look at them once a day," she
said. "But because of the emerging situation, I do ask cattle farmers in
England to look at their animals twice a day, so that we can be absolutely
sure to detect and get reported any concerns about any animals as quickly
as possible."
Mrs Reynolds also said vaccines would not be provided for any animals, but
added the decision would be reviewed. "Vaccination can be used as a disease
control measure if it is demonstrated that steps in addition to the
slaughter policy are required to eradicate the disease," she said. "It has
been decided not to vaccinate at this time, because the risk of spread of
disease outside of the Surrey area is still considered to be low at the
present time."
Three earlier confirmed cases were just a few miles away from the Pirbright
research complex in Surrey, blamed as the source for the FMD outbreaks at 2
other farms last month [August 2007]. The new cases also involve the same
strain of the disease found in the outbreaks last month.
FMD was confirmed at Hardwick Park Farm, Egham, a week ago, with animals
then testing positive at nearby Stroude Farm shortly after.
On Tuesday [18 Sep 2007], it emerged that animals at The Klondyke farm had
contracted the disease and had been culled.
A 3 km (1.8 mile) protection zone has been set up around the Surrey
farmland, with a 10 km (6.2 mile) surveillance zone encircling it.

Results of the laboratory investigation are expected soon. For the location

It is to be hoped that this suspected case is not confirmed. Otherwise, the
odds for the establishment of a containment zone in the UK will lengthen. -
