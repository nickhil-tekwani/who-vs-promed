POTATO VIRUSES - CANADA: (PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND)

Almost half of PEI's [Prince Edward Island] seed potatoes used to
plant the spring [2010] crop, are above the Island's allowable virus
standard this year, according the PEI Potato Board. The board is
trying to decide whether to ask the provincial government to increase
the current 3 percent cap on allowable virus in the seed [tubers]. A
decision could be made within a week, officials say.

If the tolerance level isn't increased, farmers will have to import
expensive seed potatoes from Manitoba, said Agriculture critic Jim
Bagnall. And that could have dire consequences, he said. "I think
that if they don't relax maybe the virus levels for this year [2010],
that it could put some potato farmers right out of business."

Usually, 85 to 95 percent of PEI's seed potatoes are below the 3
percent threshold. Virus levels are the latest problem to plague
Island potato farmers. Wet weather late last year [2009] contributed
to warehouse rot. Delays caused by thick mud in the fields also
resulted in frost damage.

[Around 40 viruses have been reported to affect potato. A number of
them can be spread by aphids, but since the crop is vegetatively
propagated, many of them are also disseminated in tubers. Some
viruses may only have a minor effect on yield if they are the only
infecting virus species. However, if virus-infected seed tubers are
used, the virus population will gradually build up during every crop
cycle, both in number of co-infecting (possibly synergistic) virus
species and in amounts of infectious units per species. This
invariably leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop
in yield. The important role that tubers play in virus and viroid
spread is recognised by the strict requirements for certified seed
potato production in many countries worldwide.

Control of viruses and reduction of high virus levels in regional
crops may be extremely difficult since insect vectors and solanaceous
pathogen reservoir hosts are often widespread. It is therefore vital
for national potato industries to set maximum levels of acceptable
risk for the whole industry. The suggestion above of relaxing this
level in PEI, with 'dire consequences' predicted otherwise, cannot be
recommended since it is likely to lead to increased virus levels over
the total of local crops. This may result in yield losses for years
to come, and the consequences of this action can therefore be
expected to be much more 'dire' in the long term (see for example
ProMED-mail post 20090212.0628).
