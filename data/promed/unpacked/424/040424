With the fall comes cold and flu season, but whilst coughing in humans may not be an immediate sign of danger, bovines exhibiting this behavior could be harboring a much more serious disease.

The Control of Worms Sustainably (COWS) Group [see comment] has warned that wetter weather and rainfall following the summer drought could bring a spike in lungworm infections among grazing cattle - with farmers urged to remain vigilant for signs for respiratory distress, such as coughing and weight loss.

The issue was flagged up during a recent discussion with experts at the Animal and Plant Health Agency and Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), who raised concerns about the potential for outbreaks during the wetter months.

Lungworm is a parasite infection that occurs when the animal ingests infected larvae from pasture. Infected animals develop bronchitis and pneumonia, with young dairy cattle at a higher risk as they lack immunity, though vaccination in the first grazing season could prevent infection.

Outbreaks can be unpredictable but are more prevalent in wetter areas of Britain, with symptoms typically appearing in late summer and autumn. COWS estimates that severe outbreaks could cost farmers £50-£100 [about USD 55-110] per head and up to £3 [about USD 3.37] per cow per day in lost milk production.

"There are warnings that this year could be particularly challenging as the drought suspended lungworm life cycles, which may result in a greater infection pressure in a short space of time," the group said. "And with autumn now bringing wetter weather, rainfall can promote the release of infective larvae from fecal pats." Farmers should be on alert about coughing cattle and speak to their vet as early as possible if they spot symptoms of the disease. Severely affected animals may either not respond to treatment or symptoms may become life-threatening, COWS warned. Treated cattle should be removed from infected pastures and transferred to clean pastures if available or housed in well-ventilated facilities, with severely-infected calves kept indoors for treatment and observation.

[In spite of their significant economic and animal-suffering impact, diseases caused directly by internal and external parasites obtain a modest exposure among reports addressing emerging or transboundary diseases of animals. The epidemiology of such diseases in livestock, particularly grazing animals, is closely related to climatic conditions to which the lifecycle of the relevant parasites is adapted. The climate in the UK is defined as a humid temperate oceanic climate, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe. Management of grazing/pasturing, and periodic application of anthelmintics, insecticides, or, when available, vaccines, are consequently also climate- and season-dependent. UK's policy is shared in other countries which present similar climatic conditions.
