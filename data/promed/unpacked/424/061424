Eight people who drank hand sanitizer at a house party in Russia after the alcohol ran out have now died, including the parents of 5 children who are now orphaned.

A 48-year-old woman, the children's mother, became the latest to have died on Thursday [3 Dec 2020] after succumbing to internal injuries caused by the industrial-grade alcohol.

Her husband was among 5 men aged between 27 and 69 who were the 1st to die, along with a woman, 41, and another person, whose gender and age were not given.

A 48-year-old woman -- the mother of 5 children -- has become the 8th person to die after drinking hand sanitizer at a house party in Russia

All 7 of those who died, plus the mother, had attended a house party in Tomtor village on 19 Nov 2020.

Another man, from the neighboring Aldansky district, has also died from consuming the sanitizer but was not connected to the party.

A 9th party attendee, aged 32, is still in hospital and is expected to survive the poisoning but will likely go blind, doctors say.

The party-goers died after drinking sanitizer containing 69 percent methanol, an industrial alcohol used as a solvent, pesticide, and sometimes as a fuel source. It is poisonous when consumed by humans, unlike its chemical cousin ethanol, which is commonly found in beers, wines, and spirits.

The legal limit for methanol in hand sanitizer products is just 3.5 percent.

Businessman AK, 44, from Sverdlovsk region, has been arrested and accused of supplying the sanitizer, which has been tracked to kindergartens, schools, businesses, and a jail.

He is currently being held under house arrest while an investigation is carried out, and is facing 6 years in jail if convicted.

Almost 4800 litres of the deadly concoction have been seized so far, but police believe more was supplied.

[Methanol toxicity initially lacks severe toxic manifestations. Its pathophysiology represents a classic example of lethal synthesis in which toxic metabolites cause fatality after a characteristic latent period. In other words, these people may not realize they are sick or ill until sometime after consumption.

Methanol is sometimes used as an ethanol substitute for alcohol. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body, but [they contain] minute quantities.

Wood alcohol is also known as methanol. It is a commonly used toxic organic solvent causing metabolic acidosis, neurologic issues, and death when ingested. It is a part of many commercial industrial solvents and of adulterated alcoholic beverages or is mistaken as being the same as alcohol for ingestion. Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing world, especially among members of lower socioeconomic classes.

Neurological complications are recognized more frequently due to advanced technologies and because of early recognition of the toxicity and advances in supportive care. Hemodialysis and better management of acid-base disturbances remain the most important therapeutic improvements.

Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury. Funduscopic changes are notable within only a few hours after methanol ingestion. The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is regarded as being responsible for ocular toxicity, and blindness can occur in humans.

The prognosis in methanol poisoning correlates with the amount of methanol consumed and the subsequent degree of metabolic acidosis; more severe acidosis confers a poorer prognosis. Methanol has a relatively low toxicity. The adverse effects are thought to be from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. The prognosis is further dependent on the amount of formic acid that has accumulated in the blood, with a direct correlation existing between the formic acid concentration and morbidity and mortality. Little long-term improvement can be expected in patients with neurologic complications.

The minimal lethal dose of methanol in adults is believed to be 0.3-1 g/kg of body weight. The exact rates of morbidity and mortality from methanol intoxication are not available.

Rapid, early treatment is necessary for survival, but sequelae such as blindness may be permanent.

Metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning may necessitate the administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy, often using ethanol or fomepizole, is directed towards delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol is eliminated from the patient's system either naturally or via dialysis. Like methanol, ethanol is metabolized by ADH [alcohol dehydrogenase], but the enzyme's affinity for ethanol is 10-20 times higher than it is for methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of high cost and lack of availability.

Hemodialysis can easily remove methanol and formic acid. Indications for this procedure include (1) greater than 30 mL [1 oz] of methanol ingested, (2) serum methanol level greater than 20 mg/dL, (3) observation of visual complications, and (4) no improvement in acidosis despite repeated sodium bicarbonate infusions.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10% dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment.

Anecdotal reports of other potentially harmful "home remedies" for COVID-19 being sold or touted as a cure on the internet or by someone wishing to make a quick profit remind us that education of the general public and responsible messaging are more important now than ever.
