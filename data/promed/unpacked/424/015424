White-nose syndrome has been found in Union, Saline, Johnson and Jackson counties, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.

IDNR confirms that the disease, which has killed millions of bats in North America, was found in 5 bats submitted from the counties to the United States Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. These are the 1st confirmed records in these counties, according to IDNR.

According to the IDNR, while only a handful of bats have been found with white-nose syndrome, once a bat has the disease, it can kill up to 90 per cent of bats hibernating in the same cave.

The disease was 1st discovered in Illinois in 2013 in Hardin, LaSalle, Monroe and Pope counties.

Officials say white-nose syndrome is not known to affect people, pets or livestock but is harmful and potentially deadly to hibernating bats.

The IDNR says bats are essential to controlling pests. Not only mosquitoes, which attack people, but it helps keep pests from attacking our food sources. They say a study done 2 years ago in Illinois says that the bats keep in check the pests that attack corn crops.

The dollar amount of damage was not available, but there was an increase in pest damage to the corn crop where bats were kept out.

[It is of crucial importance to distinguish infected bats without clinical signs from those that show clear manifestations of the disease. Proper account of this distinction will allow monitoring the evolution of this novel host-parasite interaction (the fungus was introduced into North America less than 10 years ago) as well as to assess the impact on infected bat populations.
