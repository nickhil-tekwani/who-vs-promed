The Ocana Mayor's office, the Norte de Santander Governor's office,
and the Departmental [state/province] Institute of Health gave a press
conference in order to let everyone know about the [campaign] for
dengue control, due to the significant increase of [dengue] cases
registered in this region of the country. The situation led the
municipal administration to decree an "orange alert" to be attentive
to the prevention of this disease, combating the vector mosquito from
all fields.

The Governor of Ocana, Yebrail Haddad Linero, announced that so far
this year [2010] there are 29 cases in the municipality, of which 47
percent have been in children less than 15 years of age, the reason
for which he called on parents and adults in general to establish
contingency plans and measures towards preventing and stopping this
situation.

Haddad Linero thanked both the departmental Institute of Health and
the Emiro Quintero Canizares Hospital for the timely response for the
fight against _Aedes aegypti_. "We have the obligation to provide the
necessary conditions for all the Ocana inhabitants to develop their
personal integrity and for 'You can be Healthy'," added the leading
authority of Ocana. Both the mayor as well as the officials of the
departmental Institute of Health stated that constant fumigation will
not work if in the homes [occupants] do not carry out the
recommendations to avoid breeding of the mosquito that causes
[transmits] dengue [virus infection].

Although Ocana does not have decentralized health [systems], it is
necessary to adopt a series of measures to combat the mosquito vector,
_Aedes aegypti_, indicated Haddad Linero.

He requested that the representatives of IPS [health care
institutions] and EPS [health insurance agencies] organize all their
personnel to go out on the street, discover the breeding sites, and
stop the foci of contamination [reproduction]. "It is necessary to
involve everyone -- children, youths, adults, elderly, rural people,
housewives, and others to take up the campaigns to fight the
mosquito," he added. It is recommended that [water] tanks, sinks,
pots, and water buckets that can accumulate water be constantly
cleaned and scrubbed. The accumulated water must be emptied in order
to eradicate the mosquito breeding sites. He made an important call to
[school] principals, teachers, and students, to deliver the guidelines
for the care and ongoing inspection of bathrooms and sanitary
equipment. "The input of all members of society is necessary to spread
the precautions and counter the sources where the larvae reproduce."

An outbreak of chikungunya was reported in April [2010] in
south-eastern Gabon, which has also recorded cases of dengue fever
that caused no deaths, officials said on Friday [28 May 2010], at the
Centre International de Recherches Medicales of Franceville (CIRMF).

Dr Eric Leroy of CIRMF said that out of 608 total samples studied in 3
weeks (3-23 May[2010]) only for the area of Franceville, the
researchers found 82 cases of dengue fever. Among the positive cases,
15 were "doubly infected with [chikungunya and dengue] viruses which
is exceptional. Their life is not endangered but their condition
required hospitalization," Dr Leroy said.

[This is an interesting mixed chikungunya-dengue virus outbreak. Both
viruses are likely transmitted by the same _Aedes_ mosquito, but it
would be of interest to have the species of the mosquito vector(s)
confirmed.

In the 19 May 2010 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20070523.1654) Dr
Andreas Krueger reported that the potential chikungunya virus vector
is _Aedes albopictus_ in Libreville (together with _Ae. aegypti_ ssp.
_formosus_). Both species can transmit dengue virus. This was the 1st
report of the detection of _Ae. albopictus_ in Gabon.

A team from the Epidemiologic Surveillance Unit (ESU) of Iloilo
Provincial Health Office (IPHO) visited Barangay [neighborhood]
Cadapdap of this town yesterday [25 May 2010] to check the status of
15 suspected dengue cases initially reported from the said barangay.
According to IPHO assistant chief Maria Socorro Quinon, once her team
confirms that those cases are positive, it means the area has a dengue
outbreak. "An area with highest number of reported dengue cases is not
a good indication," she stressed.

Dengue is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_
mosquitoes. These are day-biting mosquitoes that breed in clear,
stagnant [not flowing] waters.

A total of 4 deaths were already recorded in Iloilo province from
January [2010] up to the present. Casualties came from the towns of
Guimbal, Oton, Pototan, and one component of the city of Passi. Last
year from 1 Jan-10 Jun [2009], a total of 286 dengue cases were
recorded by the IPHO.

So far, Quinon said that they are expecting the number of dengue cases
will increase during rainy season. June is considered the month of the
rainy season; thus, the IPHO advised the public to clean their
surroundings and to properly dispose of tin cans, empty bottles, used
tires, and other containers that are potential breeding areas of
dengue [virus]-carrying mosquitoes.

In Western Visayas region, the Department of Health 6 (DOH-6) has so
far recorded a total of 1311 cases [4 times the Jan.-June 2009 total]
-- with 7 deaths -- from January to May 8 this year [2010]. Negros
Occidental has the highest number of recorded cases at 380 with 2
deaths, followed by Bacolod City with 266 cases. Iloilo Province has
231 cases with 4 deaths, while Iloilo City has 126 cases. There were
194 cases in Capiz, 79 in Aklan, with one death, 16 in Guimaras, and
12 in Antique.

The Department of Health (DOH) has asked the public to take
precautions against dengue fever as the disease's 2nd wind seems to be
gaining strength. Lin Ting, deputy director general of the DOH's
Centers for Disease Control, said that this year's [2010] dengue fever
outbreak has come in 2 waves. Some 38 cases were recorded in the 1st
round, which started last year [2009] and extended into this spring
[2010].

After the outbreak eased off for more than one month, a 2nd wave has
struck, and the number of dengue fever cases has risen to 7, mainly in
Kaohsiung City. "The public should be on alert against the latest
round of dengue fever," Lin cautioned, noting that the mosquito-borne
disease [virus] is usually prevalent at this time of year. Because no
vaccine exists for the disease, Lin said the most effective step that
can be taken against it is to eliminate potential breeding grounds for
the mosquitoes by cleaning up containers with standing water.

Today [25 May 2010], Dr Yorn Jiranakorn, chief of Pattani provincial
health office, alerts people that dengue may be fatal and prepares the
SRRT (surveillance rapid response team) to investigate and control a
dengue outbreak in the province after more than 400 hospitalized cases
have been reported since 1 Jan 2010. The districts with the most
reported cases are Muang, Mayo and Nong Jik district.

The trend of dengue outbreaks in Pattani province has been
continuously rising. Recently, Pattani is the 2nd province in Thailand
in terms of the number of dengue fever patients. Therefore, Pattani
Public Health Office asks people to destroy any possible habitats for
the mosquitoes around their residences every 7 days in order to stop
the mosquitoes from breeding.
