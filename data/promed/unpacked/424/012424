The southernmost province of Ca Mau posted an export revenue of USD 12
million in the first two months of 1999, a 62 percent year-on-year
decrease. The exports included, 9,751 tonnes of rice; 1,924 tonnes of
frozen shrimp; and 31.62 tonnes of cuttlefish.
The reduction was attributed to the death of shrimp in key areas.
