Over 6 frightening months, a deadly germ untreatable by most antibiotics spread in the nation's leading research hospital. Pretty soon, a patient a week was catching the bug. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health [NIH] locked down patients, cleaned with bleach, even ripped out plumbing -- and still the germ persisted.

By the end, 18 people harbored the dangerous germ, and 6 died of bloodstream infections from it. Another 5 made it through the outbreak only to die from the diseases that brought them to NIH's world-famous campus in the 1st place.

It took gene detectives teasing apart the bacteria's DNA to solve the germ's wily spread, a CSI-like saga with lessons for hospitals everywhere as they struggle to contain the growing threat of superbugs. It all stemmed from a single patient carrying a fairly new superbug known as KPC [_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ Carbapenemase-producing] - _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ that resists treatment by one of the last lines of defense, antibiotics called carbapenems.

"We never want this to happen again," said Dr. Tara Palmore, deputy hospital epidemiologist at the NIH Clinical Center. Infections at health care facilities are one of the nation's leading causes of preventable death, claiming an estimated 99 000 lives a year. They're something of a silent killer, as hospitals fearful of lawsuits don't like to publicly reveal when they outfox infection control -- yet no hospital is immune.

Wednesday [22 Aug 2012], government researchers published an unusually candid account of last year's outbreak, with some advice: Fast sequencing of a germ's genome, its full DNA, may be essential. It can reveal how drug-resistant bacteria are spreading so that doctors can protect other patients. "This is not an easy story to tell," said Dr. Julie Segre, a senior investigator at NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute. She led the genetic sleuthing that found the bug hiding in sink drains and, most chilling, even in a ventilator that had been cleaned with bleach.

Infection-control specialists at other hospitals called this detailed anatomy of an outbreak, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, important to share. "They were able to demonstrate that this sneaky little bug was able to stay alive and get transmitted in ways they hadn't quite predicted before they had the detailed genetic information," said Dr. Sara Cosgrove, associate hospital epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. "It's very revealing."

"Absolutely this could happen in any hospital," said Dr. Deverick Anderson, co-director of a Duke University infection control network that advises smaller community hospitals. This is really exciting stuff, cutting-edge technology, to try and better understand how these infections get spread," he added. That in turn may lead to new protections, important because "there's something that's very, very wrong about going to a hospital and becoming more ill."

Normally, the _Klebsiella_ bacteria live in human intestines and don't harm people with healthy immune systems. But the multidrug-resistant strain named KPC has emerged over the past decade to become a fast-growing threat in intensive care units, spreading easily between very ill people and killing half of those it sickens. Worse, people can carry KPC without symptoms unless the germs slip into the urinary tract or bloodstream -- theirs or the person's in the next bed -- through a catheter or surgical wound.

The 243-bed NIH Clinical Center, in Washington's suburbs, is a unique hospital, only treating people enrolled in government research studies. So on 13 Jun 2011, a research nurse carefully checked the medical records as a New York City hospital transferred a study participant who had become critically ill with a rare lung disease. The nurse found that the patient had KPC as well. The woman went into strict isolation: Everyone entering her room donned a protective gown and gloves and rigorously washed their hands. Her medical equipment got special decontamination. All other patients in the ICU had their throats and groins tested regularly to see if the bug was spreading. All seemed OK. The woman recovered, and went home on 15 Jul 2011.

Fast forward 3 weeks. Now a man with cancer has KPC despite never crossing paths with Patient No. 1. 10 days later, a woman with an immune disease fell ill, too. Both died of the infection. Did they arrive carrying their own KPC bacteria, or did that 1st patient's germ somehow escape into the hospital? Standard tests couldn't tell. Segre, the geneticist, turned to DNA.

As bacteria multiply, mistakes appear and are repaired in their genetic code. Sequencing that genome allowed Segre to follow differences in single genetic letters like a trail of the germ's transmission and evolution. Sure enough, the KPC originated from the New York patient despite NIH's precautions. Testing bacteria from the 17 additional patients who ultimately caught it shows the KPC was transmitted 3 separate times from Patient No. 1, and then spread more widely.

Even this sophisticated technology couldn't prove exactly how transmission occurred. But it turns out that Patient 3 had been in the ICU at the same time as the New York woman and really was the next infected, silently carrying the bug longer before becoming sick. That was enough time for Patient 3's infection to spread to Patient 2, who just got sick faster.

Meanwhile, NIH was making big changes. All the ICU patients underwent more invasive testing, using rectal swabs, to check for silent germ carriers. A new wall created a separate ICU to house them. Doctors, nurses, even janitors assigned there could work nowhere else, and monitors were paid to make sure everyone followed infection-control rules.

Yet a patient a week was either becoming infected or found to be a silent carrier of the same KPC strain. "Honestly, we were very scared at that point," Segre recalled. Test after test never found the bug on hospital workers' hands. Tainted objects like the ventilator couldn't be ruled out -- but NIH adopted more complex and expensive decontamination, using robot-like machines to spray germ-killing hydrogen peroxide into the tiniest of crevices in all affected rooms and equipment. Still, November brought more bad news: The outbreak strain had escaped the ICU, as 2 patients who'd never been there now were carrying it. A new isolation room was built, and all 200-plus patients in the hospital started undergoing rectal testing.

The outbreak now is over, the last carrier found in December [2011]. But NIH isn't dropping its guard. The isolation room remains, used every time one of the 7 outbreak survivors returns to the hospital for their ongoing research studies -- because they still carry the strain. Those rectal tests continue, hospital-wide once a month, to be sure no new KPC strain sneaks in.

Bacterial sequencing is becoming fast and cheap enough for most large hospitals to use during tough outbreaks, said Dr. Lance Peterson, microbiology and infectious disease director at NorthShore University HealthSystem in Evanston, Ill. But another lesson is how much it takes to guard against these bugs sneaking in the 1st place. Peterson said his hospital does weekly rectal testing of every ICU patient as a precaution. "There's better technology becoming available for your hospital to prevent these bacteria from spreading, and this is what you should expect from your hospital," he said.

A deadly, drug-resistant superbug outbreak that began last summer [2011] at the National Institutes of Health [NIH] Clinical Center claimed its seventh victim 7 Sep [2012], when a seriously ill boy from Minnesota succumbed to a bloodstream infection, officials said Friday [14 Sep 2012].

The boy was the 19th patient at the research hospital to contract an antibiotic-resistant strain of the bacterium _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ that arrived in August 2011 with a New York woman who needed a lung transplant. But his case marked the 1st new infection of this superbug at NIH since January [2012] -- a worrisome signal that the bug persists inside the huge brick-and-glass federal facility in Bethesda.

"It's heartbreaking," said John Gallin, the physician-researcher who directs the clinical center. "What happened this summer was a very unfortunate case. All of these cases are hugely sad cases."

The boy arrived in Bethesda in April [2012] after complications arose from a bone marrow transplant he received last year. His underlying condition -- a severe genetic defect that crippled his immune system -- increased his risk of acquiring the superbug, as did the steroids and other drugs the boy was given to combat complications from the transplant. "We worried he was set up for a bad infection," said Gallin. On 25 Jul [2012] routine rectal swabs of patients for hospital-borne infections -- a measure put in place during the worst of the outbreak last fall -- detected the superbug in the boy.

Genetic analysis showed the boy's strain matched that of the superbug that arrived last year. It eventually spread to 17 additional patients, of whom 11 died. 6 of those deaths were directly attributed to the superbug by NIH staff. The NIH did not make the outbreak public until describing it in a scientific publication last month [August 2012].

As the superbug spread last fall [2011], NIH staff members built a wall to isolate infected patients, ripped out plumbing that harbored the bacteria, hired monitors to ensure doctors and nurses were properly scrubbing their hands and even blasted patients' rooms with vaporized disinfectant.

By January [2012], those measures had apparently halted the spread. For 6 months, no new patients became infected.

But in July [2012], the boy tested positive for the superbug. Clinic staffers isolated him in the intensive-care unit and raced to treat the infection.

The boy's superbug originally appeared vulnerable to one antibiotic, but after a week of therapy, the infection grew impervious to that drug, too, Gallin said. The NIH obtained an experimental antibiotic, but it also failed.

"This kid probably got this infection because a patient who was a carrier [of the superbug] was on the same unit," said Gallin. "There was undoubtedly some intrahospital transmission despite our best efforts."

Swabs picked up the superbug on a railing outside the boy's room, but Gallin said it's impossible to know whether the boy or someone else deposited it there.

Gallin said that earlier this year, 2 other patients arrived at the clinical center carrying different strains of potentially deadly drug-resistant _Klebsiella_. Neither of those strains has spread to other patients, Gallin said. One of those 2 patients was treated at 2 hospitals in Maryland before transferring to NIH.

A deadly germ untreatable by most antibiotics has killed a 7th person at the National Institutes of Health [NIH] Clinical Center in Maryland.

The Washington Post reported the death Friday [14 Sep 2012]. NIH officials told the paper that the boy from Minnesota died 7 Sep 2012. NIH says the boy arrived at the research hospital in Bethesda in April [2012] and was being treated for complications from a bone marrow transplant when he contracted the bug.

He was the 19th patient at the hospital to contract an antibiotic-resistant strain of KPC, or [carbapenemase-producing] _Klebsiella pneumoniae_. The outbreak stemmed from a single patient carrying the superbug who arrived at the hospital last summer.

The paper reported the Minnesota boy's case marked the 1st new infection of this superbug at NIH since January.

[The news reports above refer to a recent publication describing the genomic and epidemiological investigation of an outbreak at the NIH Clinical Center that involved a strain of carbapenemase-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ (see below). Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases) are a type of beta-lactamase that degrades and thereby confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. KPCs also hydrolyze all other beta-lactam antibiotics and consequently this organism is resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics. KPCs are also resistant to multiple other classes of antibiotics such as the aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones due to linked resistance genes.

KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc) are plasmid-encoded enzymes 1st found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name). Subsequently, KPCs have been found in other organisms, including _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. KPCs are now commonly encountered in the United States, and have also been reported in other countries such as Israel, China, France, and Italy, as well as countries in central and South America.

Patients at risk of infections caused by KPC-producing microorganisms include those with prolonged hospitalization, particularly in intensive care units, those who are critically ill or immunocompromised, those exposed to invasive devices (such as, ventilators or central venous catheters), and those receiving long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The U.S. CDC has published guidelines for control of these organisms in health care facilities (Guidance for control of infections with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58(10): 256-60; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm).

Abstract. "The Gram-negative bacteria _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ is a major cause of nosocomial infections, primarily among immunocompromised patients. The emergence of strains resistant to carbapenems has left few treatment options, making infection containment critical. In 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Center experienced an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ that affected 18 patients, 11 of whom died. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on _K. pneumoniae_ isolates to gain insight into why the outbreak progressed despite early implementation of infection control procedures.

"Integrated genomic and epidemiological analysis traced the outbreak to 3 independent transmissions from a single patient who was discharged 3 weeks before the next case became clinically apparent. Additional genomic comparisons provided evidence for unexpected transmission routes, with subsequent mining of epidemiological data pointing to possible explanations for these transmissions. Our analysis demonstrates that integration of genomic and epidemiological data can yield actionable insights and facilitate the control of nosocomial transmission."

This outbreak was thought to have ended after implementation of rigorous infection control procedures at the NIH Clinical Center, but that now seems to have been overly optimistic. We await further epidemiologic investigation concerning the latest case of KPC infection at the Center to see how this occurred and what has to be done to prevent recurrence in the future. - Mod.ML
