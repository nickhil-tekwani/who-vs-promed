This afternoon [19 Jan 2016], a delegation from the Ministry of Health traveled to the department of Salto to investigate the many cases of canine leishmaniasis. As there is a risk of people being infected, health authorities declared a health emergency and began implementing an action plan.

A study by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine recorded the presence of this parasite in 60 dogs in Salto, although the investigation could not be completed due to floods that affected the department. This is a fatal disease in 90 per cent of cases if a person is not treated in time, and it affects both dogs and humans.

It is transmitted through the bite of a sandfly. Dogs are the main reservoir of leishmaniasis, so if a sandfly bites an infected dog and then bites a person, it transmits the disease.

[The city is located about 500 kilometres (310 miles) north west of Montevideo, and on the east bank of the Uruguay River across from Argentina (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salto,_Uruguay). Uruguay is considered free of leishmaniasis and is not mentioned in the comprehensive review of the global epidemiology of leishmaniasis by Alvar and colleagues (Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671). Thus this report demonstrates that leishmaniasis is now firmly established in western Uruguay, and a previous study found the vector, the sandfly in Uruguay (Salomon OD, et al. Lutzomyia longipalpis in Uruguay: the first report and the potential of visceral leishmaniasis transmission. Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2011;106(3):381-2). - Mod.EP
