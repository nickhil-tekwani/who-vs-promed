Lethal outbreaks of measles in a proximal village of Shikarpur, leave a 3-year old minor dead.

During a time-period of the last 15 days, 3 children have become victims of deadly disease while dozens of children have been infected in the outbreak.

Recently in Garhi Hassan village in Jacobabad, 2 children died and scores hospitalized due to measles, a lethal disease for babies and young children. According to the sources, 2 minors from Jacobabad have died due to the same diseases. Measles, being a deadly disease generally peaks in summer and infects the age group ranging from infants, to toddlers and minors.

As per medical experts, the respiratory disease is considered to be a highly virulent infection. Nearly 1 -- 3 of every 1000 children infected with measles are likely to die from respiratory and neurological complications.

...Common complications include diarrhea, middle ear infection and pneumonia.

Moreover, immunity to measles is passed to the children via maternal antibodies, in case the mother acquires immunity naturally without vaccination.

Epidemiological update: Measles (1 Mar 2021)
--------------------------------------------
Situation Summary

In 2021, between epidemiological week (EW)1 and EW 6, one country and one territory in the Region of the Americas have reported confirmed cases of measles: Brazil with 54 confirmed cases and French Guiana with 2 confirmed cases. Currently, only Brazil is reporting active outbreaks of measles, this event constitutes a hazard for other countries and territories in the Region of the Americas.

In 2020, a total of 9 countries in the Region of the Americas have reported a total of 8726 confirmed cases of measles, including 11 deaths: Argentina (61 cases including 1 death), Bolivia (2 cases), Brazil (8448 cases including 10 deaths), Canada (1 case), Chile (2 cases), Colombia (1 case), Mexico (196 cases), the United States of America (13 cases), and Uruguay (2 cases).

During the period from 2016 to 2021, 3 of the 6 international indicators for integrated measles/rubella surveillance were met: 1) the percentage of cases with adequate blood samples 2) the percentage of laboratory results in less than 4 days and 3) the percentage of cases with adequate investigations. However, 3 indicators have not been met: notification rate of suspected cases per 100 000 population; 2) the percentage of sites reporting weekly and 3) percentage of blood samples received by the laboratory in less or equal to 5 days (Figure 1, Figure 2). Therefore, considering these gaps among the indicators, the low vaccination coverage of the 1st and 2nd doses of vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR1 and MMR2) in many countries and territories of the Region of the Americas, the wide circulation of viruses in other Regions, and the opening of the borders, the occurrence of new outbreaks of varying magnitude in the Americas cannot be ruled out.

https://consumer.healthday.com/societal-costs-of-measles-outbreak-in-clark-county-3-4-million-2650959644.html


The overall societal costs of a measles outbreak identified in Clark County [Washington state] in 2018 to 2019 were estimated at USD 3.4 million, according to a study published online 12 Mar 2021 in Pediatrics [see below].

Jamison Pike, Ph.D., from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and colleagues estimated costs related to an outbreak of measles in Clark County between 31 Dec 2018 and 26 Apr 2019, with 72 confirmed cases, from the societal perspective. Information on costs was collected or estimated for the public health response, direct medical costs, and productivity losses.

The researchers found that the overall societal cost of the outbreak was approx. USD 3.4 million (USD 47 479 per case; USD 814 per contact). Most of the costs were incurred by the public health response to the outbreak, followed by productivity loss and direct medical costs (approx. USD 2.3 million, approx. USD 1.0 million, and approx. USD 76,000, respectively). The majority of expenditures associated with the public health response were labor costs (approx. USD 1.9 million), which were primarily containment costs (approx. USD 1.8 million).

"Our estimates of the economic burden a measles outbreak from the societal perspective, in terms of public expenditures to address the measles outbreak, private expenditures incurred as direct medical costs, and productivity losses, indicate that under vaccination can carry a substantial cost for individuals, communities, and public health institutions and underscore the value of vaccination," the authors write.

Abstract
In 2018 and 2019, the United States weathered a resurgence of measles, with over 1600 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of these cases were associated with large outbreaks in New York and a smaller outbreak in Washington (1). For the 2018-2019 school year, kindergarten coverage with 2 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine was 94.7% nationwide, 97.2% in New York, and 90.8% in Washington (2). These recent outbreaks confirmed modeling studies revealing that localized pockets of undervaccination and higher vaccine exemption rates plus exposure to travel create fertile conditions for measles spread (3,4). In previous measles studies, the significant cost of public health response activities needed to control these preventable outbreaks have been quantified (5,6).

In this issue of Pediatrics, Pike et al (7) expand on previous outbreak assessments to present a comprehensive cost evaluation of the 2019 measles outbreak in Clark County, Washington. These authors include direct medical costs; economic consequences of lost productivity due to illness, quarantine, and caregiving; and public health response costs. ...-more [not open access]

Between 2014 and 2019, roughly 1900 cases of measles, a disease that was declared by the United States to be eradicated in 2000, have been recorded. The estimated cost to contain each case (including follow-up) was USD 140 000, and the total cost to stop the spread of measles was approximately USD 266 million (1). Although immunizations help prevent millions deaths (2), the United States spends nearly USD 27 billion treating adults for diseases that could have been prevented with vaccinations (1). Some models estimate that vaccinations administered to children born in the United States from 1994-2013 will prevent 322 million illnesses, 21 million hospitalizations, and 732 000 deaths over the course of their lifetimes. The same cohort is predicted to have a net savings of USD 295 billion in direct costs and USD 1.38 trillion in total societal costs (3).

Given the role of immunization in reducing the incidence and prevalence --as well as morbidity and mortality-- of vaccine-preventable diseases(4), wider adoption of vaccination administration is necessary to reduce the associated clinical and economic burden. This article provides an overview of immunization in the United States.

The Implications of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases

Age, lifestyle, overall health, and previous vaccinations all play a role in determining which vaccines individuals need, but it is generally recommended that adults receive immunizations for influenza (flu), pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria, herpes zoster (shingles), and pneumococcal disease (5). In childhood, vaccinations are especially important. From infancy through 6 years of age, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended 14 vaccinations to help prevent diseases. Staying up-to-date on infant vaccinations is also critical, as they can take up to a week to become effective (6,7).

Every time an individual is immunized against a specific pathogen, the rate of that disease decreases along with its associated asymptomatic carrier state. For many diseases to spread successfully, a certain proportion of the population must be susceptible (8). However, when a large proportion of the population is immunized, those who are unvaccinated can benefit from a lower risk of exposure to the pathogen (known as herd immunity. (4).

If individuals continue to receive immunizations for rare diseases, the diseases may eventually become eliminated (9) Sixteen diseases are under control or considered eradicated by vaccination (10-12): varicella zoster, diphtheria, influenza, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV), measles, meningococcal disease, mumps, pneumococcal disease, rubella, shingles, tetanus pertussis, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae.

Although significant strides have been made in disease control through immunization, vaccination rates for both children and adults are well below recommended levels (13). Many patients are not aware of the recommendations for adult immunization or may not realize the importance of immunizations (14). Barriers such as lack of information, vaccine hesitancy, and lack of accessibility can interfere with immunization rates (4). Misinformation about vaccine safety can lead to more unvaccinated individuals, thereby increasing the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (15). According to the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy, "Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place and vaccine type. It is influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience and confidence.(16)."

The CDC has launched a new initiative, Vaccinate with Confidence, to help combat myths about immunization. Its 3 main priorities include protecting communities that are under-vaccinated, empowering families and healthcare professionals to start effective conversations about vaccinations, and to stop the spread of misinformation associated with vaccinations. As part of its new Vaccinate with Confidence initiative, the CDC is working with local partners and social media companies to provide accurate information and combat myths about immunization (15).

In addition to misinformation about immunizations and vaccine hesitancy, healthcare providers prioritize some vaccines over others, and many are not familiar with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for immunizations (17). Only 60% of physicians and 56% of physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses reported using official guidelines to inform their decisions regarding adult immunizations. (17) Recommended vaccinations can also be missed when healthcare providers do not have up-to-date patient vaccine records (18). ...-more]

[It clearly is much more expensive to treat unvaccinated individuals after they become infected than to vaccinate them before they become infected. The cost is financial, and also emotional, and may result in severe complications from the disease. It also impacts others who are unable to be vaccinated because of health conditions. - Mod.LK]

To the Editor -- Children are the invisible victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although they have a low risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death, they are suffering disproportionate harm from non-pharmaceutical public-health measures, including deleterious educational effects of school closures, and decreased social care, school feeding programs and health-service attendance (1). Of grave concern are the profoundly negative effects of the pandemic on childhood immunization coverage. All 6 World Health Organization Regions have reported disrupted immunization activities, with major adverse effects on routine immunization, mass vaccination campaigns (101 were cancelled in 56 countries during the first 6 months of the pandemic), outreach services and surveillance (2).

One deadly, highly infectious virus--measles--is unforgiving of immunity gaps and is certain to resurge after the COVID-19 pandemic, with a resultant catastrophic impact on young lives. The precarious measles immunity gaps resulting from suspended immunization activities and delayed campaigns are an ominous precursor to a measles resurgence. Increased malnutrition, due to effects of this pandemic on food supplies for impoverished children, and interruption of vitamin A supplementation during campaigns, may lead to increased measles-related deaths.

The recently published global report card on measles-elimination progress attempts to paint a positive picture, celebrating the increase in global 1st-dose measles vaccine coverage from 72% to 86% during 2000-2019; a concurrent increase in global second-dose measles vaccine coverage from 18% in 2000 to 71% in 2019; and the estimated 25.5 million deaths from measles averted during this time period due to this increased coverage (3).

A thorough data review, however, portends a grim future for measles. For the past decade, global first-dose measles-vaccine coverage stagnated at 85%, which has left nearly 20 million children in every annual birth cohort unprotected against measles. Second-dose coverage is inadequate to guarantee enduring immunity, and coverage is highly heterogeneous within and between countries. The inequitable risk of measles is perpetuated through immunization campaigns that regularly fail to reach children who have never received a vaccine against measles.

Measles virus is the most infectious virus on the planet. Its reproduction number of 12--18 (the average cases one case generates over the course of that case's infectious period in a susceptible population) far exceeds that of other emerging viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (which has a reproduction number of 2.5-3.5) (4). Given this incredible transmissibility and the annual accumulation of immunity gaps, the measles resurgence that commenced during 2017 and affected countries in every World Health Organization Region during 2018 and 2019 was predictable. This epidemic led to an appalling, preventable death toll (Table 1). Within just 4 years, there was an increase of 130% in estimated deaths attributed directly to measles. Those deaths do not capture delayed fatalities from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis due to persistent infection with measles virus, or deaths resulting from the array of viral and bacterial infections that exploit measles virus infection-induced 'immune amnesia' (5)

The COVID-19 pandemic distracted attention from the worst global measles pandemic of this century. The decreased measles case reporting in 2020 is falsely reassuring and was occasioned by a combination of immunity after the large-scale 2018-2019 outbreaks; COVID-19 pandemic-affected sub-optimal surveillance quality; decreased international travel; and a temporary reprieve that resulted from measures against COVID-19 that limited human contact. However, in reality, existing measles-immunity gaps remain, and the impact of COVID-19 on both routine immunization and campaigns cancelled in the countries at highest risk will provide the perfect conditions for a post-pandemic measles catastrophe, unless appropriate action is taken now.

Countries must prioritize 'catch-up' vaccination so that children who have missed out are not left vulnerable. Ensuring the confidence and safety of vaccinators demands appropriate infection-control measures, and these essential workers should be near the front of the COVID-19 vaccination queue. The rollout of vaccines against COVID-19 should include strategies to minimize further detrimental impacts on childhood immunization. Safety monitoring after approval of vaccines against COVID-19 must be robust, as loss of confidence in these vaccines could foment general vaccine hesitancy, with great harm to childhood immunization coverage.

All countries and global partners must prepare for expected measles outbreaks and apply 'prevention, preparedness, response and recovery' emergency-management principles (6). When outbreaks occur, they should be investigated to elucidate and define immunity-gap demography for targeted strengthening of immunization services.

The COVID-19 pandemic offers a platform for accelerating progress toward the elimination of measles. New tools that have assisted in contact tracing could be repurposed to enhance measles surveillance, while novel vaccine-delivery innovations under development, including microarray patches, slow-release vaccine preparations and enhanced thermostability, could contribute to reaching every child with potent measles vaccines.

Despite the current all-consuming focus on the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the ancient killer virus measles must not be neglected. The tragic avalanche of deaths from measles in 2018 and 2019 provides compelling evidence that the world cannot 'mark time' with measles. The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered a critical immunity-gap legacy, particularly in many vulnerable countries, which demands urgent action to reverse a pending measles catastrophe.
