An outbreak of deadly disease has killed cattle on Northern Rivers [New South Wales]. The deadly clostridial disease, blackleg [_Clostridium chauvoei_ infection], has been diagnosed on several properties on the North Coast in recent weeks.

North Coast Local Land Services district veterinarians said blackleg usually affected young cattle aged between 6 months and 2 years.

They become infected when they ingest contaminated feed or soil and most commonly it is seen in winter and spring when the grass is short.

District vet Liz Bolin said clinical signs of blackleg included lameness, anorexia, and decumbency. Animals can also just be found dead on the property.

"Carcasses of affected animals may appear bloated with limbs spread apart and pointing upwards," she said. [Depending on how hot it is and how long the animal has been dead, a bloated animal with upward pointing legs may be seen from other causes than just blackleg. However, an animal deceased from blackleg may have gas bubbles under the skin. - Mod.TG]

"There may be frothy, blood stained discharge from the nostrils and anus."

Blackleg is easily and effectively prevented by vaccination, either using a 5-in-1 or a 7-in-1 vaccine. It is usually recommended to vaccinate calves twice, 4 weeks apart, and then to give an annual booster. Boosting 2 to 3 weeks before anticipated risk periods may also be beneficial.

Dr Bolin said: "In the face of an outbreak, cattle should be moved from affected pastures and prophylactic antibiotics and vaccination can be implemented to prevent further deaths."

[There are numerous _Clostridium_ species. When the article speaks of 5-in-1 or 7-in-1 vaccine it is referring to the different bacterial species that particular vaccine protects against: either 5 species in 1 inoculation or 7 species in 1 inoculation.

Blackleg is a fatal disease of young cattle. It produces an acute local infection, resulting in rapid death. The name 'blackleg' derives from the fact that the site of infection is often a leg muscle, and that the affected muscle is dark in color.

"Blackleg is an acute, febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_ characterized by emphysematous swelling, usually in the heavy muscles (clostridial myositis). It is found worldwide.

Etiology
--------
_C. chauvoei_ and, less frequently, _C. septicum_, is found naturally in the intestinal tract of animals. Spores remain viable in the soil for many years and are purported to be a source of infection. Outbreaks of blackleg have occurred in cattle on farms in which recent excavations have occurred or after flooding. The organisms probably are ingested, pass through the wall of the GI [gastrointestinal] tract, and after gaining access to the bloodstream, are deposited in muscle and other tissues (spleen, liver, and alimentary tract) and may remain dormant.

Clinical findings and lesions
-----------------------------
Usually, onset is sudden, and a few cattle may be found dead without premonitory signs. Acute, severe lameness and marked depression are common. Initially, there is a fever but, by the time clinical signs are obvious, body temperature may be normal or subnormal. Characteristic edematous and crepitant swellings develop in the hip, shoulder, chest, back, neck, or elsewhere. At first, the swelling is small, hot, and painful. As the disease rapidly progresses, the swelling enlarges, there is crepitation on palpation, and the skin becomes cold and insensitive with decreased blood supply to affected areas. General signs include prostration and tremors. Death occurs within 12-48 hours. In some cattle, the lesions are restricted to the myocardium and the diaphragm.

Diagnosis
---------
A rapidly fatal, febrile disease in well-nourished young cattle, particularly of the beef breeds, with crepitant swellings of the heavy muscles suggests blackleg. The affected muscle is dark red to black and dry and spongy; it has a sweetish odor and is infiltrated with small bubbles but little edema. The lesions may be observed in any muscle, even in the tongue or diaphragm. In sheep, because the lesions of the spontaneously occurring type are often small and deep, they may be overlooked. Occasionally, the tissue changes caused by _C. septicum_, _C. novyi_, _C. sordellii_, and _C. perfringens_ may resemble those of blackleg. At times, both _C. septicum_ and _C. chauvoei_ may be isolated from blackleg lesions, particularly when the carcass is examined 24 hours or more after death, which allows time for postmortem invasion of the tissues by _C. septicum_. Field diagnoses are confirmed by laboratory demonstration of _C. chauvoei_ in affected muscle. The samples of muscle should be taken as soon after death as possible. The fluorescent antibody test for _C. chauvoei_ is rapid and reliable.

Control
-------
A multivalent vaccine containing _C. chauvoei_, _C. septicum_ and, where needed, _C. novyi_ antigens is safe and reliable for both cattle and sheep. Calves 3-6 months of age should be vaccinated twice, 4 weeks apart, followed by annual boosters prior to the anticipated danger period (usually spring or early summer). In an outbreak, all susceptible cattle should be vaccinated and treated prophylactically with penicillin (10 000 IU/kg, IM) to prevent new cases for up to 14 days. Cattle should be moved from affected pasture. Vaccine failure has been observed locally and attributed to a deficient spectrum of antigens in the vaccine. In such instances a bacterin vaccine is produced with local clostridial strains of _C. chauvoei_."
