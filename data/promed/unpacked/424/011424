Following an unexplained cluster of deaths in children from the
NGagne Diaw quarter of Thiaroye sur Mer, Dakar, Senegal, an
investigation by health and environmental authorities revealed that
the area was contaminated with lead from the informal recycling of
lead batteries. In addition, siblings and mothers of the dead
children were found to have extremely high blood lead concentrations,
in many cases above 1000 ug/L (in children, a concentration above 100
ug/L may impair neurological development, and 700 ug/L is considered
to require immediate action).

Following a formal request from Senegal, WHO has deployed an
international team consisting of a clinical toxicologist, an
environmental health specialist, and an analytical chemist. This team
has conducted clinical examinations and further environmental
investigations in NGagne Diaw. Clinical examinations have confirmed
continuing high blood lead concentrations in the original group
studied as well as in a randomly-selected group of adults and
children who were not involved in lead recycling. Many children are
showing evidence of neurological damage. Environmental investigations
have found very high concentrations of lead both outside and inside
peoples' homes. These have been mapped to an area inhabited by
approximately 950 people who are continuously exposed through
ingestion and inhalation of lead-contaminated dust.

WHO has advised the Senegalese authorities about the need for urgent
action to terminate exposure of the affected population to lead and
to provide chelation and other therapy to children with high blood
lead concentrations. Chelation therapy in children who continue to be
exposed to lead is ineffective and may exacerbate toxicity. Plans are
in hand to hospitalize the worst-affected cases, but they will then
need to be able to return to a lead-free environment. WHO has
provided chelating agents, and the clinical toxicologist has started
her systematic investigation of the population of NGagne Diaw as well
as the administration of appropriate treatment. Thorough
decontamination of the affected area of NGagne Diaw, including the
insides of homes, is a high priority.

To deal effectively with this environmental and public health
emergency, the Senegalese authorities will require urgent technical
and financial assistance from the international community. WHO is
briefing its UN and other partners about the situation in order to
facilitate the provision of the necessary resources.

[Signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in children and adults may vary slightly.

The signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in children are nonspecific
and may include irritability, loss of appetite, weight loss,
sluggishness, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, unusual
paleness (pallor) from anemia, and learning difficulties.

Although children are primarily at risk, lead poisoning is also
dangerous to adults. Signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in adults
may include pain, numbness or tingling of the extremities, muscular
weakness, headache, abdominal pain, memory loss, mood disorders
reduced sperm count, and abnormal sperm.

Lead levels in the blood are categorized into Classes I through V.
Class V is the most severe and constitutes a medical emergency. The
classes are as follows:

Class I: less than 10 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL)
Class II-A: 10 to 14 mcg/dL
Class II-B: 15 to 19 mcg/dL
Class III: 20 to 44 mcg/dL
Class IV: 45 to 69 mcg/dL
Class V: 70 or greater mcg/dL

From the levels listed in the WHO report, these would be medical emergencies.

Long term exposure to low levels of lead can result in problems from
accumulation. Likewise, short term, high level exposures are problems as well.

Health problems in children caused by elevated blood lead levels may
include nervous system and kidney damage; learning disabilities;
speech, language, and behavioral problems; poor muscle coordination;
decreased muscle and bone growth; and hearing damage.

High levels of lead in adults may lead to high blood pressure;
digestive problems; nerve disorders; cataracts; memory and
concentration problems; muscle and joint pain; pregnancy
complications including miscarriage, preterm delivery and stillbirth;
and damage to sperm-producing organs in men.

There is treatment available for most cases. For more severe cases
such as those in the above report, chelation therapy is needed in
addition to removal from lead exposure. In chelation therapy, a
chelating agent binds with the lead so that it is excreted in the
urine. Physicians may treat some Class III cases and many Class IV
cases with the oral drug succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid).

Physicians treat lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL of blood, which
fall into Class IV or V, with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
EDTA is administered through intravenous injections and may be
combined with the drug dimercaprol (BAL). Depending on the lead
level, more than one treatment may be necessary. The therapy may not
reverse damage that already has occurred in cases of severe lead intoxication.

Children with lead toxicity may also be iron deficient. Such children
are usually tested for iron deficiency and treated with iron
supplements if needed.
