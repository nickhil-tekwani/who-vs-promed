ARSENIC POISONING - BANGLADESH

The British Broadcasting Corporation reported recently that 2,276 cases of
arsenic poisoning have so far been identified in Bangladesh. The cause is
believed to be from naturally-occurring arsenic in groundwater. More than
230 experts from around the world met in Dhaka on Sunday, 8 February, 1998
to suggest possible strategies to deal with the problem. Kazi Quamruzzaman,
the conference convenor, said 67% of water samples from 8000 wells tested
had levels of contamination above the maximum permissible limits set by the
World Health Organisation.
A booklet by Dhaka Community Hospital, quoted by the BBC in the transcript
of the broadcast, states: "The Bangladesh arsenic contamination is possibly
the largest mass poisoning case in the world now."
The BBC continued: "The World Bank has offered to pay more than three
quarters of the $76m (stlg46m) cost of a government project to study the
extent of the problem, support treatment and preventative measures and
raise awareness of the problem. This must be done with caution, however.
Doctors fear a move away from underground water to surface sources could
expose water drinkers to diarrhoea that already claims thousands of lives
each year."
The victims of this contaminated water develop lesions, tumors at diverse
sites, and some develop cancer.

[Although this is not an outbreak of infectious disease, ProMED-mail also
covers outbreaks caused by toxins, and we would doubtless have also covered
the Bhopal chemical disaster in India. We feel that this item is of
sufficient interest to make an exception. - Mod.JW]
