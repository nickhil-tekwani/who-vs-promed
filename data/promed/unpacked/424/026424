[There appears to be laboratory confirmation that this is H5N1. The
OIE has received virtually no reports of Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza from West Africa previously. Key countries with active
veterinary services such as Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana have not
reported HPAI for the last ten years. Of course, low path Avian
Influenza has been recognized in Nigeria for decades - I remember
seeing clinical examples in the late 1970s.
Unfortunately, a glance at the world migratory birds routes places
the above report in a worrisome context - please see
http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/migrationmap.html.
Nigeria and the Cameroon are located right at the intersection of the
Black Sea/Mediterrean flyways and the East Atlantic Flyways. While
the outbreak location of Kaduna appears to be north of the migratory
bird flyway intersection, it is just marginally north, albeit located
in a more Sahelian ecological zone.
We need information on the extent and source of the outbreak in
Nigeria and other parts of West Africa. We will make contact there
at key institution (Veterinary College at ABU and Ibadan, Vom
National Research Institute) to try and obtain updated information.
We also need more than a cursory analysis of migratory bird pathways
and the potential for Europe and the Americas to be affected.
Surveillance for human infections in Nigeria should be ramped up at
this point as well. - Mod.PC]
