Foot-And-Mouth Disease Reported in Northwest Rwanda
---------------------------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was reported last week in the northwestern
province of Gisenyi, Rwandan Director of Animal Husbandry in the Ministry
of Agriculture and Forestry Isidore Gafarasi announced in Kigali on Monday,
according to Rwanda News Agency (RNA).
"The disease has been identified in the district of Mutura, Gishwati sector
in Gisenyi province," Gafarasi said, adding the Ministry of Agriculture has
enacted quarantines in the region to halt the spread of the disease. The
outbreak of the disease follows another that occurred in northeastern
Umutara province 5 months ago, resulting in the doubling of the prices of
milk and beef due to the quarantine imposed on cattle and their products.
According to the Gisenyi Director of Animal Husbandry Francois Kamanzi, the
outbreak is linked to an affected cow transported from the neighboring
province of Ruhengeri. "As of now, 16 cows have been found with the
disease," Kamanzi said, noting that security personnel have been deployed
to prevent any movement of cattle and their products.
While all cattle markets in the affected areas have been closed, Gafarasi
urged that "people should not take advantage of the calamity befalling
their colleagues to skyrocket prices."
