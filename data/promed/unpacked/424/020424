The Adams County SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] announced on Monday [1 Jul 2019] that a case of rabies was confirmed in Huntington Township after a man was bit by a feral cat.

On [Mon 1 Jul 2019], a York Springs resident was bit by a feral cat that, according to a press release, looked "injured or sickly" and was dragging its back end.

The cat was trapped after it bit the man and taken to the Adams County SPCA to be tested for rabies and euthanized. Rabies tests require an animal be euthanized [or deceased - Mod.TG] in order to test for the virus. The cat was then sent to the PA Diagnostic Laboratory in Harrisburg, where it tested positive for the rabies virus. The man bitten by the cat is being treated at this time, according to the Adams County SPCA.

The Adams County SPCA says it is imperative to report animal bites and scratches immediately to your family doctor so treatment can be initiated. Anyone who has been bitten, scratched by, or come in close contact with, a stray, wild, or unfamiliar animal should immediately contact their healthcare provider or call the rabies hotline at 877-PAHEALTH.

The SPCA also says rabies is completely preventable and provides these tips to stay clear of exposure to the virus.

All dogs and cats, 3 months of age and older, are required by Pennsylvania law to be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian. Consider vaccinating livestock and horses as well. It is recommended to consult with your private veterinarian if you have any questions regarding whether your animal(s) should be vaccinated against rabies.
- Reduce the possibility of your pets being exposed to rabies by not letting them roam free.
- Spay or neuter your pet; this may reduce the tendency to roam or fight and, thus, reduce the chance they will be exposed to rabies.
- Do not keep your pet's food or water outdoors; bowls can attract wild and stray animals.
- Keep your garbage securely covered.
- Do not touch or otherwise handle wild or unfamiliar animals, including cats and dogs, even if they appear friendly.
- Wild animals, particularly raccoons and bats, are the highest risk of exposure to rabies. Do not handle or go near wild animals even if they appear approachable.

[There is] a health alert in Jackson County, where at least 3 people were exposed to rabies-positive animal(s). Those animals have tested positive for rabies.

At least 2 of those cases involved a fox; the other involved a raccoon. Right now rabies cases have been reported only in the eastern part of the county.

The health department believes more animals are out since losing their homes during Hurricane Michael, so the [department] is warning you to not approach any wildlife.

Rabies is a disease attacking the nervous system and can lead to death.

"Rabies is something you don't want to play around with. It's something if you are contracted; it is fatal. There is a vaccine to prevent it [in your animals]," said T.G. Harkrider, with the Jackson County Department of Health. "If you are exposed to rabies, we can provide you with the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) that can prevent you from getting rabies."

The county's rabies alert will be in effect for the next 60 days.

Gloucester County put out rabies alerts for Woolwich and West Deptford townships on Tuesday [2 Jul 2019] after 2 animals tested positive for rabies, including one which scratched a person.

A raccoon and a fox that both tested positive for rabies were found within a 10 mi [15 km] area. Police were notified about the fox in the vicinity of 2259 Kings Highway in Woolrich on [Fri 28 Jun 2019] after it attacked a dog in the backyard of a residence, according to police. The fox was picked up by an animal shelter, while the dog was taken to a local vet to receive a rabies booster shot.

The raccoon was found near 968 Kings Highway at the Kingswick Apartments in West Deptford on [Sat 29 Jun 2019]. The animal ran up to a vehicle and scratched a person who is now receiving treatment, according to the Gloucester County Health Department.

"They are not related and are most likely separate incidences," said Wendy Carey, environmental health coordinator at the Gloucester County Health Department. "Both animals showed signs of rabies before attacking, such as a wobbly gate, drooling, and aggressive behavior."

The health department is urging all pet owners to check the vaccination status of their pets and to keep children from handling wildlife.

"We always want people to be mindful of animals they are not familiar with, strays, and wildlife in general," said Carey.

Rabies is a deadly disease contracted through the saliva of an infected animal. Anyone who has come in contact with a rabid animal should seek immediate treatment. If someone sees an animal appearing disorientated or exhibiting strange behavior, they should not handle it and, instead, should call the Gloucester County Animal Control Office at 856-881-2828.

One person has been referred to their healthcare provider after being attacked by a stray cat in York County, according to officials with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SDHEC). Officials said the possible exposure happened on [Fri 28 Jun 2019]. The short-haired black and white cat was taken to DHEC and tested positive for rabies.

There have been 74 cases of rabid animals in South Carolina this year [2019], according to DHEC. This is the 1st case taking place in York County.

Officials with DHEC urge anyone who believes they may have been in contact with an animal possibly having rabies to call their nearest DHEC office during from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. To report a bite after hours, call 1-888-847-0902.

[Animals exposed to rabies essentially receive a death sentence. A live animal without a record of rabies vaccination will be euthanized and tested for the virus. Please vaccinate your pets. Please keep records of these vaccination and keep the tags on your animals. It may save their life.

Rabies vaccination for most pets is required on an annual or 3-year basis based on the age of vaccination, the number of rabies vaccinations, and the rabies burden in the area. But vaccination of your pets is a measure of protecting both your pets and you.

Rabies is fatal in almost all individuals without proper post-exposure prophylaxis. Unfortunately, animals without a rabies-prevention vaccination are destined for death because there is no treatment for rabies.

Humans need to have the wound cleaned and dressed. An individual will likely need to receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine. The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment. PEP is quite expensive, generally in the thousands of dollars in the USA, but the alternative is death. People who have been previously vaccinated or who are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have the shot at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and, therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine given on the day of the exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14.

If a person has previously received post-exposure vaccinations or received pre-exposure vaccinations, only 2 doses of vaccine (on the day of exposure and then 3 days later) are needed. Human rabies immune globulin is not required. Your doctor and local health department will be able to guide you through the process (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html).

However, animals who have been vaccinated will need their wounds cleaned and cared for. They will be re-vaccinated and, depending upon the specific state, are likely to be quarantined for a period of time. If the bitten animal has not been vaccinated, the animal is likely to be euthanized, as it presents a risk of rabies to its owners.

The lesson is to keep your animals vaccinated. Check with your veterinarian regarding your state and county law on frequency of vaccination for your pets. Pets include dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and other animals you have contact with. - Mod.TG
