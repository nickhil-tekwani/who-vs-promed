The 1st death [of a horse] from equine encephalitis was confirmed by officials from the Ministry of Health (MINSA) this Thu 10 Sep [2015]. They also reported that they had provided clinical and epidemiological follow-up from 7 Aug - 10 Sep [2015] in Darien province. During this period 12 cases of [human] equine encephalitis were confirmed, of these, 11 cases were caused by Venezuelan equine encephalitis [VEE virus], which includes 1 death, and 1 case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE].

As for diagnosis [of encephalitis] in equine animals, 10 [cases] had a positive diagnosis of which 6 were eastern equine encephalitis, and the diagnosis for the other 4 [cases] is awaited.

In a [press] conference it was announced that [efforts] in the Darien region would be reinforced with half a million [US] dollars for prevention and control actions, and also [support] has moved from Human Relations in other regions in order to increase mitigation actions for the outbreak [in Darien] and to be able to reach the farthest corners of the province.

MIDA [Ministry of Agricultural Development, which includes veterinary services], together with MINSA, will maintain monitoring in the strengthened areas with the help of the National Border Service. ICGES [Gorgas Commemorative Institute for Health Studies] will help with field investigations and with laboratory diagnosis.

Equine encephalitis [both EEE and VEE] are diseases transmitted by mosquito bite to people, horses and other animals. These diseases are caused by viruses and are characterized by a varying and non-specific clinical presentations with symptoms that range from mild to moderate to fatal. In adults or children, symptoms may be: fever, headache, alteration of consciousness or behavior, in small children irritability. A few cases can present in a serious form, with the course presenting with tremors, convulsions, torticollis, muscle weakness, disorientation, paralysis and death.

The best way to prevent the diseases is the prevention of mosquito bites. Vaccination of equine animals is the best way to prevent the disease in them. There are no [commercially available] vaccines for humans. It is important to emphasize that people with these symptoms and signs must not self-medicate and must go to the nearest health facility.

Recommendations for the public:
- With any fever, go to the closest medical center.
- Do not self-medicate, drink lots of liquids.
- Avoid mosquito bites by using repellants, protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts, long pants), screened [[windows] in houses.
- Use bed nets as much as possible.
- Cooperate with the actions of MINSA and MIDA to improve health.
- Maintain the restriction of the entry and departure of equine animals in eastern Panama and Darien that have no record of vaccination. Help with vaccination of equine animals.

The Ministry of Health and MIDA will continue health surveillance in the entire national territory and reinforce their actions to contain this outbreak, which repeats itself cyclically, and can affect other areas, according to the [wild] bird migration routes.

[This report updates and modifies the previous reports of equine encephalitis in humans in Panama. ProMED report (03) listed below indicated that there were 8 human cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Darien province. The more recent report (above) indicates that there are 12 confirmed cases of human equine encephalitis, of which 11 cases were caused by Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV, not EEE virus), which includes 1 death, and 1 case of eastern equine encephalitis. The reason for the discrepancy between these 2 reports is not clear. Perhaps subsequent laboratory testing came up with this most recent diagnosis.

Both viruses occur in Panama. The case fatality rate for humans infected with VEEV is relatively low -- less than 1 percent, whereas it is much higher in individuals with neurological disease from EEEV infections. Children are more severely affected by VEEV infection than adults are. It would be of interest to know which VEEV subtype is involved in these cases, as subtype IAB or IC can cause massive equine epizootics over wide geographic areas with spillover to many humans. Subtype ID usually causes a few sporadic human cases (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100617.2034).
