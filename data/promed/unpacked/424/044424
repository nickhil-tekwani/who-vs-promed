Toxic algae, which can be harmful to humans and potentially deadly to animals, has been discovered in a Wrexham fishing lake. Tests carried out by Natural Resources Wales have detected a bloom of blue-green algae in the water at Acton Park. Wrexham council is now warning members of the public not to enter the lake or allow their pets to come in contact with the water.

A spokesperson for the authority said: "Following tests by Natural Resources Wales on behalf of Wrexham County Borough Council, a bloom of blue-green algae has been detected at Acton Park lake. Blue-green algae can be toxic to humans and animals if swallowed or if it comes into contact with the skin; therefore, no one should enter the lake or allow their pets to come into contact with the water. Blue-green algae is naturally occurring, usually during periods of calm warm weather."

A similar health warning was issued in September last year [2014] after blue-green algae was discovered in a popular fishing lake at Moss Valley Park in Wrexham.

There have been reports that pets and livestock have died elsewhere after drinking water containing the toxic algae. The risk to humans comes from external exposure -- prolonged contact with skin -- and from swallowing the water. Symptoms from external exposure can include skin rashes, lesions and blisters, or, in more severe cases, mouth ulcers, ulcers inside the nose, eye and/or ear irritation, and blistering of the lips. Ingesting the water can cause headaches, nausea, muscular pains, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting. Severe cases could result in seizures, liver failure or respiratory arrest.

For more information about blue-green algae, call Wrexham council on 01978 298989 or Natural Resources Wales on 0300 065 3000.

[Blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, can be deadly to a number of animals and have been responsible for the death of livestock in other parts of the world. Cyanobacteria can be found in water, soil, on rocks, and even in symbiotic relationships with some lichens. They can be found as single cells, colonies, filaments, sheets, and sometimes as balls with a hollow center.

Cyanobacteria have several types of classification, but some produce cyanotoxins. Some of the toxins are known as anatoxin-a, anatoxin-as, aplysiatoxin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, microcystin LR, nodularin R (from _Nodularia_), and saxitoxin. These toxins are neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, cytotoxic, and endotoxic and are detrimental to a wide variety of animals and can also be dangerous to humans.

Additional information about cyanobacteria, especially at they relate to human health, can be found on the Health Canada website at http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/cyanobacter-eng.php. - Mod.TG
