Lassa patient still in coma
-----------------------------
The state of health of the student suffering from Lassa fever in
Wuerzburg has not improved over night, according to the hospital.
"The patient continues being in a critical state", said the Head of the
Hospital, Professor Klaus Fleischer, on Friday morning.
The 23-year old from Schwaebisch Hall has been ventilated since Tuesday
night and is unresponsive.
(.....)
Looking for fellow passengers
--------------------------------------
Nationwide about 50 people have come forward until Thursday evening who
were thought to have been on the same flight as the student. Most of
them had contacted the authorities in Stuttgart. A short-time fellow
traveller was also registered. Fifteen friends, acquaintances and family
members -- including 4 students from Duesseldorf (where the young
woman is a student) -- as well as 37 women and men from the Hospital in
Schwaebisch Hall, where she had at first been treated, had been in contact
with the diseased.
All concerned were informed about the necessary precautions. According
to official statements, none of them has any evidence of Lassa fever so
far. The Medical Consultant of the Hospital in Schwaebisch Hall,
Fritzmartin Wink, declared in the afternoon that 2 employees of the
hospital were merely suffering from common colds.
"Within the next 24 to 48 hours it will be decided where she is going",
said Fleischer on Thursday afternoon about the patient's state. Her
renal function is impaired. A separate dialysis unit was on stand-by.
"A prognosis about the result is impossible at present", he stressed. The
student has since the night of 10-11 Jan 2000 been treated at the Mission
Hospital in Wuerzburg.
(Details about the flights used, from the Robert Koch Institute)
Time between infection and onset of disease is normally between 7
and 12 days. The student group from Duesseldorf with whom the
23-year old had been travelling weeks ago in Cote d'Ivoire has returned
well, according to Fleischer. For the fellow students the incubation
period was long over. A female friend with whom the student travelled
through Ghana afterwards is still under observation but well.

[The incubation period of Lassa fever is known to be as long as 21 days.
But the chances of any of the air passengers being infected from her are
very small indeed. The people to watch are the hospital staff who had
contact with her blood & body fluids while she was still thought to have
malaria, before she was moved to the isolation ward. - Mod.JW
