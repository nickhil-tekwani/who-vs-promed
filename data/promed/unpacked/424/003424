Government inspectors have linked Canada's latest _Escherichia coli_ [O157:H7] outbreak to a recalled batch of Butcher's Choice brand beef burgers sold across the country. The strain of _E. coli_ bacteria found in Butcher's Choice Garlic Peppercorn Beef Burgers was the same one that made 5 people sick in Ontario and Alberta, officials told a news conference on Mon 17 Dec 2012.

"All of this product was recalled from the marketplace between 12 and 15 Dec 2012," said Paul Mayers, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's vice-president of programs. The frozen burgers are sold at Loblaws stores across Canada. 2 other beef products, Cardinal Select brand Prime Rib Beef Burgers and Butcher's Choice Hickory Barbecue Beef Burgers, have also been recalled, but they have not been linked to any cases of illness. All of the beef in question was produced by Cardinal Meat Specialists Ltd. based in Brampton, Ontario.

_E. coli_ infection can cause serious illnesses, but the 5 victims of the outbreak have either recovered or are recovering. Officials acknowledged knowing about _E. coli_ cases in Canada as early as October 2012, but said they were not in a position to issue any recalls. "The identification of a case of illness with no source of the particular food associated, while it triggers investigations, cannot lead to a recall at that time," Mayers said. A patient may have eaten a number of different foods, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific source of infection, he explained. "Indeed, we took samples of the Butcher's Choice product at the time. All of those tests came back negative for (_E. coli_)," Mayers said.

Mayers reiterated the importance of cooking beef well to destroy _E. coli_ bacteria and to ensure cooking surfaces and utensils are free of uncooked beef to avoid _E. coli_ infection.

[It is not specifically stated that the serotype O157:H7 isolated from the frozen hamburger was a genetic match to the strain from the 5 cases in Ontario and Alberta. It cannot be underscored more that adequate cooking of the hamburger and rational kitchen hygiene will prevent these cases. - Mod.LL
