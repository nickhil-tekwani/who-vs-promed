Nine members of a hospital staff here have been sent home on sick leave
amid fears they could have contracted a deadly new strain of flu that
previously only infected birds, a health official said. The nine all
reported "flu-like symptoms" after coming into contact with two patients
infected with the H5N1 "bird flu," said a spokesman for the Hospital
Authority, which operates major public health services here. One of the
patients, a 54-year-old man, died last Friday and the other, a 13-year-old
girl, remained hospitalized in serious condition.
Some 90 hospital staff had contact with the pair and it was "not uncommon"
for up to 10 percent of employees to suffer minor ailments at any time, the
spokesman added. The nine staff members on sick leave had been tested for
the virus, and officials were awaiting the results, she said. Local and
international experts are frantically searching for the source of the
virus, which first appeared in humans when it killed a 3-year-old boy here
in May. A 2-year-old boy was also infected but later recovered.
The last time a new flu strain broke out in Hong Kong was in 1968. That
strain, which killed tens of thousands, became known as Hong Kong flu.
