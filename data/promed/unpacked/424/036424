The following capsule on anthrax in the former USSR was extracted from GIDEON:
filename="ANTHRAX"
International concern with anthrax in the former USSR may be traced to an
outbreak in 1979 of 96 cases of intestinal disease in Sverdlovsk. Although
this event was ascribed to contaminated meat, some suggested spread of
bacteria from a germ-warfare facility at the time.
94% of anthrax cases in these countries are reported in rural areas,
primarily in teppe and forest-steppe setting. Cattle are implicated in 65%
of human cases. Highest rates are found in males (70%), over age 14 (81%),
and during June to October.
Recent rates of approximately 0.08/100,000 have been registered. 176 to 259
[human] cases were reported annually during 1985 to 1990.
50% of cases are reported in Tajikistan and 12% in Kazakhstan. Russia and
Ukraine account for 12.9% of cases. No cases have occurred in Estonia since
1968.
[Actually there were some 80 documented pneumonic anthrax deaths in
Sverdlovsk in 1979; the number of expected deaths in the relevant military
research establishment have not been revealed. Some 450 people became ill
and hospitalised (if they survived long enough); many deaths occured at home
or during diagnosis at emergency centres. The source was certainly not
contaminated meat but an accident at the nearby military facility.
There has been an hiatus in the Russian statistics for this disease in
humans since the collapse of the USSR in 1990. From discussions with
Benyamin Cherkasskiy, D/WHO Collaborating Centre for Zoonoses, Moscow, it is
clear that a Russian reporting system is now back in place. As in many
countries this disease is largely ignored in sheep and goats. The ongoing
outbreaks indicate that individual livestock cases, including those in
cattle, are being missed. A useful multiplier for livestock to human cases
is 10:1; my Chinese colleagues use a 20:1 ratio. A surprisingly robust ratio
for human cases is that there are 200 cutaneous cases for each enteric case.
Estonia had 2 bovine deaths from anthrax in 1994 and two human cases.
Neighbouring Latvia is "probably free" not having had any livestock cases
since 1989; ditto Lithuania from 1986; Belarus having reported its last case
in 1981, reported an affected bovine in 1995 ... However, caution is needed
as the FAO Animal Health Yearbook for 1995 has yet to appear and the 1996
OIE statistics have yet to be released.
