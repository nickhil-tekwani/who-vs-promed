From: Gabriel Trueba <gabriel@mail.usfq.edu.ec>

Preliminary results of the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) of sera
from infected people in Guayaquil showed reactions with serovars such as
_L. icterohaemorrhagiae_, _L. pomona_, _L. hardjo_, _L. sejroe_, [and _L.
wolffi_. Considering the association existing between serovars and animal
species, we could speculate [that the main sources of human infection are
rats, pigs and cattle.
