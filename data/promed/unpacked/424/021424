[BSE update 2004 (04), posted on 15 May, included the following comment: "A
BSE research project, 'Experimental production of bovine tissue for the
validation of BSE diagnostic tests (SE1736)' was reportedly launched by
DEFRA in the UK several years ago. One wonders if final or interim results
of the British research are available, to spare duplications and to
complete needed data within the Japanese trials". The following response
was received from Dr Peter Barrowman, of DEFRA, on 19 May 2004: - Mod.AS]
re: BSE update 2004
-------------------
The research program of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (DEFRA), UK has included a project for the experimental production
of bovine tissues for the validation of diagnostic tests. The work has been
done by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, UK and started, in
1998, to provide a bank of tissues and body fluids, over the course of
infection, from cattle of known BSE incubation and clinical status. Groups
of calves were challenged orally with either 100g or 1g of BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy) infected bovine CNS (central nervous system) of
known infectious titre. Tissues and fluids were also produced from age
matched controls kept under similar husbandry conditions.
In the 100g challenge group, a wide range of tissue and fluid samples were
collected at 3 month intervals from 30 months post-challenge. In the 1g
challenge group, a wide range of tissues and fluids were collected at
approximately 6 month intervals from 36 months post-challenge.
The tissues and fluids from these animals have been collected following
strict protocols and are archived under ISO9001 conditions. The archive
represents a valuable resource of bovine BSE materials, which is used
within the UK program and may be supplied to those engaged elsewhere in BSE
research, particularly, but not exclusively, for the development of
diagnostic tests. As this is a limited and valuable long term resource, the
approval of requests, and release of material, is through an independent
archive advisory group (IAAG) made up of scientists with TSE (transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy) research experience.

[Dr Barrowman's expedient response is gratefully acknowledged. Interested
research parties might grasp the opportunity to approach IAAG and make good
use of the archived tissues and fluids.
Since DEFRA's research project SE1736 included long term (yet ongoing?) BSE
studies of orally-dosed bovines, significant data may have come to light.
These data may include, for example, the periods required for initial
detection of infectivity and of pathological changes in CNS and other
tissues, the onset of clinical signs, and other data which might help in
understanding BSE related epidemiological observations in the affected
countries. It would be most helpful if the accumulated, and latest,
observations become available. - Mod.AS]
