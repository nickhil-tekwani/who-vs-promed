Shore fisherman dies from saltwater-borne bacterial infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
An Eastern Shore Maryland fisherman died from a rare bacterial blood
infection caused when an open wound on his body came in contact with
contaminated marine life or saltwater, health authorities said. Dr Ann H
Webb, deputy health officer for Talbot County, refused to release details
about the death caused by _Vibrio vulnificus_, saying that she wanted to
protect the privacy of the patient's family. But Webb did say that the
fisherman was healthy until a skin abrasion became infected while he was
fishing in July 2005 on the Chesapeake Bay.
"It's very rare, and it shouldn't cause any panic," Webb told The
(Baltimore) Sun. "But we'd like to make people aware that when the Bay
temperature rises, they should not eat raw seafood. And, if they go
swimming, they should not have any open lesions, and they should rinse
themselves off well after they leave the water." The last confirmed death
from vibrio in Maryland occurred more than a quarter-century ago, health
experts said.
Although fatal, vibrio infections are rare in the Chesapeake region. About
100 people a year in the US become sick from the bacteria when they eat raw
oysters or touch contaminated fish or crabs, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 38 per cent of the people who
contract vibrio infections die.
"The most important thing is that if anybody receives a wound at the
seashore, they should wash it carefully," said John Painter, an
epidemiologist with the CDC. "If they see any changes in the wound, they
should go to a physician, who should culture the bacteria and consider
treatment with antibiotics," he said.
_V. vulnificus_ is a naturally occurring waterborne bacterium similar to
the bacterium that causes cholera. Vibrio is commonly found in the Gulf of
Mexico and other warm bodies of saltwater, reproducing more as temperatures
rise. It normally causes serious problems only to people with weakened
immune systems, according to Rita Colwell, a microbiologist at the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "Vibrio is notorious for getting
into wounds, and once it gets into the blood system, it's devastating. It
essentially liquefies the internal organs," she said.
