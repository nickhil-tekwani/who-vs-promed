Trainer John Moore and the Hong Kong Jockey Club veterinary
department may never know the identity of the virus which struck down
9 racehorses and 2 lead ponies last week [week of 11 Feb 2007].
The head of veterinary regulation, Brian Stewart, said yesterday [23
Feb 2007] that test results from the Hong Kong government
laboratories have ruled out equine influenza and it is "99 percent"
certain that the horses were not infected with an equine herpes virus.
"That has not been determined absolutely but it's looking very
unlikely, and it may be that we never get to the bottom of this
virus," Stewart said. "Horses, like people, have all sorts of unknown
viruses floating around in the population. The next step in this is
to send samples to the United Kingdom for further testing, but that
takes time as the test procedure requires additional samples, taken
14 days after the initial samples so as to see if there was a rise in
the antibodies during that period."
[On the week of 11 Feb 2007,] 9 Moore-trained horses were struck with
the mystery illness, with the main external symptoms including a
fever, and 4 runners from the yard were forced to withdraw from
racing on Tuesday's [20 Feb 2007] Lunar New Year programme.
They, along with the 2 Jockey Club ponies used to escort racehorses
at race and trial engagements, were isolated from contact with the
general horse population and Stewart is giving an optimistic report
on the minor outbreak.
"We've had one or 2 mild fevers but they look unrelated and we would
expect to see the odd one here or there at any time," he said.
"The concern is when they occur in groups or clusters and fortunately
we haven't had anything more like that. There are no new fevers in
John Moore's yard since last Monday [19 Feb 2007] and none among the
ponies for over a week. We have also established that there is no
evidence of cross-infection between John Moore's horses and the
club's lead ponies. Another week or so and I think we should be in a
position to relax a bit more about this situation."
Stewart reported that the temperatures of last week's affected horses
have now returned to normal and the horses are recovering
"uneventfully" from the effects of the virus.

[Excluding equine influenza and equine herpesvirus will leave a list
of other infectious, febrile disease agents to be (serologically)
screened. Hopefully, the event will not remain unsolved.
According to an October 2005 decision of the International Olympic
Committee, the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Equestrian Events have
been relocated from Beijing to Hong Kong. The considerations for the
said decision included Hong Kong's extensive experience in horse
racing, its status in equine health, and its world renowned
regulatory framework for equine diseases.- Mod.AS]
