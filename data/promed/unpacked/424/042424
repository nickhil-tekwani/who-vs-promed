Toscana virus meningitis in Portugal, 2002-2005
-----------------------------------------------
Toscana virus infection is endemic in Italy but
has also been documented in other Mediterranean
countries. Our aim was to investigate the
occurrence of Toscana virus (TOSV) meningitis in
children and young adults in a metropolitan area
in the north of Portugal. Cerebrospinal fluid
samples from 308 patients with the diagnosis of
meningitis and with negative bacterial culture
were tested for enteroviruses and herpesviruses
by reverse transcription PCR. Those samples that
proved negative for enterovirus and herpesviruses
were tested for Toscana virus with a commercial
reverse transcription nested PCR assay. In total,
we investigated 106 samples, collected between
May and September during the 4-year period
between 2002 and 2005 from patients younger than
30 years old. Toscana virus was the cause of
meningitis in 6 (5.6 percent) of the cases, 3
children and 3 young adults. All had a benign
course and self-limited disease. Since a 1st case
report of TOSV infection 1985 and another in
1996, both in foreign tourists, these 6 cases of
Toscana virus meningitis are, to our knowledge,
the 1st diagnosed in Portuguese inhabitants, and
they underline the need for more studies on the
prevalence of this virus in Portugal.
Introduction
-------------
With the improvement of diagnostic techniques
such as PCR, it is now possible to rapidly
diagnose viral meningitis through identification
of the pathogen [1]. In Portugal, enteroviruses
are the most frequent cause of aseptic meningitis
but, despite thorough testing, a significant
number of patients are discharged from hospital
without an etiological diagnosis [2,3]. The
inclusion of Toscana virus (TOSV) diagnosis in
the laboratory tests for enterovirus- and
herpesvirus-negative samples was an attempt to
improve the knowledge about aseptic meningitis.
Viral meningitides, including TOSV meningitis,
are non-notifiable diseases in Portugal and are
characterised by non-specific symptoms.
Consequently, their seroprevalence is unknown.
TOSV belongs to a group of sandfly fever viruses
transmitted by the sandfly (genus _Phlebotomus_),
and classified in the family _Bunyaviridae_,
genus _Phlebovirus_. Three sandfly fever viruses
have been identified in Mediterranean area:
sandfly fever Naples virus, sandfly fever
Sicilian virus, and Toscana virus. The latter is
endemic in central Italy and described as the
most frequent cause of aseptic meningitis in
children in that region [4,5]. As a consequence
of the life cycle of _Phlebotomus_, TOSV is more
frequent during summer, with a peak in August.
The most common presentation is an acute febrile
illness or meningitis, and more rarely a
meningoencephalitis [5-7]. Most of the studies on
TOSV have been done in central Italy, but the
occurrence of TOSV in other countries, such as
France, Spain, Slovenia, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey
and Egypt, has also been reported recently [8].
TOSV can be identified by culture of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a time-consuming
method with low sensitivity, but very useful for
virus characterisation and genetic studies [8].
Immunoenzymatic tests, (IgM by IFA or ELISA) are
rapid and sensitive; however cross-reactivity can
occur. Nowadays, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
is considered the method with the highest
sensitivity and specificity for virus detection
[8,9]. Many vectors implied in human diseases,
including _Phlebotomus_, are present in Portugal
[10]. The aim of this study was to investigate
the occurrence of TOSV meningitis in children and
young adults in an urban area in the north of
Portugal.
Methods
-------
During the period 2002 to 2005, we have
investigated the occurrence of TOSV in CSF
samples of aseptic meningitis patients. Aseptic
meningitis was defined by a CSF cytosis greater
than 6 leukocytes/ml and a negative bacterial
culture. RNA was extracted from the samples with
the Qiamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). Samples
that were PCR-negative for enterovirus and herpes
virus and that had been taken from patients
younger than 30 years and hospitalised between
May and September each year were tested for TOSV
with a nested RT-PCR assay purchased from
Amplimedical SpA (Toscana, N prot Kit). Each run
included a negative control (water) and a
positive control (Toscana virus positive control,
Amplimedical SpA). Some negative samples (n=26)
were tested with an in-house� nested RT-PCR
protocol with published outer and inner primers
[11].
Results
-------
Over the 4-year period (2002-2005), 308 patients
were admitted to the emergency department of our
hospital with aseptic meningitis and hospitalised
for observation and study. They were analysed by
RT-PCR for the presence of a number of viruses
known to cause meningitis (enterovirus, herpes
simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
cytomegalovirus (CMV), and West Nile virus)
during the acute phase of the disease. The
results are tabulated as follows:
PCR / No. positive / No. negative
Enterovirus / 110 / 178
Herpes simplex virus / 20 / 178
Epstein-Barr virus / 5 / 173
Cytomegalovirus / 3 / 175
West Nile virus / 0 / 15
Toscana virus / 6 / 100
Total meningitis cases 144 (47 percent)
RT-PCR for enterovirus and herpes simplex virus
were done in an order determined by the patient's
mental status at admission. CSF samples from
patients with a normal level of consciousness or
with somnolence (Glasgow Coma Scale >=14) were
analysed 1st for enterovirus, and, if this was
negative, subsequently for HSV. Samples from
patients with further impaired mental status
(Glasgow Coma Scale <14) were 1st analysed for
HSV, and then, if negative, for enterovirus.
RT-PCR for CMV and EBV was performed only in
cases with a negative result for HSV and
enterovirus. RT-PCR for West Nile virus was done
only in 15 patients aged over 60 years without
etiologic diagnosis. It was negative in all of
them.
For this study, we chose 106 of those 308 samples
to be tested for TOSV using the Amplimedical SpA
nested RT-PCR assay. This included only samples
from patients who had been admitted between May
and September in the years from 2002 to 2005 and
had been negative for enterovirus, HSV, EBV and
CMV when tested upon hospital admission. All
patients were younger than 30 years of age (range
2.5 months to 30 years). TOSV was detected in 6
(5.6 percent) of those 106 samples. Three were
children, one aged 4 years and 2 aged 8 years,
and 3 were young adults, aged 16, 23 and 30
years. Three of the patients were male. All 6
patients live in an urban area, and none of them
had a recent history of traveling abroad.
All cases had occurred between May and July, 2
cases in 2002, 3 in 2003 and one in 2005.
Admission symptoms were fever, headache and
vomiting and lasted between one and 5 days. On
admission, meningeal symptoms were present in all
patients and somnolence in 3. Two of them had
brain-computed tomography that was normal. CSF
cytosis ranged from 70 to 1,090 cells/ul, with
normal glucose and protein levels. The blood
leukocyte count varied from 5.6 to 11.8x109/L,
and C-reactive protein was normal in all
patients. All underwent only supportive treatment
with antipyretics and intravenous fluids and had
a benign and self-limited disease. They were
discharged between 4-7 days after admission. 26
of the 106 samples were examined only by an
in-house� RT-PCR assay. The sensitivity of this
assay was comparable to the commercial RT-PCR
when tested using TOSV-positive clinical samples.
All 26 samples that were only tested by this
method were negative.
Discussion
----------
In the Mediterranean countries, especially Italy
and Spain, the interest in TOSV has increased in
recent years [12-14]. PCR is the most frequent
method used for TOSV diagnosis. It can be
complemented by immuno-enzymatic tests, which are
rapid and sensitive [8,11], or culture, which in
combination with PCR is useful for genetic
characterisation of the virus. Most of the
reported cases of TOSV infections occur
throughout the summertime in the central region
of Italy, particularly in the Siena province, in
children [4,5,9,15]. A study by Valassina et al.
[5] describes the analysis of 277 meningitis
cases that occurred in Tuscany between 1995 and
1998. TOSV was identified as the cause for 58
percent of the cases admitted in the period
between June and September, and for 10 percent of
the cases admitted from May to October,
reflecting the seasonality of the infection.
Other studies investigate the seroprevalence of
TOSV in humans in southern Europe [8]. More
recent reports have demonstrated the occurrence
of TOSV in Spain, in the Granada and Madrid
provinces [8,16-18]. A study by Navarro et al.
shows that this virus is responsible for 7
percent of aseptic meningitis cases in Spain
[16]. In another Spanish study using samples
collected between 1988 and 1996, TOSV was the
cause of 8 percent of aseptic meningitis cases;
these authors analysed 1268 serum samples from
adults and children for the presence of
antibodies against TOSV, and found a prevalence
of 26.2 percent [17].
Echevarria et al. [18] identified TOSV as the
cause of 8.6 percent of aseptic meningitis cases
in the region of Madrid, where 5 percent of the
healthy population were shown to have had a past
infection. Another Spanish publication on the
seroprevalence of TOSV in the community of
Madrid, comparing 2 periods (1993 to 1994 and
1999 to 2000) found past infections in 7.2
percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. It further
showed that seroprevalence is age dependent, with
the antibody prevalence increasing with age [14].
Two TOSV cases have been identified in southern
France, one of aseptic meningitis and the other
of influenza-like illness [19,20]. In addition,
several reports have been published on TOSV
infection in travelers returning from
Mediterranean countries [21-24].
The climate conditions in Portugal favor
_Phlebotomus_ survival. Two infections with TOSV,
acquired in Portugal, have been reported in the
past. Both were in male tourists, one Swedish and
one German, returning from their holidays in
Portugal in 1985 and in 1996, respectively [25,
26]. One of them had documented meningitis.
Studies on the occurrence of TOSV in Portugal
have so far not been done, and the 6 cases of
TOSV meningitis reported here are the 1st cases
diagnosed in Portuguese inhabitants. Thus, in our
opinion, the investigation of TOSV in summer
cases of meningitis in Portugal should be
continued in the future, as it is done in other
Mediterranean countries, even though the
prevalence of TOSV appears to be lower in
Portugal. Serological surveys are planned to
document the prevalence of antibodies against
TOSV in all age groups of the Portuguese
population, in order to gain a clearer picture of
the occurrence of this form of viral meningitis.
