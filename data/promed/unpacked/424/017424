An outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) was confirmed on Monday [6 Apr 2020] on a farm near the village of Wieckowice near Poznan in western Poland [Wielkopolskie/Greater Poland], less than 150 km (93 mi) from the border with Germany [see map at https://goo.gl/maps/hKd3A3sZeg3B7gFV6].

The outbreak is Poland's 2nd in 2020 and the 1st in the Poznan region, an important centre of pig farming.

The source of the infection were ASF-positive piglets that the farm owner, Smithfield Foods' subsidiary Agri Plus, purchased in mid-March [2020].

The farm in Wieckowice specialises in fattening piglets up to 30 kg [about 66 lb]. There are just over 10 000 piglets on the farm that will have to be culled, local authorities said, but the eradication of the outbreak might be slowed by safety and social distancing measures imposed in Poland in order to stop the spread of COVID-19.

The spread of ASF on pig farms and in wild boars in western Poland is a concern for Germany, Europe's top pork producer with approximately 26 million pigs. Germany is also the EU's 2nd largest pork exporter to non-EU markets, after Spain. Most German exports go to China, South Korea, and Japan. Should any of those markets -- China in particular -- classify Germany as an ASF country, it could herald a major crisis for the German pork industry.

That would also spell trouble for Polish pork producers: a Chinese ban on German pork could lead to it flooding the EU market, depressing prices.

But ASF on pig farms is just one source of potential problems for German pork producers. Another -- and more serious -- is wild boars, over which there is much less control. There have been more than 1600 ASF cases in wild boars in 2020 in Poland to date, only 600 fewer than in the whole of 2019, according to data from the General Veterinary Inspectorate.

Poland passed a special law on containing ASF in December last year [2019] that gave Polish hunting associations new powers in culling wild boar.

But the hunting associations are regularly accused of disregarding safety measures and helping, rather than curbing, the spread of the disease. In early 2020, private broadcaster TVN24 allegedly exposed the lax biosecurity measures of one of the hunting associations, prompting a criminal investigation.

The German states of Brandenburg and Saxony have both recently built fences along the border with Poland to prevent wild boars from entering.

"Jumps over large distances in the disease spread (such as within Poland, to Belgium, Hungary, the Czech Republic) clearly show the existing risk of introduction into Germany through human activity. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) is especially concerned about the situation in wild boar in Poland as the last cases are only about 10 km [6.2 mi] from the German border," said Elke Reinking, a spokesperson for FLI, Germany's federal research institute for animal health.

About 10 European countries are currently suffering from ASF, the most recent being Greece, where the 1st case was recorded in early February [2020] in the region of Serres, close to Bulgaria and North Macedonia.

[We are grateful to Sabine Zentis for submitting earlier reports on this event.

The outbreak described was caused, reportedly, by the unfortunate purchase of ASF-infected piglets; their source is not given.

COVID-19 overshadows other diseases which continue their previous pace or cause new outbreaks in humans and animals, globally. As indicated in the report, the application of control/eradication activities encounters difficulties under the pandemic conditions.

ASF has been spreading westwards in Europe, mainly through wild boar, and has become a steadily growing threat to the main pork producers which have maintained thus far their ASF-free status, such as Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, and France; Belgium managed to contain, and prevent the spread of ASF from wild boars, affected in its southern province, to domestic pigs.
