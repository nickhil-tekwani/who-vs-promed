Chagas disease has been added to the list of ailments with a significant outbreak throughout Venezuela. According to the Ministry of Health, in the 1st 3 weeks of 2014, 334 cases of the dangerous infection were recorded.

For instance, 175 cases of infection caused by the parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_ were recorded in the week of [12-18 Jan 2014], an astronomical growth compared with 4 cases recorded the same period in 2013. In one week only, the same number of cases as all the cases accumulated last year [2013] was reached, as shown in the Epidemiology Bulletin No. 3 of the Ministry of Health.

Children were most affected, accounting for 56 per cent of all cases in the 3rd week of January [2014]. The number of infected pediatric patients in the previous weeks is unknown, as the official report did not report it.

Through last September [2013], the states with the largest amount of insect-vectors included Cojedes, Barinas, Portuguesa and Guarico, based on the official numbers of the Administration of Environmental Health.

[The report above does not provide any details which allow how the patients were infected. South American trypanosomiasis caused by infection with _Trypanosoma cruzi_ is traditionally transmitted by triatomid bugs, which live in cracks and crevices in houses and feed on sleeping humans at night.

Over the past decade foodborne transmission has been increasingly recognized as an important risk factor for infection. The largest ever outbreak of oral transmission was reported from Caracas in 2007, where at least 128 schoolchildren were infected from contaminated fresh guava juice (see ProMED-mail reports below from 2007).

Congenital infection from infected pregnant mothers to their children, as well as blood transfusions, are also increasingly recognized as important routes of transmission.
