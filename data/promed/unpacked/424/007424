For your information, I am sending you the message below which we are
distributing through our EMPRES and RADISCON networks to alert our contacts
in Eastern Africa/the Horn and the Arabian Peninsula. It summarises most
of the information we have from your postings augmented by that from other
sources in Kenya. However, the situation is obviously evolving, and new
facets are being revealed, continuously.
[The EMPRES and RADISCON communication follows with minor editing changes.

This message refers to the current human and animal disease epidemic in
Kenya and Somalia of which many of you will be aware. It serves as an EARLY
WARNING MESSAGE from EMPRES and RADISCON.
The human and animal disease situation in North and North East
Kenya/Southern Somalia is alarming; some 500 people are reported to have
died in Kenya and Somalia while mortalities in animals is estimated to be
in the thousands. These figures are largely guesses and are, almost
certainly, underestimates as the whole area is even more difficult to
access than normal. Investigations are severely hampered by continuing
heavy rainfall and flooding. Rift Valley fever (RVF) has been identified as
the main cause of the human epidemic by the WHO Collaborating Centre in
South Africa and is undoubtedly a significant component of the animal
epidemic; abortions in small ruminants are now being reported. However,
some of the disease signs reported are not consistent with this disease in
animals.
Anthrax is suspected to be involved, as would be expected from the
predisposing factors in the epidemic, and there is strong clinical evidence
of bluetongue disease affecting small ruminants and even, possibly, an
antelope species (Gerenuk) in Kenya. The conditions of human and livestock
movements away from flooded areas and concentration on higher land would
also be expected to favour the transmission of other disease agents
including foot-and-mouth disease, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia,
contagious caprine pleuropneumonia and morbillivirus infections (rinderpest
and peste des petits ruminants), if present. Of domesticated livestock,
goats appear to be most severely affected at present, followed by sheep,
camels and cattle. It might be some time before the situation in animals,
and aetiological components of the disease complex, are clarified.
RVF, which affects humans and can cause very serious economic losses in
animals, especially small ruminants, is transmitted by mosquitoes and, when
weather conditions of high rainfall and flooding are favourable for
breeding of the vectors, outbreaks may reach serious dimensions and cause
extensive epidemics. The virus was originally recognised in Southern Africa
but is now endemic in much of sub-Saharan Africa. In the last two decades
West Africa has experienced epidemics. It has spread into Egypt and clearly
has the potential to spread to other regions.
An excellent description of the disease can be found in the relevant
chapter of Coetzer JAW, Thomson GR and Tustin RC (1994) Infectious Diseases
of Livestock with Special Reference to Southern Africa. Cape Town: Oxford
University Press.
Rift Valley fever virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus of the family
Bunyaviridae transmitted by mosquitoes. It is a disease of mainly ruminant
animals and humans. Classically it causes abortions of pregnant animals and
a high mortality rate in young animals, primarily small ruminants. In
humans it causes a severe influenza-like disease with occasional more
serious haemorrhagic disease, encephalitis, mortality and retinal damage
noticeable in survivors. Recent epidemics have shown higher than normal
pathogenicity in humans and mortality in livestock of all ages and this
appears to be the case in East Africa at present. Often the first signs of
an epidemic developing are abortions in small ruminants and these may not
be recognised as RVF until much later. Humans can also be infected by
contact with blood or body fluids from infected animals which may occur
during slaughtering of animals or handling of aborted foetuses and animal
tissues.
NECROPSY PROCEDURES AND HANDLING OF TISSUES FOR LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC
PURPOSES HAVE RESULTED IN MANY INFECTIONS OF DIAGNOSTICIANS AND LABORATORY
PERSONNEL, SOMETIMES WITH MOST SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. GREAT CARE SHOULD BE
EXERCISED IN HANDLING SUCH MATERIALS. LABORATORY CONFIRMATION OF RVF AND
OTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS ON MATERIAL DERIVED FROM ANIMALS WHICH COULD BE
INFECTED WITH RVF REQUIRE BIOLOGICAL CONTAINMENT FACILITIES. The risk of
human-to-human infection through direct contact appears to be very low.
Meteorological and remote sensing data (Cold Cloud Duration [CCD - a
measure of rainfall; and Normalized Difference Vegetation Images [NDVI - a
measure of vegetation density) indicate that large areas of the Horn of
Africa have experienced unseasonal and abnormally high rainfall recently
(which is continuing at present); suitable conditions exist for high
multiplication of mosquito vectors. Without wishing to be pessimistic or
alarmist, the risk exists that the RVF epidemic could expand considerably
from its present relatively restricted focus in Kenya and Somalia. The
movement of viraemic livestock could spread infection into new areas. The
presence of disease in man and his animals, and fear of its consequences,
might itself precipitate further movements of pastoralists and their
livestock (together with any epidemic diseases they are harbouring) into
other areas. It is also conceivable that the disease might even cross the
Red Sea and affect livestock in the Arabian Peninsula, for the first time
on record, if conditions exist there for mosquito reproduction. Hence this
message is to put our RADISCON National Liaison Officers ON THE ALERT.
We strongly advise the recipients of this message to be extremely vigilant
for any condition which could be suggestive of RVF (and indeed other
disease epidemics), especially if abnormal rainfall has created conditions
for the multiplication of mosquitoes. We advise you to monitor the weather
conditions and collaborate with your colleagues from the medical services.
This is not Kenya's or Somalia's problem alone; the situation has the
makings of a major international emergency and demands the highest
vigilance in disease surveillance with diligent attention to emergency
preparedness in all countries at risk.
PLEASE REPORT ANY SUSPICIONS THROUGH THE NETWORK WITHOUT DELAY. The
situation may change rapidly and we will keep you informed of any
significant developments. We stand ready to assist in any way possible.
