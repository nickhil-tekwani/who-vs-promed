Pakistan was wrong in wheat row: Australia
------------------------------------------
Independent laboratory tests in Britain have proven that Pakistan
wrongly rejected a major shipment of Australian wheat earlier in
2004, alleging that it was infected, said grain exporter AWB Ltd on
Monday, reports AFP.
The Australian monopoly wheat exporter said Britain's Central Science
Laboratory (CSL) found no sign of Karnal bunt disease in the 150
000-tonne shipment, which had previously also been cleared by
Australian scientists.
"Samples were taken under the supervision of the government of
Pakistan from all 4 ships, and CSL found no evidence of Karnal bunt
in any of the samples analysed," AMB Managing Director Andrew
Lindberg said in a statement. "AWB is pleased with the test results,
as they reaffirm Australia's reputation as a supplier of high-quality
clean, white wheat, and vindicates our position regarding the quality
of Australian wheat during the recent events in Pakistan," he added.
Karnal bunt, a fungus that gives wheat a fishy smell that makes it
unfit for human consumption, has never been detected in Australia,
and Australian experts who tested the grain said they found none in
the shipment.
Lindberg said the company had the wheat re-examined in Britain in a
bid to ensure other key markets did not reject future shipments.
Pakistan's claim that the shipment was infected prompted government
protests from Australia and threatened to undermine the country's
$3.5 billion-per-year wheat export business.
The wheat rejected by Pakistan was eventually sold to other countries
in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Javed Mahmood adds: Ministry
of Food and Agriculture on Monday rejected the claims of the
Australian Wheat Board officials who said independent tests had
proven that the wheat rejected by Pakistan was free from Karnal bunt
disease.
Dr Qadir Bux Baloch, wheat commissioner of the ministry of food and
agriculture, told Daily Times in Islamabad that the tests of
Australian wheat were carried out in the presence of both Australian
as well as Pakistani officials, which led to detection of Karnal bunt
disease. He said samples of wheat were taken in the presence of the
Australian officials and Tradesman International, the company that
imported wheat from Australia.
Dr Baloch said the fresh tests arranged by Australian Wheat Board had
no legal standing, as there was no provision of such tests in the
tenders invited by the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Supply
Corporation.
It had been clearly mentioned in the tenders that wheat would only be
tested in Pakistani labs and not abroad, he said. The wheat
commissioner said the Australian Board played no role in the deal,
which was directly between Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Supply
Corporation (PASSCO) and Tradesman International (to import 0.15
million tons of wheat). The federal government approved the import of
0.3 million tons of wheat, to meet consumption requirements.
PASSCO was allowed to import the commodity through the private
sector. Tradesman International won the tender for 0.15 million tons
of wheat in 3 equal lots, but all the lots were rejected by the
federal government when wheat proved substandard and infected with
Karnal bunt.
Dr Baloch insisted that Pakistan itself was a wheat-growing country
that exported its product, and importing disease-infected wheat could
damage the country's crop and its foreign market.

[Karnal bunt [Kb] is caused by the fungus _Tilletia indica_. The
disease was first reported in the Karnal district of India in 1930
and has since been reported in Afghanistan, Pakistan Nepal, Iraq,
Iran and Mexico. The disease was also reported in Arizona and
California in regions adjacent to Mexico in March 1996. Diseased
grain bears a fishy odor, which downgrades the grain but does not
adversely affect quality.
This long-simmering problem seems to be resolved, although not to the
satisfaction of all concerned. CSL was selected to test the samples
because it currently has 88 procedures within the Food Safety &
Quality, Microbiology and Pesticides Veterinary Medicine Groups
accredited to the ISO/IEC 17025 standard by the United Kingdom
Accreditation Service and is a world-renowned expert laboratory in
testing for Kb. In addition, the Australian Department of Fisheries
Forestry and Agricultural has independently tested over 100 samples
of current seasons grain from throughout Australia's entire wheat
belt and no Kb was found. - Mod.DH]
