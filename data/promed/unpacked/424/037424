The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) has confirmed the 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse this year [2013].

The horse, a 7-year-old Paint gelding from Disputanta in Prince George County, moved to Virginia from Mississippi 3 months ago.

A blood test showed recent infection, and officials say he contracted the disease in Virginia. The horse, which had not been vaccinated for EEE, was euthanized on 31 Aug 2013.

This is the 1st reported case of EEE in a horse in Virginia this year [2013].

So far, there have been no reported cases of West Nile Virus (WNV) in Virginia horses this year [2013].

[Vaccination is critical to protecting your horse. Immunity to EEE wanes quickly and recommendations are to vaccinate horses for EEE every 3-4 months for best protection.
