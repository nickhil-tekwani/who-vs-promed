Bubonic Plague Stabilises In Southern Malawi
--------------------------------------------
Bubonic plague, which was first reported early June in the southernmost
Malawi district of Nsanje, has now stabilised, a local administrator said.
George Chitimbe, environmental officer of Nsanje district, said that at
least 78 people have so far been suspected of having been affected by the
disease. "But it is now confinable and there is no cause for alarm," he
told PANA.
MacLean Sandiyawo, the Malawi/Mozambique border post health officer, said
he alerted the Nsanje district health officials when he got a report that
at least 80 people were affected by the disease in the Mozambican town of
Dovu, about 30 km from the border. "It only took two weeks for the disease
to spread to the Malawian side of the border," he said.
Chitimbe said quarantining the affected people mainly controls the spread
of the disease. A chemical called Coopex is spread in homes to kill the
fleas, but where there is no Coopex, communities are encouraged to boil
water and pour it in their houses.
Community health nurse Melenia Mukongwa complained that quarantining
patients sometimes becomes a headache because most of them loathe the idea
of abandoning their household duties for a week. "Some people actually run
away thereby risking further spread of the disease," she said. Mukongwa
said patients, who are normally treated with chloramphenicol, are supposed
to be observed at a quarantine area for 7 days.
