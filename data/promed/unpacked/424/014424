The number of dengue fever deaths for the 1st half of the year [2012] has soared to 60, according to new statistics garnered by the National Centre for Parisitology, Entomology and Malaria Control.

The number of cases for the 1st half of the year [2012] compared to those in 2011 has almost quadrupled, with 15 600 cases reported compared to 4604 for the same time last year [2011].

About 20 000 cases were reported in the 1st half of 2007, which saw a severe epidemic sweep the country, killing 407 throughout the year and causing 39 861 to fall ill.

The spike in cases, which experts say was triggered by a premature rainy season, has prompted the Ministry of Health to dispense 290 tonnes of the larvicide Abate -- used to kill larvae in water pots -- around the country.

Last Thursday [19 Jul 2012], 20 tonnes of Abate were distributed to 38 communes within 5 of Phnom Penh's 9 districts. National Dengue Control Program director Ngan Chan-tha said it was an effective measure. "It can last up to 3 months, but we only cover the high risk areas," he said.

World Health Organization epidemiologist Steve Bjorge maintained that the boost in larvicide distribution was not a case of too little too late, as it was impossible to predict climate and rainfall early enough to import more of the chemical.

He said the problem rested in the distribution of larvicide once it reached a province, as it was then allocated by provincial health departments.

"The provincial health departments don't operate in a scientific environment, they operate in a political environment -- they will be trying to please political powers that be -- so they're distributing in broader areas but in less than effective concentrations."

[According to the newswires above, approximately 15 600 cases and 60 fatalities due to dengue infection were reported in Cambodia during the 1st 6 months of 2012. Of these, 14 fatalities were reported from Banteay Meanchey province, 7 fatalities were from Siem Reap, and 6 fatalities were from Kampong Thom. In 2011, a total of 4626 cases and 23 deaths attributable to dengue infection were identified in Cambodia during the same period (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Cambodia (04) 20110723.2224).

According to the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) report on the dengue situation, dated 13 Jul 2012, dengue activity is still high in Cambodia. A total of 11 037 cases and 45 deaths due to dengue infection, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.4 percent, were reported between 1 Jan 2012 and 19 Jun 2012. Relatively sustained high and increasing activity of dengue infection has been reported in 2012 compared to the historic seasonal baseline; 3183 cases and 16 deaths, with a CFR of 0.5 percent for the same period in 2011 (see http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/DengueSituationUpdates/en/index.html).

Numbers of cases (deaths) due to dengue infection in Cambodia during the previous 5 years (see http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/annual.dengue.data.wpr/en/index.html):
Year / cases (deaths)
2007 / 39 851 (407)

More than 500 children are receiving treatment due to dengue infection in Mawlamyine Children's Hospital in Mon State and General Hospital in Karen State, according to local health care staff.

A local woman from Mudon Township who visited the hospital said that the 500-bed Children's Hospital in Mawlamyine does not have enough space for dengue-infected children.

Dr. Aung Nway Oo also said that more than 200 children are admitted in Pa-an General Hospital in Karen State.

Dr. Min Soe Lin, who has been providing health care at his private clinic in Mawlamyine Town for 30 years, says: "My friends from hospital said that there are not enough beds for patients. There are a lot of patients this year [2012]. About 30 patients come to my clinic every day."

In the past, dengue infection occurred only in children during the rainy season. But since last year [2011], adults have also been affected at any time of the year, according to Dr. Min Soe Lin.

"[Adults in their 30s] came to my clinic for treatment. Just a few of the patients are adults, around 10 people."

He also mentioned that although dengue incidence is increasing every year, the mortality rate is getting lower, as the infection has been occurring in the country for many years now, and people are immune to it.

Dr. Aung Nway Oo of a private clinic in Pa-an Town says: "We have fewer dengue patients than last year [2011]. Most of them are from rural areas. The number of deaths is decreasing a lot compared with previous years."

[As the newswire mentions above, dengue infection is very well known in the country, and people are aware of dengue symptoms and its severity, such as death. During the rainy season, people are alert to dengue infection, and if a child gets sick, they usually take that child for medical care, either to a private clinic or hospital. Thus, children's wards in general hospitals and children's hospitals are very crowded with dengue patients during the rainy season.

Early supportive treatment and monitoring of children with severe infections in hospitals could greatly reduce mortality. However, environmental preventive and control measures against dengue infection in communities still needs to be strengthened in order to reduce morbidity.
