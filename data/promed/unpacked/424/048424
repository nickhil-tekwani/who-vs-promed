At the press conference held today at the 73rd General Session, the Director
General of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), Dr Bernard
Vallat, accompanied by the President of the OIE, Dr Niang, and by the
President of the OIE Code Commission, Dr Alex Thiermann, gave some
indications as to certain specific issues that were discussed and adopted by
the 167 Member Countries and which are of particular interest for the public
at large. These relate in particular to the following:

1. BSE Chapter of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code

1.1 Red Muscle Meat

Based on scientific information provided by world experts, the OIE Code
Commission recommended the listing of deboned skeletal muscle meat among the
list of safe commodities. The OIE incorporated deboned skeletal muscle meat
into the list of commodities that can be safely traded regardless of the BSE
status of countries.

For this commodity to be traded freely, it has to meet certain conditions:
- It must exclude mechanically separated meat;
-It must come from cattle which were not subjected to an invasive stunning
process, prior to slaughter [because this can drive brain material into the
blood vessels in the muscle. - Mod.JW];
-Cattle must have been subjected to an ante and post mortem inspection and
cannot include suspect or positive BSE cases;
-The meat, during its processing, must be kept from possible contamination
with [BSE] specified risk material (SRM);
-It must come from animals 30 months old or younger.

This means that any country, regardless of its BSE status, should be allowed
to trade red meat as long as it can meet the conditions above, something
that was not possible under the rules of the previous OIE Terrestrial Animal
Health Code.

1.2 Blood products

Blood and blood products were also included in this safe commodity list. To
be traded freely these products must come from animals which were not
subjected to an invasive stunning process prior to slaughter [see 1.1 above].

1.3 Categorisation of countries according to the BSE risk

The 2004 OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code recognized 5 different BSE risk
categories:
- free
- provisionally free
- minimal risk
- moderate risk
- high risk

At the request of its International Committee, the OIE convened experts and
on their advice drafted a simplified 3-category system. This system focuses
on the determination of risks, and if present -- on how they are managed.
The adopted 3-category system is composed of the following:
a. negligible risk,
b. controlled BSE risk,
c. undetermined BSE risk.

In order to determine the BSE risk category of a country, [the said country]
must conduct a detailed risk assessment, identifying all potential factors
for BSE occurrence and their historic perspective. This assessment must be
accompanied by a surveillance protocol. New guidelines for surveillance were
adopted at the General Session which are based on a statistical model
developed on the basis of the results of 40 million tests conducted in
Europe.

Developing countries, due to lack of resources, may not conduct an extensive
BSE surveillance. Countries which choose not to conduct the surveillance
protocol according to the recently adopted surveillance appendix, will be
classified in the "undetermined BSE risk" category. However they will still
be able to trade, especially those commodities listed in the safe commodity
category, including deboned skeletal muscle meat.

The categorisation system is used by trading partners to determine the level
of risk and the conditions for trade on the basis of the OIE standards. In
addition to the bilateral use of this categorisation, the OIE has accepted
submissions from countries which wish to be categorised as free or
provisionally free [of BSE], according to the 2004 Code. To date, 4
countries have been recognised as provisionally free and several others are
under consideration. These will be still considered under the 2004 version
of the Code. All new submissions will be examined according to the recently
adopted Code.

2. Avian Influenza Chapter of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code

2.1 Notification requirements and compartmentalization

The adopted chapter on Avian influenza incorporates several significant
concepts that will lead to increased transparency in reporting and a more
risk-based approach to trade recommendations. The new notification
requirements include reporting on the presence of avian influenza, of low
and high pathogenicity, in poultry. Poultry is defined to include all birds
raised for commercial purposes, and the status of the country is determined
only on the presence of AI in [domestic] poultry. This means that the
presence of avian influenza in migratory water fowl should be notified
without negatively affecting the health status of the country. Since Avian
influenza is endemic in migratory water fowl, it is difficult to prevent
poultry from becoming infected. The new Avian Influenza chapter incorporates
the concept of compartmentalization, which describes the criteria for the
separation of these 2 populations through biosecurity measures. Veterinary
Services in conjunction with the industry can establish and enforce the
necessary conditions to ensure the safety of a poultry subpopulation through
compartmentalization, even when AI is found in the rest of the country.

2.2 Vaccination

The new chapter also incorporates criteria for trading commodities while
vaccination is being applied as an additional tool for the control and
eradication of AI. Vaccination should be carried out with approved vaccines
and vaccination protocols identified in the OIE Terrestrial Manual.

3. Animal Welfare Chapters of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code

Standards on animal welfare, included in 4 chapters, were adopted (i.e.
slaughter for human consumption, including religious slaughter; land and sea
transport of animals; humane killing of animals for disease control
purposes). For the 1st time, an organisation with a global mandate provides
the international community with standards in this field.

All the adopted chapters will go into effect at the conclusion of the 73rd
General Session on Friday, 27 May 2005.
