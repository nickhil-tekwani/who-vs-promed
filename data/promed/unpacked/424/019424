Kinder Surprise recall over salmonellosis outbreak risk: what to do
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Makers of a confectionary favourite beloved by kids have recalled products over a risk of salmonellosis. Ferrero is taking the precautionary action of recalling selected batches of Kinder Surprise because they might be contaminated with _Salmonella_. Only Kinder Surprise products manufactured in Belgium are affected. It relates to Kinder Surprise pack sizes 20g and 20g x 3m, of all best before dates between 11 Jul 2022 and 7 Oct 2022.

Symptoms of salmonellosis typically resolve themselves within a few days and include diarrhoea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and fever. However, symptoms can be more severe and lead to hospitalization, especially in the very young and those with weakened immune systems.

The Food Standards Agency, along with Food Standards Scotland, are advising customers to take action if they have bought this product, and return it to the store where they purchased it. This is in connection with a potential link to a salmonellosis outbreak, with a number of the cases involving young children.

Investigations led by UK Health Security Agency, Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland have found a link between reported cases of salmonellosis across the UK and the specific product produced by the Ferrero company.

In response to this, Ferrero has taken the precautionary step to undertake a product withdrawal and recall with immediate effect whilst investigations continue. The product thought to be affected have all been manufactured at the same factory. Other products manufactured by Kinder are not thought to be affected.

Tina Potter, FSA head of incidents, said: "We welcome the precautionary approach being taken by Ferrero and are advising consumers not to eat any of the products listed in the FSA alert. It is really important that consumers follow this advice to avoid the risk of becoming ill with _Salmonella_ infection.

"We know that these particular products are popular with young children, especially as Easter approaches, so we would urge parents and guardians of children to check if any products already in their homes are affected by this recall. The food business involved has voluntarily carried out this product withdrawal and recall and we are working closely with them and their competent authorities to identify the precise cause of this outbreak. We are also working closely with UK and international partners including UKHSA and Food Standards Scotland."

Dr Lesley Larkin, surveillance lead for gastrointestinal pathogens and food safety (One Health) at UKHSA, said it was also working with international public health and food safety authorities to ensure that the risk to the public is minimized.

"Symptoms of salmonellosis typically resolve themselves within a few days. However, symptoms can be more severe, especially in young children and those with weakened immune systems. Salmonella can be spread from person to person, so anyone affected should adhere to good hygiene practices such as washing hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and avoiding handling food for others where possible, if you have symptoms," she added.

[The distribution of this confection outside of the UK is unclear and the serotype thought to be involved is not stated.

Kinder Surprise (Italian: Kinder Sorpresa or Ovetto Kinder), also known as Kinder Egg or Kinder Surprise Egg, is a milk chocolate consisting of a chocolate egg surrounding a yellow plastic capsule with a small toy inside. Manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero since 1974, Kinder Surprise was originally created with children in mind, replicating an Italian Easter family tradition in which adults give children large chocolate eggs with toys inside. However, Kinder Surprise toys have become collectible for adults as well. Since 1974, 30 billion Kinder Surprise eggs have been sold worldwide (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder_Surprise). - Mod.LL
