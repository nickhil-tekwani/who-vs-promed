Abstract
--------
Background
----------
In northern Europe, bluetongue (BT) caused by the BT virus (BTV),
serotype 8, was first notified in August 2006 and numerous ruminant
herds were affected in 2007 and 2008. However, the origin and the
time and place of the original introduction have not yet been determined.

Methods and principal findings
------------------------------
4 retrospective epidemiological surveys have been performed to enable
determination of the initial spatiotemporal occurrence of this
emerging disease in southern Belgium: investigations of the 1st
recorded outbreaks near to the disease epicenter; a large anonymous,
random postal survey of cattle herds and sheep flocks; a random
historical milk tank survey of samples tested with an indirect ELISA
and a follow-up survey of nonspecific health indicators. The original
introduction of BTV into the region probably occurred during spring
2006 near to the National Park of Hautes Fagnes and Eifel when
_Culicoides_ become active.

Conclusions/significance
------------------------
The determination of the most likely time and place of introduction
of BTV8 into a country is of paramount importance to enhance
awareness and understanding and, to improve modeling of vector-borne
emerging infectious diseases.

[Determining the actual timing of the BTV-8 introduction into
northern Europe is a welcome contribution to the accumulating
knowledge regarding the "when" and, to some extent, the "where"
question; the origin and particularly the "how" and "who" questions
remain unsolved. In fact, they are the key issues with potential
implications for future possible events, which may involve also
additional orbiviruses or other vector-borne disease agents of animal and man.

Which animals or other means for virus/vector introduction reached
the suspected region in spring 2006? Were these viraemic animals or
carriers of infected vectors? Several speculations have been brought
forward, awaiting their analysis, which may involve investigations
into various routes, species, goods, international public (including
equestrian) events... For the time being, this enigmatic panzootic in
large and small ruminants, which has spread within vast parts of
Western Europe and elsewhere since 2006, remains an unfinished story.

The location of National Park of Hautes Fagnes and Eifel, shared by
Belgium and Germany, is indicated in a map, which is included in the
