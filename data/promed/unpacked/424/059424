Situation report on atypical pneumonia 9 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 3 PM 9 Apr 2003, an additional 42 patients with symptoms of atypical
pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals. They include 15 healthcare
workers (9 from Princess Margaret Hospital, 2 from United Christian
Hospital, one from Tuen Mun Hospital, one from Tseung Kwan O Hospital, one
from North District Hospital, and one from Queen Elizabeth Hospital) and 5
patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 22 were new patients and contacts
of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 142 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 4 were discharged today.
Most of the patients currently in hospital are showing positive responses
to the new treatment protocol. 118 patients are receiving treatment in
intensive care unit.
2 patients with a history of chronic disease died in hospitals, bring to 27
the total number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia. An 86-year-old
female died in Tuen Mun Hospital last night and a 35-year-old male died in
Queen Elizabeth Hospital this morning.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Nature Cumulative no. cases/ No. discharged patients/ No. deaths
(The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 241 (241)/ 72/ 27
Patients, family members & visitors 729 (729)/ 70
Total 970 (970)/ 142/
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively
late stage of infection.

[There is an excellent review article available as an early release on the
New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) website by Lee N et. al. A major
outbreak Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Hong Kong. This
article reviews the clinical course of 138 patients with SARS seen in Hong
Kong, along with clinical, laboratory, and radiographic information on
these cases. <http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa030685v1.pdf>
There is a discussion and analysis on risk factors for mortality. "In a
multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome
were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent
confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate
dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent
confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and a high absolute neutrophil
count on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval,
1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04)."
In addition, there was a presentation of the new treatment protocol
referred to in the daily Hong Kong Department of Health
updates. "Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) was also given initially to treat possible
influenza infection. If fever persisted for more than 48 hours and the
blood count showed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or both, oral ribavirin
(1.2 g, 3 times a day) and corticosteroid therapy prednisolone (1 mg per
kilogram of body weight per day) was given as a combined regimen. Patients
with persistent fever and worsening lung opacities were given intravenous
ribavirin (400 mg every 8 hours) and corticosteroid therapy (an additional
2 to 3 pulses of 0.5 g of methylprednisolone daily). Patients in whom
hypoxemia developed were given oxygen through a nasal cannula. Patients
were admitted to the ICU if respiratory failure developed, as evidenced by
an arterial oxygen saturation of less than 90 percent while the patient was
receiving 50 percent supplemental oxygen, a respiratory rate that exceeded
35 breaths per minute, or both." In the discussion section of the paper
they mention: "...the similarity of this radiographic picture to that of
bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia and the similarity of the
histologic features to those of early ARDS in postmortem studies have
prompted us to use corticosteroid in combination with ribavirin for the
treatment of SARS. In ARDS and particularly in bronchiolitis obliterans
organizing pneumonia, corticosteroid therapy has been used with some
success. The majority of our cohort appeared to have a response to
corticosteroid therapy, in addition to ribavirin, with resolution of fever
and lung opacities within 2 weeks.". - Mod.MPP]

Update on SARS 9 Apr 2003
As of 9 Apr 2003, 75 SARS patients have been discharged. 42 SARS patients
remain hospitalised.
There were 8 additional SARS cases reported today, 7 of whom are linked to
the SGH cluster comprising 5 SGH staff, 1 inpatient and 1 visitor. The 8th
additional case is a friend of the MediaCorp staff who was reported
yesterday. He was in contact with the MediaCorp staff when she was unwell.
So far, 46 persons are linked to the SGH cluster at Wards 57 and 58,
comprising 14 probable and 32 suspect SARS cases. They comprise 26 SGH
staff, 13 visitors and 7 inpatients. In addition, 9 SGH staff were admitted
for observation. All are stable except for 2 inpatients who are in serious
condition in intensive care. Apart from ring-fencing the staff and
inpatients from Ward 57 and 58 at TTSH, SGH has implemented mandatory
twice-daily temperature checks for all staff, the use of N95 masks by all
their staff, and has limited visitors to the wards. Epidemiological
investigations are in progress to determine the source of the infection.
Health screening for incoming air passengers
All passengers from SARS-affected countries disembarking at Changi Airport
have been required to complete a Health Declaration Card since 7 Apr 2003.
This was extended to all passengers and crew arriving by sea yesterday, 8
Apr 2003. From today [9 Apr 2003], this requirement would be further
extended to include passengers from all incoming flights who disembark at
Changi Airport.
Today, 25 passengers from affected areas required further screening by the
nurses at the airport. None were referred to TTSH for further assessment.
Summary of SARS cases
To date, the total number of people diagnosed with SARS is 126. Among these
are 3 children below 18 years of age. Out of the 42 patients still
hospitalised, 14 are in intensive care. Since yesterday, there were 2 new
admissions into the intensive care. The new cases are a visitor to SGH Ward
57/58 and a member of the MediaCorp staff.
The number of suspect cases admitted is 82, including 3 children (below 18
years old). The number of people under Home Quarantine Orders is 286.

[A] Update 25 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 9 Apr 2003 4:00 PM
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update25.html>

As of 9 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 242 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 10 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons
who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household
or in a health-care setting. The information contained in this update is
based on the best available information Health Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 94 probable and 101 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 31 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 6 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
So far, 49 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These
people were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.
These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 9 Apr 2003.
[B] Summary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Cases (epidemiology)
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030409_e.html>

Since yesterday, 3 additional probable cases of SARS have been reported in
Canada. A total of 97 individuals who meet the probable case definition of
SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia, including 10
deaths; 144 individuals who meet the definition of a suspect case of SARS
have also been reported in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Since SARS is a diagnosis
of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time.
At the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is estimated at
approximately 4.1 percent of probable or suspect cases (10 of 241 probable
or suspect cases). Most of the case fatalities occurred in patients with
underlying illness, and nearly all were elderly patients over the age of 70
years.

Table 1: Cumulative Number of SARS Cases Reported in Canada: 9 Apr 2003
Province/Territory: No. probable cases(1)/ No. suspected cases(1)/ Deaths(2)
British Columbia 3/ 31/ 0

Total: 97/ 144/ 10
(1)These persons may drop off the probable or suspect case list if another
cause if identified for their illness
(2)This figure is included in the number of probable cases
A summary of the current status of probable cases of SARS in Canada as of 9
Apr 2003 is presented in Table 2. 22 individuals have been discharged (23.9
percent) and of the 60 individuals currently hospitalised, 39 (65 percent)
are improving or in stable condition. In addition, nearly all of the
suspect cases reported in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have either recovered or are
presently recovering.

for epidemiologic curve of the Number of probable cases of SARS in Canada
by symptom onset date and exposure type from: 23 Feb 2003 to 9 Apr 2003
(n=76, excluding 21 for whom data is pending)
There is currently no evidence to suggest the presence of community
transmission of SARS in Canada. All identified probable cases of SARS have
been linked to either travel-related exposures, or in healthcare and
household settings (Table 3). The index case in Ontario was an individual
who travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at the Metropole Hotel, where a
cluster of SARS cases was subsequently identified (MMWR Vol 52, No. 12, 28
Mar 2003) . Upon return to Canada, disease transmission occurred in 4
members of the immediate and extended family, and nearly all subsequently
identified probable cases in Ontario have been epidemiologically linked to
exposure to the first hospitalised family member of the index case. Other
probable cases reported in Ontario as well as British Columbia have all
been attributed to travel-related exposures. Thus, there is currently no
evidence to suggest that community transmission is occurring in Canada.
Table 3: Type of exposure to probable cases of SARS in Canada: 9 Apr 2003
Exposure: Number of probable cases/ proportion
Hospital or healthcare-related setting: 70/ 72.1 percent
Household: 20/ 20.6 percent
Travel: 7/ 7.2 percent
Total number of probable cases with known exposure: 97/ 100 percent
As part of the public health measures currently being implemented, the
Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care have identified the following
potential at-risk exposures(1):
- The Scarborough Hospital, Grace Division, between 16--26 Mar 2003
- York Central Hospital in Richmond Hill, between 16--28 Mar 2003
- The Brookside/Hilltop Retirement Residence in Richmond Hill, between
26--29 Mar 2003
- Highland Funeral Home, evening of 3 Apr 2003
(1) The Centenary site of the Rouge Valley Health System (formerly
Scarborough Centenary Hospital) is no longer being identified as a
potential at-risk exposure.

[A review of the epidemiologic curve presented as part of this report
reveals the most recent date of onset of a probable case was 2 Apr 2003,
representing 7 days since the onset of the last case. The shape of the
epidemic curve suggests that the outbreak peaked during the period 17-22
Mar 2003 with a second small peak during the period 24-29 Mar 2003. Until
2 incubation periods since the date of onset of the last case has passed,
it would be premature to state definitively that transmission has been
interrupted. - Mod.MPP]

Initial PCR testing utilising primers supplied by CDC has proven negative
for the newly identified coronavirus implicated in the aetiology of SARS.
The clinical picture remains fully congruent with WHO criteria, and further
investigations are awaited. We will report these as they become available.

The government of Kazakhstan, a country whose eastern border is with China,
registered the first probable case of SARS, according to information from
the Ministry of Situations and Emergencies. The patient is 32 years old
and was hospitalized in the city of Pavlodar, with onset of respiratory
difficulties on 1 Apr 2003. There was a history of recent travel to Thailand.

[In the past 24 hours there have been 42 new cases reported in Hong Kong, 8
new cases reported in Singapore, 5 new suspected cases reported in the
United States, and 3 new probable and 7 new suspected cases reported in
Canada. With the exception of unexplained clusters in Hong Kong,
transmission still seems to be via close contact with known SARS cases,
with health care professionals are disproportionately represented in the
pool of contact cases. In Singapore, among the new clusters associated
with contact in hospitals with SARS cases, 26 out of the 46 probable cases
or 56.5 percent were in hospital staff. In Canada, 70.1 percent of the
probable cases had transmission in the health care setting, but the
percentage of healthcare workers was not given.
In the briefs section [5] there is more information on the reported case in
South Africa, with information that PCR testing for the coronavirus was
negative. A negative PCR could represent a false negative (in Peiris et
al, Coronavirus as a Possible Cause of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,
Lancet 7 Apr 2003
<http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol361/iss9364/full/llan.361.9364.early_online_publication.25243>
and posted in ProMED: SARS - Worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857, there
was mention that 45 out of 50 SARS cases tested positive by PCR for the
coronavirus, suggested a 10 percent false negative rate). Or, it is still
possible that this coronavirus is not the etiologic agent for SARS,
although the evidence seems to be mounting in favor of this being the
etiologic agent.
We have also included a brief newswire mentioning the announcement of a
probable case of SARS in Kazakhstan. Although this case is reported to
have a history of travel to Thailand, one has to consider there may have
been overland spread from China to Kazakhstan. We await official
information on this reported occurrence. The newswires are also filled
with speculations that there may be more cases of SARS in Beijing that have
not been reported. We await further information on this from official
sources as well. - Mod.MPP]
