The tick-borne disease anaplasmosis is on the rise, and is largely affecting populations over age 50, according to Bradley Tompkins, epidemiologist and program chief of tick-borne and enteric diseases for the Vermont Department of Health.

Tompkins says the department of health has tallied 2017 data, and cases of anaplasmosis doubled from last year's 200 [in 2016] to 400 [in 2017]. That number is much higher than when the department began tracking the disease. "We've been keeping track since 2008 and we started off with 3 or 4 cases a year," says
Tompkins. "Since 2010, the numbers have gone up each and every year."

Tompkins says that, like Lyme disease, anaplasmosis is transmitted by the black-legged tick. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle ache, confusion, liver inflammation, and dehydration. According to Dr. Marie George, medical director of infectious disease at Southern Vermont Medical Center, the illness can be diagnosed with a blood test, which is done through a panel test that tests for several tick-borne illnesses at once. Treatment is typically doxycycline, an antibiotic. "People usually feel better within a day," says George. Untreated, says Tompkins, the infection, which affects the liver and gets into the blood stream, affecting blood counts, can be fatal. "It can be fatal if you are not diagnosed within a timely period," says Tompkins. "Particularly if you are an older individual."

Tompkins says a unique feature of the disease is that it is affecting mainly older populations in Vermont. "It's ages 50 and above where we see a sharp increase," says Tompkins. "It's really making older Vermonters sick. It comes on like you get hit by a train. All of a sudden you feel horrible."

It's possible, Tompkins says, that younger Vermonters are getting the disease but are not experiencing symptoms. Those who are experiencing symptoms, though, are finding themselves very ill. "It hospitalizes a significant amount of the people," says Tomkins. "As many as 4 percent of Vermonters get hospitalized (when they have) Lyme disease. With anaplasmosis it's about 31 percent. That's a really high number."

Though Lyme disease remains a problem in Vermont, anaplasmosis has become a focus in emergency rooms and hospitals. George says that so far this year [2018], she has seen a much higher number of anaplasmosis diagnoses than Lyme disease. "I'm not sure whether that's because people are being more proactive about Lyme symptoms and are seeing their family doctor earlier and therefore don't get sick to the point where I'd see them at the hospital," says George.

Tompkins says that while he certainly hopes it's the case that people are being more proactive about getting treated earlier for Lyme disease, it is the case that anaplasmosis is highly prevalent. He says the increase from 200 cases in 2016 to 400 in 2017 is staggering. "It's one thing to go from 3 to 10," he says. "That's a tripling, but it's a very small number. But when you go from 200 to 400 that's a significant increase. There's no explaining that away with math."

As with other tick-borne illnesses, recommendations from the department of health and from physicians are rooted in prevention. "My mantra isn't what are we going to do about the illness after you get it, it's getting no tick bites," says George. George encourages the use of permethrin, a solution that cannot be put on the skin but is sprayed onto clothing and kills ticks on contact. It lasts on clothing for several washes. Additionally, George says, if you're doing something high-risk such as hiking or yard work, a repellant such as DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 should be used. As for natural sprays, medical professionals do not recommend them, since they are not scientifically tested.

"Natural sprays are unregulated and have not undergone rigorous testing for safety," says Dr. Trey Dobson, emergency medicine doctor at Southern Vermont Medical Center. "It is unlikely that their efficacy has been demonstrated through scientific study. If you do have exposed skin, use an EPA-registered tick repellant," says Tompkins. "There are a lot of products that claim to be safe and effective at repelling ticks, but we want people to use something that has been scientifically tested to be safe and effective." It is also recommended that when possible, long sleeves, pants, and socks are worn and that people do routine tick checks after being outdoors.

George emphasizes that ticks are extremely widespread, and that no one is immune to them. "The CDC has said the amount of tick-borne illnesses has gone up 3 times higher than they ever thought," says George. "People's risk is very high, particularly in the spring. And they should always be vigilant, always. People say all the time, 'Oh, ticks don't like me,' or 'I never had a tick bite.' I can't tell how many cases I've had of people who say 'I check myself all the time, and I still got a tick-borne illness.' You can't depend on just giving it lip service. You must do the work of prevention."

[An increased incidence of anaplasmosis can be due to either a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, or to better recognition and reporting of anaplasmosis.

_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the causative agent of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), is transmitted to humans in wooded areas of the northeastern United States by the same tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) that transmits _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the causative agent of Lyme disease; _Babesia microti_, the causative agent of babesiosis; _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the causative agent of relapsing fever; and Powassan virus, the causative agent of encephalitis . Typically, the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/. Patients may be concurrently co-infected by these pathogens.

Some individuals infected with _A. phagocytophilum_ do not become ill or experience only very mild symptoms and do not seek medical treatment. The symptoms tend to be most severe in aged or immunosuppressed people. In infected persons who are symptomatic with anaplasmosis, illness onset occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. Initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care, and the disease can be fatal. Severe infections can include prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, hemorrhages, and death.

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ are found in the blood stream, infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ Transmitted Through Blood Transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57(42): 1145-8. October 2008 [date cited], available from http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm).

Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously for all symptomatic patients suspected of having anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimal total course of 10 days. This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme disease, but is not effective therapy for patients who are co-infected with _B. microti_.
