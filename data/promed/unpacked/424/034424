The number of children coming into Colorado's largest pediatric emergency department after accidentally eating marijuana is on pace to more than double last year's total.

Michael DiStefano, the medical director of the Children's Hospital Colorado emergency department, said 9 kids so far this year [2014] have been brought into the hospital for accidental marijuana ingestion. Of those, 7 were admitted to the hospital's intensive-care unit -- most commonly for what DiStefano said was either extreme sedation or agitation. One of those kids had breathing problems that required a respirator, DiStefano said.

Most of the children admitted are between 3 and 7 years old, DiStefano said. Last year, the hospital saw 8 children in its emergency room who accidentally ate marijuana. Between 2005 and 2013, only 8 children were admitted at the hospital for unintentional marijuana ingestion, DiStefano said.

Although the numbers are still small compared with the total patient load, DiStefano said the patients at Children's are just one slice of what hospitals across the state are seeing.

"It is important to stop it before it becomes a huge problem," he said. DiStefano spoke Wednesday [21 May 2014] after Governor John Hickenlooper signed a bill attempting to do just that.

The new law, which was House Bill 1366, requires state regulators to come up with rules that make edible-marijuana products identifiable even when they are out of their packaging. Lawmakers suggested the products might all contain a unique stamp or be made in a particular shape or color.

[Cannabis can be consumed in food, and this may be an alternative for patients needing medical marijuana and not desiring to smoke/inhale it. Eating too much cannabis can cause extreme drowsiness, dizziness, inability to concentrate, diminished ability to focus, rapid heartbeat, increases or decreases in blood pressure, need for sleep, and feelings of euphoria.

Cannabis can be infused into butter or oil that is then cooked in food. Edibles, as they are typically called, usually take longer to take effect than smoking or vaporizing, often 20 minutes to an hour or more. Doses can be difficult to judge, so it is recommended to eat only small portions of an edible at a time, and wait at least an hour to assess its effects so you do not over-medicate. Edibles will kick in significantly faster if eaten on an empty stomach, rather than after a meal. In general, the therapeutic effects from eating cannabis last much longer than other consumption methods, often up to 4 hours or more, and then slowly begin to wear off.

Mixing the marijuana with lipids or fats, such as butter, tends to promote absorption of the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THC) and other cannabinoids into the bloodstream.

While these or similar guidelines are provided on many websites, it is generally intended for rationally minded adults, and generally directed at those needing medical marijuana. It is not directed toward children, especially small children, in which the adult dose would already potentially be an overdose.
