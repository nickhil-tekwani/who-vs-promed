[1] Amoebic dysentery - Philippines (Cotabato Province)

At least 56 of the more than a hundred patients from Alamada town in North Cotabato that were affected by diarrhea are positive of amoebiasis or an infection caused by the amoeba, _Entamoeba histolytica_, a local health official said.

Dr Eva Rabaya, head of the Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) in North Cotabato, said they based their reports from the results of the laboratory examinations.

This, Rabaya explained, does not mean that what hit the 4 barangays (villages) of Alamada town, which killed 7 villagers, was amoebiasis. She explained that amoebiasis is transmitted through contaminated food and water. Rabaya has already taken water samples from several sources of drinking water from the affected villages for bacteriological and physical exam. The samples were also submitted to the Bureau of Plant Industry in Davao City for possibility of contamination of hazardous and toxic chemical wastes. Rabaya said they have yet to receive all the results to determine what really hit Alamada town.

Reports of vomiting coupled with loose bowel movement (LBM) and severe stomach pains -- all considered symptoms of diarrhea, were monitored in at least 12 areas in 4 villages, which include Upper Dado, Lower Dado, Pigcawaran, and Mampurok. The IPHO in North Cotabato has already ordered some 400 families residing in the affected villages to vacate the area while investigations are still ongoing.

[Given a little better description of the symptom complex, the presence of severe abdominal pain is consistent with dysentery whereas the secretory diarrhea of cholera is painless. The diarrheal stools are also quite different in the classical illnesses with dysentery causing mucus containing bloody stools and cholera with rice water stools. Fever is also likely present in dysentery and not in cholera. It is possible that the two diseases are coexisting or that the finding reflects chronic amoebic cyst passers who have cholera but severe pain favors amoebiasis having a role. - Mod.LL

Gombe State Government [Nigeria] says it has recorded 5 cases of cholera in the state this month [May 2014] and intensifying efforts to check further occurrence of the disease. The state's epidemiologist, Dr Joshua Abubakar, said in Gombe on Wed 14 May 2014, that over 30 cases of gastroenteritis were also reported in the state recently.

Abubakar said that 5 of the 30 reported cases of vomiting and diarrhoea were confirmed as cholera. He said that the cholera cases were reported from Akko Gombe and Yamaltu/Deba local government areas of the state.

The epidemiologist said that there was no single case of cholera reported in the state in 2013. He advised the residents of the state to imbibe personal hygiene and ensure that they washed their hands with soap or potash and water, after using the toilet. He also advised them to drink clean and uncontaminated water, and wash vegetables and fruits before eating them.

[3] Amoebic dysentery - American Samoa

Health officials in American Samoa are warning the public about an amoebic dysentery outbreak which has so far affected 26 people, half of which have been admitted to the LBJ hospital. A Pacific Island Health Officers' Association Epidemiologist, Mark Duran, says the department of health is leading an investigation into the source of the parasite.

Dr Duran says amoebic dysentery is spread through contamination of human waste. "It especially attacks the intestines and invades its way into the wall of the intestines; it causes abdominal pain, it causes bloody diarrhea, fever." Dr Duran says in serious cases the parasite can travel through the body and cause abscesses especially in the liver.
