https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/01/who-experts-urge-exploring-updated-covid-19-vaccines


A World Health Organization (WHO) advisory group set up in September [2021] to examine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on vaccine performance laid out a framework today [11 Jan 2022] for assessing updated versions of COVID-19 vaccines, and the experts urged manufacturers to gather and share data on how well current and variant-specific vaccines hold up.

In other developments today [11 Jan 2022], WHO officials in Europe warned that omicron (B.1.1.529) activity is expanding eastward, carrying the biggest threats to countries with low vaccination levels. And South African researchers said omicron spreads more easily from asymptomatic people, part of what's likely driving its exponential spread.

In a statement today [11 Jan 2022], the WHO's COVID-19 vaccine composition advisory group said broader access to current vaccines is needed -- to both primary doses and booster shots -- to help curb the emergence and impact of new variants of concern (https://bit.ly/3rgADN9). They added, however, that COVID-19 vaccines that prevent infection and transmission, alongside those that prevent severe illness and death, are needed and should be developed.

The group also said that ideally vaccines should provide broad, strong, and durable protection to avoid the need for successive booster doses. Options include monovalent vaccines against circulating variants, multivalent vaccines against different variants, and a universal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that would protect against all current and future variants. Until such vaccines are available, current vaccines may need to be updated to provide recommended protection levels against omicron, as well as future variants, the group said.

At a briefing today [11 Jan 2022], the head of the WHO's European regional office said omicron is like a tidal wave moving from west to east on top of an earlier delta variant surge. Hans Henri Kluge, MD, MPH, said Europe's cases doubled over the past 2 weeks, quickly becoming dominant in the region's western countries and now spreading in the Balkans.

For example, France today [11 Jan 2022] said it expected to report another record high for cases, more than 350 000, and Swiss officials said today they expect Switzerland's cases to peak later this month [January 2022]. A forecast from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicts that, at this rate, more than 50% of Europe's population will become infected with omicron over the next 6-8 weeks. Death levels are still stable but are highest in countries with high COVID-19 activity but low vaccination levels, he said.

Due to the unprecedented illness numbers, COVID-19 hospitalizations are rising, challenging and threatening to overwhelm health systems, Kluge said. "Once again, the greatest burden of responding to this pandemic is being carried by our health and care staff, and other essential frontline workers. They also carry the highest exposure to the virus."

Findings from 2 clinical trials in South Africa suggest that the omicron variant is linked to a much higher rate of asymptomatic spread than earlier variants, which may help explain its rapid spread, even in populations that were hard hit in earlier COVID-19 surges. Both are preprint studies and not yet peer-reviewed (https://www.samrc.ac.za/media-release/preliminary-findings-studies-south-africa-indicate-omicron-has-much-higher-rate).

One that looked at the effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine in the 1st half of December [2021] found a 31% positivity rate, much higher than the 1%-2.4% the researchers saw before omicron. The other, part of the larger Sisonke study, examined people who had receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, finding an asymptomatic carriage rate of 16% during omicron circulation, compared with 2.6% during outbreaks involving earlier variants.

More global headlines
---------------------
- Brazil's health ministry officials said today [11 Jan 2022] that omicron has become the country's dominant variant, according to Reuters (https://news.yahoo.com/omicron-brazils-dominant-coronavirus-variant-123139045.html).
- The World Bank today [11 Jan 2022] said the global economic is entering a slowdown due to new threats from COVID-19 variants, as well as rises in inflation, debt, and income inequality that threaten the recovery of emerging and developing countries. It also said the slowdown in growth is due to dissipating pent-up demand for products and expiring fiscal and monetary supports (https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/01/11/global-recovery-economics-debt-commodity-inequality).
- BioNTech and its partner InstaDeep have developed and tested a computational method that they say can more quickly analyze worldwide sequencing data to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. During the trial period, the Early Warning System developed by the 2 companies ranked omicron as high risk the same day its sequence was available. The system also found that the IHU (B.1.640.2) variant detected in France -- classified by the WHO as a variant under monitoring in November [2021] -- has immune-escape properties similar to omicron but is significantly less fit [see comment below] (https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-and-instadeep-developed-and-successfully-tested-early).
- The global total today [11 Jan 2022] rose to 312 273 593 cases, and 5 501 266 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

[ProMED thanks John Klopfer (HKU) for his comment on IHU (B.1.640.2) variant detected in France ex Cameroon [edited]:

"Regarding the new French variant 'IHU' reported in ProMED posting 20220110.8700767, [it is important to note] the weakness of the variant story itself."

"The media frenzy [regarding variant B.1.640.2] prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to weigh in on Wednesday [5 Jan 2022], saying the IHU variant 'has been on our radar' but that it is not overly concerned about its emergence.

"Epidemiologists and virologists also tried to stem the rising tide of concern. One of them was Professor Francois Belloux, director at the University College London's Genetics Institute, who noted that the last detected IHU case was recorded on 6 Dec [2021] -- and that it 'does not explain a spike of cases in Southern France' and 'has not sent hundreds of people in ICU in France.'" - Mod.LK

US Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) have been critical to providing COVID-19 vaccinations to low-income and racial minority populations, finds a study yesterday [10 Jan 2022] in JAMA Network Open [see citation below].

Boston University researchers led the analysis of data from national COVID-19 surveys and 1096 FQHCs that served 25.9 million US patients from 8 Jan-2 Jul 2021. The Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program gave FQHCs, which provide primary care to underserved communities, large numbers of vaccines to help address vaccine disparities.

Of the 25.9 million patients, 0.7% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 2.9% were Asian, 17.5% were Black, 42.0% were Hispanic, 34.9% were White, and 2.0% were of other races. The proportion of Black and Hispanic patients who sought vaccines at FQHCs increased over time.

COVID-19 vaccines were equitably given to American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, and Hispanic patients (statistical equity ratio, 1.0 or higher), and 61.4% of vaccines were administered to people of color, compared with 40% of those given to racial minorities in the general US population.

Disparities among Black patients persisted (statistical equity ratio, 0.94), but they were smaller than those in the rest of the US Black population.

"These populations may not otherwise have easy access to a vaccine clinic, or may not trust other types of institutions with histories of racism or that have systematically failed them," lead author Megan Cole Brahim, PhD, MPH, said in a Boston University press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/939547).

The authors noted that addressing COVID-19 vaccine racial disparities is vital to curbing disease transmission. To that end, they said, the government should continue to fund and prioritize the use of FQHCs as vaccine providers.

"This includes direct allocation of vaccines; use of FQHC-based mobile clinics, pop-up vaccination sites, and school-based sites; and targeted outreach for Black and Hispanic patients, including pediatric populations," the researchers concluded.

A 4th dose of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine produces a good antibody response in half of kidney transplant recipients who did not respond adequately after 3 doses, according to a study involving 92 transplant patients yesterday [10 Jan 2022] in Annals of Internal Medicine [see citation below].

Researchers from the University Hospital of Strasbourg, France, gave a 4th vaccine dose to patients who had low (less than 143 binding antibody units per milliliter [BAU/mL]) anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers one month after a 3rd dose. Fifty-eight received the Moderna vaccine and 34 the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The investigators then measured anti-spike IgG titers 2-6 weeks later. They reported that, after a median of 29 days, median anti-spike IgG levels increased from 16.4 BAU/mL (interquartile range, 5.9 to 62.3 BAU/mL) to 145 BAU/mL (interquartile range, 27.6 to 243 BAU/mL), suggesting that a 4th dose of vaccine may be warranted in these patients.

Half the patients reached the threshold of 143 BAU/mL, and those who received Moderna had higher IgG titers (median, 150 vs 122 BAU/mL). The researchers also found no safety concerns with the additional dose.

Only one patient was subsequently diagnosed with mild COVID-19, and he had an anti-spike IgG level of only 28 BAU/mL one month after the 4th dose.

The study authors conclude, "We recognize that an increase in antispike IgG titers does not invariably provide protection from infection and disease, which is why we encourage longitudinal studies with a sufficient duration of follow-up."

Israeli healthcare workers who received a 3rd dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine had significantly lower rates of infection in the next 39 days, according to a single-center study yesterday [10 Jan 2022] in JAMA [see citation below].

On 30 Jul 2021, the Israel ministry of health began offering booster COVID-19 vaccines to people 60 and older, later expanding availability to younger residents. In the United States, boosters are now available to people ages 12 and older and for those 5-11 with compromised immune systems.

A team led by Tel Aviv University researchers assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among 1650 healthcare workers with normal immune systems given a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine after receiving a 2nd dose a median of 210 days before and compared them with 278 not given a booster. Participants were considered boosted if they had received a 3rd injection at least 7 days before.

Enrollment took place from 8-19 Aug 2021, after the emergence of the delta (B1617.2) variant, and follow-up ended on 20 Sep [2021]. Median participant age was 44 years, and 71.6% were women. Participants were tested for COVID-19 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) every 2 weeks, and their anti-spike protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels were assessed at baseline and one month after receipt of the booster.

During a median 39 days of follow-up, 44 of 1928 participants were diagnosed as having COVID-19, for an incidence of 0.2 per 100 000 person-days. Five booster recipients followed for a median of 26 days and 39 unboosted participants were infected, for incidence rates of 12.8 versus 116 per 100 000 person-days, respectively.

A time-dependent Cox regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.07 between those who received and didn't receive a booster. Twenty-eight (71.7%) of the 39 unboosted and 3 of 5 (60%) boosted participants had symptoms, for incidence rates of 32.7 and 5.1, respectively. aHRs for symptomatic versus asymptomatic infection were 0.07 and 0.08, respectively.

Of COVID-19 booster recipients, 953 of 1021 (93.3%) reached the maximum value measured by the antibody assay, while no significant differences were identified from baseline to follow-up among booster nonrecipients.

A post hoc analysis showed a link between lower levels of IgG and greater risk of infection, and a multivariable Cox regression found that low baseline IgG levels and earlier receipt of the initial vaccine regimen were also significantly tied to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The researchers said that the findings are in line with those from previous Israeli booster studies among multiple age-groups and those in people older than 60. "Moreover, this study addressed immunocompetent healthcare workers [those with healthy immune systems], a population not included in recent studies on the effect of booster vaccination," they wrote. "Ongoing surveillance is required to assess durability of the findings."

In a commentary in the same journal [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788105], Anna Wald, MD, MPH, of the University of Washington at Seattle, said it is important to consider whether this vaccination is a booster or 3rd dose. "The interval between vaccine doses is important in terms of resulting in durable immunity, with a longer interval more likely to establish a durable response," she wrote.

Wald said that COVID-19 booster doses could help reduce the risk of transmission of variants of concern. "This is especially critical during the current omicron [B.1.1.529] surge, as this variant appears to cause infection even in persons with vaccine-induced immunity," she said. "However, higher levels of neutralizing antibody following booster vaccination provide additional protection against the omicron variant."

A 3rd dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may result in an immune response robust and long-acting enough to obviate the need for future boosters, and formulation of novel vaccines that protect against coronavirus proteins that are less prone to mutation could lead to broader population immunity, she added.

"The evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 have not been predictable, and being prepared to respond, such as with effective vaccines and booster doses of vaccine as needed as well as with nonvaccine mitigation strategies, remains critically important to help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19," Wald concluded.

[4] COVID here to stay

[Citation: COVID is here to stay: countries must decide how to adapt. Nature. 2022; 601, 165; doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-00057-y]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From a pandemic perspective, 2022 seemed poised to begin with a hefty dose of deja vu, with COVID-19 cases on the rise in many countries in the lead-up to the new year. Meanwhile, a new coronavirus variant seemed poised to overwhelm health-care systems amid fears that vaccines -- from 1st inoculations to boosters, depending on the country -- could not be rolled out quickly enough to stem the impending tsunami of infections.

The welcome news that surges of the omicron variant are associated with less severe disease in adults than are preceding variants of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that some of pandemic modellers' worst-case scenarios will not come to pass. But life has again been disrupted. Widespread absences due to coronavirus infections have left hospitals in many countries understaffed, forced schoolchildren to return to remote learning, and limited global mobility. And even if a relatively small percentage of those infected require hospitalization, sky-high infection rates across large populations mean that many people will still face life-threatening disease and long-term disability. This is particularly true for the unvaccinated, a group that includes a large proportion of the world's population, especially children.

For those who had hoped that 2021 would be the year that put the pandemic in the past tense, it was a harsh reminder that it is still very much present. Rather than laying plans to return to the 'normal' life we knew before the pandemic, 2022 is the year the world must come to terms with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is here to stay.

Countries must decide how they will live with COVID-19 -- and living with COVID-19 does not mean ignoring it. Each region must work out how to balance the deaths, disability, and disruption caused by the virus with the financial and societal costs of measures used to try to control the virus, such as mask mandates and business closures. This balance will vary from one place to another, and with time, as more therapies and vaccines become available -- and as new variants emerge.

The emergence of the omicron variant last November [2021] highlighted the ongoing challenges of life with SARS-CoV-2. Some countries were already facing surges in the highly transmissible delta variant, but vaccines and prior infection conferred relatively high levels of protection against delta, particularly against severe disease. Many researchers -- and a fair few politicians -- hoped that future waves would be less disruptive, thanks to the build-up of immunity in populations that would keep viral circulation in check and protect most people from the severe manifestations of disease that drain health-care resources.

It was expected that mutations in the viral genome would slowly chip away at this immunity, particularly its ability to stop viral transmission. But omicron dealt a swifter and more serious blow to immunity than predicted. It is now clear that SARS-CoV-2 reinfections are more common, and that some of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines have faltered in the face of the variant. Existing vaccines, developed against an earlier variant, now require a booster to provide substantial levels of protection against infection.

But the news has not all been grim. Vaccines, particularly when boosted, still seem to provide substantial protection against severe disease and death. Early data from animal studies suggest that omicron might generate a different pathology compared with previous variants, causing greater infection of the upper respiratory tract and less infection in the lungs. Data from several countries suggest that the variant is associated with less severe disease, although whether this is due to the variant itself or widespread pre-existing immunity requires further study.

Countries have charted a variety of courses through the latest surge. Many with the resources have accelerated the distribution of vaccine boosters, but many others do not have this luxury. Some countries have reinstituted lockdowns, whereas others are holding back, waiting to see the extent to which climbing infection rates affect hospitals.

With infection rates soaring around the globe and many countries still unable to access adequate vaccine supplies, more SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern will continue to emerge. And, as omicron has illustrated, the ability to predict what course those variants will take becomes more difficult as the complexities of viral evolution and pre-existing immunity complicate the models that have previously been used to anticipate the course of the pandemic. Now modellers need to factor in the effects of vaccines, previous infections, waning immunity over time, booster shots, and viral variants -- and, as the year progresses, they will also have to consider the impact of emerging antiviral treatments.

But what is clear is that the hope that vaccines and prior infection could generate herd immunity to COVID-19 -- an unlikely possibility from the start -- has all but disappeared. It is widely thought that SARS-CoV-2 will become endemic rather than extinct, with vaccines providing protection from severe disease and death, but not eradicating the virus.

As omicron and other variants have shown, this only adds to the urgency with which vaccines must be distributed to countries that currently lack supplies. Efforts are under way to bolster vaccine production in countries such as South Africa, which have not historically been centres for vaccine manufacturing. These and other efforts to boost global access to vaccines remain in the best interests of all countries: devastating variants are particularly likely to emerge and seed blazing outbreaks in regions with low vaccination rates, and their spread will be further exacerbated where levels of testing and genomic surveillance are also low.

Fortunately, 2022 is poised to add to our defences against the pandemic. New vaccines -- such as protein-based vaccines, which might cost less and have less-stringent storage requirements than mRNA vaccines currently do -- will become more widely available. In December [2021], the World Health Organization approved the long-awaited protein vaccine made by Novavax in Gaithersburg, Maryland, for emergency use. Ongoing clinical trials will establish whether upcoming vaccine candidates that target specific coronavirus variants, or that can be inhaled or taken orally rather than injected, will also be useful. Several nasal candidates are in clinical testing, including one from CanSino in Tianjin, China, and another developed by AstraZeneca in Cambridge, UK.

Meanwhile, new antiviral drugs, formulated in tablets that can be easily administered early in the course of infection to reduce the chance of serious disease and death, offer another approach against COVID-19. In the past few months, some countries have authorized the use of 2 such drugs: molnupiravir, made by Merck in Kenilworth, New Jersey, and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics in Miami, Florida; and Paxlovid, made by Pfizer, based in New York. Data from pivotal clinical trials of other candidates are expected in the coming year.

All of these will expand the world's capacity to manage SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. They are cause for hope and optimism, but with a hefty dose of realism: the virus will continue to circulate and change, and governments must continue to rely on the guidance and advice of scientists. We will not always be able to predict the virus's path, and we must be ready to adapt with it.

[One of the most important points this article makes is that "it is widely thought that SARS-CoV-2 will become endemic rather than extinct, with vaccines providing protection from severe disease and death, but not eradicating the virus." It's critical that vaccines are distributed throughout the world to dampen circulation of the virus and consequent mutations in the genetic makeup, leading to new variants. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 33 countries including the USA (729 604), France (368 149), Italy (236 162), India (200 563), Spain (134 942), Argentina (134 439), the UK (115 280), Australia (105 155), Belgium (76 157), Turkey (74 266), Brazil (71 447), Sweden (70 641), Israel (69 838), Germany (61 205), Peru (36 764), Mexico (33 626), Portugal (33 340), Greece (32 833), Viet Nam (30 853), Canada (29 630), the Netherlands (29 039), Philippines (27 943), Switzerland (24 445), Colombia (23 074), Denmark (20 937), Bolivia (20 070), Ireland (19 290), Russia (17 525), Reunion (16 256), Serbia (13 693), Japan (13 223), Austria (11 516), and Poland (11 402) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 9560 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 9 Jan 2022 to late 10 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 75 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 41 of the 75 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and 11 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 66.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 67.3% increase in daily reported cases and 25.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 3.1 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 314.17 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.52 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
