[According to the Bangkok Post (http://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/family/302843/what-to-do-when-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-strikes), hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is caused by different types of virus called enterovirus, and the most common ones are coxsackie virus types A16, A5, A9, A10, B1, and B3, human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), and herpes simplex viruses (HSV). The virus is spread from person to person through direct contact with nose and throat discharges, blister fluid, and faeces. Therefore coughing and sneezing can spread the virus from the infected person to healthy persons. When the virus enters the body, it multiplies at the contact site such as in the throat, surrounding lymphatic nodes, stomach, and intestines. Then it gets into the blood and flows to other parts of the body such as mouth and the skin.

HFMD is a common worldwide disease that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old and is more widespread in summer and early spring. In tropical countries, it can be widespread in any season. In Thailand, it is more commonly found in the rainy season, and usually affects children under 5 years of age. The most common breeding grounds for the virus are places with lots of children such as nurseries or kindergartens.

Symptoms of the disease start to show after an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, and include low-grade fever, loss of appetite, stomachache, and pain in the mouth. Soon, blisters develop in the mouth and on the skin, commonly at the hands and feet, and sometimes at buttocks. The typical blisters are yellow with bright red borders. They usually appear in the mouth such as on the tongue, palate, velum, tonsils, or gums. Skin rashes also develop at the back of the hands and feet, or the palms. They might or might not be itchy. These rashes start of as red rashes and quickly develop into raised red spots, some with blisters. Usually, the rashes will go away within a week. There is no specific treatment for HFMD. The treatment available is just for symptom relief. Medication is prescribed according to the symptoms, such as fever, and oral anesthetic to help relieve the pain of mouth sores. It is very important to keep infected children hydrated. You can assess the hydration status by checking the pulse, skin elasticity, mouth and eye hydration, tears when they cry, and urination frequency.

There is no vaccine to protect against the viruses that cause HFMD. But children can lower their risk of being infected by washing hands with soap and water often and avoiding close contact with people with the disease. The virus is expelled out of the human body through stools following 6-8 weeks.

HFMD surveillance summaries for the WHO Western Pacific Region are posted weekly, but currently there is no information specifically related to Thailand. - Mod.CP
