Around 50 head of cattle are feared to have died from anthrax since
December 2005 in Kartaj village, 8 km from Narsinghpur, official sources
said today. "Tests on cattle samples sent to the disease investigation
laboratory at Jabalpur have confirmed anthrax," Dr P K Sharma, posted at
the government veterinary hospital, said.
After the 1st death due to suspected anthrax in December 2005, cattle in
the area were vaccinated, and a major drive was launched on 28 Feb 2006, he
said, adding that the number of deaths continued to rise, with cattle
showing typical symptoms of anthrax.
Around 50 head of cattle, including cows, bulls and calves, have died,
department sources said, adding that soon after the test report was
received from Jabalpur, the cattle were again vaccinated and fresh tissue
samples sent to Bhopal for further tests.

[Normally all livestock deaths should stop within 8-9 days of effective
vaccination. Continuing deaths suggest that either the vaccine is useless
or that the owners have been treating with antibiotics and thus killing the
live vaccine organisms before they can provide any benefit. Such a scenario
would also suggest that the local strain of _B. anthracis_ may now be
resistant to the antibiotics being used. It would be appreciated if any
ProMED-mail readers in Madhya Pradesh could enlighten us as to why in fact
this outbreak has continued. While anthrax is not unknown in Madhya
Pradesh, this is the first report in ProMED-mail. - Mod.MHJ.
