Oregon: West Nile Virus Infection Case Imported from Another State
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Oregon State Public Health Laboratory has confirmed West Nile virus
infection in a Michigan woman visiting here, health officials at the Oregon
Department of Human Services (DHS) said today. The patient was not infected
in Oregon, says Mel Kohn, M.D, state epidemiologist at DHS.
"She was bitten by mosquitoes in her home state and became ill while
traveling here. Because many people are worried about West Nile virus, we
want to emphasize that this not an illness that can be spread from one
person to another. Also, the virus has not been detected in any animals or
mosquitoes in Oregon," Kohn said. West Nile virus [is carried by] birds and
mosquitoes and can be transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The risk to
humans is relatively low and most people who become infected with West Nile
virus will have mild or no symptoms. On rare occasions, infection can
result in severe encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain, or
meningitis, an inflammation of the spinal cord and lining of the brain.
Although there is currently no risk of getting infected by West Nile virus
in Oregon, it is expected to arrive in bird populations some time in the
next year or so. The virus has been detected in every state east of the
Rocky Mountains.
