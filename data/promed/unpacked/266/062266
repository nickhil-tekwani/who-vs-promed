Atypical scrapie/Nor 98 detection in single sheep from the national flock
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAF Biosecurity New Zealand (MAFBNZ) and the New Zealand Food Safety
Authority (NZFSA) today [28 Oct 2009] confirmed that a series of New
Zealand and European laboratory tests on a single New Zealand sheep
brain have detected the condition atypical scrapie (also known as Nor
98).

Atypical scrapie/Nor 98 is a relatively recently discovered brain
condition of sheep and goats that is quite different from the
classical form of scrapie. Neither atypical scrapie/Nor 98 nor scrapie
is known to pose any risk to human health or the safety of eating meat
or animal products.

MAFBNZ Principal International Adviser Dr Stuart MacDiarmid says
global knowledge about atypical scrapie/Nor 98 is evolving. The widely
accepted mainstream scientific view is that it occurs spontaneously or
naturally in very small numbers of older sheep in all sheep
populations around the world.

"This positive detection of atypical scrapie/Nor 98 in a sheep from
New Zealand's national flock reinforces that view. Every country that
has conducted sufficient surveillance for atypical scrapie/Nor 98 has
found it in their flocks. This includes most Scandinavian and EU
countries, the UK, the USA, and Canada," he says.

The detection does not change New Zealand's status as free from
scrapie. Dr MacDiarmid says because of this scrapie freedom status,
New Zealand supplies sheep brains to the European Union for use in the
development of tests for scrapie.

"The affected brain was one of a consignment of 200 brains sent for
this purpose. EU-authorised tests carried out in New Zealand prior to
shipment had not picked up anything unusual. However further tests in
Europe and re-testing in New Zealand on different parts of the brain
from the area originally tested have now established a diagnosis of
atypical scrapie/Nor 98.

There is no evidence that atypical scrapie/Nor 98 can be transmitted
naturally to other animals or to people, or that it in any way affects
people.

The NZFSA's Principal Advisor (Public Health) Dr Donald Campbell says
that NZFSA agrees with the UK Food Standards Agency advice that there
is no reason for people to change their eating habits or stop eating
lamb or mutton (sheep meat) and goat meat or products derived from
these animals.

Given the accepted view that the condition occurs spontaneously and is
not thought to be infectious between sheep, MAFBNZ expects the
follow-up actions to be limited to collaborative international
research designed to better understand how the condition develops.

Officials downplay scrapie case
-------------------------------
Government and trade officials are down-playing any likelihood of
trade impacts after confirmation that a prion illness, atypical
scrapie, occurs in New Zealand sheep.

It is the 1st confirmed case of a prion disease in New Zealand farm
animals since 119 sheep flocks were culled 50 years ago to eradicate
an incursion of classical scrapie.

Though New Zealand is free of the brain-wasting disease in sheep and
goats, the different condition of atypical scrapie has been found in
the brain of a New Zealand sheep tested in Belgium.

The find was made last July [2009] in a Romney sheep brain sent in a
2008 shipment for use in European laboratories, despite material from
that brain having previously tested negative for atypical scrapie.

The subsequent positive test was confirmed last week [week of 19 Oct 2009].

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry principal international adviser
on animal health Stuart MacDiarmid said it appeared that the infection
was not evenly distributed through the brain.

"A number of the tests were just on bits of the brain where there was
not an accumulation of abnormal [protein] PrP," Dr MacDiarmid said. He
sought to differentiate the "condition" of atypical scrapie from the
classical scrapie disease, which tends to occur in younger sheep and
has animal health implications.

Neither illness is known to affect humans, but both are transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) illnesses, a family of diseases that
includes scrapie in sheep and goats; bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), or mad cow disease, in cattle; chronic wasting disease in deer;
and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in people.

Dr MacDiarmid said the condition apparently arose spontaneously,
particularly in older sheep.

The deputy director of export standards for the Food Safety Authority,
Bill Jolly, said the discovery was a "scientific curiosity" of no real
trade relevance.

"FAQ's: atypical scrapie
-----------------------
"What is the current issue?
Brain material from a New Zealand born and bred sheep has tested
positive for the brain condition atypical scrapie.

"New Zealand is classified as free from the classical form of scrapie
(known as scrapie) and for this reason, supplies brain tissue
specimens to the EU for use as negative controls in their development
of rapid tests for the detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) and scrapie.

"A UK reference (expert) laboratory found that one sample from a
recent consignment of 200 brain samples returned a positive test for
atypical scrapie. Subsequent testing in Denmark and New Zealand, using
Elisa and Western Blot tests, revealed conflicting positives and
negatives. A final definitive histopathology test undertaken by the
Veterinary Laboratory Agency (the international experts on
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) testing) returned a
positive ruling on (insert date). This is the 1st positive detection
of this condition in a sheep from New Zealand's national flock.

"What is atypical scrapie?
Atypical scrapie is a brain condition, which can occur in sheep and
goats. It was first identified in 1998 in Norway and is quite
different [from] classical scrapie.

"The United Kingdom Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee
(SEAC) has concluded that: 'On the basis of a number of
characteristics, atypical scrapie can reliably be distinguished from
both classical scrapie and from experimental BSE in sheep.' Their
statement goes on to say, 'on the basis of emerging data, it may be
more appropriate to consider atypical scrapie as a distinct TSE
(transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) of small ruminants and not
simply a variant of what is now called classical scrapie.'

"The evolving and increasingly widely accepted mainstream
international scientific view on atypical scrapie is that it is a
degenerative brain condition that naturally occurs in a small
proportion of older sheep, and less commonly, in goats. There is
evidence it is not naturally infectious, that is, passed from animal
to animal.

"Does atypical scrapie pose a threat to human health?
No impact on human health from atypical scrapie has been identified.
Neither classical nor atypical scrapie is considered by the science
community and health professionals as a risk to human health. The
existence of classical scrapie has been known for over 200 years and
has not been associated with human illness.

"Does atypical scrapie affect the safety of eating sheep meat?
The UK Food Standards Agency is advising people that there is no
reason to stop eating lamb or mutton (sheep meat) and goat meats or
products derived from these animals.

"Does this positive result mean New Zealand can no longer claim
scrapie-free status?
New Zealand is free of scrapie and continues to claim scrapie freedom
as part of trade conditions.

"How can we be sure we don't have scrapie?
Over the past decade New Zealand has sent close to 5000 brains to the
EU for examination. As well, we run our own domestic scrapie
surveillance programme where the brains of animals exhibiting
neurological symptoms are examined. Scrapie has never been detected.

"Is this positive result a surprise for New Zealand?
This positive result is not unexpected. We have known for some time
that, due to the condition being a naturally-occurring condition in
older sheep, it would likely be present in the New Zealand flock.
Evidence shows us that every country that has actively looked for
atypical scrapie has found it.

"Is atypical scrapie a rare condition?
No. As above, it has been found in all countries which have looked
hard enough, but at a very low frequency in the sheep population --
less than one in 1000 animals tested.

"Are there trade implications for New Zealand as a result of this detection?
There are no animal health or public health reasons for trade impacts.
Last year (2008), after examining member country submissions and
investigating rigorous scientific research, the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health) decided that atypical scrapie should
not be listed in its Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The Code sets out
trade recommendations or restrictions for listed diseases or
conditions, and the OIE determined there was no need for such
recommendations around atypical scrapie.

"What will we be doing in New Zealand following this detection?
The New Zealand Food Safety Authority and MAF Biosecurity New Zealand
have informed our trading partners of the test results. Other
interested parties such as the primary industries are informed.

There will be no attempt at any eradication programme. Eradication is
not possible or justified because of the growing international
acceptance of the view that atypical scrapie occurs spontaneously or
naturally in sheep populations as a very small minority of these
animals age. There is no imperative to attempt eradication given the
lack of known health concerns for humans or other stock and the OIE's
position on the condition.

"The OIE has, in accordance with New Zealand's animal health reporting
obligations, been informed. Other interested parties such as the
primary industries are also informed.

"Will we undertake surveillance for atypical scrapie?
There is no reason to undertake surveillance for this condition given
the lack of human or animal health concerns, and considering the OIE's
position that it has no place in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code
(see question above on trade implications)."

Atypical scrapie
This rare condition has been detected only through the intense
surveillance programmes undertaken in the European Union following
concerns that BSE might have entered European sheep flocks through the
use of rations containing meat-and-bone meal. An examination of the
epidemiology of atypical scrapie suggests that the condition has been
present, and widely distributed, in Europe for a long time. The fact
that nearly all 'cases' have been found in clinically normal animals
partly explains why this condition was not detected earlier; it causes
no significant wastage amongst livestock and hence its presence would
not have been noticed.

"The widespread distribution of 'atypical' scrapie cases in Europe
suggests that they represent a previously unrecognised isolate or
isolates rather than one that has recently dispersed between countries."

The OIE's ad hoc group on atypical scrapie acknowledged that, "There
is currently no epidemiological evidence of an association between
classical and atypical scrapie."

Atypical scrapie tends to occur in genotypes that are associated with
resistance to infection with classical scrapie.

Atypical scrapie is a rare condition, as clearly demonstrated by the
results of the extensive surveillance programmes undertaken in the
European Union. For example, in the United Kingdom in 2006, out of 87
912 sheep samples from 5 different surveillance streams, 223 were
diagnosed as classical scrapie and 60 as atypical scrapie cases. That
is, a total of 0.08 percent tested positive for atypical scrapie.
European Union-wide surveillance in 2006 involved testing 1 035 065
sheep for scrapie. That surveillance detected scrapie in 3507 sheep
(0.34 percent) and only 365 of these (0.03 percent) were atypical
scrapie.

In other studies it has been noted that:
"... only a single scrapie positive sheep was found in more than 90
percent of the flocks where atypical scrapie was diagnosed."

One of the most striking aspects of atypical scrapie is that only a
single scrapie-positive sheep per affected flock was identified in
most cases."

The very low incidence of atypical scrapie means that it cannot be
considered a significant source of livestock wastage. Indeed, the
evidence from various studies suggests that the age-at-onset of
clinical signs for atypical scrapie is much later than the commercial
lifespan of a sheep.

Certainly New Zealand is eager to put this incident behind them.
However, they should be congratulated that their surveillance detected
this case. - Mod.TG]
