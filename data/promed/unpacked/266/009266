After 5 long years, malaria is back in the national capital and the number of cases has shot up alarmingly to 113, of which 40 cases were detected this month [June 2017].

The National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) has found 2 new species of Anopheles stephensi (urban vector) and Anopheles culicifacies (rural vector) circulating this year [2017].

The parasitic infection was lying dormant after mutating, but it has made a comeback after a gap of 5 years at a time when Delhi is already reeling under the scourge of dengue and chikungunya.

Experts have raised the red flag after the resurgence of this deadly parasite and have advised Government agencies to take adequate measures to arrest the spread of this deadly infectious disease that can play havoc with people's health.

NIMR Director Neena Valecha told The Pioneer, "The cases being reported now are because of better detection and surveillance. In Delhi, the nearby villages are adding to malaria cases because of poor hygiene and drainage system. About 40 percent patients have a travel history which suggests that people contracted the disease outside Delhi and once they came back, the infection spreads."

Confirming this, a municipal official said, "Of the 113 people suffering from malaria, 62 belonged to Delhi, while 51 of the cases diagnosed in Delhi were traced to other States." Dr Valecha added, "We are working on the lines of the National Malaria Control Programme and the target is to eliminate it by 2030. This year [2017], we have found Anopheles stephensi and Anopheles culicifacies circulating.

Incidentally, of the approximately 430 Anopheles species, only 40 to 50 transmit malaria. Earlier, Delhi had seen a few cases of malarial infection with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum parasite, but they were not much."

"Dengue and chikungunya are transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, while malaria is caused by the plasmodium parasite that is passed from one human to another with the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes," she explained.

A senior SDMC official said a full-fledged awareness drive through distribution of pamphlets and plying of vehicles carrying loudspeakers, announcing dos and don'ts, has been launched for prevention of vector-borne diseases.

Though the season of vector-borne diseases had ended in December, the city continues to report such cases, prompting authorities to prepare a roadmap for the combat plan. The season for the vector-borne diseases begins from mid-July and generally lasts until November.

[The last time ProMED reported malaria in New Delhi was in 2012. Malaria is a problem in many states in the monsoon season and the CDC advise malaria prophylaxis in the entire country including Mumbai and New Delhi (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/country_table/i.html).

It is especially difficult to control _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria due to the variable incubation times and multiple relapses (Anvikar AR et al. Epidemiology of Plasmodium vivax Malaria in India. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2016 Dec 28;95(6 Suppl):108-120. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.16-0163. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27708188). _P. vivax_ is most probably constantly introduced into New Delhi from other parts of india due to migration and reflect the state of malaria control in India overall. - Mod.EP
