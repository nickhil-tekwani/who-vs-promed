New tests have confirmed that food products from an Adelaide company were
contaminated with the same strain of listeria that contributed to the death
of a man at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Another person died in hospital in
Gawler, while 2 women are recovering from the illness.
Yesterday, 12 Dec 2005, products from Conroy's Smallgoods Bowden factory
were recalled. Today the Health Minister John Hill confirmed that 2
products from the company, ham steak and corned beef, tested positive for
listeria.
"That's the same listeria that was found on equipment in Conroy's plant.
It's also the same material that's been found in the Royal Adelaide
Hospital," he said. [It is not stated specifically if the matching hospital
isolates were from the kitchen or were clinical isolates. - Mod.LL] It is
still not known if it has the same molecular make-up as the bacteria found
in those who died.
The CSIRO's Food Science Australia has been appointed to carry out an audit
of the way the Health Department handled the outbreak and the way the Royal
Adelaide Hospital supplies food to its patients.
Conroy's Smallgoods has now removed all its products, except bacon, from sale.
