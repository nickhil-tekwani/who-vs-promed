[Since the Health Canada update of 12 Jan 2004, the number of
confirmed clinical cases has increased by 53 to an overall total of
1388. This rise is accounted for by an increase of 56 confirmed cases
in Saskatchewan, a decrease of 2 in Manitoba, and a decrease of one
in British Columbia. 4 additional deaths were recorded in
Saskatchewan, raising the overall total for Canada from 10 to 14 in
2003. (Inconsistencies in the overall totals may be due to failure of
some territories/provinces to provide complete breakdowns into WNNS
and WNF.) - Mod.CP]
