[BDF Hospital acting chief medical laboratory technologist Younis Ali
Mohammed was quoted by the Gulf Daily News - Internet Edition of 15
Sep 1998 as saying: "[We tested the stool samples of 300 hospital
patients, aged four months and above, who had these symptoms. We
found that 37 of them had _Campylobacter_... Others surveyed had
other more common organisms..."
Mod.JW's comment stated: _Campylobacter_ is responsible for 5-14% of
diarrhea worldwide...
This message raises a few questions:
1) 37 out of 300 is only 12.3%, well within the normal range of
_Campylobacter_ cited. What then was responsible for the vast
majority of these cases, [more than 80%?
2) What is meant by "more common organisms"? Does this mean
detection of normal flora or "more common" causes of gastroenteritis?
3) Were these stools tested for virus or other agents which might
survive the irradiation mentioned?
[The irradiation mention was wrong -- see ref. above - Mod.JW
