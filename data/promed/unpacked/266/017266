The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that infection of kala-azar and dengue have been found in Kalikot [Karnali], Okhaldhunga [Province One], and Myagdi [Gandaki] districts, which would not report these diseases in the past.

"We have alerted the health workers at the local level and districts about the risk of a large-scale outbreak of kala-azar and dengue," said Lila Bikram Thapa, a senior public health administrator at the division. "What is alarming is these diseases have been reported from mountain districts, which were considered non-endemic to the diseases."

Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis or black fever, is transmitted through the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sandfly.

Detection of kala-azar cases in areas above 650 metres [2133 ft] where it was thought impossible for female phlebotomine sand flies to survive is a cause for serious concern, health officials say. "We were taught that phlebotomine sandflies do not survive above the altitude of 650 metres, but now cases of infection are being reported in altitudes over 1400 metres [4593 ft]," said Thapa.

Weight loss, weakness, cough, and fever that last from a few weeks to months are common symptoms of kala-azar.

Entomologists say that detection of dengue and kala-azar in the district in the midst of the pandemic increased the risk of a massive outbreak, as health workers, who have been continuously serving for a long time, have been exhausted. Moreover, symptoms of many vector-borne diseases including kala-azar and dengue overlap with symptoms of COVID-19 infections.

"As the authorities have allowed resumption of public transportation, which increases mobility, chances of spreading the diseases -- not only the coronavirus, but also other vector-borne diseases -- will increase," said Sishir Panta, an entomologist, told the Post. "Vectors of dengue and kala-azar and others have been present throughout the country. What is needed is the source of infection and if infected people travel, the risk of spreading the infection increases."

The Health Ministry said that cases of kala-azar have been reported from 60 districts and dengue from 68 districts. The ministry has decided to eliminate kala-azar by 2030, and for that, cases of infection should be reduced to 1 per 10 000 population. Officials said that the existing case detection rate of kala-azar is over 1 per 10 000 people.

As most of the symptoms of the vector-borne disease -- fever, body ache, and sore throat -- match with coronavirus infection, there are also chances of misdiagnosis, doctors say.

"Surveillance of the vector-borne diseases should be stepped up and health workers should be encouraged to perform another testing if patients tested negative to coronavirus," Pun said.

[Previously, visceral leishmaniasis in Nepal was seen only in the Terai lowlands bordering India. The incubation period of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) may be months, so the appearance of cases in the mountains needs to exclude exposure in the lowlands months before.

Since 2006, a sharp decline in the number of cases has been observed, but between 2007 and 2010, VL was notified from an increasing number of districts (from 14 in 2007 to 26 in 2010) (1).

In 9 districts, the elimination target has been reached. However, underreporting is substantial (2).

A recent study found that "transmission of _L. donovani_ in Nepal has decreased significantly between 2006 and 2016, coinciding with the elimination programme." (3)
