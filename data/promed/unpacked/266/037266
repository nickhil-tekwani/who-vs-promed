Hungarian government temporarily prohibits sale of paprika
-------------------------------------------------
The Hungarian government has prohibited the sale of all types of paprika,
the powdered condiment used to spice typical Hungarian food, because of the
high level of aflatoxin found in the product from various producers.
Aflatoxin can damage the liver and immune system and cause tumors if
consumed at the rate of 0.5 kg per week for a long period (the quantity
which the average Hungarian would take a year to eat).
The aflatoxin came to Hungary in a type of spice imported from Brazil and
Peru "which is used to enhance the color of paprika", explained Peter
Biacs, director general of the Hungarian Office of Food Safety.
"This toxin is only found in paprika coming from the tropics, which means
that producers are illegally mixing imported and domestic products and
tricking consumers," said Jenoe Racz, Hungarian health minister. [Aflatoxin
is found in many climates other than the tropics. - Mod.TG]
Racz has asked the public not to consume spices until the investigation is
over, which is making life very difficult for restaurants, which use it in
typical dishes like goulash, fish soup and different sauces.

[Aflatoxin is a mycotoxin produced by the mold _Aspergillus flavus_ or _A.
parasiticus_. The mold may no longer be evident but the toxin may be
present. This mold grows on a number of different foodstuffs and other
organics.
The mold occurs in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing
microbiological deterioration and invades all types of organic substrates
whenever and wherever the conditions are favorable for its growth.
Aflatoxin can be produced wherever the mold is, and the mold has been shown
to grow in most climates. The statement that it grows only in the tropics
is incorrect. - Mod.TG]
