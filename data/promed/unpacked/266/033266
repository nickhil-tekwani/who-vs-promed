55 LGs Affected By Bird Flu
---------------------------
Statistics have shown that the avian infuenza known as bird flu has
so far spread to more than 55 local government areas and Abuja as at
February 2007.

Desk Officer in charge of Communication Component on Avian Infuenza
Alhaji Aliyu Jajirma said this at a 2-day workshop for local
government information officers and directors of social welfare on
avian influenza in Birnin Kebbi.

Jajirma explained that since 2003 there has been an increasing number
of outbreaks of the flu known as H5N1 in countries of Asia,
particularly in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.

He said in a bid to ensure the control of the disease among humans
and mass death of birds, the federal government established avian
influenza crisis management comprising of federal ministries of
information, health and agriculture to coordinate and disseminate
information regarding prevention and control of the disease in Nigeria.

He said that flu is yet to be confirmed in Kebbi state despite its
discovery in neighbouring states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Niger.
