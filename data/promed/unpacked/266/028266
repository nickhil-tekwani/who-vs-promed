Indonesian health authorities have contained an outbreak of the
chikungunya virus in a village in South Sumatra after about 1/6 of
the population there was infected, a doctor said Monday.
"It is now under control as our teams have intervened quite early in
Sungai Dua (village)," said Syahrul Muhammad, the head of the South
Sumatra province health office.
He told AFP that the outbreak began at the end of May 2006 and
infected more than 500 people in village of some 3000.
He said that teams had sprayed the village to rid it of the
mosquitoes that transmit the virus and infected villagers had been
given medical treatment.
Chikungunya is a tropical infectious disease transmitted by
mosquitoes. It causes extreme pain in the joints and leaves the
sufferer weak for a few days [to weeks] but is not considered to be
fatal. [No vaccine is available. - Mod.TY]

[The spread of chikungunya from the Indian Ocean Islands to India and
now into Southeast Asia is dramatic and of concern for any area where
the _Aedes_ vectors are present.
ProMED requests additional information about laboratory test results
confirming the chikungunya diagnosis that differentiated it from
dengue fever, monitoring and control of vector _Aedes_ mosquitoes,
and detection of any new cases that may occur.
A severe dengue outbreak was reported on Sumatra in March 1998. A
