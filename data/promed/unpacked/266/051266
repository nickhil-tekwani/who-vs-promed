WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2004 - USA (02)

[In the press report, posted on Thu 1 Apr 2004 as "West Nile virus update
2004 - USA (01) 20040401.0885", it was stated that 2 wild birds had "tested
West Nile virus-positive" in Orange County, California. 2 correspondents
have queried the meaning of this report.
Dr. Richard Frankel <Richard.Frankel@med.va.gov> Associate Chief of Staff
for Education, VA Pacific Islands Health Care System, 459 Patterson Road,
Honolulu, HI 96819-1522 commented: "The message states the virus 'turned
up' in 2 captured house finches. Does this mean that the virus was
cultured from the birds? Is there any information about the health of the 2
birds?"
And Dr. Robin Lindsay, Research Scientist, Health Canada, National
Microbiology Laboratory, Rm 4770, 1015 Arlington Street, Winnipeg, MB, R3E
3R2 commented: "Is it possible to clarify which diagnostic tests were
performed on the finches and whether their West Nile virus-positive status
was based on detection of virus or antibodies. Because the birds were
collected alive, I assume we are talking antibodies, but the posting states
'that virus turned up' in these animals suggesting bona fide virus
detection (by RT-PCR or virus isolation procedures?)".
The press report below and information supplied by one of the scientists
involved provide comprehensive answers to these queries. - Mod.CP]

California: Birds Test Positive for West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------
Vector Control District (OCVCD) biologists in Orange County, California,
have found antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in 2 adult female house
finches. The birds were trapped as part of the District's wild bird
trapping program, which involves trapping and releasing dozens of wild
birds each week after drawing a small blood sample. The 2 birds were bled
on 2 Mar 2004, and tested at the District laboratory in Garden Grove. One
of the birds was also trapped and sampled on 18 Feb 2004 and showed no
antibodies at that time. "This evidence is an indication that active virus
transmission has already begun in the county. Our wild bird bleeding
program is an early warning system that alerts us to virus activity prior
to any human cases" stated James P. Webb PhD, OCVCD Technical Director.
West Nile virus is carried by birds and is passed on to mosquitoes when
they feed on an infected bird. The disease can then be transmitted by the
bite of an infected mosquito to humans or other animals. The disease
usually goes unnoticed though a small percentage of the population will
experience febrile symptoms, and an even smaller percentage can become
seriously ill; about 240 people died as a result of West Nile virus in
2003. Horses are particularly hard-hit by West Nile virus infection,
mortality rates approach 40 percent, but there are 2 vaccines available,
and horse owners are encouraged to have their animals vaccinated.
"The District's message of the shared responsibility has never been more
relevant," offered newly appointed District Manager, Gerard Goedhart. "The
District has been preparing for West Nile virus since it was first
discovered in New York in 1999; our level of mosquito control is excellent;
it is the residential backyard sources that we need the public to help
with. With over 700 000 backyards in the county, homeowner involvement is
critical," Goedhart added.
The public is advised to dump any standing water they might find in their
yards or work place; mosquitoes can develop in a week. Mosquito fish are
available for no charge at the District for stocking ponds or
out-of-service pools. It is advisable to wear long sleeves and long pants
when outdoors at dusk and dawn, and use a repellent whenever in areas that
may have mosquitoes.

Clarification
--------------
I would like to clarify the posting concerning the finding of West Nile
virus in 2 house finches in Orange County, California. The 2 birds were
positive for specific antibody to West Nile virus using a blocking ELISA to
NS1 protein (Jozan, Evans, et al., Detection of West Nile Virus Infection
in birds in the United States by Blocking ELISA and Immunohistochemistry,
Vector-Borne & Zoonotic Disease 3(3):99-109, 2003).
As part of our >10-year program of wild bird arbovirus serosurveillance,
these finches were trapped, bled, banded, and released. One of the birds
had been trapped and bled a short time earlier and was found seronegative,
indicating a recent seroconversion.
