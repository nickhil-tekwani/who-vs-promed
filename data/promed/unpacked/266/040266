Over the 1st week of November 2018, 489 people got sick with measles, according to the press service of Lviv regional Lab Center: "In Lviv region, during one week (1-7 Nov 2018), 489 cases of measles, including 373 cases with children under the age of 17 or 76% and 116 cases with the adults (23.7%) were spotted," the message said.

Children aged from 5-9 made the vast majority of those infected; 78% of them were not vaccinated. 323 people were hospitalized. As we reported, since the beginning of 2018, 15 people, including 11 children and 4 adults have died from measles. The number of cases of measles in January-September 2018 has increased 17 times in comparison with the same period of time in 2017.

Earlier, 45 school students and a pregnant teacher got sick with measles in Rukshyna village, Chernivtsi region, south western Ukraine. Later, it turned out that the majority of the affected were not vaccinated. Moreover, 53 children fell ill with measles in Petranka village, Ivano-Frankivsk region, western Ukraine. And 28 children got sick with measles in one of the Vinnytsia region's schools. The measles outbreak is related to the fact that parents refuse to vaccinate their children.

Addressing the measles outbreak in Italy has become essential, especially among health care workers. Over the past year, 100 doctors and nurses have been infected with measles. The head of the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (SIMIT), Massimo Galli, said that "it is absolutely unacceptable that someone working in the healthcare sector does not protect themselves and, as a result, does not protect their patients." In 83 of the 100 cases recorded, the health care workers had never been vaccinated.

Public Health England is urging the public to ensure they have had 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine after outbreaks of measles were confirmed across England. Between 1 Jan and 31 Oct [2018] there were 913 laboratory-confirmed measles cases in England, marking a "steep rise" from the 259 reported in 2017.

The rise is because of outbreaks linked to importations from Europe that have led to some limited spread in the community, particularly teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were younger, officials said. "We will continue to see measles cases in unvaccinated individuals and are monitoring the situation carefully. People who have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are particularly at risk," commented Dr Mary Ramsay, head of Immunisation at PHE. "We want to remind people that measles is not just a disease of young children, and most of the cases this year have been in people over the age of 15."

Children and young people who have not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine are at greater risk from contracting the highly infectious viral illness that, in some cases, can lead to serious complications, such as deafness, pneumonia and blindness. Adults who are unsure if they or their children have been fully vaccinated should check with their GP and make an appointment to receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine, Dr Ramsay stressed.

https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Ile-de-France-Measles-outbreak-due-to-lack-of-vaccination-coverage-say-doctors


A serious measles outbreak is spreading across the Ile-de-France region, which doctors say is due to a lack of vaccination coverage among the general population. Whereas the usual rate of diagnosis averages about 1 case per week in the region, 56 cases were diagnosed in October 2018 alone.

In the worst-affected area, Seine-Saint-Denis, 11 people have been hospitalised due to the disease. Most were children aged 4 and under, whose vaccination records were not up to date. The disease is 10 times more contagious than flu, and it is passed between people by air droplets (such as a cough or sneeze) or by direct contact, such as touching. One ill child in a public space -- such as a crèche -- can infect up to 20-50 others.

In France, doctors must report any diagnosis of measles to their regional branch of medical agency (Agences Régionales de Santé; ARS). No deaths have so far been reported in this recent outbreak, but at the beginning of the year [2018], 3 people died from the condition. The ARS has said that the reappearance of the disease is almost certainly due to a lack of vaccination coverage across France. National coverage needs to be at 95% to prevent outbreaks, it said, but the current level is at 79%. A 95% coverage would protect very young babies, older people, and anyone else who is immunocompromised and cannot themselves receive the jab.

Dr Sylvie Hubinois, paediatrician and president of l'Association Française de Pédiatrie Ambulatoire [the French Association of Ambulatory Paediatrics], said: "This [recent outbreak] is because vaccination coverage is not high enough to be effective. Even though vaccination coverage is rising every year, to avoid epidemics we must reach a very high coverage rate, in the region of 95%. Despite this, no region in France has so far reached such a target." The measles vaccination is now one of the 11 jabs that are now mandatory in France, so experts expect coverage to rise slowly over the next few years.

Between 6 Nov 2017, and August 2018, 2471 cases were reported in France, of which 22% were hospitalised. Dr Hubinois added: "Measles is still a fatal disease. These are preventable deaths. The illness could be eradicated if everyone [that could be] was vaccinated."

This year [2018], the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned of the continued risk of measles, as cases of the disease reached record-breaking levels this year.

The Department of Health (DOH)-Western Visayas declared a measles outbreak inside the compound of Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) in Barangay Handumanan, Bacolod City. As of [12 Nov 2018], about 25 inmates have been suffering from fever and rashes inside the BJMP-Handumanan, Dr Grace Tan, head of CHO [City Health Office]-Environment Sanitation Division, said [on Tue 13 Nov 2018]. Of the 25 inmates, 19 inmates have been placed in the isolation area.

If there's an increase of fever and rashes, Tan said they leveled [diagnosed?] it as suspected measles unless it will be confirmed with the laboratory test. However, she said the Department of Health (DOH)-Western Visayas called it an outbreak. "We talked with the immunization coordinator and the DOH, and we came up with a plan to conduct a mass immunization among our inmates in BJMP-Handumanan, both male and female inmates, to stop the spread of the virus," she added. Anti-measles-rubella immunization will be held [on Wed 14 Nov 2018] at the BJMP-Handumanan. Tan said they have had approval from Mayor Evelio Leonardia for the immunization program at BJMP-Handumanan. "This is also to encourage everyone that we have to be aware because we have an increase of fever and rashes which we leveled it as suspected measles," she said.

Tan noted that some of the inmates started suffering from fever and rashes last month [October 2018] during their National Correctional Consciousness Week wherein they received several visitors and probably one of them could be the carrier of the illness. BJMP-Handumanan has a total of more than 800 inmates, both male and female. Since it's a contained area, the transmission of the virus will spread immediately, Tan said.

A measles outbreak is spreading in Charedi [Orthodox Jewish] communities in the Tri-State area [New York metropolitan area], fueled by anti-vaccine propaganda promoted by the anti-vaxxer cult. The outbreak is affecting only members of the Frum community. Not only are the anti-vaxxers responsible for this outbreak, but they are responsible for anti-Semitic propaganda that has begun spreading online -- specifically targeting Jews because of failing to get vaccinated.

- Ocean county, New Jersey (Lakewood): 11 confirmed measles cases, 7 under investigation.
- Brooklyn, New York (Williamsburg, Boro Park, etc.): in the last month, at least 17 cases of measles confirmed in Williamsburg and Borough Park; additional cases under investigation. 2 infants in Intensive Care Unit at Maimonides Medical center.
- Rockland county (Monsey, New Square, Spring Valley): 68 confirmed cases of measles and 11 suspected cases within Rockland county.
