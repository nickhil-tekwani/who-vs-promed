Salmonella outbreak in France linked to meat product
----------------------------------------------------
French authorities are investigating a suspected salmonella outbreak linked to a meat product from Italy. Officials did not reveal how many people were ill, but did say Coppa ham, which is a salted, seasoned, and dry-cured thinly cut pork shoulder or neck product, was thought to be the source.

Consumer complaints led the French supermarket Intermarche to alert authorities and withdraw products from sale. The store started the withdrawal of implicated products on 8 Jul 2019. According to the recall notice, salmonella was detected in the product during microbiological control testing. The link with Coppa of the brand Di Vittorio supplied by Castelli France, based in Marseille, was confirmed by French officials and [Public Health] France, the country's public health agency.

Sliced or whole Coppa sold between 17 May 2019 and 8 Jul 2019 throughout the country is affected. Coppa sandwiches made at the supermarket between the same dates have also been recalled. Health authorities told people who still have the products not to consume them and to take items back to the place of purchase. The same product was recalled in August 2018 for listeria. It was sold at Intermarche between 8 Jun 2018 and 9 Aug 2018.
