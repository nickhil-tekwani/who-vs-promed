At the end of October [2020], a wild boar infected with African swine fever (ASF) was shot in the Gorlitz district of Saxony. Since then, more infected wild boars have been found. This highly contagious viral disease threatens not only the wild boar but also the domestic pig population.

The Ministry of Social Affairs, which is responsible for combating animal diseases, has taken all necessary measures to prevent the spread of ASF. The aim of these is to prevent the further spread of the animal disease to other regions and to limit it to as small an area as possible. For this reason, restriction zones have been set up around the site, in which special requirements apply for hunters, agricultural livestock owners, and the general public.

African swine fever is harmless to humans and to domestic and farm animals other than pigs.

As of 1300 on 19 Nov 2020, a total of 7 cases have been identified in Krauschwitz municipality (Gorlitz district).

Saxony is Germany's 2nd state into which ASF-infected wild boars penetrated from neighbouring Poland, infecting the local wild boar population. The date of start, according to the immediate notification to the OIE, was 30 Oct 2020 (20201102.7910014).

Earlier, ASF invaded another German state bordering Poland, namely Brandenburg. The event there started on 9 Sep 2020; its spread, within 3 districts of the state, is continuing.

OIE's interim summary of the event in Brandenburg, published on 19 Nov 2020, is as follows:
Total outbreaks = 157 (submitted)
Species / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar / 157 / 151 / 6 / 0

The above summary, details of all 21 follow-up reports, and a map are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000036652_20201119_145713.pdf.

The total current number of ASF cases in wild boar in Germany is 164, of which 157 are in Brandenburg and 7 are in Saxony. So far, no ASF outbreaks on domestic pig farms have been recorded in Germany. - Mod.AS
