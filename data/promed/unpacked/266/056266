Another region hit by bird flu: China
-------------------------------------
China reported 4 new suspected bird flu outbreaks on Monday, including one
in the northern municipality of Tianjin, which had previously not been
affected, state media said.
"The Ministry of Agriculture on 9 Feb 2004 received reports that in recent
days, Tianjin's Jinnan district, Hubei's Macheng city, Yunnan's Anning
city, and Shaanxi's Huayin city each discovered one case of suspected
highly pathogenic bird flu," the Xinhua news agency said.
Tianjin municipality is located close to the capital Beijing, which has yet
to report any outbreaks. Hubei, Yunnan, and Shaanxi provinces had reported
other outbreaks earlier.
Meanwhile, World Health Organization experts have discussed with Chinese
health officials the possibility that humans may be infected by bird flu,
despite government insistence that it has found no cases of human
infection, WHO said on Monday. "WHO feels it is conceivable that there may
be human cases (in China), given the extent of the outbreaks in poultry,"
said Henk Bekedam, WHO representative in China. "WHO has discussed this
possibility with Chinese authorities," WHO spokesman Roy Wadia said.
China has reported more than 30 suspected or confirmed bird flu outbreaks
in 13 [see comment] of its 31 provinces. Several unconfirmed reports and
rumours claim that infected birds have passed the virus to humans in
southern China, and that local officials have covered up much earlier
outbreaks of bird flu. "We believe that what is known by the central
government is being shared with WHO and FAO (the United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organisation), to better allow us to support China at this
crucial time," Bekedam said. "However, that may not be the same as knowing
all that is happening across the country."
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has killed at least 18 people in Viet
Nam and Thailand.

[With the additional outbreak in Tianjin, 14 of the total 31 main
administrative regions in China (provinces and municipalities) seem to have
been found affected to date; the H5N1 HPAI virus strain has, so far, been
definitely confirmed in 6 of them. An updated (9 Feb 2004) map can be seen
