Hepatitis B epidemic: Beware of the lab needle jab
--------------------------------------------------
Officials of the government health service suspect unsafe clinical practices [employed] by the mushrooming of private medical laboratories, could be behind the recent spurt in large number of hepatitis B cases in the state. While the officials does not discount other causes like sex work, men who have sex with men (MSM) and infected mothers passing it on to their children during childbirth, they feel that private labs should be brought under the scanner to check the spread of such communicable diseases.

Dr A.S. Pradeepkumar, [deputy] director of Public Health Services (PH) says that cases of hepatitis B have doubled compared to last year [2011]. Clusters of such cases were mostly found in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kollam according to him. Other places, where many cases of hepatitis B were reported are Changnacherry and Pathanamthitta.

In the case of Kottayam district, most cases have been identified in Athirampuzha panchayat, says District Medical Officer Dr N.M.Aysha Bhai. Precautionary measures such as awareness campaigns to educate the people about this disease were held in the Kottayam Medical College Hospital. Infected patients were transferred to different hospital and vaccinations were given to their relatives, she said.

The lack of awareness about the disease is also hampering the initiatives to check the spread of the disease. Kottayam District Medical Media Officer Domy.J feels that campaigns were not effective as people were not interested. "They thought that it was a water borne disease and not a blood-borne disease", he said. "All want to undergo tests and get vaccinated. But we do not have the budget to give vaccinations to everyone and moreover we have only [enough] vaccine for children below 5 years," says Domy. Some officials feel that tackling hepatitis B was an issue that needed state level planning and response. But no protocols were put in place.

Reacting to the allegations against the private labs by the government medical authorities, a microbiologist at a private lab said, "We do not re-use medical instruments due to fear of losing our jobs. It's the government hospitals that follow such unsafe practices. They accused us to save their skin," the micro-biologist alleged.

Clinical pathologists who work in premium private labs such as DDRC, Dianova and Premier say they use only auto-disposable syringes. They also follow strict safety guidelines and diligently use incinerators to destroy used needles. The medical waste is collected by an IMA-led agency IMAGE (Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly).

Dr Punnen Kurian Venkadathu, Director of Tropical Institute of Ecological Sciences (TIES), Kottayam feels that there could be some truth in allegations by the government health authorities. "Some private companies sell recycled syringes in bulk for a song to these private labs. If an auto-disposable syringe is sold for Rs.2 [USD 0.036] each in the market, these private companies will recycle the used syringes and sell it for 50 ps [paise - 50 ps is equal to 0.5 rupees, or 0.01 USD] each," says Dr Punnen.

Accreditation of clinical labs is not at present mandatory in the state. A lab can be set up if you have certification from a local body. While many of the premium clinical labs have opted for the voluntary accreditation programme under the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), several others that operate in rural areas and towns do not have them. The proposed Kerala Clinical Establishments (Registration, Regulation and Accreditation) Bill now plans to make the accreditation mandatory and also has provisions for grading the labs.

[Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by contact with the blood or other body fluids (i.e., semen and vaginal fluid) of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Common modes of transmission in developing countries are: perinatal; early childhood infections, inapparent infection through close interpersonal contact with infected household contacts, unsafe injections practices; blood transfusions and sexual contact. Further information can be obtained from the WHO Factsheet at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html.

Hepatitis B is preventable with a safe and effective vaccine that has been available since 1982. This vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing hepatitis B virus infection and its chronic consequences. Hepatitis B is endemic in many parts of India. Most people in the region become infected with hepatitis B virus during childhood. In these regions, 8-10 percent of the adult population are chronically infected.

Medical malpractice has been frequently reported in India (see ProMED-mail archived reports below). The accusations and counter-accusations related in the above press report suggest that there has been little improvement in the situation. However, adequate supplies of hepatitis B vaccine at affordable cost may be the underlying problem.

Kottayam is a city in the Indian state of Kerala. It is located in central Kerala and is also the administrative capital of Kottayam district.
