Philippines (Cordillera Administrative Region): Dengue Alert Declared
--------------------------------------------------------
Regional health officials raised a dengue alert region-wide following
over 360 admissions with one death reported since January [2003]. This
developed even as Department of Health of the Cordillera
Administrative Region (DOH-CAR) Information Officer Bonifacio
Bengwayan reported that all provincial, municipal, and barangay health
offices in the region have already instituted measures to control the
increasing number of dengue admissions.
In Baguio, Dr. Florence Reyes, chief of the Baguio Health Department
reported that the dengue alert was also raised in 48 of the city's 128
barangays. She said that dengue admissions in various hospitals reached
105 as of July 2003. Most of the suspected dengue patients are residents of
Barangays Kias, Irisan, and Camp 7.
Bonifacio, meanwhile, reported that Ifugao province has the highest
number of dengue admissions with 132, followed by Benguet with 68
cases, 42 in Mt. Provinces and an aggregate of 20 cases from the
remaining provinces of Kalinga, Apayao and Abra. Most of the patients,
according to health officials, were admitted at the start of the rainy season.
To control the increasing trend of dengue admissions, health officials
recommended that all sanitary inspectors should be mobilized to
actively inspect the surroundings of dengue-affected barangays. There
should also be a regular monitoring of water sources in the city and that all
food handlers should secure updated health certificates. [Dengue is not
transmitted through food. - Mod.JW].
In June 2003, a dengue outbreak was declared in Paracelis town in Mt.
Province.

Philippines (Mindanao): 2-fold Increase in Davao City
-------------------------------------------------------
City Health Medical Officer, Dr. Edilberto Estampa yesterday said the
dengue cases in the city has increased by 300 percent from the same
period of 2002. From 283 cases documented in 2002, it soared to 951
cases from January to June 2003. "The trend of
dengue in Davao City (is) supposedly [cyclical?] every 3 years, but lately it
does not follow that pattern any more because the rainfall is almost
[continuous] throughout the year," Estampa said. In 2002, the
months of October, August, & July had the most number of Dengue
cases, but this year CHO statistics showed that the number of cases
every month has been 2-fold greater.
Topping the list of places where dengue is prevalent is Talomo South
with 168 cases, Talomo North with 147 cases, Agdao with 98 cases,
Buhangin with 97 cases and Sasa with 58 cases.
Estampa said the records they have were based on the consolidated reports
of the hospitals in the city. According to Estampa, although the increase is
quite alarming, the doctors' diagnoses were based only on symptoms and
signs as there's no "confirmatory test" in Davao City. He said that
confirmatory testing [is only carried out in] Manila. However, if doctors find
the symptoms in the patient, they'll usually diagnose it as dengue.
Dengue fever is 2nd in the list of 10 leading causes of illness in the
city. Topping the list is acute upper respiratory infection, 3rd is
pneumonia followed by diarrhea and gastroenteritis, acute bronchitis,
essential hypertension, other disease of urinary system, respiratory
tuberculosis, influenza, and bronchitic emphysema.

Philippines (Northern Luzon): Widespread Outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
Like the other regions and provinces in Northern Luzon, the rainy
season disease dengue hemorrhagic fever has already made its dreaded
presence felt in Ilocos Sur. From January to July 2003, dengue afflicted a
total of 97 residents, mostly schoolchildren and
preschoolers, with 2 deaths, according to data provided by the
Provincial Health Team Office (PHTO).
As of 11 Aug 2003, half of the 32 towns and 2 cities in the province
have been afflicted by the disease since February this year. Hardest
hit were Candon City and the towns of San Ildefonso and Salcedo with 17,
16, and 12 victims, respectively. Other towns have the following number of
cases: San Juan, 8; San Vicente, 7; Sinait, Sto. Domingo & Vigan City, 6
each; Magsingal, 4; Bantay & Tagudin, 3 each; Caoayan & Lidlidda, 2 each;
Cabugao, Santa, Burgos & Del Pilar, 1 each.
The 2 patients who died of dengue were from the towns of Tagudin and
Vigan City.
The PHTO said the highest incidence was in July [2003] with 51 victims. This
number is more than twice the incidence in June, when 23 victims were
afflicted with the disease. The town of San Ildefonso had the highest number
of victims, 11 in July, followed by Candon City with 8. There have been only
12 victims yet this month as of 11 Aug 2003. The dengue incidence was low
in February with 3 victims, March with 1, April with 2 and May with 5. The 3
victims in February were from the towns of San Vicente, 2, & Caoayan 1.
The 3 victims in March (1) and April (2) were from Salcedo, and increased
to 4 in May [2003].
In Candon City, which is hardest hit by the disease thus far, dengue
incidence has been rising since May [2003], when there was only one
victim. The number rose to 5 in June & 8 in July. Thus far, however, only 3
have been afflicted with the disease in August.
A total of 11 of the 17 towns without dengue incidence are in the
interior areas of the province.
At the regional level, the Department of Health regional office in the
Cordillera also reported an alarming increase of dengue from 62 cases in
2002 to 353 this year with one death. Most of the patients were admitted to
hospitals at the start of the rainy season, health
officials said. Ifugao has the highest number of cases with 132,
followed by Baguio, 94; Benguet, 65; Mt. Province, 42; & Kalinga, 3,
according to officials.

Queensland; 3 Weeks Since Last Case Reported in Townsville
--------------------------------------------------------------
Townsville's Tropical Public Health Unit says the twin cities need
another 2 months free of any new dengue fever cases before it can
declare the recent outbreak is over. It is 3 weeks since the last case
was reported, but there are 20 confirmed cases in Townsville, and the unit
has been working with Townsville City Council for the past 4-5 months to
ensure its spread is minimised.
The director of environmental health, John Piispanen, says the weather is
playing into authorities' hands. "We're nearly at a month, so it's a bit early to
get too excited, but the signs are good," he said. "The cool weather means
the breeding cycle is a little bit longer, so it means less mosquitoes; no rain
or little rain means no water in breeding sites, so that's a good sign as well."

Hong Kong: Public Urged to Prevent Dengue Fever
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DH) today [Tue 12 Aug 2003] confirmed one
more imported case of dengue fever and urged the public to guard against
the disease. A DH spokesman said the case involved a
46-year-old man. The patient developed fever, cough, vomiting, and
diarrhea on 2 Aug 2003, one day after returning from a Southeast Asian
country. On 7 Aug 2003, he was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital with
rash on his trunk and limbs. Based on the clinical features and laboratory
tests results, the patient is [believed to be] suffering from dengue
haemorrhagic fever. He is now in stable condition.
The spokesman said: "Public alertness to the threat of dengue fever
and their active participation in the elimination of mosquito breeding
sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites are essential to
prevent dengue fever."
Dengue fever is a viral illness transmitted by the bite of the
infectious _Aedes_ mosquito. The dengue viruses include 4 serotypes. The
spokesman said: "Dengue fever is often mild and self-limiting. Recovery
from an initial infection caused by one serotype provides lifelong immunity
against that serotype only. Subsequent infection by another serotype of the
dengue virus increases the risk of acquiring the more serious disease,
dengue haemorrhagic fever. With proper treatment, most patients can
recover. Persons with a history of dengue fever are particularly reminded to
take precautionary measures against mosquito bites."
So far in 2003, 25 cases of dengue fever have been reported in Hong Kong.
