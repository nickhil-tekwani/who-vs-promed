HEMORRHAGIC FEVER, SUSPECTED - CONGO, DR (02)
*********************************************
A ProMED post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>
[This update contains info on the interim cases since the epidemic was
declared over in late May. Specifically there is mention of a case on
around 12 July around Durba, which was one of the sites of the epidemic of
Marburg fever. If there are any ProMED subscribers with more information
on the suspected cases in the Congo, please share it with us. There is
obvious concern that in fact the epidemic that was reported during late
April and May may not have ended but rather continued outside of "capture"
by the formal health sector. Or, as Moderator Charlie Calisher suggested,
there may be a continuing source of Marburg virus in the region that
studies at this point in time might provide more information on the natural
history of the virus. - MPP]

Results of laboratory tests to check for the presence of haemorrhagic fever
viruses in Isiro, Province Orientale, are expected later this week or early
next week, a WHO official told IRIN on Tuesday. Samples collected from
Isiro were sent to South Africa for testing last week after one man in the
town died of suspected haemorrhagic fever on 29 August. Humanitarian
sources have said six other suspected cases with four deaths were reported
in nearby Durba during August. From late 1998 to May, a haemorrhagic fever
outbreak in the same area, apparently caused by the Marburg virus, affected
about 90 people. Meanwhile, humanitarian sources have said one additional
suspected case was reported between 12-18 July some 40 km from Durba.

[Then again, as far as I recall, we have never had confirmation that the
earlier cases were due to Marburg virus. Anyone know? Bob Swanepoel? -
