According to preliminary data, Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is likely the cause of the unknown disease in Afghanistan. This was reported to journalists in the press service of Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare].

"According to the head of the health department of Zabul province (Afghanistan), 80 cases of the disease of unknown etiology with 2 deaths were detected in the Shajoy district of Zabul province."

The clinical picture of the disease includes fever, nosebleeds, and bleeding of the oral mucosa. According to preliminary data, the probable cause of the disease is CCHF, an acute infectious disease transmitted mainly through tick bites, which is widespread in Afghanistan.

Rospotrebnadzor noted that the disease is characterized by fever, severe intoxication and hemorrhages on the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs. "Outbreaks of the disease have been recorded in Afghanistan for several decades. Most cases were noted in the provinces of Herat, Kabul, Balkh, and Takhar. Rospotrebnadzor has organized a reliable system of protection against the importation of dangerous infectious diseases. All necessary sanitary and quarantine measures are being taken. There is no direct flight connection with Afghanistan," the ministry added.

[CCHF is endemic in some countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region of WHO, including Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and Oman. Generally, cases are reported between May and November in most countries. With numerous challenges to the health system, the early detection of suspected CCHF cases and their management with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can be difficult.

CCHF exemplifies a classic zoonotic disease that requires a One Health approach at every step, outbreak investigation, case detection, and joint public health response by the human and animal health sectors. It appears that the chain of disease transmission continues, possibly due to tick infestation of a large number of animals/cattle, poor socioeconomic conditions of the affected region, and low level of public awareness about preventive measures. - Mod.UBA
