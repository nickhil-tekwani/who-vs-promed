This [2017] season has been tricky for eastern apple growers. Growers contacted Dan Cooley, University of Massachusetts, with new trees dying back. The trees were either completely dead with brown leaves, some were wilting, some had yellow leaves. In a very wet part, the incidents were concentrated. The trees were dug up to be examined further. "It looks like _Phytophthora_ crown and root rot," [Cooley] said. Soils saturated for more than 24 hours are breeding grounds for _Phytophthora_.

There are rootstocks that provide some resistance, such as M.9 and B.9. "The resistance is conditional on wet weather or wet sites and on how stressed that tree is." The plantings that Cooley diagnosed as having _Phytophthora_ were on B.9. "It was surprising to see that they were getting the disease." He suggests growers ensure proper drainage and [for] young plantings, minimize transplanting shock.

[A range of species of _Phytophthora_ (oomycetes, fungus-like organisms) cause crown, root and collar rots of woody hosts. For apple, the reported species include _P. cactorum_, _cambivora_, _cryptogea_, _megasperma_, and _syringae_. Symptoms usually get more severe over several growth seasons and may include delayed bud break, yellowing of foliage, branch dieback, decline of tree vigour, and sudden death of the host may occur when additional water or environmental stress is imposed. _Phytophthora_ root rot occurs mostly in heavy or waterlogged soils and may be difficult to distinguish from the effects of waterlogging alone.

The pathogens are soil borne. They are spread with soil and plant material, by water and mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements) and removal or burning of affected plants. Trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective in some tree species, for example for avocado root rot.

The genus includes some of the most destructive pathogens of crops (for example, _P. infestans_, potato late blight) as well as native environments (_P. kernoviae_, _P. ramorum_ in Europe, North America; _P. cinnamomi_ in Australia). Eradication or control of _Phytophthora_ diseases of trees have been largely unsuccessful.
