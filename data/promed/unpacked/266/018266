The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says 10 kg [approx. 22 lbs] bags of Robin Hood brand All Purpose Flour have been recalled. The popular brand of all-purpose flour sold in Western Canada is being recalled due to possible _E. coli_ contamination. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says there has been 1 reported illness associated with the consumption of Robin Hood brand all-purpose flour [it is unclear why the report says 1 case only as 25 cases have been reported - Mod.LL]. The flour, which may be contaminated with _E. coli_ O121 was sold in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

Public Health Notice - Outbreak of _E. coli_ infections linked to Robin Hood All Purpose Flour, original
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with federal and provincial public health partners to investigate an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_, called _E.coli_ O121 that has now been linked to Robin Hood All Purpose Flour, Original. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has issued a food recall warning advising Canadians of the recalled product that has been distributed in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

Canadians are advised not to use or eat any Robin Hood All Purpose Flour, Original sold in 10 kg [approx. 22 lbs] bags with a code containing BB/MA 2018 AL 17 and 6 291 548 as these products may be contaminated with _E. coli_. For additional recall details, please consult CFIA's recall notice. Restaurants and retailers are also advised not to sell or serve the recalled product, or any items that may have been prepared or produced using the recalled product. This outbreak is a reminder that it is not safe to taste or eat raw dough or batter, regardless of the type of flour used as raw flour can be contaminated with harmful bacteria such as _E. coli_.

_E. coli_ are bacteria that live naturally in the intestines of cattle, poultry, other animals, and humans. Most _E. coli_ are harmless to humans. However, there are many different strains of _E. coli_, and some varieties can cause serious illness. While most people made ill by _E. coli_ experience a few days of upset stomach and then recover fully, infections can sometimes be life threatening.

Investigation Summary
---------------------
There have been 25 cases of _E. coli_ O121 with a matching genetic fingerprint reported in 4 provinces: British Columbia (12), Saskatchewan (4), Alberta (4) and Newfoundland and Labrador (5). The illness onset dates range from November 2016 to late February 2017. A total of 6 individuals have been hospitalized. These individuals have recovered or are recovering. No deaths have been reported. The majority (54 percent) of the individuals who became ill are male with an average age of 24 years.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued a food recall warning for Robin Hood All Purpose Flour, Original linked to this outbreak. During the food safety investigation, samples of Robin Hood flour were collected and did test positive for _E. coli_ O121. Several individuals who became ill reported having contact with Robin Hood flour. The investigation is ongoing and it is possible that additional products linked to the outbreak investigation may be identified.

[Once again, thank you to EpiCore Surveillance for their continued contribution. It should be noted that in 2016, there was a seemingly separate outbreak of EHEC O121 associated with flour from a different brand (General Mills). It would be quite instructive to know if the isolates from these 2 North American outbreaks can be compared. - Mod.LL
