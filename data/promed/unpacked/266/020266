Mysterious disease keeps Health Department on alert
-----------------------------------------------
A disease called idiopathic hemorrhagic pneumonia (IHP), of as yet
unknown etiology, has caused the deaths of 7 persons in the state of
Rio Grande do Norte in northeastern Brazil. The State Department of
Health is investigating the etiology of the disease, which affects
the lungs, but they haven't yet determined whether it is viral or
bacterial and how contagion occurs.
Although no case has been reported in the neighboring state of Ceara,
the Ceara State Department of Health is monitoring the situation due
to the proximity of the 2 states.
The most common symptoms in patients with IHP are respiratory
distress, bleeding of the airways and fever. Of 9 suspect patients in
9 different cities of the state, 6 children and a 5-months-pregnant
woman, aged 32, have died. Two children are in critical condition.
The set of symptoms has been named idiopathic hemorrhagic pneumonia
due to its unknown origin. According to the Department of Health, no
epidemiological link was established between the patients, therefore,
there was no transmission between them.
About 78 percent of the patients had a chronic condition, like
asthma, metabolic disorder, epilepsy and sickle cell anemia.
The median age was 3 years, and 56 percent of the patients were male.
The cities where cases have occurred are: Boa Saude, Canguaretama,
Ceara Mirim, Galinhos, Natal, Parnamirim, Sao Goncalo do Amarante,
Sao Tome and Taipu.
The 1st case of IHP was identified on 10 Mar 2006. From this date,
the State Department of Health has identified 24 suspect cases, 15
having been discarded as other diagnosis were confirmed.
Nine cases are still under investigation, the 6 children and the
pregnant woman that died as well as the 2 children still hospitalized.

[I am at the airport waiting for the plane to take me to Rio Grande
do Norte. Tomorrow, I shall have a meeting with the staff of the
State Health Department. As far as I could understand from data sent
to me, the cases seem to be severe cases of influenza (or maybe
another viral pathogen, but I favor influenza). There is a
respiratory disease epidemic of large proportions ongoing at the
moment. The autopsy reports reveal severe viral pneumonia, some
clearly with bacterial superinfection. The preexisting morbidity of
the deceased patients favors this hypothesis, a pregnant woman, a
child with sickle cell anemia, a child with asthma and another with a
metabolic disorder; I have no idea what this disorder could be. As
soon as I have better data, I'll file a report - Mod.LJS]
