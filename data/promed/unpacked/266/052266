[1] UK - tests could miss bird flu in migratory birds

Discrepancies between levels of flu recorded in British birds and those
elsewhere in Europe have surfaced yet again, following publication of the
biggest study so far of bird flu in Europe. The findings raise concerns
about whether British tests would pick up H5N1 bird flu if migratory wild
birds carried it into the country.
Researchers in the Netherlands and Sweden analysed influenza A samples
taken from 37 000 water birds in northern Europe over 8 years. They
confirmed that dabbling ducks, especially mallards, are the main carriers
of flu viruses, although other birds, including geese, are occasional
carriers. On average 6 per cent of ducks are infected, falling to a few per
cent in spring and peaking at up to 20 per cent or more in autumn (PLoS
Pathogens, DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.0030061; ProMED-mail 20070511.1512).
In contrast, UK measurements of flu incidence in ducks remain low. [The

[A fair comment. Deb Mackenzie has pointed out to me that mallards were a
laboratory-confirmed infected species in this paper and that wild mallards
can be commonly seen feeding alongside domestic backyard poultry.
Therefore, if infected, they are at risk of transmitting HPAI (highly
pathogenic avian influenza) to poultry. - Mod.MHJ]

[2] Ghana - migratory birds not responsible for bird flu outbreak

Dr Erasmus Owusu, acting executive director, Ghana Wildlife Society (GWS),
has refuted allegations that birds that migrated to the shores of Ghana
during winter in Europe were responsible for the outbreak of bird flu in
Ghana. He said although there had been evidence around the world that wild
birds were responsible for the outbreak of the virus in some European
countries, this had not been the case with Ghana. "We have been
collaborating with the Veterinary Services, the Wildlife Division of the
Forestry Commission, and the other research agencies to find out if any of
the birds that migrated to Ghana had any of the bird flu strain, but have
till date not found any," he told journalists at a press conference in Accra.
The press conference was to draw attention to World Migratory Bird Day
(WMBD), a global event, scheduled to take place on 12 May 2007 under the
theme: "Migratory Birds in a Changing Climate." The day is a global
initiative devoted to celebrating the beauty of migrating birds and for
promoting their conservation worldwide. The day would be marked in Ghana by
bird watching at the Ramsar sites across the Greater Accra Region, by
patrons of the GWS, Club members, tourists, and people from all walks of
life, as well as the screening of the film "An Inconvenient Truth" at the GWS.
Mr Owusu said the GWS had since last year [2006], been taking and
monitoring blood sample of the migratory birds that visited the country,
especially within the wetlands, to ensure that they did not have any strain
of the bird flu. So far, all the reports had proved negative.
"Where the bird flu was 1st detected in Ghana was nowhere near the Ramsar
site where the birds are found," he said, adding, "surveillance is still
being carried out and the samples are being sent to countries in Europe to
ensure that the migratory birds were not the vectors for the transmission
of the bird flu."
Mr Owusu said the need to mark the WMBD in Ghana was essential to draw
attention to the need to conserve the birds so that they did not become
extinct as was becoming the case. He cited the migratory 'Roseate tern' as
a case of near extinction, which was halted through conservation efforts
instituted by the GWS and Bird Life International both NGOs
(non-governmental organizations).
Dr Chiambeng Paulinus Ngeh of the Birdlife International, West African
sub-Regional Office based in Nigeria, praised Ghanaians for not showing any
panic during the announcement of the bird flu outbreak. This, he noted, was
a clear indication of how well the education had been taken by the people.
He urged Ghanaians to take the issues of conservation more seriously,
especially in relation to migratory birds since such birds could offer
extraordinary opportunities for international collaboration.

[3] Ghana - bird flu outbreak linked to smuggled birds from Nigeria
Date: Fri 4 May 2007

<http://www.blackbritain.co.uk/news/details.aspx?i=2438&c=africa&h=Suspected+bird+flu+case+in+Ghana+linked+to+smuggled+birds+from+Nigeria>

[According to the Veterinary Services Department of Ghana's Ministry of
Food and Agriculture, an investigation is underway in the port city of Tema
over reports of an outbreak of bird flu. The department says even though
initial checks in some outlets in the city suggest it might be bird flu, a
more in-depth assessment will be needed to draw definite conclusions on the
matter. According to ministry sources, a blood specimen is being prepared
for analysis at the World Health Organization's (WHO) laboratories in
Italy. [See ProMED-mail postings referenced below.]
Some local observers are already blaming the situation on smuggled live
birds from Nigeria. Though the government of Ghana banned the importation
of poultry products from Nigeria since the 1st case was reported in Kano,
they say the products have continued to be smuggled into the country's
market. "If it is true that there is bird flu in Tema, you can be sure it
came from Nigeria. We have one of the most porous borders in the world and
I just hope it would not create a serious problem for us," Eric Dancquah, a
businessman in the Kwame Nkrumah Circle area of Accra told Black Britain.
However, Ghana's neighbour, Cote d'Ivoire, has also been identified as a
likely source of the flu. Ghana's ban on the importation of poultry
products also includes other African countries, including Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, and Niger, where outbreaks of avian influenza have
been previously reported.
The flu has the potential to devastate the livelihoods of many millions on
small [poultry farms], along with the few larger scale poultry operations
that country has. Agriculture and food production account for a larger
share of the Ghanaian economy, so losses to poultry farmers could have a
significant impact on the macro economy. A 4-day sensitisation forum was
held last month [April 2007] in the Kintampo South District of the Brong
Ahafo region of the country to sensitise 45 assembly members and heads of
department on the issue of avian influenza. The forum, organized by the
district's Agricultural Development Unit of the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture, was to [provide participants with information on surveillance
and prevention of the disease.]
Apart from the loss of income that bird flu brings, there is also a cost
for governments -- and aid donors -- in trying to tackle it. The World Bank
says the key to containing the economic cost of bird flu is rapid effective
action.

[It should be noted that, as of 3 May 2007, the source of the now confirmed
H5N1 outbreak near Tema, Ghana -- see ProMED-mail postings referenced below
-- was unknown. Suspicions are one thing, hard facts are something else,
whoever voices their suspicions. We await the results of serious
investigations by the Ghanaian veterinary services and of the genetic
analyses. - Mod.MHJ
