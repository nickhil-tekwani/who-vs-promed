A black sigatoka infection is threatening the local banana and plantain
industries, and farmers in the Tuschen area [Essequibo Islands-West
Demerara region], many of whom cultivate plantains, are already counting
their losses. The disease was first observed in late 2008, and they are of
the opinion that the plantain industry will soon be a thing of the past.

At the Rosanante Co-op Society farmlands, several acres of plantain trees
lay on the ground, while some which were only recently infected with the
disease stood on their stalks. Farmers have begun to diversify their crops
and also noted that many persons who depend on farming for their livelihood
were driven from the area because of the disease. They also said that
agriculture officers have visited the area to assess the existence of the
disease on their farms.

Stabroek News understands that the disease has been affecting farms at
several areas across the country, including farms at Parika, Hog Island and
other Essequibo Islands, including Hamburg Island, where the disease is
said to be prevalent. This newspaper also understands that aspects of the
disease were also observed in the Waini area in Region One [Barima-Waini
region] sometime in 2005.

The Ministry of Agriculture stated that extension officers have been
deployed to the administrative regions across the country, and a unit has
since been set up to focus on the black sigatoka disease.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by the
fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species and hybrids
of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of
bananas, with yield losses of 50 per cent or more. It is present in the
Americas, China, South East Asia, and parts of Africa. Infection occurs on
the youngest leaves of the plant during and immediately after unfurling,
while older leaves are not readily infected.

BS causes destruction of leaf tissue affecting the photosynthetic
capabilities of the plant. Fruit produced on diseased plants can ripen
prematurely during commercial shipment and cause further losses. The
pathogen is spread by water, wind, and contaminated materials including
suckers for planting. Disease management includes frequent applications of
fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, and cultural
practices, but the high costs of these measures make them essentially
unavailable to smallholder farmers.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS). Symptoms of
both diseases are often similar, but YS is considered less serious because
symptoms appear mainly on older leaves, and, therefore, less damage is
caused to photosynthetic tissue. Also, there are more cultivars of banana
and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS.

Both YS and BS have been causing serious crop losses in the Caribbean
region. An undiagnosed disease of bananas reported from Guyana's Essequibo
Islands-West Demerara region in 2009 was later diagnosed as one of the
sigatoka diseases (ProMED-mail posts 20090824.2984 and 20090928.3392), but
the disease now appears to have been identified as black sigatoka. The item
above also reports a wider distribution in the country. It also claims that
the disease may have already been present in 2005 in the Barima-Waini
region, however, it is not clear whether this is based on a reliable diagnosis.
