[1] COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against variants
Date: Mon 11 Jan 2021
Source: CNBC [edited]
https://www-cnbc-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/11/covid-biontech-ceo-says-vaccine-is-effective-against-new-strains.html


The CEO of German pharmaceutical company BioNTech has said he remains confident the company's COVID vaccine, developed in partnership with Pfizer, will be effective against the highly-infectious variants of the virus discovered in the UK and South Africa.

"We are confident that based on the mechanism of our vaccine, even though there are mutations, we believe that the immune response which is induced by our vaccine could also deal with (a) mutated virus," Dr Ugur Sahin, co-founder and CEO of BioNTech, told CNBC's Meg Tirrell on Monday [11 Jan 2021].

"Last week [week of 4 Jan 2021], we reported another mutation which is present in the UK variant and also in the South African variant, and this mutation is considered to be important because it could change structurally the protein. But it appears the immune response against our vaccine also neutralizes this mutation."

His comments referred to research published Thursday [7 Jan 2021] that showed Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine appeared to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the virus discovered in the UK and South Africa.

The study, conducted by US pharma giant Pfizer and not yet peer-reviewed, suggested the vaccine worked to neutralize the so-called N501Y mutation. This mutation has been reported in the coronavirus variants discovered in the UK and South Africa.

The variants, which originated separately, both share a genetic mutation of the so-called spike protein, which the virus uses to gain entry into cells within the body.

Physicians tentatively welcomed the findings of the study last week but cautioned it was important to note the research only focused on the N501Y mutation found in both new variants.

BioNTech's Sahin said the company would be able to present more data looking at the full set of mutations in the coming days.

New vaccine could be ready 'within 6 weeks'
-------------------------------------------
Like Moderna's, Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID vaccine uses messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology. In practice, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this "teaches our cells how to make a protein -- or even just a piece of a protein-- that triggers an immune response inside our bodies."

The resulting immune response produces antibodies that help to protect people from becoming infected with the virus.

When asked how quickly BioNTech could pivot if it turned out the existing COVID vaccine was found to be ineffective against new variants, Sahin said "one key advantage" of the mRNA technology was that it would allow the company to adapt the vaccine "relatively quickly."

"We can change the sequence of the vaccine within a few days and we could deliver a new vaccine within six weeks in principle. This is technically possible, and if this is needed, we would go for that," he said, noting that this would also require discussions with regulatory authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration.

"So, we are confident that the technology we would allow us to be extremely fast in responding to a mutation or a to a virus variant that comes with different problems," Sahin said.

Public health experts have expressed concern the new mutant strains could pose a threat to inoculation efforts. In recent weeks, optimism about the mass rollout of COVID vaccines has been tempered by the resurgent rate of virus spread worldwide.

To date, more than 90.3 million people have contracted the coronavirus worldwide, with 1.93 million deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

[Like other coronaviruses, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell to initiate infection and determines host tropism. It is also the major target of neutralizing antibodies and it may be the main antigen of the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by most related groups. According to the public information, S protein or receptor binding domain (RBD) sites are the main antigens encoded by SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. However, due to the limited information and patent protection on the adaptation of antigens of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, the antigen information of most SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates is unclear. The expected immune response, such as antibody or T cell-mediated immune response, stimulated by these SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development are not clear either. Thus accordingly, the protection against SARS-CoV-2 can not be predicted. With new variants emerging, in the initial stages of the vaccine roll out in most countries, if the spike S protein undergoes multiple mutational events, the possibility of reviewing and updating the mRNA vaccines cannot be ruled out! - Mod.UBA]

[3] USA: new variants
Date: Wed 13 Jan 2021
Source: CNBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/ohio-researchers-say-theyve-identified-two-new-covid-strains-likely-originating-in-the-us.html


Key points
----------
- Ohio researchers said Wednesday that they've discovered two new variants of the coronavirus, one of which has become the dominant strain in Columbus, Ohio.
- The new strain prevalent in the city appears to spread more easily, the researchers said.
- "This new Columbus strain has the same genetic backbone as earlier cases we've studied, but these three mutations represent a significant evolution," Dr Dan Jones, lead author of the study, said.

Researchers in Ohio said Wednesday [13 Jan 2021] that they've discovered 2 new variants of the coronavirus that likely originated in the US -- one of which quickly became the dominant strain in Columbus, Ohio, over a 3-week period in late December [2020] and early January [2021].

Like the strain first detected in the UK, the US mutations appear to make COVID-19 more contagious but do not seem like they will diminish the effectiveness of the vaccines, researchers said.

The researchers said in a press release has become dominant in the city, includes "three other gene mutations not previously seen together in SARS-CoV2."

"This new Columbus strain has the same genetic backbone as earlier cases we've studied, but these 3 mutations represent a significant evolution," Dr Dan Jones, vice chair of the division of molecular pathology at Ohio State and lead author of the study, said in a statement. "We know this shift didn't come from the U.K. or South African branches of the virus."

Researchers at Ohio State's Wexner Medical Center have been sequencing the virus since March, but have since drastically scaled up their efforts to sequence hundreds of samples per week, Jones told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday. He added that he's sent his team's findings to the Ohio Department of Health, but not the CDC yet.

"We are now in a period where the virus is changing quite substantially," Jones said. "This is the moment, as we're starting to see changes, where vaccination is being introduced and where the virus has been in the human population for some months, where we do want to be looking out very carefully for the emergence of not just single mutations, but new strains that have multiple mutations."

Jones added that it's too early to determine how much more infectious the strain in Columbus might be, but researchers believe it's likely more contagious just based on how quickly it's spread over the past few weeks.

Dr Bruce Vanderhoff, chief medical officer of the Ohio Department of Health, said in a statement to CNBC on Wednesday that the department is "not surprised" that a new strain of the virus was found in the state.

"The arrival of this new strain in Ohio is always concerning because more contagious strains could lead to more people getting sick, more people getting hospitalized, and ultimately more people dying," he said. "No matter what strain of COVID-19, people can continue to protect themselves by wearing masks consistently, staying at least 6 feet apart, avoiding crowds, ventilating indoor spaces, and frequent hand washing."

Peter Mohler, chief scientific officer at the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center and co-author of the forthcoming study, said there's no data to indicate that either of the new strains will impact the effectiveness of vaccines.

"It's important that we don't overreact to this new variant until we obtain additional data," he said in a statement. "We need to understand the impact of mutations on transmission of the virus, the prevalence of the strain in the population, and whether it has a more significant impact on human health.

Mohler said the discovery of the new strains is a testament to the lab's efforts to ramp up genetic sequencing as the virus appears to mutate at a faster pace in recent months. He added they hope to publish data in the coming weeks, and that they are exploring whether COVID-19 molecular tests accurately diagnose the new variants.

The White House Coronavirus Task Force warned states earlier this month [January 2021] that there may be a "USA variant" circulating. The hypothesis, which The New York Times reported was pushed by task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx, was based on how severe the US outbreak has become in recent months. The CDC said in a statement last week that it has not yet detected a new variant in the U.S. unrelated to already-discovered strains.

Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security, said it's difficult to assess the significance of the findings without seeing the data.

Researchers have warned that as the virus spreads widely around the world, it has more opportunities to evolve, potentially becoming more infectious or rendering treatments and vaccines less effective. Following the discovery of new strains in the UK and South Africa, the CDC has ramped up efforts to track the genetic sequence of the virus in the US.

Dr Greg Armstrong, director of the CDC's Office of Advanced Molecular Detection, said last month that the agency is contracting with academic centers around the country to sequence samples and search for new variants locally. Those centers, he said, are in Boston, New Haven, Connecticut, Athens, Georgia, Nashville, Tennessee, Madison, Wisconsin, and the Scripps Institute in San Diego.

He added that many academic centers across the country have the ability and expertise to sequence samples of the virus, and are ramping up efforts to do so.

[Whenever there is evidence of emergence of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 with distinct mutations, the important points of public health concern are whether the variants:
- spread more easily from person to person;
- cause milder or more severe disease in people;
- are detected by currently available viral tests;
- respond to medicines currently being used to treat people for COVID-19;
- change the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

For the variants reported from the UK and South Africa initially and now from most other countries, there is no evidence that this is occurring, and most experts believe this is unlikely to occur because of the nature of the immune response to the virus. The variants of the virus will continue to evolve in the coming weeks to months and genomic surveillance by laboratories can help in identifying these variants early, so their potential impact on the response strategies including vaccination can be predicted. - Mod.UBA]

[4] Germany: domestic travel restrictions
Date: Wed 13 Jan 2021
Source: DW News [abridged, edited]
https://m.dw.com/en/covid-city-limits-berlin-to-restrict-how-far-you-can-travel/a-56211952


The German capital is set to join other parts of the country in implementing a 15-kilometer [9 mi] travel restriction for residents. The measure is a response to the high rate of coronavirus infections.

Berlin already has 2 rings around it: one a highway, the other a regional transit line. Starting Saturday [16 Jan 2021] it will likely get a 3rd: a "corona ring." That is when residents will be prohibited from traveling 15 kilometers (9 miles) beyond Berlin's city limits, based on the pandemic incidence rate.

The decision follows similar measures across Germany. The federal and 16 state governments agreed to this as part of the latest round of tougher pandemic restrictions. In general, the 15-kilometer boundary gets triggered each time a district sees more than 200 new infections per 100 000 people within 7 days.

In a special session on Tuesday [12 Jan 2021], Berlin's government, the state Senate, decided that the rule would stay in place until the incidence rate keeps below 200 for 7 consecutive days. "The goal of everything we're doing is to reduce travel and contact," Finance Senator Matthias Kollatz told reporters after the session. "The 15-kilometer rule, when the rate hits 200, aims to achieve a further reduction."

Berlin has exceeded the 200 figure before. And on Wednesday this week [13 Jan 2021], it was 199.9, with higher tallies in many parts of the city. Berlin's 3 "corona traffic lights" -- one each for the incidence rate, the reproduction number, and ICU bed occupancy -- all hit red for the 1st time on Monday [11 Jan 2021].

The new rule, should it come into effect, might mean very little for most people in Berlin.

Germany's stricter shutdown, which was extended from [10 Jan 2021] until at least the end of the month, already requires a valid reason to leave home, although that is lightly enforced. People can still move about within Berlin, which can stretch almost 30 kilometers [18 mi] in any direction.

Nationwide, people are urged to work from home whenever possible, but those who cannot and commute from beyond the 15-kilometer radius would still be able to do so. Medical emergencies, appearing in court or at other official appointments, and reaching rented or owned property are also exceptions.

Other kinds of travel would be off the table, however, whenever the 15-kilometer radius applies.

"My parents live in Bonn," Kollatz said at the news conference. "It means I would not be able to visit them."

Kollatz acknowledged that there are still many details to work out, especially in coordination with the state of Brandenburg, which encircles Berlin and already implemented the rule for its own affected districts on Saturday [9 Jan 2021]. The 2 states are closely linked, with commuters and day-trippers regularly going back and forth. Kollatz said Berlin aims to "mirror" the existing regulations in Brandenburg.

Police there have done spot checks to enforce the measure, and a police spokesman told DW that authorities will extend enforcement to Berlin residents in Brandenburg, should the restriction take effect.

"Our officers will decide what measures are necessary on a case-by-case basis. That means, where appropriate, collecting personal data and informing the relevant authorities for issuing fines, and sending those people back," Mario Heinemann said in a written statement.

Ulrike Protzer, who directs the Institute of Virology in Munich, told the German Press Agency on Monday [11 Jan 2021] that a blanket "15-kilometer boundary has no immediate advantage" in limiting infections. She called for more targeted, specific travel restrictions.

In discussions earlier this month [January 2021] about extending the shutdown, German media reported that many state leaders rejected a 5-kilometer [3 mi] radius proposal from a researcher for the Max Planck Institute. Other countries, such as France, are keeping people within one kilometer [0.6 mi] of their homes.

Just how much to restrict public life to keep the pandemic under control has been a constant tug-of-war between Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has favored tougher measures, and her state counterparts.

"My take on it is that they did not want to explicitly state to not leave the house except for very limited reasons," Tobias Kurth, the director of the Public Health Institute at Charite Hospital, told DW. "That may still come depending on developments in the next days and weeks."

[This rule is applicable "for districts with a 7-day incidence of more than 200 new infections per 100 000 residents; the radius of movement is to be restricted to a 15 km (9 mi) radius around the place of residence unless there is a valid reason to travel further. Exceptions can include trips for work or medical appointments.

"Shopping, travelling, and day-trips explicitly do not constitute a valid reason," the government and states say. Chancellor Merkel had been pushing for this order to come into force in regions with an incidence rate of 100 infections per 100,000 people in 7 days." (https://www.thelocal.de/20210105/explained-these-are-germanys-new-tighter-lockdown-rules-january-2021). The movement restriction rule has been enforced for hard-hit areas and the lockdown until 31 Jan 2021.

"Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions often referred to as 'lockdowns', can slow COVID-19 transmission by limiting contact between people.

"However, these measures can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people, and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under resourced settings, and depend on daily labour for subsistence.

"WHO recognizes that at certain points, some countries have had no choice but to issue stay-at-home orders and other measures, to buy more time."

So the 'extra' time granted by 'lockdown' measures can be used by the governments to build their capacities to detect, isolate, test and care for all cases; trace and quarantine all contacts; engage, empower, and enable populations to drive the societal response, etc. - Mod.UBA
