Bird flu discovered in Aichi identified as H7N6 strain
------------------------------------------------------
The avian flu found in quails here [in Aichi] has been identified as
the H7N6 strain, the 1st outbreak of the strain in Japan, local
authorities said.

The National Institute of Animal Health in Tsukuba, Ibaraki
Prefecture, identified the virus found in 2 quails at a farm in
Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, as the H7N6 strain. The institute will
conduct investigations on the samples, officials said.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the
first H7N6 infection was reported in 1981 in Australia in chickens,
then in migratory ducks in Mongolia between 2004 and 2007, and in
waterfowl in Slovakia in 2006. However, no human infections have been
reported to date.

The quail farm in Toyohashi decided to kill about 259 000 quails it
was breeding and had put to death roughly 61 200 of them as of Sunday
[1 Mar 2009].
