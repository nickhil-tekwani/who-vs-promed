The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is warning consumers not to eat Harry's Berries Salsa (mild or hot flavors) or Harry's Berries Dilled Beans, packed by Gean Farms, Inc, because they may have been improperly produced, making them susceptible to contamination with _Clostridium botulinum_. No illnesses have been linked to any of the affected products at this time.

Gean Farms, Inc, of Oxnard, California, is voluntarily recalling the products after CDPH discovered they were produced without the required controls to prevent botulism toxin. Ingestion of botulism toxin from improperly processed foods can lead to serious illness and death.

These products were sold under the Gean Farms, Inc label and packaged in pint glass canning jars with screw-on metal lids, labeled as "Harry's Berries Salsa" and "Harry's Berries Dilled Beans." These products do not contain production or date codes. Additional product information, including photos of affected products, can be found on the CDPH website [http://www.cdph.ca.gov/pubsforms/Documents/fdbFrGE1n.pdf].

The products were sold between May 2011 and November 2012 at certified farmers markets in Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties.

Consumers in possession of the recalled products should discard them. Anyone who sees these products being offered for sale are encouraged to report the activity to the CDPH toll-free complaint line at (800) 495-3232.

Botulism toxin is odorless and colorless. Symptoms generally begin 18- to-36 hours after eating contaminated food, but can occur as early as 6 hours, or as late as 10 days. Symptoms typically begin with blurred or double vision, followed by trouble speaking and swallowing, progressing to muscle weakness that starts in the upper body. Botulism can lead to life-threatening paralysis of the muscles used in breathing. People experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical attention. More information about botulism symptoms and prevention is available on the CDPH website.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.
