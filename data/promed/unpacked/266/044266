An investigation into the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that emerged in Harlem last month [August 2021] is now over, according to the NYC [New York City] Department of Health.

No new cases of Legionnaires' disease have been identified in the neighborhood for 4 weeks and the cooling towers in the affected areas have completed disinfection, city health officials confirmed Wednesday [22 Sep 2021].

City health officials said there were 18 cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with this cluster. All 18 people were hospitalized and 16 have been discharged. There have been no deaths.

According to the city's health department, its public health laboratory analyzed sputum samples from patients and water samples from the cooling towers in the investigation area. The bacteria from one of the specimens matched a cooling tower at NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem [Harlem Hospital].

"I'm grateful for the many Health Department staff who identified and responded to this cluster quickly," Health Commissioner Dr. Dave A. Chokshi said in a news release. "After an extensive investigation, we were able to identify one cooling tower that matched to a clinical specimen, and appropriate cleaning and disinfection measures at that tower and all other potential sources were conducted."

All facilities with cooling towers in the cluster area fully cooperated with the health department and those with _Legionella_ positive results completed full cleaning and disinfection as directed, city health officials said.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia that is caused by the bacteria _Legionella_, which grows in warm water, according to the NYC Department of Health. Symptoms resemble other types of pneumonia and can include fever, chills, muscle aches, and cough. Most cases of Legionnaires' disease can be traced to contamination of artificial water systems where conditions are favorable for _Legionella_ growth, such as cooling towers or evaporative condensers associated with air conditioning and industrial cooling, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, decorative fountains and water features, hot water tanks, and complex plumbing system systems.

People only get sick by breathing in water vapor containing _Legionella_ bacteria, and the disease is not transmitted from person to person, health officials said. Legionnaires' disease is not caused by drinking water that has _Legionella_ bacteria. [People can also get legionnaires' disease by aspiration of drinking water containing _Legionella_ (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/causes-transmission.html). - Mod.ML] People at higher risk include those ages 50 and above, cigarette smokers, and people with chronic lung disease or compromised immune systems.

The Health Department today [22 Sep 2021] announced that the investigation of the Central Harlem Legionnaires' disease community cluster is over. No new cases of Legionnaires' disease have been identified in the area for 4 weeks and the cooling towers in the affected areas have completed disinfection as directed by the Health Department. There were 18 cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with this cluster. All 18 people were hospitalized and 16 have been discharged. There have been no deaths.

The Health Department's Public Health Laboratory analyzed sputum samples from patients and water samples from the cooling towers in the investigation area. The Lab's analyses showed that the bacteria from one of the clinical specimens matched a cooling tower at NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem.

[ProMED thanks Dr Mahmoud Orabi for this submission.

The initial cluster of 9 cases of legionnaires' disease in Aug 2021 in New York City (NYC) was localized to zip codes 10037 and 10039 in the northeastern portion of the borough of Manhattan. A map of Manhattan showing the location of these zip codes can be found at https://www.zipdatamaps.com/10037 and https://www.zipdatamaps.com/10039. (See ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (06): (NYC) northern Manhattan Archive Number: 20210820.8608820.) There are now 18 cases of legionnaires' disease associated with this cluster.

A cooling tower at Harlem Hospital is now said to be the source for the outbreak. Harlem Hospital is a 272-bed, public teaching hospital, with a Level 1 Trauma Center and a Burn Center, located at 506 Lenox Avenue in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in the 10037 zip code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Hospital_Center).

The news report and the report from the NYC Department of Health above say that "sputum samples from patients and water samples from the cooling towers in the investigation area" were analyzed and _Legionella_ bacteria from one of the sputum specimens matched [presumably by genotyping] _Legionella_ isolated from a cooling tower at Harlem Hospital. But what of the other 17 patients? Was the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease in these 17 patients based on urinary antigen testing with no _Legionella_ isolates available for genotyping, or is there another explanation? More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
