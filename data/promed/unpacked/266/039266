I have followed with great interest the many suggestions and criticisms
posted on ProMED-mail about how the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) should be handling preparedness for foot and mouth disease (FMD). I
would like the opportunity to respond very briefly.
Contrary to impressions one might have from your postings, the USDA has
been involved actively in a National Animal Health Emergency Management
System for a number of years to plan, prepare, respond, and recover from an
animal health incident with a foreign animal disease or from a natural
disaster. The USDA and its state and industry partners in animal health
have been excluding, responding to, and/or eradicating domestic, emerging,
and foreign animal diseases for more than 100 years, and have had an
enviable track record of successes.
The current system has involved active discussions, planning, test
exercises, and actual field responses with USDA personnel and many other
persons and organizations concerned with animal health. These include state
animal health officials, other federal agencies, USDA-accredited veterinary
practitioners, representatives of the livestock and poultry industries,
university animal health experts, wildlife officials, representatives of
professional veterinary organizations, and our North American trading
partners, to name a few.
Your readers may be interested to know that the national discussion and the
national plans for FMD have addressed all of the suggestions offered by the
moderators and a number of additional issues as well, including other
foreign animal diseases.
I wish to address one specific suggestion and associated editorial opinion
recently posted. "Confirmed diagnosis, when necessary, within 3 hours of
any sick animal's being seen. With presently available hand-held ELISA kits
this should be possible even within 15 minutes ... We are amazed at the
number of states that seem to be ignorant of this." This statement is a
glaring piece of misinformation that has no basis in fact. Obviously, with
the recent FMD activity, there is intense international interest in
diagnostics.
While the USDA would be keenly interested in any kit that could be used in
the field to diagnose FMD within 15 minutes, we are unaware of the
commercial availability of any such diagnostic kits. We have seen no
publications of this technology in refereed scientific journals. No
diagnostic kit or reagents have been presented to USDA for scientific
assessment and validation against licensed or internationally accepted
tests at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Plum Island, NY.
No reagents, kits, or techniques have been submitted to the Centers for
Veterinary Biologics, Ames, IA, for licensing. If the moderators of
ProMED-mail have any information to enlighten us, it would be helpful if
that information were forwarded to USDA, or more appropriately, if the
developer(s) of this technology be referred to the USDA.
And may I suggest the statement "... states ... seem to be ignorant of
this... " is an inappropriate and inaccurate assessment of the facts. The
animal health professionals and technical experts in the state, federal,
and university animal disease diagnostic laboratories and in the field are
well aware of available diagnostic technologies. I can assure you that when
rapid, handheld diagnostic technology is validated and available, it will
be distributed to and used by USDA and state professionals in the field.

[Although the USDA has a relatively good track record in a number of areas,
the communication within this agency is not altogether appropriate. After
numerous telephone calls with questions on this topic, there have been as
many different answers as phone calls and people. This may not be
altogether bad, except that each answer contradicted what someone else had
said. Furthermore, there is still the issue of how quickly the USDA
could/would respond and how quickly they will be overwhelmed.
As yet USDA has not mentioned an indemnity plan, though funds will no doubt
mysteriously appear when the Office Internationale des Epizooties stop USA
exports in the event this disease arrives in the US.
As to Dr Walton's claim "This statement [on 15-minute PCR field test
availability is a glaring piece of misinformation that has no basis in
fact. Obviously, with the recent FMD activity, there is intense
international interest in diagnostics." Firstly, this was put into our list
because there is a clear and obvious need for such a field test, whether or
not it presently exists. The recent British experience has highlighted
this. Secondly, through the US Department of Energy there has been a very
serious thrust over the past 6 years with significant funding to develop
such field kits for human diseases, including virus infections. The
technology is now out there and working successfully. Some are truly
handheld devices. While I know the institutes and individuals involved, I
do advise people to first approach Plum Island and discover what they are
doing and planning there with a private company. Their box weighs only 27
lbs and is mobile. It is undergoing trials at the moment in the BL4
facility -- I am told successfully -- and that publication will follow
sometime in the fall.
We would recommend that Dr Walton consult the 2 references posts at the
beginning of this post. Please remember that much of our information has
come from such USDA people as Roger Breeze and other sources within the
USDA or Pirbright. Â­ Mods.TG/MHJ
