Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: RHDV2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Madina County, Medina, Ohio

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Hares/ rabbits / 5 / 4 / 4 / 0 / 0
Affected population: non-commercial pet rabbits.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is a serious and extremely contagious viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. Morbidity and mortality rates are high in unvaccinated animals; on some farms, most or all of the rabbits may die. This disease has also caused dramatic declines in some wild rabbit populations, particularly when it is 1st introduced. This has had a detrimental effect on some ecosystems in Europe, where wild rabbits are an important food source for certain endangered predators, such as Iberian lynx (_Lynx pardinus_). Conversely, rabbit hemorrhagic disease has been used to help control excessive numbers of wild, non-native European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) in Australia.

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus _Lagovirus_ and family Caliciviridae. There are many strains of RHDV, and 3e major viral subtypes: RHDV ("classical RHDV"), the antigenic variant RHDVa, and the recently emerged virus RHDV2 (also called RHDVb). Classical RHDV and RHDVa comprise one serotype, while RHDV2 belongs to a different serotype.

"RHDV2 affects young rabbits as well as older animals; clinical cases have been reported in rabbits as young as 11 days of age. The clinical signs are similar to the illness caused by RHDV/RHDVa; however, experimentally infected rabbits generally survived longer, and peracute or acute cases were less common. A captive Italian hare infected with RHDV2 had no clinical signs other than epistaxis before death. Wild Cape hares infected with this virus were found dead.

"There is no indication that RHDV infects humans". http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf
