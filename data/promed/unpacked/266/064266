Epidemiological summary
- Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX).

- On 26 May 2022, a monkeypox National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated in response to the risk assessment conducted, which put Nigeria at high risk for a monkeypox outbreak. The essence of the activation was to improve the coordination of related preparedness/response activities across the country.

- There were 44 new suspected cases reported in Epi week 22, 2022 (30 May - 5 Jun 2022) from 14 states: Kebbi (11), Lagos (8), Gombe (4), Plateau (4), Rivers (3), Adamawa (2), Edo (2) Kano (2), FCT (2), Niger (2), Ondo (1), Katsina (1), Bayelsa (1) and Imo (1).

- From 1 Jan - 5 Jun 2022, there have been 110 suspected cases in total and 31 confirmed cases from 12 states: Adamawa (5), Lagos (6), River (3), Cross River (2), FCT (2), Kano (2), Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), Edo (2), Imo (2), Plateau (2), and Ondo (1). One death was recorded in a 40-year-old man with co-morbidity that was receiving immunosuppressive drugs.

- There were 10 new positive cases in Epi week 22, 2022 from 6 states: Edo (2), Rivers (2), Plateau (2), Lagos (2), Ondo (1) and Imo (1).

- Overall and from September 2017 to 5 Jun 2022, a total of 622 suspected cases have been reported from 33 states in the country.

- Of the reported cases, 257 (41.3%) have been confirmed in 23 states: Rivers (55), Bayelsa (45), Lagos (36), Delta (31), Cross River (16), Edo (12), Imo (10), Akwa Ibom (7), Oyo (6), FCT (8), Plateau (5), Adamawa (5), Enugu (4), Abia (3), Nasarawa (2), Benue (2), Anambra (2), Ekiti (2), Kano (2), Ebonyi (1), Niger (1), Ogun (1) and Ondo (1).

- In addition, from September 2017 to 5 Jun 2022, a total of 9 deaths have been recorded (CFR = 3.5%) in 6 states: Lagos (3), Edo (2), Imo (1), Cross River (1), FCT (1) and Rivers (1).

Response activities [See URL for activities to date and next steps for:
Coordination
Surveillance
Case management
IPC
POE
Laboratory
Risk communication]

Challenges with monkeypox surveillance
1. Non-prioritisation of monkeypox as a disease of public health importance due to low-risk perception

Recommendations
1. Risk communication and social mobilization

KEY ACTIVITIES
Coordination
1. The multi-agency MPX Emergency Operation Centre coordinates monkeypox activities at NCDC.
2. Offsite support is being provided to states.

Epidemiology/surveillance
1. Deployment of the One-Health animal surveillance team to Adamawa's state.

Next steps
1. Conduct active case searches in facilities and communities that have been reporting positive cases.
2. Weekly follow-up calls/emails to the state's surveillance team and MPX treatment facilities.
3. Follow up with trained HCWs on plans for step down training.

Notes on this report
Data source: Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Monkeypox Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions
Suspected case: An acute illness with fever >38.3C [101F], intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed 1 to 3 days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of the hand.

Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory-confirmed but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case.

Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.

Contact: Any person who has been in direct or indirect contact with a confirmed case since the onset of symptoms, i.e., contact with skin lesions, oral secretions, urine, faeces, vomitus, blood, sexual contact, sharing a common space (anyone who has been in close proximity with or without physical contact with a confirmed case).

Calculations
Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[Monkeypox (MPX) cases continue to occur in Nigeria this year (2022). There are 110 suspected cases and 31 confirmed cases, 10 of which occurred in the past Epi week 22. Monkeypox virus clearly is endemic in Nigeria. Cases occur sporadically throughout the year and across the country except to the far northeast. The above report does not indicate which of the 2 clades of MPX virus are responsible for the cases. The reported case fatality rate of 3.6% is higher than the usual 1% for the West African clade but lower than the up to 10% for the Central African clade.

The report does not indicate if the reported cases are due to person-to-person transmission or to contact with infected wild mammals. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus has been shown to be transmitted between people in Africa, but not readily. - Mod.TY
