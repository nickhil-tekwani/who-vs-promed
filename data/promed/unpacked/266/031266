In reply to Carlos West:
The British Ministry of Health Report on the Pandemic of Influenza
1918-19 published in 1920 has a section devoted to the world wide
distribution of influenza at this time. I quote two sections.
St Helena
-----------
St Helena is one of the few places that appears to have escaped any
serious epidemic of influenza in 1918. In that year the total civilian
death rate for the island was only 9.85 per thousand, the lowest rate
reported since 1909.
Pacific Islands
-----------------
The Commission reported that American Samoa (Pago Pago) had entirely
escaped the ravages of influenza, and it appears, from their report,
that from the 20th November, to avoid the risk of introduction from
Apia, the United States Governor at Pago Pago imposed on all ships
arriving at this port five days absolute quarantine before discharging
or taking on board any mail or cargo.
POLYNESIA
Dr. Cumpston, Director of Quarantine for the Commonwealth of Australia,
has drawn attention to the relative incidence of influenza in certain of
the Pacific Islands. He notes that the Tonga and Samoan Islands are
based upon New Zealand, from which they receive all supplies. Both these
groups of islands were very heavily infected and suffered a high
mortality.
On the other hand, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, New Hebrides, Norfolk
Island, Solomon Islands, British and German New Guinea and New Caledonia
all are based on Australia, with which alone they have communication.
This group of islands entirely escaped influenza infection, a result
which is ascribed by the French Authorities and by the local British
Administration to the strict outward quarantine precautions which were
taken by the Australian Quarantine Service in respect of all vessels
leaving Australia for these island groups.

I cannot find any reference to Tristan da Cunha.

[We thank Professor Cartwright for this response. I am sure all readers
interested in the 1918 flu will have found it a fascinating account.
This is yet another example of how there is always an expert somewhere
on ProMED-mail ready to answer even the most obscure question - Mod.JW
