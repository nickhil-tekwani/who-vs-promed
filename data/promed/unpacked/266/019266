Health Canada has recently become aware of 16 cases of _Salmonella_
infection where infected individuals may have come into contact with these
bacteria by directly handling pig's-ear dog treats. Investigations by
health authorities in the province of Alberta and at Health Canada have
linked some of these cases to products made by Farm Meats Canada Ltd,
Alberta. The pig's-ear dog treats in question are distributed widely in
Canada. At this time, Health Canada cannot specify the brand names of the
affected treats since many are sold in bulk. Further investigations are
underway to determine how widespread infections associated with this
product have become.
Because the problem may not be limited to a single manufacturer, as a
general precaution, members of the public are advised to wash their hands
thoroughly with warm water and soap after contact with pig's-ear dog
treats. It is advised that people with a particular risk of infection,
particularly children, the elderly and people who are immunodeficient,
should not handle pig's-ear dog treats. Furthermore, children,
particularly, should be reminded never to put products intended for
consumption by pets into their mouths and to wash their hands after playing
with animals.
Symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection usually include diarrhea, abdominal
pain, nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. Children, elderly persons and
people with depressed immune systems may be at risk of more serious illness
and should consult their doctors if symptoms persist for more than a few
hours.

[If the level of _Salmonella_ is high enough for the health authorities to
warn people to take extra precautions of hand washing, then dogs should not
be receiving them as treats as dogs are susceptible to _Salmonella_.
Although there is some debate among veterinarians regarding how sensitive
dogs are, the issue is the health authorities should have recommended
discontinuing the treats until the problem is resolved. - Mod.TG]
