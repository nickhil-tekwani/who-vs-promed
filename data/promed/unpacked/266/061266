The government of Venezuela has said that it had contained a cholera
outbreak that at its peak sickened hundreds of its citizens, who
caught the disease at a wedding in the Dominican Republic.

Officials in Caracas said they planned to implement a follow up
program this week [week of 21 Feb 2011] to verify that every remnant
of the disease had been completely eradicated throughout the country,
but were confident that they had halted its spread.

The illness infected some 450 Venezuelans who attended a wedding in
January 2011 in the Dominican Republic that borders Haiti, which was
the original source of the outbreak of the waterborne bacterial disease.

Venezuela said it succeeded in stopping the spread of the disease by
putting those who attended the wedding under quarantine.

[It is not clear if any of the reported cases in Venezuela were
locally acquired. "Halting" the spread of the infection implies that
spread had occurred. If not, preventing the spread would be a better
term. In some earlier reports, it was not clearly stated whether all
those treated were symptomatic, were culture positive, or were treated
because of going to the wedding in the Dominican Republic. - Mod.LL]
