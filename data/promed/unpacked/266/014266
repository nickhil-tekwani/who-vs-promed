Enzootic bovine leucosis [EBL], Finland
---------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 2 Apr 2008 from Mrs Riitta Heinonen,
deputy director general, Department of Food and Health, Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry, Helsinki, Finland

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 3 Jan 2008
Date of first confirmation of the event: 17 Jan 2008
Date submitted to OIE: 2 Apr 2008
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1996
Causal agent: enzootic bovine leukosis virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Outbreak 1: Muhos testing station, Oulu
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Jan 2008
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species: cattle
Susceptible: 27
Cases: 1
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 1
Affected population: a 13 month old bull intended for artificial insemination

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: the bull tested positive during the quarantine
required for moving from the rearing station to the artificial insemination
centre. Before final results were available, the bull was slaughtered [for]
other reasons. Consequently, no virus isolation could be carried out
afterwards. Other bulls in the same group have tested negative but are
still under movement restrictions. Also, the positive bull and the herd of
origin tested negative before the bull entered the rearing station in
spring 2007. The farm of origin, including the dam of the infected bull and
another calf of the dam were tested again in February 2008 with negative
results but are still under movement restrictions. The tracing of the
origin of the infection continues. Finland officially declared its whole
territory free from enzootic bovine leukosis since 1999.

Control measures
Measures applied:
- quarantine
- movement control inside the country
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
- vaccination prohibited [irrelevant; there is no EBL vaccine. - Mod.AS]
- no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: no other measures

laboratory)

[Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a disease of adult cattle caused by the
retrovirus, bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). Cattle may be infected at any
age, including the embryonic stage. Most infections are subclinical, but a
proportion of cattle (about 30 per cent) over 3 years old develop
persistent lymphocytosis, and a smaller proportion develop lymphosarcomas
(tumours) in various internal organs. Clinical signs, if present, depend on
the organs affected. Cattle with lymphosarcomas almost invariably die
either suddenly, or weeks or months after the onset of clinical signs.

EBL is subject to a test and slaughter program in some EU countries. The
disease is present in many industrialised countries, including the USA; it
is not a zoonotic disease.
