There have been 4 confirmed cases of a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_ in the Fredericton area, according to public health officials. _E. coli_ O157:H7 is the same type that killed 7 people in Walkerton, Ontario, in 2000. The source of the infectious bacteria that multiplies quickly remains unclear.

Public health is investigating to determine where the affected individuals in Fredericton ate, what they ate, and whether the cases might be connected, said Dr Denis Allard, the province's acting chief medical officer of health, in a statement. "Pending lab results could determine if the bacteria share the same DNA pattern, suggesting a common source," Allard said.

It could be next week before those results are available, he added, declining any further comment.

Allard says 3 of the Fredericton cases were hospitalized. 2 have been treated and released.

The main symptom for this type of _E. coli_ is bloody diarrhea, but it can also cause vomiting and stomach cramps. Unlike other illnesses, there is no fever.

The confirmed cases come on the heels of an outbreak in Miramichi in April 2012. At least 13 people were infected with the potentially deadly strain and another 11 people may have also been infected by the same strain, officials had said. Romaine lettuce was recently determined to be the likely source of that outbreak.

[It is not clear if this outbreak is related to the earlier outbreak in Miramichi. We await more information regarding the scope and source of this enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ cluster.
