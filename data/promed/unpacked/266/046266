Research is to start on primates and genetically engineered rats to study
drugs that might prevent the development of human BSE [Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, also known in humans as new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease or nvCJD of which there have been 38 cases. An expert government
committee called for this to be given high priority.
A study by the neuropathogenesis unit in Edinburgh, published by the Lancet,
showed that mice infected with scrapie, the BSE equivalent in sheep, can be
protected from spongiform disease by a single dose of pentosan polysulphate
soon after exposure to infection. However it must be given before clinical
signs appear. Pentosan polysulphate was originally developed to treat
cystitis [a type of bladder irritation/infection.
The Medical Research Council and Department of Health will form a group
considering treatments for human BSE -- nvCJD -- after comments by the
Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC). SEAC accepts [that the
drug, or similar ones, may be effective in preventing nvCJD, but widespread
use could not be justified at this time. Professor Sir John Pattison,
chairman of the committee, says that there are too many uncertainties. "We
believe that further research needs to be done, both into this drug and
others. If an efficacious compound was found, then its use might be
justified."
