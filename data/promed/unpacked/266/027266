From: "John W. Aldis, M.D." <jwaldis@email.msn.com>

I had heard the same story about a possible cholera outbreak in the
south
from the Human Resources man at Ford Motor Company. He went down to the
area 2-3 weeks ago to discuss the matter with his people there, and he
reviewed the situation with a local (Chinese) physician whom he
trusts. It
was that physician's opinion that while one can certainly anticipate a
rise
in water-borne GI illnesses, there was a general feeling that cholera
was
not happening in large numbers (if at all) at that time.
The H.R. man emphasized the importance of "common sense" in handling
water
and food, etc., which was the advice he got from his own home office.
Of course, when one sees deaths in the face of epidemic diarrhea,
cholera is
a likely suspect. However, I am forever impressed with how the Chinese
can
actually "create a panic" by trying to cover up a situation. In other
words, "In spite of the fact that the Chinese deny there is a serious
problem, there might actually be no serious problem."
For the record, I am not aware of any increase in diarrhea in our people
at
the consulates around China or here in the Embassy in Beijing.

[Dr Aldis promised to keep us up-to-date. In the 3 weeks since this was
written we have had no confirmed reports of cholera in Hubei or anywhere
else in China from him or any other source, which is remarkable in the
face of the severe flooding. Besides, it should not be thought that the
cholera vaccination campaign aborted an epidemic, since the vaccine is
only 50% effective
