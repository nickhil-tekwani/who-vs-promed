The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has
urged heightened international surveillance against foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD), following 3 recent incursions in Japan and South Korea
with fears of possible spread to South Africa, United Kingdom, and
Europe. [The 2 introductions into S Korea related to 2 different FMDV
serotypes, 1st incursion was serotype A; the later, current incursion
is serotype O. The Japanese outbreak has been caused by FMDV serotype
O. Both serotypes are circulating in China. Genotyping not yet
performed or known. - Mod.AS].

Citing FAO's statement, Namibia Press Agency (Nampa) reported that in
the past 9 years, incursions into officially FMD-free countries
(Japan and the Republic of Korea) have been extremely rare and such
events in 4 months is a serious cause for concern.

The FAO's chief veterinary officer Juan Lubroth was quoted as saying
that the rigorous biosecurity measures in place in the 2 countries
were overwhelmed and pointed to a recent, large-scale weight of
infection in source areas, very probably in the Far East [see
moderator's remark above. - Mod.AS]

The 2001 FMD outbreak caused losses in billions of dollars to
agriculture, livestock trade, and tourism in the United Kingdom alone.

So far Japan has had to slaughter 385 animals -- buffaloes, cattle
and pigs -- in its initial response to the outbreak, and the Republic
of Korea has destroyed more than 3500 animals, mostly pigs, in
responding to its outbreaks.

According to the FAO, the routes taken by the virus have not been
identified, but experts say it is possible the infection occurred
through food waste, with pigs eating infected meat scraps.

a reference laboratory for confirmation and genotyping of their
respective virus strains. - Mod.AS]
