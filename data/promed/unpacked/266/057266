The AIIMS [All India Institute of Medical Science] researchers found the presence of malaria parasite _Plasmodium knowlesi_ in the north Indian population while doing a study on patients with acute febrile illnesses (AFI) and pathogens causing them.

_Plasmodium knowlesi_ is found in nature in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques. The zoonotic parasite was found in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Delhi. A previous study at AIIMS had found its presence in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

The patients were admitted to the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) from July 2017 to September 2018. The AIIMS research team also found simultaneous pathogenic infections in patients with fever, influencing the severity of the disease. The patients were co-infected with other pathogens like dengue virus and bacterial species _Leptospira_ and _Orientia tsutsugamushi_.

[The natural host of _Plasmodium knowlesi_ is the macaque monkey and the present understanding is that human cases are infected from the monkeys and that human to human transmission does not occur. _P. knowlesi_ occurs in all areas of Southeast Asia where the macaque monkey is distributed. Therefore it is no surprise that is found in areas of India where the macaque monkeys are present. - Mod.EP
