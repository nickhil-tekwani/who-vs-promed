A pneumonia outbreak has killed at least 33 bighorn sheep in the Mojave Desert this summer [2013], threatening one of [California]'s healthiest herds and leaving experts fearing a more widespread die-off.

Wildlife managers have shot 7 of the animals to test for the disease. They are considering widespread removal and killing of visibly sick animals to keep the disease from infecting other herds in the 1.6-million-acre Mojave National Preserve, which was set aside for its scenic beauty and diverse wildlife, said Debra Hughson, the preserve's science adviser. About 300 sheep are at risk around Old Dad Mountain and Kelso Peak, 15 miles south east of Baker, where the outbreak is centered.

Pneumonia is devastating to bighorn sheep. They catch it from domestic goats, sheep and cattle, which can be unaffected by the disease, said Jim DeForge, executive director and research biologist with the Bighorn Institute, a private research and education group in Palm Desert.

As many as 90 per cent of those infected will die. The few survivors pass the disease on to lambs, with almost always fatal results, and a herd can be impacted for a decade.

"To see a large-scale die-off like this, it's a pretty hard hit to take, especially when this is a native population that has been so robust," Regina Abella, desert bighorn sheep coordinator at the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, said Wednesday, 14 Aug 2013. "It's pretty disheartening."

Officials think the source of the disease was a feral angora goat that was shot by a hunting guide last fall [2012] near a water source, Marl Springs, about 12 miles east of Old Dad Mountain, Hughson said. Because of the threat of disease outbreaks, hunters are required to turn over such kills to officials.

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Pneumonia in the bighorn sheep is generally caused by a _Mycoplasma_ sp. organism. The epidemiology of determining that a goat may have been the cause is bound to be fascinating.

This kind of outbreak is very heartbreaking. We hope these animals survive. - Mod.TG
