Re: Section [9] Mexico of Dengue/DHF update 2005 (27) 20050831.2569 posted on
31 Aug 2005:
Section [9] Mexico contains 6 misquoted paragraphs -- from paragraph 10
beginning "During the current epidemiological week [3rd week August 2005]..."
through the last paragraph ending "...and Thira (77)", which were actually
about Venezuela and already posted in section [8] Venezuela of Dengue/DHF
update 2005 (26) archive number 20050824.2497.
ProMED apologizes for the error and thanks Mr Kazumasa Fujitani of the Tokyo
Metropolitan Infectious Disease Surveillance Center for pointing this out. -
