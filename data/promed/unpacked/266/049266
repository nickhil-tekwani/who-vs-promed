The State Secretariat of Health (SES/MT), through State Epidemiological Surveillance, confirmed a case of human yellow fever in the state. The patient is from Primavera do Leste, works as a grain sorter, and is responding well to treatment.

In the face of this case, the Health Surveillance of the municipality, with the support of the Regional Health Office (ERS) of Rondonópolis, triggered preventive and control actions for the disease beginning with an emergency strategic meeting between the 2 teams, followed by investigation of the positive case and of the site of possible infection.

A technical note signed by the Management of Diseases and Endemic Diseases and Coordination of Epidemiological Surveillance states that it also carried out the investigation of possible infected monkeys in the region, an active search for patients with possible symptoms of yellow fever in the health units of the municipality, and a vaccination barrier of the population without vaccine registration.

The case remains under investigation because, during an interview, the patient related that, in the period before the symptoms of the disease appeared, he had traveled in various rural areas in the municipalities of Primavera do Leste, Itiquira, Campo Verde and Alto Taquari.

In view of this report, the ERS team in Rondonópolis needed to extend actions to these other municipalities, holding an expanded meeting to prepare the response plan. The 4 have already prepared their respective plans, and, in all, there is an anticipated "D-Day" to pass information to the population and for immunization of those who have not yet been vaccinated.

SES requested sufficient doses of vaccine for these 4 municipalities from the National Immunization Program (PNI). Mato Grosso is an endemic area for the disease, and in the period from 2010 to 2017, 44 suspected cases were reported, and none of these were confirmed. The last confirmed case in the state was in 2009, in the municipality of Feliz Natal.

The Unified Health System (SUS) offers vaccine against yellow fever for the population. Since April 2017, Brazil has adopted a one-dose lifetime vaccination schedule, a measure that is in accordance with the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). Any person residing in Yellow Fever Vaccine Recommendation Areas and persons traveling to these areas should be immunized.

The vaccination for yellow fever is offered in the routine [immunizations] of the municipalities with vaccination recommendation in the following states: Acre, Amazonas, Amapá, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, Tocantins, Federal District, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, Bahia, Maranhão, Piauí, Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. In addition to the recommended areas, currently, the population of Espírito Santo is also being vaccinated.

[Had the individual not been vaccinated? When did symptoms appear? Suspected and reported when? Laboratory confirmation when? What is the current clinical status of the patient? - Mod.RNA]

[Brazil has had an extensive yellow fever (YF)_ outbreak in the east of the country this year (2018), so it is not surprising that this case set off alarm bells in the Mato Grosso public health agencies. As a single case with a travel history in rural municipalities, this is likely one resulting from sylvan (forest) transmission and not urban, _Aedes aegypti_ transmission with a risk of an outbreak in populated areas. An 8 May 2018 report from the Brazil Ministry of Health listed 4 human YF cases under investigation and one confirmed as well as 10 non-human primate cases and one confirmed in Mato Grosso state so far this year (2018) (see ProMED-mail Yellow fever - Americas (31): Brazil 20180511.5792117). The public health officials at the state and local level are prudently responding quickly to identify any additional human cases and to vaccinate individuals who have not received the vaccine previously. - Mod.TY
