The U.S. pork industry is facing a deadly swine virus that has now spread to 13 different states, with more than 100 positive cases being found since the virus was diagnosed just last month [May 2013].

Known as the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the rapidly spreading virus is proving even harder to control than the 99.4 percent similar Chinese virus that killed more than one million piglets since 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infectious Diseases Journal.

However, federal officials say that the virus poses no health risk to humans or other animals and that such pigs are still safe for people to eat.

PEDV was diagnosed earlier this month [June 2013] for the 1st time in Arkansas, Kansas and Pennsylvania. Previously, the virus had been found in barns in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Dakota.

The virus has been found in baby pigs, adult sows and other hogs which are being fattened for slaughter in the U.S. How and when the virus came to the states is still unknown. The 1st U.S. case of PEDV was reported on 17 May 2013. But researchers at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa and other diagnostic labs have since discovered that PEDV arrived as early as 16 Apr 2013, according to the American Association of Swine Veterinarians.

U.S. Agriculture Department investigators are looking for clues to the growing outbreak and focusing their efforts on the U.S. livestock transportation system.

"It could happen at the slaughterhouse, where you have a trailer unloading a truck of pigs that was positive," Dr. Montserrat Torremorell of the University of Minnesota told Reuters, who noted that diagnostic researchers at the University of Minnesota and elsewhere have tested hundreds of samples in recent weeks.

"If the person doesn't clean the trailer correctly and then goes to load up another load of pigs that were negative for PEDV, that person could end up delivering a truck of pigs to an uninfected farm," she said.

A swine virus deadly to young pigs, and never before seen in North America, has spiked to 199 sites in 13 states, nearly double the number of farms and other locations from earlier this month [June 2013].

Iowa, the largest U.S. hog producer, has the most sites testing positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: 102 sites as of 10 Jun 2013. The state raises on average 30 million hogs each year, according to the Iowa Pork Producers Association.

PEDV, most often fatal to very young pigs, causes diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. It also sickens older hogs, though their survival rate tends to be high.

The total number of pig deaths from the outbreak since the 1st cases were confirmed on 17 May 2013 is not known.

Researchers at veterinarian diagnostic labs, who are testing samples as part of a broad investigation into the outbreak, have seen a substantial increase in positive cases since early June 2013, when data on the PEDV outbreak showed it at some 103 sites nationwide.

The data was compiled and released last week by Iowa State University, University of Minnesota, Kansas State University, and South Dakota State University.

The virus does not pose a health risk to humans or other animals, and the meat from PEDV-infected pigs is safe for people to eat, according to federal officials and livestock economists.

But the virus, which is spreading rapidly across the United States, is proving harder to control than previously believed. In addition to Iowa, Oklahoma has 38 positive sites, Minnesota has 19, and Indiana has 10, according to the data.

PEDV has also been diagnosed in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania and South Dakota.

Swine veterinarians, investigators with the U.S. Agriculture Department and others are trying to determine how the virus is spreading from farm to farm and state to state. Currently, the focus is on the nation's livestock transportation system.

PEDV is spread most commonly by pigs ingesting contaminated feces. Investigators are studying physical transmission, such as truck trailers marred with contaminated feces or a person wearing dirty boots or with dirty nails.

While the virus has not tended to kill older pigs, mortality among very young pigs infected in U.S. farms is commonly 50 percent and can be as high at 100 percent, say veterinarians and scientists who are studying the outbreak.

The strain of the PEDV virus that is making its way across the nation's hog farms and slaughterhouses is 99.4 percent similar in genetic structure to the PEDV that hit China's herds last year [2012], according to the U.S. researchers.

After PEDV was 1st diagnosed in China in 2010, it overran southern China and killed more than one million piglets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infectious Diseases Journal.

No direct connection has been found between the U.S. outbreak and previously identified outbreaks in Asia and Europe, say scientists and researchers.

Mexico said on Tue 25 Jun 2013 that it has restricted live pork imports from the United States, citing an outbreak of a deadly piglet virus that has spread north of the border.

Mexico's Agriculture Ministry said it would review imports on a case-by-case basis and said it had not detected the virus in Mexico.

It added that pigs imported from the United States prior to 17 May 2013 would be quarantined and closely observed. It is checking all lots of pigs imported from the United States during the past 3 months.

[The understanding of this virus still seems to be emerging as much as the disease itself. It seems odd to me that these news articles state that this virus does not transmit to people through consumption of infected animals. How is that known? Where is the research, and since when have our food safety authorities let diseased animals into our food supply? Perhaps someone from USDA would care to comment? - Mod.TG
