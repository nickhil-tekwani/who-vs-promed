Search for Prions in Bovine Muscle Draws Blank
----------------------------------------------
Tests by government scientists in France have allayed renewed fears
that eating beef can cause variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
[abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail, the human
form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The fears were heightened on 18 Mar 2002 when scientists
unexpectedly reported finding traces of infective material in the
muscles of mice. The findings carried extra weight because they came
from the laboratory of Stanley Prusiner, the scientist at the University
of California in San Francisco who won a Nobel Prize for discovering
mutated "prions." These are the defective proteins believed to cause
brain-wasting diseases like BSE, vCJD and scrapie. Prions are known
to collect in brains, spinal cords, spleens, and other lymphoid tissue,
and these parts have long been banned for human consumption.
Muscle tissue in meat was assumed to be free of prion contamination
and safe to eat. But Prusiner's team found prions in the hind leg
muscles of mice whose brains had been injected with BSE-like prions.
He reported his results in 19 Mar 2002 issue of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, USA [see: ProMED-mail post "Murine
prions, presence in muscle tissue 20020321.3785". - Mod.CP.
The new twist in the story came on Wed 27 Mar 2002, when French
government scientists announced that they had drawn a complete blank
when they looked for prions in muscles from several BSE or scrapie-
infected animals including mice, sheep, goats, and cows. "The tests
proved negative in the search for pathological prions in the set of
samples, including those taken from the hind limb muscles," says the
AFSSA, France's food safety watchdog.
Reassuringly, tests on peripheral nerves and lymphoid tissue in the cow
also came up negative, suggesting that meat will be safe even if it
contains this type of tissue. "These observations are consistent with the
findings made to date concerning the distribution of the infectivity
linked to BSE in cows," they say.
The researchers detected prions with 2 tests. The first, an "ELISA" test,
detects antibodies made by animals against prions. The second
"western blotting" test isolates and identifies fragments of the prion
protein itself. The scientists will discuss their results in more detail at a
meeting of France's top BSE specialists on Thu 11 Apr 2002.
The significance of Prusiner's results has also been questioned in
Britain. Peter Smith, chairman of the government's Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, told New Scientist that a much
more significant experiment had been under way for 5 years in Britain,
and had yet to give any cause for concern. Instead of using a surrogate
animal like the mouse, this experiment is focusing on which cattle
tissues can transmit BSE to other cattle. Scientists at the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, injected the brains of live
calves with liquidised tissue from various parts of the bodies of BSE-
infected cows.
"None injected with muscle have gone down yet," says Smith. "But if
you inject BSE-infected brain tissue, the calves come down with BSE
in about 2 years, as expected," he says. "If there is infectivity in muscle,
it must be at a much lower level than in other tissue, particularly that
from the brain or central nervous system," says Smith. You can never
prove a negative, he adds, but the results so far have been reassuring.
