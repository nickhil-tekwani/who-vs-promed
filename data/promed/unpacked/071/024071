[Interestingly, La Estrella reported on 18 Mar 2014 that the Panama Ministry of Health recommended that travelers not go to the localities where chikungunya virus is being transmitted (http://www.laestrella.com.pa/online/impreso/2014/03/18/minsa-recomienda-no-viajar-a-zonas-con-chikungunya-medida-204905.asp). The islands where the chikungunya virus is being transmitted are popular tourist destinations. A reduction in tourism would have significant adverse economic impacts there.

Maps showing the location of the islands mentioned can be accessed at http://carpha.org/What-We-Do/Public-Health-Activities/Chikungunya (with case numbers as of 17 Mar 2014) and http://healthmap.org/r/9NLv. - Mod.TY]

[2] ECDC review: Caribbean Basin
Date: 2-8 Mar 2014

On 6 Dec 2013, France reported 2 laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases of chikungunya [virus infection] in the French part of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin. Since then, local transmission has been confirmed in the Dutch part of Saint Martin, on Martinique, Saint Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Anguilla, and French Guyana. Aruba only reported imported cases. This is the 1st documented outbreak of chikungunya with autochthonous transmission in the Americas. As of 21 Mar 2014, there have been more than 15 000 probable and confirmed cases in the region. There have been 5 fatalities reported.

Update of the week:
During the past week, the number of new cases reported increased in some of the affected areas but at a lower rate than the previous weeks, the only exception being Dominica. No new affected islands were reported, but in Martinique and Guadeloupe, new municipalities were affected. The islands affected are St. Martin/St. Maarten, Martinique, Saint Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, Virgin Islands (UK), Anguilla, Dominica, Aruba, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and French Guiana in mainland South America. In most of the territories of the French Antilles, given the load of cases, the health authorities decided not to seek laboratory confirmation for all suspected cases.

[3] Dominica
Date: Wed 19 Mar 2014

http://dominicavibes.dm/dominicans-urged-to-help-manage-spread-of-chikungunya-disease-2/


Dominicans have been called upon to play a greater role in managing the spread of chikungunya disease, which is reportedly increasing across the island.

The disease, 1st confirmed here in January 2014, is a viral disease carried mainly by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The symptoms of the disease include sudden high fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, rash, and severe pain in the wrists, ankles or knuckles.

Chief environmental health officer Anthony Scotland revealed on QFM Radio on Wed 19 Mar 2014 that as of 17 Mar 2014, there were 56 confirmed and 269 suspected cases of the disease in Dominica. These figures are based on confirmed information from the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CPHA). Scotland, therefore, urged citizens to wage war against the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito by disrupting their breeding areas and refraining from storing water in uncovered and untreated drums. The Ministry of Health, he said, will be placing emphasis on toppling drums, boring holes in drums, and giving notices to offenders.

Scotland emphasized that the cooperation of the public is critical in managing the outbreak.
