[2] South Korea: no additional cases among contacts
Date: Fri 21 Sep 2018

South Korea will lower its Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) alert level to its lowest readiness posture, as 21 people who came into close contact with a patient all tested negative for the disease, health authorities said Friday [21 Sep 2018].

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said it has reached the decision to lower the readiness level from "caution" to "attention" starting Saturday [22 Sep 2018].

The KCDC said that people who had been placed under quarantine -- including flight attendants and passengers on the same plane as the patient, medical staff, and immigration officials -- have all been checked and show no symptoms.

They will be released as of midnight Saturday [22 Sep 2018], as the maximum incubation period for secondary cases associated with limited human-to-human transmission of MERS is approximately 14 days, the KCDC said.

Earlier this week, the country's sole MERS patient was released from quarantine after testing negative for the respiratory disease. He was diagnosed with MERS on [8 Sep 2018] after returning home from a 3-week business trip to Kuwait via the United Arab Emirates. It was the 1st case of MERS diagnosed in South Korea since 2015.

The agency said it will lift monitoring of 396 people who came into ordinary contact with the MERS patient. They were not quarantined, but they had to report their health condition every day to officials in charge of monitoring.

MERS is a viral respiratory disease with a fatality rate of 20-46 percent. It is caused by a novel coronavirus carried by camels and can be spread when someone is in close contact with a patient for a sustained period.

The 1st MERS case was recorded in Saudi Arabia, and it has since spread to other countries. As of June this year [2018], the World Health Organization has reported 2229 laboratory-confirmed cases.

South Korea was hit by an outbreak in 2015, resulting in 38 deaths and 186 people testing positive for MERS.

[The Korean CDC press release on the case and lowering of threat level is available at http://www.cdc.go.kr/CDC/eng/info/CdcKPress.jsp?menuIds=HOME002-MNU0576-MNU0586&fid=8652&q_type=&q_value=&cid=140830&pageNum=.

In the past few weeks there have been additional suspected cases in returning travellers from the Middle East to South Korea that have been detected at the airport on arrival and referred to a hospital, with isolation precautions pending results of 2 separate tests for MERS-CoV presence (media reports are available on Yonhap News with the most recent report being today, Sat 29 Sep 2018; see http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/09/29/0200000000AEN20180929002051315.html).

The South Korean CDC is to be commended for the intense effort on training personnel how to "think MERS" and how to respond to a suspected case of MERS. - Mod.MPP
