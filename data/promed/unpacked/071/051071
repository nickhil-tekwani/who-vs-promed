Sylvia Gordon is plagued by painful muscles and joints, shortness of
breath and a lack of energy, all unwanted gifts of a disease that
keeps on giving. The nurse was among the 1st wave of health-care
workers and patients stricken by SARS [severe acute respiratory
syndrome] in early 2003, but the 5-month outbreak that killed 800
people worldwide, including 44 in the Toronto area, is far from done
among those who survived the disease.

Patients who were infected but came through the epidemic are learning
that severe acute respiratory syndrome can leave lingering physical
and psychological effects, which not only don't resolve over time but
can actually get worse. "I have not been able to return back to the
front line at all," said Gordon, 57, of her 22-year nursing career.
"It's very difficult because one day you're feeling really well and
the next day you're not."

SARS, initially considered a severely acute illness that would
resolve like other pneumonias, has turned out to be a chronic disease
with symptoms that researchers speculate could persist for life. "It
certainly is something that's unfolding that we're learning about,"
said Dr. Paula Gardner, a psychologist at St. John's Rehab Hospital
in Toronto, who is studying the long-term effects of SARS. "We
couldn't know this before because it's a completely new disease. "And
so we're sort of watching and waiting and measuring and trying to see
what's going to happen."

Gardner and a team of researchers at St. John's Rehab have been
following 40 people who contracted SARS in 2003, most of them
health-care workers. Their study, presented last month [August 2010]
at an International Congress of Behavioural Medicine meeting in
Washington, used questionnaires to assess the physical and
psychological health of participants in 2004 and again in 2007. "So
what we could do was get a snapshot at one year and at 4 years
(post-SARS), and then we could compare across time," Gardner said.
"At both time frames, the ratings of their general health and mental
health and vitality were all reduced from the norm."

What surprised the researchers was that patients not only weren't
getting better as time went on, many seemed to be getting
significantly worse. The study found that in 2007, almost 88 per cent
of patients were below average for measures of general health,
compared with about 49 per cent 3 years earlier. Participants, who
had an average age of 50, reported shortness of breath, muscle and
joint pain, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, and fatigue.
"And it's not the kind of fatigue like 'I just feel kind of tired
today.' It's the kind of fatigue where you do something for an hour,
you have to rest. You have no choice," Gardner said.

Patients, all of whom had been taking part in a SARS-rehabilitation
program at St. John's, also tended to have increased symptoms of
depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. In fact, about 30 per
cent of study participants showed distinct signs of post-traumatic
stress disorder, or PTSD, even 4 years after contracting SARS.

PTSD, a condition increasingly being diagnosed in war veterans, can
cause nightmares and flashbacks and lead the person to avoid talking
about the traumatic event or returning to the place where it
occurred. Many exhibit signs of hyperarousal, including irritability,
jumpiness and being constantly alert for danger.

"I guess what was surprising to us is that the number is so high,
even after such a long time," said Gardner. But she stressed that for
many with SARS, having the disease was a highly traumatic event.
"People came near death in most cases. It was a life-threatening
illness," she said. "You were isolated, so you were isolated away
from family and loved ones in a room, some people without a window.
And that went on for days and days. You didn't know if you were going
to live or die and see your family before that happened."

Gordon was a coronary intensive care nurse at Scarborough Grace
Hospital when she got SARS after caring for a patient admitted with
respiratory distress in March 2003. Hospital staff didn't know the
man had SARS, a new disease that had just begun striking people in
China. She was among 14 health-care workers from Scarborough Grace
placed into isolation for 2 weeks at another Toronto hospital, where
her husband and daughter were not allowed to visit. Some of her
colleagues or their family members died, as did the man who had infected her.

"It was just overwhelming," said Gordon, who believes she was among
those SARS patients who developed PTSD. "Mentally, I'm still very
cautious about diseases, where I go and hospital settings," she said.
"So it all interrelates, the physical and the psychological. It's
hard to differentiate when one is at work or if it's the other at
work." SARS patients also suffered from stigmatization because of
people's fear that any contact would mean certain infection and
possibly death, said Gardner, exacerbating the sense of isolation.

Gordon, who experienced depression and anxiety, recalls withdrawing
from people, in part because of the stigma that seemed to linger long
after she was no longer contagious. "I remember going into my dentist
4 years post-SARS, and she just panicked when I told her I had SARS,"
she said. "She just freaked right out."

While she has worked through a lot of her emotional issues -- among
them anger at how health-care workers were kept in the dark about the
new infectious threat and put unwittingly in harm's way -- Gordon
said that the physical residues of SARS are what most concern her
now. "I've come to terms with a lot of the issues that surrounded the
whole thing," she said. "But physically, I think I have to contend
with this forever."

[Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory
illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV). SARS was 1st reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the
next few months, the illness spread to more than 2 dozen countries in
North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before the SARS global
outbreak of 2003 was contained. According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide became sick with
SARS during the 2003 outbreak. Of these, 774 died.

In general, SARS begins with a high fever (temperature greater than
100.4 F [38.0 C]). Other symptoms may include headache, an overall
feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also have mild
respiratory symptoms at the outset. About 10 percent to 20 percent of
patients have diarrhea. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients may develop
a dry cough. Most patients develop pneumonia.

As a result of a world-wide containment programme, the last infected
human case occurred in late 2003 (apart from a laboratory-associated
infection in 2004). However, SARS is not claimed to have been
eradicated (unlike smallpox), as it may still be present in its
natural host reservoirs (animal populations) and may potentially move
into the human population again at some time in the future. Civet
cats in China were believed to be the original hosts of the virus
affecting the human population, but phylogenetic analysis now
suggests that the SARS coronavirus moved from bat to human to civet,
in that order.

It is not clear whether the long-term effects of SARS coronavirus
infection described in the Canadian survivors of SARS coronavirus
infection are particular to these patients and their specific
circumstances of exposure or whether they are a typical outcome of
the infection generally.
