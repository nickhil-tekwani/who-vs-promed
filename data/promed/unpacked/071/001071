Cases of the tickborne illness, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, are on the rise in Illinois. Our region [southern Illinois] is leading the state in 2013 confirmed cases. In 2011, Illinois had 51 confirmed cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In 2012, that jumped to 151. Jackson County alone saw 23 cases in 2012. Health officials there believe 2013 numbers could reach that same level. The woods and wilds of southern Illinois can be the perfect haven for ticks. "They can be active throughout the year," said Jackson County Health Department director of nurses, Karen Brown, "but especially during the warm months between April and September."

Out of 33 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever statewide between April and June 2013, 28 of them were in our region. "In Jackson County, we are leading the state in incidents," said Brown. "We've had 9 cases so far in 2013." Behind Jackson County is Hardin County with 6 cases. Saline and Williamson Counties both had 3 cases. White, Hamilton, Massac, Union, Washington, and Wayne Counties have also had confirmed cases.

"Everywhere from a one year old to an 81 year old," said Brown. "So no one is really exempt from this." Brown also expects those case numbers to rise. "We're still getting reports during the month of July and August," she said.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever typically develops a couple days after a bite from an infected tick. "What you see is a high fever," said Brown. "Also some people will develop a rash, but not always." Other symptoms include [severe - Mod.LL] headache, nausea, and muscle pain. While there is a cure, seeing a doctor is crucial. "It's important to get treatment right away because it can be a fatal disease if it's untreated," said Brown [see 2nd post - Mod.LL].

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed a Buncombe County child's death in early June 2013 was the result of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). This represents the 1st confirmed death due to RMSF in North Carolina since 2009. While deaths from this tickborne disease are rare, RMSF is the most commonly reported tickborne illness in the state.

In 2012, there were a total of 598 probable and laboratory-confirmed cases of RMSF reported from 78 counties across the state. For the 5-year period from 2008-2012, a cumulative total of 2044 cases were reported from 93 counties. North Carolina and Oklahoma are the states with the highest numbers of reported RMSF cases relative to their population each year.

"This death is a tragic reminder that ticks in our state can carry dangerous and potentially fatal diseases," said state health director Laura Gerald. "Transmission of RMSF from a tick can happen quickly after a bite, so the best way to prevent any tickborne illness is to limit the opportunity for exposure."

RMSF is caused by infection with the bacterial organism _Rickettsia rickettsii_, and is transmitted by the bite of an infected American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_). People typically become ill within 3-14 days following the bite of an infected tick.

Among tickborne diseases in the USA, RMSF has one of the highest risks of death. While the disease can usually be treated with antibiotics, 3 to 5 per cent of cases reported in the USA in recent years have been fatal.

[It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she
attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles
before becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
