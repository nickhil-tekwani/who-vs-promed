Nigeria: yellow fever final report - DREF operation no. MDRNG027, 20 Sep-20 Dec 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Situation analysis
Description of the disaster

In August 2019, the country had recorded an increase in the number of yellow fever cases in Katsina, Bauchi, and Benue States. By September 2017, all 36 States in Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory [FCT] had reported at least one suspected case of yellow fever. Between 1 and 31 Oct 2019, some 839 suspected cases were recorded from all states including FCT, adding up to a total of 3620 suspected cases reported in 588 LGAs [local government areas] since January 2019; with 18 States recording at least one confirmed case of yellow fever (NCDC Sit rep, Epi wk 40-44). To ensure a well-coordinated response and quick control of the outbreak, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) activated the national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) which met weekly to review the situation of the epidemic, partners intervention, identify gaps and proffer way forward.

In support to Government actions to curb the rising trend of the outbreak, the Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS) received support from IFRC through this DREF [Disaster Relief Emergency Fund] operation, launched for CHF 165 635 [about USD 170 000] in September 2019. Through this operation, NRCS was actively involved in the yellow fever (YF) response, mobilising communities for clean-up campaigns, destruction of mosquito breeding spaces, and providing risk communication messages to the affected populations in Katsina and Bauchi States. Through door-to-door education and awareness creation, dissemination of leaflets and posters with key messages on yellow fever, airing of jingles in Hausa and Jarawa languages, mobile cinema shows to publicly display a video of yellow fever transmission and prevention in the local language, as well as weekly live radio shows, reaching a total 1 669 757 people (278 292 HHs [households]) in Bauchi and Katsina States. This amounts to 69% above the planned target of 985,044 people.

YF is a mosquito-borne viral disease occurring in tropical regions of Africa and South America. YF is a completely vaccine preventable disease. In Nigeria, vaccination against yellow fever is primarily through the routine childhood immunisation and where necessary, catch up campaigns are carried out to increase population immunity. In the course of the outbreak, Bauchi state organised a mass vaccination campaign in 3 worst affected communities (Gudum Hausawa, Gudum Fulani, and Gudum Sayawa) and the NRCS volunteers moved door to door in the targeted areas to encourage households to ensure that their children and HH members below 44 years of age received the vaccine. In addition to providing support to the vaccination exercises, Red Cross volunteers also mobilised the community members to keep their environment clean and free of stagnant water to discourage the breeding of mosquitoes and ensure consistent use of insecticide treated mosquito nets, limit forest activities and have screens on windows and doors to prevent access for mosquitoes. Additionally, volunteers conducted door to door active case search to refer people with signs of community case definition of yellow fever to the nearest treatment centres.

B. Operational strategy
Overall operational objective

The objective of this operation was to reduce the incidence of yellow fever through intensified prevention and control activities at the household and community level.

Specific objectives were:
- To mobilise the community for the proposed YF mass campaign in Katsina and Bauchi states
- To provide health awareness on prevention of YF in the affected communities and to identify and refer people
with symptoms to the treatment centers of Bauchi and Katsina
- To destroy breeding grounds of mosquitoes within the houses and in the environment

Through this operation, NRCS reached out to 1 669 757 people out of the targeted 985 047, including 1 055 535 in (male: 578 239, female: 477 296 ) in Katsina and 614 222 people (male: 298 072, female: 316 150) in Bauchi.

The DREF intervention focused on three main strategies:
1. Community engagement through social mobilisation for YF mass campaign and/or health promotion
NRCS trained 651 community based volunteers to conduct social mobilisation for mass vaccination campaign in 20 LGAs in Katsina State (Daura, Malumfashi, Kurfi, Katsina, Bindawa, Funtua, Baure, Sandamu, Batagarawa, Maiadua, Charanchi, Mani, Mashi, Faskari, Kankara, Jibia, Danmusa, Batsari, Sabuwa, and Safana). Preceding the volunteers' training, was a one-day orientation for 20 trainers drawn from the 20 LGAs targeted. This orientation was facilitated by the State immunization technical team using a harmonized curriculum developed by the State. Trained volunteers conducted house to house education on the rationale of YF, its prevention and the importance of taking the YF vaccine, and mobilised the eligible persons for vaccination. At the end of the 10 days vaccination campaign, a total number of 761 385 eligible persons were mobilised for vaccination. 106 160 households were visited reaching 1 055 535 persons with preventive messages on Yellow Fever in 20 LGAs in Katsina State [see Table 1: People reached with YF preventive information at the source URL above]

Some 15 volunteers were trained as trainers in mobile cinema, radio shows and feedback mechanism to cascade the training to 150 volunteers in 4 Local Government Areas (LGAs) (Alkaleri, Bauchi, Tafawa Balewa, and Kirfi) in the state. This training was facilitated by the technical team from NRCS, State, and LGA Health Education Officers, the State Epidemiologist and Bauchi Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) members. Volunteers were trained on how to engage and mobilise the community people for YF vaccination and health promotion for behavioural change as well as awareness campaigns in social gatherings.

A great emphasis was laid on active case finding strategies and community case definition of yellow fever. Trained volunteers conducted house-to-house visits sensitising the community members on the transmission routes of YF, creating health awareness on YF prevention and the importance of vaccination. The volunteers worked 5 days in a week for the 1st 4 weeks, targeting at least 30 HHs each day, including markets, shops, schools, community gatherings and religious centers. As the number of cases began to reduce, activities were scaled down in Tafawa Balewa and Kirfi LGAs, while Alkaleri and Bauchi LGAs continued for another 2 weeks. In total, 614 222 persons were reached with preventive messages on YF in 44 wards in 4 LGAs in Bauchi.

To stop further spread of the YF virus and boost herd immunity in the worst affected LGA, the Bauchi state Government implemented a yellow fever reactive mass vaccination campaign in Bauchi LGA and the NRCS volunteers were actively involved in the targeted settlements, creating awareness and mobilising community members for vaccination. They also provided information about the vaccine, the campaign and the dates of vaccination to the community leaders and members.

Community meetings and advocacy visits were made to LGA chairmen and community leaders to introduce the team of volunteers and discuss the strategies of the operation. Regular visits were made to the EOC and state Ministry of Health to receive update on the outbreak and provide information about the RC activities and how it complements the effort of the Government. Operational updates were regularly being shared with the State team to ensure a coordinated response.

An additional 15 volunteers were trained to facilitate and host live radio show, mobile cinema and how to collect feedback using Kobo Collect, including rumours and complaints, from the communities. An assessment was carried out to identify information gap and response needs of the targeted LGAs in Bauchi State, also to find out if there was a change in perception, practice, knowledge beliefs and attitude of the respondents due to the social mobilisation activities, mobile cinema and radio programmes carried out in their respective communities/LGAs. Red Cross volunteers carried out a house to house KAP assessment, targeting the 4 LGAs in Bauchi State. Each volunteer was given a target of 15 HH per day for 5 days. Subsequently, 600 responses were received, 150 per LGA for four LGAs. Key findings from the KAP survey are as follows:
- a total of 319 females and 277 females were interviewed;
- there were more rural settlements in the targeted area than urban;
- the most trusted source of information was the radio, therefore targeted messages should be sent through the radio;
- 96% of the respondents (572 persons) said they had heard about yellow fever (The question was asked to find out if the social mobilisation and radio team properly passed the required information) 4% (24 persons) said they had not heard about yellow fever;
- 62% (368 persons) of the respondents said by taking yellow fever vaccine, yellow fever can be prevented;
- 97% agreed to take yellow fever vaccine;
- 97% (580 persons) of the respondents said they trusted the information they received from the Red Cross;
- the options radio and word of mouth (H2H) were the respondents preferred means to receive health and disaster related information from the Red Cross;
- news, magazine on health, drama and soap opera were the preferred radio programmes by the respondents;
- the preferred timing for programmes chosen by the respondents were 6-9 pm and/or 8-12 noon. Red Cross radio programmes can target these times;
- 83% of the respondents (494 persons) preferred face to face with the Red Cross to raise complaints and questions.

Trained volunteers staged 40 shows at strategic locations in the communities using megaphones to mobilise community members for cinema shows. The one hour radio show titled "Haska Lafiyar ka" in Hausa, which means "light your health" was presented on Bauchi Radio Corporation 990KHz, 846KHz by trained volunteers who developed the scripts for the show and also anchored the sessions, providing information about the RCRC [Red Cross and Red Crescent] Movement, the current outbreak, the activities of the NRCS and also giving time for call in from community members to ask questions and provide feedback.

In appreciation of the work of the Red Cross and to show commitment in fighting the scourge, the Management of Bauchi Radio Corporation gave the NRCS one hour free slot to host a live radio session in Ningi radio station that covers the under-served nomadic settlement in the remote part of the LGA.

In a bid to reach a larger population and expanded coverage, the NRCS supported the translation of radio jingles from Hausa to Jarawa local language and contracted the Bauchi Radio Corporation (BRC) to air jingles in Hausa and Jarawa languages in Bauchi. BRC has the widest coverage with booster stations in all the LGAs in the state with transmission in the local languages. The jingle was aired, 5 times a day in Hausa and Jarawa languages. Also, 50 000 leaflets and 3000 posters with key messages on yellow fever were produced in English and disseminated. Additional 10 000 leaflets were produced in Hausa language for dissemination in Bauchi and Katsina states. NRCS printed and distributed 500 long sleeve T-shirts with an inscription "Yellow fever vaccine saves lives" to promote visibility of the NRCS in the targeted communities.

2. Prevention and active case finding of suspected cases NRCS targeted 4 high risk LGAs in Bauchi (Kirfi, Tafawa Balewa, Bauchi, and Alkaleri) where cases of yellow fever were initially reported. Some 150 volunteers were trained on active case finding, social mobilisation, and preventive messages on yellow fever: 50 in Bauchi, 40 in Alkaleri, 30 in Tafawa Balewa, and 30 in Kirfi. These volunteers conducted door to door case search for case definition of YF. The volunteers also established linkages with the Disease Surveillance Notification Officers (DSNOs) to report all suspected cases and ensure prompt referral to the designated treatment centers or nearest health facilities for treatment. In total, 77 suspected cases were identified by the NRCS volunteers in the 4 LGAs and referred for treatment.

3. Vector control -- destruction of breeding grounds of mosquitoes in Bauchi
Sanitation materials were procured and delivered to Bauchi to support community clean- up campaigns in the targeted LGAs as follows: [A table at the source URL above describes the 7 approaches used]

Volunteers worked with the community leaders to fix dates for the clean-up campaigns while community members were mobilised to clean up their environment and destroy mosquito breeding grounds. In Alkaleri LGA of Bauchi State, the NRCS team paid an advocacy visit to the Local Government Chairman. In appreciation and show of support for the work of the Red Cross, the chairman sent a delegation to all the wards in the LGA to enforce environmental sanitation in all communities and also support the volunteers during the clean-up campaigns. During the operation timeframe, 689 clean up sessions were conducted, and 30 community health committees established to oversee and mobilize community members for the clean-up exercise and also take ownership to ensure continuity.

[In 2019, Nigeria confronted a widespread and serious yellow fever outbreak. The presence of YF virus mosquito vectors and a large proportion of the population unvaccinated provided the potential for a massive, out-of-control outbreak, as occurred in Angola with consequent spillover into the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A prompt and comprehensive response was necessary and that was organized by the Nigerian CDC as described above. The adaptation of the response to local conditions and cultures is noteworthy.

Additional YF cases have been reported this year (2020) and yellow fever preventive mass vaccination (PMVC) campaigns are planned for implementation in Oyo, Delta, Benue, Osun, Bauchi, and Borno States in the 3rd and 4th quarters (see Yellow fever - Africa (05): Nigeria 20200217.6998674).

One of the lessons learned for Nigeria and other YF endemic countries is that maintaining 70-80% of the population vaccinated is better than waiting for an outbreak to occur and then responding. Building YF vaccination into national routine childhood vaccination programs is one effective approach. - Mod.TY
