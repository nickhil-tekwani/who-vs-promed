Colorado: First Confirmed Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection; West Nile
virus-positive Starlings Found on Western Slope
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DENVER: A 42-year-old man from Commerce City in Adams County has tested
positive for West Nile virus. He is recovering. This is the first human case
of West Nile virus to be identified in Colorado from among 151 human
specimens tested at the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment's laboratory in Denver. The test results have been confirmed by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in Fort Collins.
The Adams County man became ill on Tue 3 Sep 2002 after he experienced a
number of mosquito bites while he and friends recently were bird hunting in
northeastern Colorado. He was treated by his private physician and did not
require hospitalization.
The first signs of West Nile virus in animals also have been detected on the
state's Western Slope. In a special test conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the Colorado Department of Public Health
and Environment, common birds, such as sparrows and starlings that were
found dead on the Western Slope, were tested for West Nile virus. Two dead
starlings found in Mesa County tested positive for the disease.
Dr. Ned Calonge, the state's acting chief medical officer who is based at
the Department of Public Health and Environment, said, "Although we had an
excellent chance of getting through this season without a human case, the
case we've seen is not surprising. We have an excellent surveillance system,
and, when you are looking harder for illness, you are more likely to find
it. We are certainly pleased that this man did well, as is true for the vast
majority of people who get infected.
The acting chief medical officer continued, "The positive birds from Mesa
County indicate that the virus has spread across the continental divide.
While the spread to western Colorado and beyond may not be very great this
year, it does indicate that the divide will not represent a barrier for
continuing westward movement and that next year, if not sooner, all of our
state will see West Nile Virus activity.
"However, it is particularly important to continue to put West Nile Virus
infection in perspective. Many more Coloradans are at risk for illness and
death from influenza, which is preventable through immunization, than they
are from this virus. Most people who get West Nile virus won't even become
ill. Most others will experience only slight symptoms. Only a very few will
become seriously ill," Calonge said. Dr. Richard Vogt, director of the
Tri-County Health Department which serves Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas
counties, said, "Though the risk of exposure to West Nile virus is extremely
low and Colorado's mosquito season will end soon, all Colorado residents
should continue to follow some sensible precautions."
West Nile virus was first detected in Colorado in mid-August when 2 horses
and a crow from Weld County and one horse from Pueblo County tested positive
for the disease. Since that time, 164 horses, including 53 in Weld County;
20 in Pueblo County; 21 in Logan County; 14 in Otero County; and 10 in
Larimer County, have tested positive for the virus. Thirty-seven birds also
tested positive, including 10 from Weld County; 6 from Adams County; 5 each
from Arapahoe and Denver counties; and 3 from El Paso. Also testing positive
was one chicken from the 23 sentinel chicken flocks maintained around the
state by the state and local health departments. Eight mosquito pools also
tested positive for the disease.
The Department of Public Health and Environment's laboratory in Denver is
continuing to accept dead birds from the corvid family for testing. If any
such birds, including crows, magpies, ravens and jays, are found within 48
hours of the time of death, they should be kept cool or frozen and then
submitted to local health departments, county public health nursing services
or local animal control agencies across Colorado. Gloves or a shovel should
be used to pick up the dead animal and to place them in a plastic bag. The
birds then will be forwarded to the state health department laboratory.
Pape emphasized that dead birds, such as sparrows, starlings, pigeons,
finches, robins and blackbirds, are not currently being accepted for testing
at the state laboratory although they were tested in the special Western
Slope investigation.
