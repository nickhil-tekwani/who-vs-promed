Hong Kong: chickens killed amid growing bird flu fears
--------------------------------------------------
Health inspectors have destroyed more than 50 chickens at a fresh food shop
here after some of the birds were stricken with avian flu. The birds were
killed after 13 dead chickens were found in the shop on Mon, 30 Dec 2002,
the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said in a statement. The shop
was ordered closed so that it could be disinfected by health workers, it
said.
The latest discovery of the virus came after the government slaughtered more
than 16 000 chickens on a farm on Sat, 28 Dec 2002, after a number of dead
birds were found there. To prevent the spread of the avian flu, the
government also closed Hong Kong's wholesale poultry market for cleansing on
Monday. 2 weeks ago, 20 dead chickens found in Mui Wo market on Lantau
island had the bird flu, sparking fears of another outbreak of the deadly
disease.
The avian virus detected so far is not of the same strain [H5N1] that
crossed over into humans in 1997, killing 6 people and causing the
government to slaughter all 1.4 million chickens in the territory. Many
people in Hong Kong prefer live poultry from wet markets, where chickens are
packed into cages as they wait to be slaughtered on the spot.
