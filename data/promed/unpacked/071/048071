The head of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Public Health confirmed that to date a total of 21 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infections] with 7 deaths from the disease have been registered in the entire province since 1 Jan [2018, to date].

The confirmed cases correspond to localities in Or√°n, Tartagal, Pichanal, Colonia Santa Rosa, Apolinario Saravia and Irigoyen. The patients range from 22-52 years of age.

The authorities of this provincial health agency urge the community to adopt extreme preventive measures in order to halt the disease. The success of any health campaign is based on its continuity and on the awareness of the community.

Cleanup of homes, personal hygiene, and putting in order patios and grounds are essential in order to avoid any type of disease and to drive away insects, rodents and animals in general.

It is recommended that the population keep their houses and empty lands clean with the goal of avoiding the presence of rodents as well as blocking openings in doors, walls and around pipes.

Use of rodent poison and traps is advised, but do not touch or hit them. If one encounters one of these animals dead, soak it in bleach, and, after 30 minutes at a minimum, pick it up using gloves and bury it at least 30 cm [12 inches] deep, or burn it.

In case it is necessary to store firewood, keep it as far away from houses as possible; remove weeds from the grounds, and avoid contact with the secretions of these animals.

Ventilate places that have been closed up for at least 30 minutes before entering, and cover the nose and mouth with a dampened handkerchief.

Clean floors, tables and cupboards with a solution of bleach of 10 parts water to one part bleach [10 percent] and leave it for 30 minutes before rinsing. Dampen floors before sweeping in order not to raise dust.

If camping, do it in an area far from weeds or trash dumps; do not sleep directly on the ground, and consume [only] potable water.

[Salta province has had a considerable number (21) cases of hantavirus infections with 7 deaths so far this year (2018). As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the cases. Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over recent years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina; in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina; in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina; in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case. However, since the report indicates that the cases have occurred in Salta province, including Oran, Oran virus seems likely.

Although rodents were mentioned as possible hosts in the report above, the rodent host of the suspected hantavirus endemic in this area was not reported but likely is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _O. longicaudatus_.

Emergency medical service units transported someone to the hospital this morning [21 May 2018] with a possible case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. Medics were instructed to wear isolation suits when they entered a home on the 500 block of Claride in Flour Bluff [in Corpus Christi city].

According to the CDC website, people become infected through contact with hantavirus-infected rodents or their urine and droppings.

Possible cases of hantavirus [infection] must be reported to the Health Department. Health officials are monitoring this particular case and are awaiting lab results to confirm whether it definitely is [a] hantavirus [infection]. The test results should be available in 5 days.

The hantavirus [infection] can progress to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which can be fatal and can also cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).

The CDC recommends rodent control in and around the home to prevent the spread of the hantavirus infection.

[The suspected hantavirus involved in the report above is not stated, nor are the conditions under which the individual might have been exposed to the virus. If a hantavirus infection is confirmed, Sin Nombre virus could be involved as is the possibility of Seoul hantavirus that occurs in brown rats in some port cities in the USA. Corpus Christi is a port city. Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the western USA, including Texas.

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of Sin Nombre virus and shed it in feces, urine, and saliva. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Seoul virus can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Prompt medical attention is essential.

An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and a brown rat (_Rattus norvegius_) at http://www.conserveireland.com/mammals/brown_rat.php.
