Type 1 wild poliovirus and putative enterovirus 109 in an outbreak of acute
flaccid paralysis in Congo, Oct-Nov 2010
------------------------------------------------------------------
[Grard G, Drexler JF, Lekana-Douki S, Caron M, et al: Type 1 wild
poliovirus and putative enterovirus 109 in an outbreak of acute flaccid
paralysis in Congo, October-November 2010. Euro Surveill. 2010; 15(47):
pii=19723]

An outbreak of flaccid paralysis syndrome in adults is ongoing in Congo.
Molecular analysis of faecal, throat, and cerebrospinal samples identified
wild type 1 poliovirus and an additional enterovirus C strain related to
enterovirus 109 as the cause. As of [22 Nov 2010], the cumulative number of
cases was 409, of which 169 (41.3 per cent) were fatal. This is one of the
largest wild type 1 poliovirus (WPV1) outbreaks ever described associated
with an unusually high case fatality rate.

Background
----------
Following mass vaccination campaigns organised through the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that
poliomyelitis had been eradicated from many regions of the world. However,
although transmission of wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) has been
interrupted, isolated human cases and outbreaks of WPV1 and WPV3 are still
being reported in many countries (1). Epidemiological investigations showed
that all these clinical cases during the last decade were due to
importation of WPV from one of the 4 countries where indigenous WPV
transmission is still ongoing, namely Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and
Pakistan (1).

In the past decade, several outbreaks and isolated clinical cases resulting
from WPV1 and/or WPV3 importation from Nigeria or India were reported in 15
polio-free countries in Africa. 2 small WPV1 outbreaks occurred recently,
in Namibia in 2006 and Angola in 2010, after importation of WPV1 of Indian
origin (2). In order to prevent these episodic cases of imported and
indigenous WPV transmission, polio immunisation campaigns were conducted
that targeted some 72 million children in 15 countries across western and
central Africa.

Outbreak description
--------------------
Congo had recorded its last official case of indigenous polio in 2000 (3).
On 5 Nov 2010 the Ministry of Health of Congo declared an outbreak of
poliovirus centred in the 2nd largest town, Pointe-Noire. The outbreak
presumably started in mid-October 2010, with an unusual accumulation of
cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) syndrome in patients between 15 and
72 years old. Most cases occurred in Pointe-Noire and some in Cabinda
province. Cases exported from Pointe-Noire were then reported in several
towns and villages of Congo. As of [22 Nov 2010] the cumulative number of
cases was 409, of which 169 (41.3 per cent) were fatal. Direct contact
between cases was rare, and there was no apparent spatial pattern.
Likewise, there was no evidence of a common source such as food or water.

In most hospitalised patients the disease started with influenza-like
symptoms 4 to 7 days before the onset of AFP of the legs. AFP then ascended
rapidly (within a day), frequently leading to death from cardiac and/or
respiratory failure. The large number of severe cases and the high case
fatality rate contrast sharply with previous WPV outbreaks and point to a
role of unknown viral/host features or to the existence of massive numbers
of mild and therefore unreported additional cases.

Laboratory investigations
-------------------------
The Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF),
Gabon, received 3 plasma samples for aetiologic investigation on [29 Oct
2010]. Real-time and conventional reverse transcription (RT)-PCR testing
was negative for neurologic, enteric, and respiratory viral pathogens,
namely the genera _Enterovirus_, _Flavivirus_, _Alphavirus_, _Phlebovirus_,
human mastadenoviruses, the family Paramyxoviridae (mumps virus, measles
virus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, respiratory syncytial virus, human
metapneumovirus) and the subfamily _Coronavirinae_ (human coronavirus Nl63,
HKU1, OC43, and 229E.

Also negative were species-specific real-time RT-PCR tests for West Nile
virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus
type 6, herpes simplex virus type 1, varicella zoster virus, rotavirus
serogroup A, norovirus genogroups 1 and 2, sapovirus, astrovirus, influenza
viruses A and B, and rhinovirus.

CIRMF then received 15 rectal swabs, 14 throat swabs, and 5 cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) samples on [2 Nov 2010] of which 13 rectal swab specimens (86.7
per cent), 5 throat specimens (35.7 per cent) and one CSF specimen (20.0
per cent) were positive for enterovirus in a real-time RT-PCR targeting the
5'-noncoding region (4). The faecal and throat samples had threshold cycles
ranging from 24 to 38 in real-time RT-PCR, indicating medium to high virus
concentrations, while the concentration in the positive CSF sample was low
(cycle threshold (CT) 38). The genome was studied by the Institute of
Virology at the University of Bonn Medical Centre in Germany, based on
partial VP1 sequencing (5), 3D sequencing (unpublished in-house assay) and
5'-UTR sequencing (6).

Poliovirus type 1 was identified in one sample (100 per cent amino acid
identity to recent poliovirus strains of Indian genotype in 'typing' VP1
PCR). The amplified 327 nt sequence of this sample (corresponding to genome
positions 2631 to 2957 in WPV1 strain Brunhilde) shared 94.8-96.3 per cent
identity with poliovirus type 1 sampled in Africa (Angola and Democratic
Republic of the Congo) in 2006 and 2007 (isolates ANG-LUA-KIL-07-003 and
RDC-BCG-SEK-06-004) and 95.1 per cent identity with a strain recovered
during a polio outbreak in Tajikistan in 2010 (GenBank accession number
HQ317702).

A more sensitive strain-specific nested PCR assay amplifying a 201 bp VP1
fragment was developed from the initial sequencing data, and all but 2 of
the 19 samples positive in the enterovirus real-time RT-PCR were typed as
wild type 1 polio virus. Partial sequences of the 3D genomic region
encoding the viral polymerase (181 nt corresponding to genome positions
6869-7049 in WPV1 strain Brunhilde) were retrieved from 5 samples. The
maximum nucleotide identity of all these samples was 96.1 per cent with 2
poliovirus type 1 strains recovered in Russia and the Philippines after the
year 2000 (isolates P1W/Bar65, and Mindanao-01-1, respectively).

Partial 5'-UTR sequencing yielded positive results for all the specimens
tested. The 115 nt thus obtained (corresponding to genome positions 466 to
580 in WPV1 strain Brunhilde) were 96.5 per cent identical to recent WPV1
strains from China (isolate CHN-Hainan/93-2). Therefore, all analysed
genomic regions were identified as WPV1, indicating absence of putative
intra- or interspecies recombination.

An additional enterovirus C strain distantly related to enterovirus 109
(EV109) in the VP1 region was retrieved from a rectal swab of a deceased
patient. In the 322 nt VP1 sequence fragment that could be retrieved, the
virus showed 75 to 77 per cent nt sequence identity with the 5 EV109
sequences available in GenBank, and 90.5 per cent nt identity in the 3D
genome region with EV109 isolate NICA08-4327 recovered in Nicaragua in 2010
(7).

Of note, the corresponding sample contained one of the highest enterovirus
RNA copy numbers (CT value 24). Polio virus was not detected in this sample
with the broad-range typing assays described above, nor with
strain-specific VP1 nested and 3D real-time PCR assays. No other sample was
positive for the EV109-related virus in a strain-specific 3D real-time PCR
assay.

The presence of other enteric viruses (adenovirus, astrovirus, enterovirus,
rotavirus A, sapovirus, and norovirus genogroups 1 and 2) was ruled out in
all the faecal samples except for one WPV-positive sample which also
contained norovirus RNA. Genome sequencing and further typing of samples
containing poliovirus and enterovirus, targeting the complete VP1 genomic
region, are ongoing. Additional samples have been sent to CIRMF for analysis.

Conclusions
-----------
The preliminary sequencing data and clinical picture are compatible with a
wild type poliovirus outbreak. Further epidemiological and serological
studies are required to explain the unusually high case fatality rate and
the patients' relatively advanced age. One possible explanation is that
only severe cases may be reported. Alternatively, the population may be
immunologically naive and highly susceptible, although this is unlikely
given the claimed success of vaccination campaigns. Epidemiological
investigations have just begun. At this time, no direct contact between
cases has been observed, and no apparent spatial pattern was identified,
with neither domestic dissemination nor within the same subdivisions.

Together, these observations suggest a diffuse source of contamination,
such as, from water drawn from wells in the poor neighbourhoods of the
city. Involvement of a more virulent virus, or potentially other viruses,
is another possibility. More information on non-hospitalised patients and
mild cases is needed. Information on predisposing conditions of the fatal
cases as well as full-length sequencing of VP1 and the full genome are
currently ongoing.

The WHO Country Office, Regional Office, and Headquarters are supporting
the Ministry of Health in Pointe-Noire, and the WHO Country Office is
supporting the operational costs of the investigation and response teams.
At least 1.1 million people are to be vaccinated in the epicentre of the
outbreak (Pointe-Noire region), and further 600 000 people will be
vaccinated simultaneously in the neighbouring regions of Congo near Angola,
where the last cases of WPV1 occurred in 2010.

[The authors of this Rapid Communication report the detection of 2 viruses
in some clinical samples obtained from patients during an ongoing outbreak
of flaccid paralysis in the Republic of Congo. This outbreak has been
characterised by a higher than usual case fatality ratio for outbreaks of
poliomyelitis. Curiously, any direct contact between cases was rare and
there is no evidence of a common source of infection. Molecular analyses
identified the presence of 2 enteroviruses -- wild poliovirus type 1, and a
2nd enterovirus identified as human enterovirus 109. The wild poliovirus
type 1 exhibited 100 per cent amino acid identity with the wild poliovirus
type 1 currently prevalent in India.

The human enterovirus 109 isolate is closely related to the novel
recombinant enterovirus previously associated with a case of acute
pediatric respiratory illness in Nicaragua. Similar molecular analyses
(real-time and conventional reverse transcription (RT)-PCR testing) were
negative for an impressively wide range of potential human neurologic,
enteric and respiratory viral pathogens. However, so far the analysis of
the outbreak lacks any element of quantitation that would allow assessment
of the relative roles of these 2 viruses in the causation of flaccid
paralysis. It is unclear whether enterovirus 109 alone or in combination
with wild poliovirus type 1 is a determining factor responsible for the
high case fatality ratio observed in this outbreak. This question must
await further analysis. - Mod.CP

from a review of polio in Sweden 1925-1944 demonstrating an increasing case
fatality rate (CFR) by increasing age, going from 4.5 per cent in the
population under 3 years of age to 23.5 per cent for those over 25 years of
age. This same increase in CFR with increased age has been observed by
other descriptive epidemiologic presentations in earlier years. Nielsena
NM, Aabya P, Wohlfahrta J, et al. The polio model. Does it apply to polio?
Int J Epidemiol. 2002; 31(1): 181-6. (available at
<http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/1/181.long>, mentions that
Weinstein L (Influence of age and sex on susceptibility and clinical
manifestations in poliomyelitis. N Engl J Med. 1957; 257:47-52),
demonstrates that there is an increase in respiratory paralysis with
increasing age, which by the nature of the involvement is more serious and
results in a higher CFR. Hence, the observation that the majority of the
reported cases have been in older age groups might well support the
observation of a higher CFR in the outbreak in the Congo than usually seen
in recent outbreaks of polio elsewhere in Africa and Asia, that have
predominantly involved unvaccinated younger age groups.

That being said, the reported CFR of 41.3 per cent in this current outbreak
in the Congo is much higher than usually reported and one can't help but
wonder if there isn't significant under reporting of milder cases to
explain this observation. One also questions whether there might not have
been a problem with vaccine potency in earlier years, leading to a larger
than expected susceptible population presently at older ages, having been
vaccinated in earlier years with non-potent vaccine, hence further
explaining the unusual epidemiology of this outbreak.

We await further information as results of active case finding and
additional laboratory studies become available.

Date: 13 Nov 2010

The risk of further international spread of the ongoing polio outbreak in
Central Asia and the North Caucasus Federal Region in Russia continues to
be high.

In Central Asia, genetic sequencing of the poliovirus isolated from a child
paralyzed in Kazakhstan on [12 Aug 2010] has confirmed ongoing circulation
of the virus which caused the Tajikistan outbreak and subsequently spread
to the Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and possibly Uzbekistan. In the
Russian Federation, the detection of an additional case of polio with onset
on [25 Sep 2010] in the Republic of Dagestan confirms ongoing poliovirus
transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region.

In Tajikistan, the epicenter of the Central Asian outbreak (458 WPV1 cases,
at [3 Nov 2010]), no new polio cases have been reported since [4 Jul 2010]
following 5 mass immunization campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV),
with a 6th and final round planned for [8-12 Nov 2010]. In Turkmenistan (3
WPV1 cases), no new cases have been reported since [28 Jun 2010], and 4
mass OPV immunization campaigns have been completed. In Kazakhstan, the 7
year old boy from Saryagach in the Southern Kazakhstan Oblast (SKO) who was
paralyzed on [12 Aug 2010], represents the only case in the country; a 2nd
large scale OPV mop-up round is being conducted in the 1st week of November
[2010].

The Russian Federation's 14th case, the child paralyzed on [25 Sep 2010],
brings the total number of cases in the North Caucasus Federal Region to 6,
3 each from Dagestan and Chechnya. Genetic sequencing of this virus is
consistent with ongoing transmission in the North Caucasus Federal Region
since the detection of the index cases on [15 Jul 2010] in Dagestan and [4
Aug 2010] in Chechnya following 2 separate importations from Tajikistan.

The other 8 cases in Russia represent sporadic importations associated with
individual cases, the last of which occurred on [2 Jul 2010]; none of these
cases has been associated with ongoing circulation following local catch-up
immunization activities with OPV. In response to the continued transmission
in the North Caucasus Federal Region, the Russian Federation initiated a
1st round of mass OPV immunization in the area on [1 Nov 2010] with a 2nd
round planned for late November [2010]; both rounds will target all
children aged 6 months to 15 years.

Although Uzbekistan has not confirmed a polio case during the current
outbreak in Central Asia, it is not possible to rule out ongoing,
undetected transmission in the country because stool samples from acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases are not currently being tested in a
WHO-accredited laboratory; the bordering areas of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan
and Tajikistan have all reported cases; and, at least one Uzbek national
became paralyzed shortly after arrival in Russia which, given the
incubation period for paralytic poliomyelitis, suggests infection may have
occurred prior to leaving Uzbekistan. Recognizing the risk of a poliovirus
importation and outbreak, Uzbekistan has conducted 4 nationwide OPV
campaigns, the last one from [25-31 Oct 2010].

Countries at risk of poliovirus importation from Central Asia or the North
Caucasus Federal Region of the Russian Federation should continue to
strengthen surveillance for AFP cases, ensure processing of all specimens
at a WHO-accredited poliovirus laboratory, maintain high routine
immunization coverage against polio, and conduct supplementary OPV
immunization activities as needed to close gaps in population immunity.

As per recommendations in the WHO's International Travel and Health
guidelines, travelers to and from polio-affected countries should be fully
protected by vaccination. Travelers who have in the past received 3 or more
doses of OPV should be offered another dose of polio vaccine before
departure. Any unimmunized individuals intending to travel to a
polio-infected area should have a complete course of polio vaccination.
Travelers from polio-affected areas should have a full course of
vaccination against polio before leaving, with a minimum one dose of OPV
before departure.

WHO's European Regional Office has alerted all Member States to the public
health risk posed by the ongoing polio outbreak in Central Asia and the
North Caucasus Federal Region of the Russian Federation, as required under
the International Health Regulations.

WHO continues to update the European Member States and partners through
letters to Ministers, Chief Medical Officers and partners; postings on its
European Region website

[ProMED-mail regrets the delay in posting this update. The information
available as presented above suggests that there may well be continued
circulation of the WPV in areas within Central Asia and the North Caucasus
Federal Region of the Russian Federation and perhaps in Uzbekistan that may
well be "below the radarscope" of present surveillance activities, and
while there have not been confirmed cases with dates of onset after 25 Sep
2010 (see table below in part [3], it is too early to conclude that
transmission has been interrupted.

[The above table is a summary of the information available on the polio
eradication website -- for more detailed information giving the breakdown
of cases of WPV1 vs WPV3, go to the above Source URL. Of note, the above
table does not have information on the cases currently reported from the
Republic of Congo ongoing outbreak of polio (see section [1] for update.
Hence, when more laboratory information becomes available, the number of
confirmed WPV associated polio cases will most likely increase
significantly due to this outbreak.

Interestingly, a recent South African newswire reported that as of 23 Nov
2010, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has identified a total of
63 cases of paralytic polio attributable to infection with WPV1, almost
twice the number of cases reported in the above given cumulative case count
from the polio eradication website. (see
