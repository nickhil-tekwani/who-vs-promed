Three of Syncrude's famous Beaver Creek Wood Bison have been found dead, according to the company, and one is confirmed to have been infected with anthrax.

Syncrude said on Friday [21 Aug 2015] that it had found 3 dead bison within in the past 2 weeks near the ranch, which is located within Syncrude's Mildred Lake site. The most recent was found on Thursday, and tests completed Friday afternoon confirmed that it had contracted the bacteria. Spokesperson Leithan Slade says the company has since taken several steps, including isolating the remaining animals from the carcasses of the dead bison, restricting access to the ranch, and closing the public viewpoint located on Highway 63. "We're taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our workers that care for the animals, and the animals themselves," Slade said.

Only one of the dead animals is confirmed to have been carrying the anthrax bacteria, as tests are still outstanding on the other 2. Slade says his company is still reviewing its next steps and will consider whether it can test the live animals for the bacteria.

For more than 20 years, the Beaver Creek Wood Bison herd -- now numbering approximately 300 -- have roamed across the Beaver Creek Wood Bison Ranch, spanning 500 hectares of reclaimed land north of Fort McMurray.

The ranch sits on top of a former open pit mine, and Syncrude has used it as an example that their reclamation efforts can support plants and animals native to Wood Buffalo. The project has been an enormous public relations victory for Syncrude. "Syncrude has always taken great pride in the health of our bison herd. It has become quite a success symbol for the company," Slade said. "At this point, it's kind of still too early to say whether (the deaths) will have an impact on the future of the herd."

In addition to the animal found on Thursday [20 Aug 2015], Slade says that one was found dead on Wednesday, and the other was found dead the week prior.

This is not the 1st case of anthrax killing a bison in Wood Buffalo this summer; in July 2015, 52 bison were killed from anthrax exposure in Wood Buffalo National Park. However, this is the 1st anthrax-related death of an animal in captivity the region has seen this summer [2015]. Slade says it's the 1st time the company has had a positive test for anthrax in any of its bison. He added the company doesn't yet know how the animals contracted the bacteria.

Anthrax can survive as a spore for decades underneath soil. Combined changes in soil moisture, from flooding and drying, can lead to a spore build-up on pastures. It is believed that after hot and dry periods, heavy rain can carry the spores into low areas that have bodies of water. The anthrax would then concentrate in the water, a fatal scenario for thirsty animals frequenting the area.

The body of a bull found Thursday [20 Aug 2015] was determined to have been infected with anthrax, Syncrude said in an email Friday. Two other bison were found dead earlier in the week. Test results are still pending in those cases. The Syncrude herd has not had a case of anthrax in the past, Slade said.

The carcasses were discovered in the main pasture of Syncrude's Beaver Creek Wood Bison Ranch, east of the North Mine. The area is not accessible to the public.

The ranch has been closed and so has a public viewpoint off Highway 63 where some bison from the 300-animal herd are kept during summer months. Other bison have been separated from the carcasses. A plan is being finalized for safe disposal of the dead bison.

In 1993, Syncrude and the Fort McKay First Nation relocated a small herd of wood bison from Elk Island National Park to a reclaimed area at Syncrude's Mildred Lake Mine site. The idea was to test the land's capability to support large mammals. Syncrude still manages the herd with the Fort McKay First Nation.

[Back in 1993, it was believed that the success of the project would help rebuild the shattered population of the wood bison, an animal with significant cultural importance to the local Metis and First Nations communities. It would also prove that the reclaimed land was sustainable, capable of supporting the same plants and animals that existed long before anyone began extracting Alberta's black gold to oil thirsty markets. Success meant a massive public relations victory for Syncrude.

Although he was already working as a mine maintenance manager for Syncrude, it was Jack Peden's job to use his knowledge as a cattle rancher to build a herd. The criteria were relatively simple, he says. The herd had to come from animals that were physically healthy, capable of breeding and purebred. A total of 6 mature cows, 15 male calves, and 9 female calves arrived at Syncrude on 16 Feb 1993, relocated from Elk Island National Park near Edmonton. "Once they got off that truck, they ran to the edges of the land and looked for a way out. They didn't know where they were," said Peden. "It took awhile for them to get used to the new land, and it was very challenging. Bison are different than other cattle species. They're a wild animal. These guys are big, very strong, and not easy to handle. You gotta use a lot of caution when handling them."

Today, the health of the animals is the responsibility of Fort McKay Environment LP. The bison are so healthy that the Calgary Zoo is interested in storing their genetic material, since Syncrude keeps detailed records of pedigree (extracted from: http://www.fortmcmurraytoday.com/2013/07/08/syncrude-celebrates-bison-ranch-anniversary).

This Beaver Creek Wood Bison Ranch is north of Fort McMurray and some distance from all other anthrax outbreaks this year (2015) in Alberta and the Northwest Territories; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McMurray, which has a map showing Ft. McMurray in northwest Alberta. The origin of this outbreak has yet to be revealed. A key point will be the genetics of this recent outbreak, as the bison in the Wood Bison National Park and surrounding areas have their own specific strain, very different from that found in Albertan cattle. Off the cuff, the 1st thought is that there have been unappreciated wildlife anthrax outbreaks in northern Alberta this summer (2015) and maybe in previous years. And once it hit this small bison herd, it was obvious. We must await the knowledgeable opinions of the anthrax experts in AB & NT. - Mod.MHJ
