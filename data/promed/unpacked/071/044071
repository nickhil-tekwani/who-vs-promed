1000 kids hospitalized for flu
-------------------------------
Cambodia's hospitals have been swamped by about 1000 young children
suffering acute respiratory infections this month, a senior health
official said on Wednesday [29 Jun 2005].

At least 60 infants aged 2 months to 5 years have been admitted
daily, but no fatalities have been reported, health ministry
secretary of state Heng Tay Kry told AFP. "About 1000 infant patients
have been hospitalized in 4 big hospitals in recent days with acute
respiratory infections," he said, adding that the children were
suffering from a human form of influenza. "It has been an
unprecedented and strange year (for infections), but it is not
critical like bird flu. No one has died yet," he said.

The deadly avian influenza, or H5N1, has been responsible for 4
Cambodian deaths and dozens more in neighboring Viet Nam and Thailand.

Heng Tay Kry said the infants were admitted with coughs, high
temperatures and breathing difficulties, requiring oxygen to be
administered.

Phnom Penh's 200-bed Kuntha Bopha hospital, a privately-run facility
where treatment is given to patients for free, has received more than
500 patients. Many others were admitted to clinics in the capital,
and more than 100 had been admitted in Siem Reap, gateway to the
Angkor temple complex, he added.

[While the above newswire suggests that human influenza virus may be
responsible for this outbreak, the absence of specific laboratory
information on the typing of the influenza virus combined with the
age distribution of cases (less than 5 years of age) lead one to add
that several other pathogens come to mind, including parainfluenza
virus, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus. (See
the GIDEON free trial <http://www.gideononline.com/promed> for
additional differential diagnoses as well as background information
on these pathogens). Influenza virus infection is always a
possibility, especially influenza B virus, which has been circulating
in the general region this year [2005]. (see prior ProMED-mail
postings listed below).

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
