Swine Virus Under Control
-------------------------
Acting Director of Veterinary Services in the Ministry of Agriculture,
Water and Rural Development, Dr Otto Hubschle, has urged the public to
continue to buy pork from any butcheries and the market place without fear
as the outbreak of the African swine fever (ASF) virus is totally under
control.
Hubschle confirmed to New Era that the 245 animals that were infected with
the virus towards the end of last year [2004] were slaughtered and the
carcasses burnt to ashes. At no time was there a chance for the meat to
penetrate the market. The virus is also known to be harmless to human
beings, he explained.
"One butchery owner contacted me and indicated that people stopped buying
pork because they were scared of getting the virus."
The 1st outbreak was on 10 Dec 2004 when 185 animals were infected. The 2nd
hit was on the 20th of the same month and 60 pigs suffered from the virus,
bringing the total number to 245 cases. These cases were reported at 2
farms in the Otjozondjupa district. The animals were destroyed and farms
were placed under quarantine for 4 weeks.
This was done based on the regulation that once animals are identified and
laboratory tests confirms that they are carrying the virus, the animals
should be destroyed. Unfortunately, the Namibian government does not
compensate pig farmers.
Evenly, it is not encouraged for farmers to keep pigs especially in the
central areas of the country, namely, Khomas, Otjozondjupa, Omaheke and
parts of the Erongo Region, due to the abundance of wild pigs.
The last time Namibia was hit by this disease was in November 2001.
Hubschle explained that ASF is commonly found in Africa due to warthogs
that happen to be carriers and transmitters of the virus.
Equally, piglets are known to carry the virus in their blood. Considering
that ticks feed on animal blood, the virus is easily spread by warthogs
that come into contact with commercial pigs.
Due to that, it is prescribed that pig farms have double fences to prevent
warthogs mixing with pigs but according to Hubschle, ticks still remain the
main culprits as they move from one place to the other.
The virus is dangerous to animals as it causes severe internal and external
bleeding. This leads to death in a short period of time.
Diagnosis of the virus is underway and further tests would be done at
Onderstepoort Research Institute in Pretoria, South Africa.

[Generally, the said information falls in line with Namibia's official
follow-up report, received at OIE's headquarters in Paris on 6 Jan 2005.
However, according to this notification, diagnosis of the 2nd outbreak has
been accomplished. Preliminary diagnosis was carried out by the Central
Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), Windhoek (clinical and post-mortem
examination, histopathology), confirmed by the Exotic Diseases Division at
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI), South Africa (OIE Reference
Laboratory for African swine fever), by virus isolation (positive) and PCR
(positive). ELISA was negative. See
