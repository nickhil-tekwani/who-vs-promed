[Chemung County health officials report a 10th case of Legionnaires'
disease among senior citizens who live in Elmira's Flannery Towers
housing complex. Health officials say all 10 people, including one
who died, acquired the disease before protective measures went into
place at the towers. - Mod.ML]

People of any age can get the bacterial infection, but most often it
affects older people, which is why James Mirando from the Elmira
Housing Authority said they suspended the use of hot water in the
senior housing complex. [Tests revealed _Legionella_ bacteria
(_Legionella pneumophila_) in the hot water system there. Health
officials have been advising residents to take sponge baths instead
of showers to avoid breathing in water vapor. Residents have been
provided with bottled water since Tuesday. Workers were continuing to
flush the water tanks at the complex
(<http://wstm.com/news/news_story.aspx?id=176066>).
- Mod.ML]

"The guidelines from the county and the state were to superheat the
water. The return water has to be 140 F. By the direction, this
should kill the bacteria," Mirando said.

Housing Authority officials also say they've taken the county's
recommendation to hire a consultant, at a hefty price, but they say
they'll do whatever it takes to resolve the problem. "Money is not an
object to us; we have to get this matter solved, "said Mirando.

[This news report adds 7 more cases of _Legionella_ pneumonia,
including one death, in elderly people living in an Elmira, NY
housing complex to the 3 previously reported (ProMED Legionellosis -
USA: (NY) 20080814.2515). For a discussion of legionellosis, please
see this prior ProMED posting.

Apparently, the building's hot water system has been incriminated.
Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot water
system is difficult. The following has been extracted from
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>:

"Success in eliminating legionella from hot water systems depends on
the design and condition of the system, as well as the remediation
methodology used. If a system is old, cleaning and descaling may be
an important component of a legionella control program. As legionella
is killed by temperatures over 55 degrees C (131 degrees F),
superheating of water (raising of water temperature above the normal
set point for the system) within a system may be efficacious. CDC
recommendations call for flushing of the hot water system for a
minimum of 5 minutes with the hot water superheated to at least 65
degrees C (149 degrees F). However, investigators at Pittsburgh
recommend that water outlets be flushed for at least 30 minutes to
allow sufficient time to penetrate water system biofilms.. While
superheating may result in a reduction in system colonization,
legionella is usually not eradicated and often recolonizes the system
within a matter of weeks, necessitating recurrent superheating
cycles. As an alternative to superheating, CDC recommends "shock"
hyperchlorination (>10 mg/liter of chlorine in water, flush all
outlets for at least 5 minutes). Again, this method may only suppress
legionella, permitting subsequent recolonization. Continuous
hyperchlorination has been attempted by several institutions, but has
generally been discontinued because of its corrosive effect on
plumbing. Success with long-term disinfection has been obtained with
continuous copper-silver ionization techniques

Elmira is the county seat of Chemung County, which is located north
of the Pennsylvania state line in the southern tier of New York
State. A map of Chemung County can be found at
