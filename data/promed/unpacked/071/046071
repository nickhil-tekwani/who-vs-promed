Pakistani polio cases reach 163
-------------------------------
Dr Altaf Bosan, head of Pakistan's polio programme said 2 more
children, one each from Khyber and Bajaur agencies, tested positive
for polio [6 Dec 2011], bringing the total number of infected children
to 163.

Of the 49 cases in FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas], 18 have
been in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with other cases in North and South
Waziristan, Frontier Region Lakki Marwat, and the Mohmand, Bajur,
Orakzai, and Kurram agencies.

"Half of these children weren't immunised due to the Taliban's
opposition to oral polio vaccine," Bosan said. The Taliban have said
polio vaccines are a Western plot.

[While the total number of cases reported in this newswire is
incorrect (according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative data,
as of 7 Dec 2011 there have been a total of 167 cases reported in
Pakistan -- see [2] below for more information), the reason this
newswire was selected for this report was the last paragraph
mentioning the ongoing rumors that appear to be impeding vaccination
activities. This situation is very reminiscent of the situation in
Northern Nigeria in 2003/2004, where similar negative rumors led to a
disruption in effective vaccination activities which in turn led to an
increase in cases occurring in Northern Nigeria, which then led to
multiple country importations and re-infection of more than 15
countries that had interrupted wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission for
at least 2 years. To date in 2011, there has been an outbreak of WPV
in Western China (see prior ProMED-mail postings below) with 18 cases
attributable to a WPV1 genetically similar to those currently
circulating in Pakistan. Given the ongoing situation in Africa (see
sections [2] and [3] below, the situation in Pakistan mentioned above
(the increase in cases combined with the decreased vaccination
acceptance due to rumors) does not bode well for the region as the
chance of additional importations to other countries is ever present.

Case count as of 7 Dec 2011:
Total cases: Year-to-date 2011 / Year-to-date 2010 / Total in 2010
Globally: 560 / 841 / 1352
- endemic countries: 272 / 201 / 232
- non-endemic countries: 288 / 640 / 1120

Afghanistan (1 new case)
One case was reported in the past week -- wild poliovirus type 1
(WPV1) from Nahri Sarraj district in Hilmand province -- bringing the
total number of cases for 2011 to 59. The most recent case had onset
of paralysis on [15 Nov 2011] (WPV1 from Kandahar).

There has been a significant increase in insecurity recently in the
southern endemic region, and in other parts of the country, with
multiple, parallel incidents reported.

India (0 new cases)
It has been 328 days since the onset of paralysis of India's 1st and
only case of WPV for the year [2011]. The case occurred in West Bengal
on [13 Jan 2011].

While great progress has been seen in the country, the Indian Ministry
of Health remains cautious. In order for WHO's South East Asia Region
to be certified as being 'polio-free', India will have to not report a
case and maintain adequate surveillance for a period of 3 years.
Dropping the guard now is not an option.

Nigeria (0 new cases -- Cameroon case reclassified as Nigerian)
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cases
for 2011 remains 45. The most recent case in the country had onset of
paralysis on [29 Oct 2011] in Jigawa.

A case of WPV3 originally reported in Cameroon with onset of paralysis
on [6 Oct 2011] will be reassigned to Borno, Nigeria. Following a
joint country investigation, it was found that the case was a Nigerian
child who had crossed the border into Cameroon for treatment. The
virus is considered to be an 'orphan', as there is a significant
genetic difference between this new case and virus of the same genetic
cluster last seen in Nigeria in December 2010 in the Federal Capital
Territory. This indicates that the virus has been circulating
undetected for a substantial period of time, most possibly in
north-eastern Nigeria.

Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) data from high risk local
government areas (LGAs) in Borno, Sokoto, and Kano indicates that
improvement in coverage is being made in these states compared to
earlier LQAS surveys. Kano state showed particularly strong results.
However, Wammako LGA in Sokoto state continues to be rejected at less
than 50 per cent coverage despite ongoing transmission in this LGA
since April [2011].

Rapid Surveillance Assessments are being conducted this week (5-9 Dec
2011) in 3 southern states that had previously reported suboptimal
surveillance indicators -- Osun, Edo, and Anambra. Further assessments
are planned for Kaduna, Taraba, Bauchi, and possibly other priority
areas in January 2012.

Pakistan (6 new cases)
6 new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s), bringing the
total number of cases for 2011 to 167. The most recent cases were both
reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on [17 Nov 2011] -- one in Tank
district and one in Kohat. The case reported in Tank is the district's
1st case for the year [2011]. Similarly, a case reported in Bahawalpur
district in Punjab province is that district's 1st case for the year
[2011].

Angola (0 new cases)
No new cases were reported in the past week. It has been 5 months
since Angola's most recent case -- a WPV1 with onset of paralysis on
[7 Jul 2011] in Uige in the country's north. The country has reported
a total of 5 cases in 2011.

The country's most recent case is in a province close to the border
with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Genetic sequencing found
the virus to be most closely related to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo's Bandundu/Bas Congo transmission chain rather than to Angola's
re-established WPV1 -- it therefore represents a new
importation-related outbreak. The case was picked up during an active
case search in Angola. Another case, officially reported in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo with onset of paralysis on [28 Jul
2011], was found to be an Angolan child from a nearby village who had
sought treatment across the border in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. It is therefore possible that this case will be reassigned to
Angola.

Chad and Central African Republic (CAR) (0 new cases)
No new cases were reported in Chad this week. The total number of
cases reported in Chad in 2011 is 125 (122 WPV1s and 3 WPV3s). The
most recent case had onset of paralysis on [26 Oct 2011] (WPV1 from
Logone Oriental).

LQAS identified a number of under-performing districts (Kelo,
Am-Timan, N'Djamena Sud, N'Djamena Nord, Guereda, and Goz Beida),
showing significant discrepancies from independent monitoring data. 7
districts were verified through LQAS as having greater than 90 per
cent coverage.

No new cases were reported from the CAR in the past week. The total
number of cases for 2011 remains 2 (both WPV1s), the most recent of
which had onset of paralysis on [6 Oct 2011] in Region Sanitaire 3
(RS3), in the country's north.

Cameroon (1 new case)
A case of WPV3 reported just inside Cameroon's border will be
reassigned to Nigeria as it was found to have been a Nigerian child
who contracted the virus in Nigeria (in Borno state).

China (0 new cases)
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cases
for 2011 is 18 (all WPV1) and the most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [18 Sep 2011] (from Kashgar, in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous
region).

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (0 new cases)
No new cases were reported in the past week, therefore the total
number of cases for 2011 remains 87 (all WPV1s). The most recent case
had onset of paralysis on [29 Sep 2011] in the outbreak district of
Popokabaka in Bandundu in the country's west.

Horn of Africa (0 new cases)
There were no cases reported in the Horn of Africa this week. A case
of WPV1 with onset of paralysis on [30 Jul 2011] in Nyanza province,
western Kenya, is the only case to be reported in the Horn of Africa
this year [2011]. While there has only been a single case reported
this year, the fact that transmission has been continually missed
somewhere in Kenya and/or Uganda over the last few years means that
the Horn of Africa will continue to be an area of concern.

West Africa (0 new cases -- 1 new case pending Niger)
No cases were officially reported in west Africa in the past week,
however the GPEI has been given 'advance notice' of a case of WPV3 in
Niger. The total number of cases for 2011 in the west African region
remains 48 (36 from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Guinea, 7 from Mali, and 2
from Niger). All cases are WPV3, except for one WPV1 case from Niger.
Mali, Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea have not reported any cases in more
than 4 months. The most recent officially reported case in west Africa
had onset of paralysis on [3 Aug 2011] in Guinea.

Diffa, the province in which Niger's advance notice case has been
reported, was covered 6 times this year [2011] with type 3 containing
vaccine, yet almost 30 per cent of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis
cases reported in the province in 2011 were reported to have received
zero doses of vaccine. The area is relatively remote (and on the
opposite side of the country from the nation's capital) with low
population density, once again highlighting that every child, even
those in the farthest villages, must be reached with polio vaccine.
There has been a history of cases spreading from Nigeria across the
border to Niger, with several instances over the last 3 years. Niger
meets the acceptable standard for surveillance at the national level
but there are problems with surveillance at the sub-national level,
including in Diffa. One consultant has already agreed to be deployed
to Niger and the search is now on for a 2nd consultant to be sent to
the area to assist in the outbreak response. A STOP-team member
already present in the country will be re-tasked to the infected
area.

[In the past week (1-7 Dec 2011], new cases have been officially
confirmed in 2 countries: Afghanistan (1) and Pakistan (6). In
addition there was an "unofficial" report from Niger (1 case pending).
There was also a re-classification of a case from Cameroon to Nigeria,
as the location of the WPV transmission was found to be in Nigeria,
with medical care/treatment (and confirmation) sought in Cameroon.

Case count as of 30 Nov 2011:
Total cases: Year-to-date 2011 / Year-to-date 2010 / Total in 2010
Globally: 553 / 821 / 1352
- endemic countries: 265 / 196 / 232
- non-endemic countries: 288 / 625 / 1120

Afghanistan (3 new cases)
3 new cases were reported in the past week (wild poliovirus type 1 --
WPV1; from Kapisa and Kandahar), bringing the total number of cases
for 2011 to 58. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [15 Nov
2011] (WPV1 from Kandahar).

India (0 new cases)
India has not reported WPV in more than 10 months. The country's only
case for the year was reported in West Bengal on [13 Jan 2011].

Keeping up immunity and sensitive surveillance in India will be the
top priority in the coming months.

Surveillance reviews continue to be conducted in high-risk areas, to
further sensitize surveillance activities.

The field work for the mucosal immunity study in Moradabad, western
Uttar Pradesh, has now been completed. The trial began on 11 Oct 2011,
with the enrolment of 989 study infants over the course of just 6
days. The trial aims to evaluate the potential role of inactivated
polio vaccine (IPV), in combination with OPV [oral polio vaccine], in
helping close residual immunity gaps in key reservoir areas.

Nigeria (1 new case)
One new case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from Jigawa),
bringing the total number of cases for 2011 to 45. It is the most
recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on [29 Oct
2011].

Pakistan (7 new cases)
7 new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s, from
Balochistan, KP, FATA, and Sindh), bringing the total number of cases
for 2011 to 161. The most recent cases had onset of paralysis on [11
Nov 2011] (WPV1s from KP and FATA).

In addition, 6 positive environmental samples were reported,
underscoring that virus transmission is continuing across the
country.

Angola (0 new cases)
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cases
for 2011 remains 5. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [7
Jul 2011] (WPV1 from Uige).

Chad and CAR (6 new cases in Chad, 0 new cases in CAR)
In Chad, 6 new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s),
bringing the total number of cases for 2011 to 125 (122 WPV1s and 3
WPV3s). The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [26 Oct 2011]
(WPV1 from Logone Oriental). 5 of the new cases are reported from
Logone Oriental. In total, nearly half of the country's cases are from
this province (55 of 125).

No new cases were reported from the Central African Republic (CAR) in
the past week. The total number of cases for 2011 remains 2 (both
WPV1s), the most recent of which had onset of paralysis on [6 Oct
2011] in Region Sanitaire 3 (RS3), in the country's north.

A case of WPV3 reported just inside Cameroon's border has been found
to have been a Nigerian child who contracted the virus in Nigeria,
just across the border in Borno state. As such, it looks highly likely
that the case will be reassigned to Nigeria.

China (0 new cases)
No new cases were reported in the past week -- the total number of
cases for 2011 remains 18 (all WPV1). The most recent case had onset
of paralysis on [18 Sep 2011] (from Kashgar, in Xinjiang Uygur
autonomous region).

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (0 new cases)
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cases
for 2011 remains 87 (all WPV1s). The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [29 Sep 2011] (from the outbreak district of Popokabaka
in Bandundu).

Horn of Africa (0 new cases)
There were no cases reported in the Horn of Africa this week. There
has only been one case reported in the Horn of Africa this year [2011]
-- a WPV1 with onset of paralysis on [30 Jul 2011] in Nyanza Province,
on Lake Victoria in western Kenya.

West Africa (0 new cases)
No cases were reported in west Africa in the past week. The total
number of cases for 2011 in the west African region remains 48 (36
from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Guinea, 7 from Mali, and 2 from Niger). All
cases are WPV3, except for one WPV1 case from Niger.

West Africa continues to be the global epicentre for WPV3
transmission, a strain on the verge of elimination. 5 different WPV3
transmission chains are affecting the region, with 3 of these
circulating in Nigeria (most recent case: [17 Sep 2011]). 2 other
strains are associated with the outbreak in Cote d'Ivoire (most recent
case: [24 Jul 2011]) and Guinea (most recent case: [3 Aug 2011]).

2011 annual totals by country as of 30 Nov 2011:
Afghanistan - 58
India - 1
Pakistan - 161
Nigeria - 45
DR Congo - 87
Chad - 125

[During the week 24-30 Nov 2011, there were new cases officially
confirmed in 4 countries: Afghanistan (3), Nigeria (1), Pakistan (7),
and Chad (6).

It is interesting to observe the time interval between the date of
onset and date/week of confirmation of WPV cases. In Afghanistan, the
interval appears to be approximately 2 weeks for the most recent case,
in Nigeria 4 weeks, in Pakistan 2 weeks, in Chad 4 weeks -- markedly
improved from earlier days when these intervals were in months. -
