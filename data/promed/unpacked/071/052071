-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Diphtheria rates in India have decreased considerably since 1980, in
parallel with increasing vaccination coverage. [1,2] In fact, rates in
India have remained similar to those of surrounding countries during
the past decade. See graphs:

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for his background reports. DTaP
vaccine is highly effective for the prevention of diphtheria. A total
of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children, one dose each
at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18
months, and 4-6 years
(http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm). The
fully immunized person who is exposed can become a carrier of the
bacterium but may only develop a mild case, or may not get sick at
all. But if not fully vaccinated, the risk of getting severely ill is
30 times higher
(http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccines/diphtheria).

Data from WHO/UNICEF (on page 77 of the document IMMUNIZATION SUMMARY
- A statistical reference containing data through 2008 - the 2010
edition, which is available at:
http://www.unicef.at/fileadmin/medien/pdf/Immunization_Summary_2008_r6.pdf)
reveals that the estimated national coverage rates for India for 1
dose of DTP for the years 2000-2008 is 77 to 83 percent. However,
estimated national coverage rates for India for receipt of all 3
initial doses of DTP fell to only 58 to 66 percent for the years
2000-2008.

Sawai Madhopur is a city in the Sawai Madhopur District in the Indian
