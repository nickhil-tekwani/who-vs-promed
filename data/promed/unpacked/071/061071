Nearly 270 people in Ireland have received blood from a British donor who
was infected with the [new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent,
apparently the human form of "mad cow" disease, the Irish health ministry
said Sunday. Blood products from the donor were transfused into patients in
nine Irish hospitals before it was learnt that the donor had died of [new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). The products were immediately
withdrawn from the market on November 26 and destroyed, the ministry said.
A department of health spokesman said that there was no evidence CJD could
be transmitted by blood or blood products but the product was withdrawn as
"a precautionary measure."
"This is an injectable agent used by radiology departments in lung scans.
The department understands that approximately 270 people were involved," the
spokesman added. The product -- three batches of Amerscam Pulmonate II
agent, which is used to diagnose lung disease -- was withdrawn following
confirmation that "one of the blood donors in the U.K. whose plasma was used
to manufacture the product subsequently developed new variant CJD."
Earlier this month, a British daily reported that Britain might have
exported the blood of a CJD victim to 46 countries.
