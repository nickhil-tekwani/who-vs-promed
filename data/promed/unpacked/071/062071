Avian Influenza - Situation in Thailand and Indonesia - WHO update 36
-----------------------------------------------
Thailand
--------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed an additional case
of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The patient, a 7-year-old boy
from Kanchanaburi Province, developed symptoms on 16 Oct 2005 and was
hospitalized on 19 Oct 2005. He is recovering. He is the son of a confirmed
case who died on 19 Oct 2005.
These are the 1st 2 confirmed cases in Thailand in a year. Since the start
of the outbreaks in Asia, Thailand has confirmed 19 cases, of which 13 have
been fatal.
Indonesia
---------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed 2 additional cases of
human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The 1st newly confirmed case is
a 4-year-old boy from Sumatra Island in Lampung Province. He developed
symptoms on 4 Oct 2005, was hospitalized, recovered fully, and has returned
home. This case is the nephew of the 21-year-old man from Lampung, who was
reported on 10 Oct 2005. Although the 2 cases are related and lived in the
same neighborhood, human-to-human transmission is considered unlikely.
The 2nd newly confirmed case was a 23-year-old man from Bogor, West Java.
He was hospitalized on 28 Sep 2005 and died on 30 Sep 2005.
Epidemiological investigations uncovered exposure to infected poultry as
the likely source of infection in both cases. To date, Indonesia has
reported 7 human cases of H5N1 avian influenza. 4 of these cases were fatal.
