Health officials have issued a rabies alert in a Sarasota [Florida] subdivision after a deer tested positive for rabies. The Florida Department of Health [DOH] in Sarasota County received laboratory confirmation on Monday, 23 May 2016, of rabies in a fawn that was found by a property owner in the Myakka Valley Ranches Subdivision on Monday, 16 May 2016.

A local veterinarian who lives in the area considered that this low-risk animal could be rabid. She recalled that Sarasota County had 2 low-risk goats test positive for rabies last spring. There was no obvious injury to the fawn. However, the animal was showing signs of illness including twitching in the face, poor muscular coordination, salivating and had no apparent fear of humans.

The deer was euthanized and tested positive for rabies. At this point, authorities are not sure how the deer contracted rabies. DOH-Sarasota has issued a rabies alert for 60 days in the Myakka Valley Ranches Subdivision.

All residents, especially in this vicinity, should be aware that rabies is present in the wild animal population and domestic animals are at risk if not vaccinated. The public is asked to maintain a heightened awareness that rabies is active in Sarasota County. Alerts are designed to increase awareness to the public, but they should not give a false sense of security to areas that have not been named as under an alert.

Rabies is caused by a virus, which humans and other mammals can get through an animal bite. In Florida, rabies is usually associated with bites or scratches from raccoons, bats, foxes, and unvaccinated outside cats. The virus can spread through contact with saliva or nervous tissue of a rabid animal through an open wound, the mouth, nose or eyes. Rabies is nearly always fatal without proper medical treatment. The only treatment for human exposure to rabies is rabies specific immune globulin and rabies immunization which should be started soon after the exposure to protect an exposed person from the disease.

Keep pets under direct supervision. If your pet is bitten by a wild animal, seek veterinary assistance for the animal immediately and contact Sarasota County Sheriff's Office Animal Services at 941-861-9500. Contact Animal Services to report unusual acting animals and to remove stray animals from your neighborhood.

Hunters should harvest only healthy appearing game, wear rubber or latex gloves when dressing carcasses, and wash hands afterwards. If a domestic or wild animal bites or scratches you, seek care promptly. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and running water for 5 to 10 minutes. Immediately visit your primary doctor, hospital or county health department for medical attention. Report an animal bite to DOH-Sarasota at 941-861-6133.

For more information on rabies, go to the Florida Department of Health website or call the Department of Health in Sarasota County Environmental Health office at 941-861-6133 or Sarasota County Sheriff's Office Animal Services at 941-861-9500.

Confirmed rabies cases in Kerr County [Texas] now stands at 21
--------------------------------------------------------------
On 7 Apr 2016, Peterson Regional Medical Center [PRMC] experienced a surge of patients in the emergency department after a possible rabies exposure. Residents of a Kerr County mobile home park between Kerrville and Ingram were told to head to the hospital for evaluation and treatment, due to exposure to a female dog confirmed rabid and her young puppies that would need to be tested.

Sarah Merritt of Kerr County Animal Control said then that residents took the unvaccinated adult dog to a veterinarian after one person reportedly was bitten; and the call to Animal Control and instructions to go to the emergency room followed.

According to Animal Control, the mother dog was confirmed rabid, and officers went door to door telling residents to go to the hospital. But they weren't the only human victims that needed aid. When the mobile home residents took the mother dog to Town & Country Animal Hospital, veterinarian Scott Chapman and other staff members (a total of 9) also were exposed to rabies and had to get expensive shots, for being what Chapman called "good Samaritans".

"The doctors here had pre-exposure shots and when we were exposed we only had to get 2 more," Chapman said. Those were claimed at USD 800 each on insurance, he said; and every staff member also had to be inoculated. If the shots have to include gamaglobulin, he said, the bill increases to about USD 13 000.

He said some got the shots at PRMC's lower cost, but at another Kerrville vet clinic, they paid workman's compensation USD 11 000 for post-rabies exposure shots. "By comparison, at our area veterinarians' offices, a pet's rabies vaccine is about USD 12," Chapman stressed. "And some of those mobile home residents from the previous case are still bringing dogs in that aren't vaccinated, and don't want to do it."

He said if a pet already was possibly exposed to rabies, that case requires 2 more doses. And by rules of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if a person is bitten by a pet exposed to rabies, the requirement is 4 injections.

Hospital response
-----------------
As more than a dozen patients presented to the emergency department [ED] in early April [2016], ED staff and other departments triaged all patients to assess their conditions and evaluate treatment depending on the level of exposure to the rabid dog and the puppies. By 6:30 pm, 18 patients were seen and ultimately 23 were seen.

"Nobody was kept overnight and there were no big injuries," Steve Pautler, chief operating officer of PRMC, said. "The process took from about 6 pm to shortly after 9 pm; and our physicians and nurses adjusted to the volume of patients."

Initial reports indicated the number of residents who could have possibly been exposed to the rabid dog and/or the puppies could have reached as many as 15 families. Patients who had direct exposure to the female dog received evaluation and treatment. Other patients received information and were released.

As of the next day, 3 patients were identified as high priority exposures and received the 1st vaccine in the rabies series. Rabies vaccines are scheduled for Day 0, 3, 7, and 14. (Day 28 vaccines are only for immunocompromised patients.) In total, 27 patients were evaluated and/or treated.

Pat Crocker, ER physician, said they need to realize a pet's rabies vaccination costs money, but humans' post-exposure 4-shot treatment costs hundreds of dollars, and the immunoglobin, when needed, costs thousands of dollars.

Hospital staff estimated they usually see about 15 people in a year for possible rabies exposure. In this event, about 10 people got vaccinated at the beginning of ER evaluations. The criteria changed after assessments, so fewer people needed follow-up care.

A potential rabies exposure should never be taken lightly. If untreated, rabies is fatal. Crocker described human symptoms of rabies as a viral syndrome that looks almost like the flu. If a person is bitten by a rabid animal, he said the location of the bite determines if there's an incubation period as the virus makes its way to the brain, before symptoms appear. There's a longer incubation period if the bite is on a hand or arm, for instance, than if the bite is on the face.

Rabies control
--------------
"This goes hand in hand with why Animal Control is here, to protect people, because we are more likely to get this from our own pets, not wildlife," Merritt said. "That's why vaccinations are required by law."

Ray Garcia, chief of the Kerr County Animal Control Department provided the following rabies warnings. "The number one thing to do, is for people to have their pets vaccinated," Garcia said. "It's in the interest of public health and safety."

The highest-risk wildlife in Kerr County, Texas, are skunks, foxes, raccoons, bats and coyotes. Of Kerr's 21 cases, more involved skunks than the other 4 animals.

Garcia listed warning signs -- any odd or unusual behaviors by the suspected animal. Some become more aggressive. Some that are nocturnal are seen in daylight hours. Some lose their usual balance and may have a limp causing them to circle or act very lame. Most that would normally avoid human contact could almost seek out people's yards or buildings.

Unvaccinated pets that are exposed to rabies might get off their food or water. Owners should notice if a pet displays other odd behavior such as changing from friendly to not friendly; or going from shyness to overt friendliness and human contact.

If a pet's rabies vaccination is current and the owner thinks it was exposed to rabid wildlife, the pet should get a booster shot, and be observed for 45 days. If a pet hasn't been vaccinated (but may be exposed), they said the animal should get a series of 3 rabies shots and be observed for 90 days.

Hamilton [Ontario] rabies count reaches 100
-------------------------------------------
Hamilton reached the century mark for confirmed rabies cases this week [week ending 13 May 2016]. To date 62 raccoons and 38 skunks have tested positive for rabies since the outbreak was 1st detected in December [2015], according the city's website.

Overall, 108 cases have been found in Ontario, with 5 animals testing positive in Haldimand-Norfolk, 2 in the Niagara Region, one in Brant County and the rest in Hamilton.

A press release from Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit said a raccoon found on the outskirts of York, near the Hamilton border had tested positive for rabies on Wednesday.

The health unit reminds the public to keep their pets' vaccinations up-to-date. In its most recent update, on Tuesday, the City of Hamilton added 6 skunks and 1 raccoon to the rabies tally. Within the city limits, the most cases have been found in Glanbrook (25), lower-east Hamilton (20) and Ancaster (14). No cases have been confirmed in Flamborough or the lower-central city.

To prevent rabies, the city recommends vaccinations and keeping your distance from wild animals. If bitten or contact is made with animal saliva, wash the wound with soap, seek medical attention, or call public health at 905-546-2489.

Lynchburg [South Carolina] dog exposes 5 people to rabies
---------------------------------------------------------
Five people have been referred to their health care providers for consultation after potentially being exposed to rabies in the Lynchburg area of Lee County by a stray dog that tested positive for the disease, the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) reported on Friday [13 May 2016].

The stray dog began showing neurological signs and was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 9 May 2016. Rabies was confirmed in the dog on 11 May 2016. During care and handling of the dog, a total of 5 people were potentially exposed. It is unknown how the dog contracted the rabies virus, however, bite wounds were discovered on the animal.

In addition, 5 pet dogs were potentially exposed to the rabies virus by the stray dog. None of these pets was current on its rabies vaccination and is required to undergo a 180-day quarantine period or be euthanized per the Rabies Control Act.

"To reduce the risk of contracting rabies, please play it safe and give animals, particularly wild and stray animals, their space," said Sandra Craig of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services. "We recommend that people avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild. "Rabies is transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into a bite wound, into open cuts in skin, or onto mucous membranes such as the mouth or eyes," said Craig.

Pets, particularly those that stay outdoors, have the potential to come in contact with wild or stray animals. If a pet returns home with unexplainable, visible wounds, immediately seek veterinary treatment and inform your local DHEC Environmental Quality Control office. In addition, keeping your pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect your family and pets from this fatal disease.

"Time is of the essence," Craig said, "because a family member or a beloved pet might be saved if treated properly and in a timely manner." Every year several hundred South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies after potentially being exposed to the rabies virus. Once signs of rabies are present in an animal, it is impossible to tell by appearance if an animal has rabies or some other condition such as distemper or lead poisoning. [However, there are tests for distemper and for lead that do not require the animal to be euthanized. Please consult your veterinarian any time you believe your pet may have been exposed to rabies or is otherwise acting in an unusual way. - Mod.TG]

The dog from Lee County is the 1st animal from that county to test positive for rabies in 2016. There have been 36 confirmed cases of rabies statewide this year [2016]. There were a total of 130 confirmed cases of animal rabies in South Carolina in 2015. Three of the 2015 cases were from Lee County.

[5] Missouri, USA - canine, human exposure

1st 2016 Howell County [Missouri] rabies case confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------
Puppy 6 weeks old with rabies, more than 25 people exposed, health department says [The following day, 6 May 2016, another source stated that 32 people were exposed. - Mod.TG]. Howell County's 1st case of rabies this year [2016] was confirmed in a 6 week old puppy, making it the 3rd confirmed case for the year in the state of Missouri.

The puppy had been separated from its litter and placed with an adoptive family on 22 Apr 2016, said Justin Frazier, environmental health specialist with the Howell County Health Department. One week later, after showing signs of illness, the puppy died and was taken to a veterinarian, who carried out testing. Rabies was confirmed to be the cause of death, and the health department was notified on Monday [2 May 2016], Frazier said.

Frazier said the puppy's mother and littermates will be euthanized. One other puppy had been placed with a family, but has now been accounted for and will be euthanized with the others. The deceased puppy was the only one to test positive right away, he said, but the virus can take months to be detectable, and the remaining puppies would have to be kept in strict isolation for 6 months.

Frazier said that more than 25 people have been exposed to the rabies virus and the health department is communicating with area hospitals to coordinate and prioritize the administration of shots to prevent rabies infection in those exposed. He said the shots are not widely available, but the department is actively working with the hospitals.

Prophylactic shots for rabies are most effective if given within 10 days of exposure, he said. Priority thus far has been given to those who are approaching that 10 days, though individuals who were exposed longer than 10 days ago are still encouraged to get the shots.

Awareness and prevention
------------------------
Frazier said there is no cause for panic -- as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, care for exposure is urgent, but not an emergency -- but rather, this serves as a timely reminder. "We need to focus on getting animals vaccinated," he stressed. The health department is actively investigating the case to identify anyone who may have been exposed and get them the necessary treatment, he said, and the best way for the public to help is to prevent rabies in their own pets.

"We had been made aware of skunks killed on the property by the dogs," Frazier said, referring to the property that housed the mother dog and the litter of puppies originally. "The puppies at the time were about a week old." He said it is his belief that the mother most likely killed the skunk, was bitten in the process or had infected material from the skunk in its mouth, and then licked on the puppies. The mother has not shown signs as yet, he said, but explained the time from exposure to clinical signs is a range of days.

The unusual circumstances of this case of rabies, heartbreaking as they are, do send a very important message. "We never want to see anyone go through these situations," Frazier said. "But if it had to happen ... we've got these clinics. This is a good time to raise awareness."

Annually, 7000 to 8000 rabid animals are detected in the United States, with more than 90 per cent of the cases occurring in wild animals. Rabies is found naturally in Missouri, primarily in bats and skunks, though other animals, domestic and wild, test positive for the virus each year. "Vaccination of cats and dogs is crucial, since vaccinated pets are a protective barrier between the people who own and interact with them and rabid wild animals with which the pets my have contact," Frazier said. "Dogs and cats whose owners consider them to be 'indoor animals' should also be vaccinated because these pets often have exposures to other animals, either by the dog or cat being unintentionally released to the outdoors, or by wild animals such as bats getting into the house."

Vaccinations are not recognized unless administered by a licensed veterinarian. There is no post-exposure treatment available for animals.

In case of exposure
-------------------
If an unvaccinated domestic animal is exposed to a rabid animal, the pet will have to be either euthanized or quarantined for 6 months at an approved facility, at the owner's expense. However, if the pet is up-to-date on vaccinations at the time of exposure, it only needs a rabies booster shot followed by a 45-day home quarantine. Protection for domestic animals against rabies begins 28 days after receiving the 1st vaccine.

CDC says people can be exposed to rabies in one of 2 ways: through a bite from an infected source -- no documented cases of human-to-human transference through bites have been recorded -- or by coming directly into contact with infected saliva or brain/nervous system tissue.

If exposed, CDC recommends immediate thorough washing of the wound with soap and water, and making an appointment with a doctor right away.

If the doctor determines that post-exposure prophylactic shots are needed to prevent illness, the patient will receive one dose of rabies immune globulin and 4 of rabies vaccine over 2 weeks. There is a very strict schedule to follow and care must be taken to adhere to it, CDC warns.

It is imperative to follow proper aftercare if exposed -- signs in animals or symptoms people of rabies can take weeks or months to develop, Frazier said, but if there's any chance that a bite may have been exposure, it's best to be cautious. As CDC warns, once clinical signs appear, the disease is nearly always fatal. The CDC website, http://www.cdc.gov, has more information about treatment, signs, and symptoms of rabies infection.

Pueblo County [Colorado] confirms rabies and tularemia in same day
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pueblo City-County Health Department discovered both a rabid bat and a rabbit infected with tularemia Thursday [5 May 2016], marking the 1st sign of summer.

Three people are undergoing vaccinations after coming into contact with the rabid bat, which they found in a home in the city of Pueblo. The health department is now putting out a reminder to citizens.

Hibernation season is at an end for both animals and the fleas and diseases they carry. Now, many like bats, are looking for a new home, and your house just might be the perfect spot if there are any cozy nooks in your attic or walls. "If you have holes in your screen, fix your holes in screens because bats can get into the smallest areas and get into your home," says Sarah Joseph with the health department. "Their teeth are very sharp and you can't feel the bite, especially if you're sleeping."

Rabies is almost always a fatal diagnosis, so health officials are acting quickly to save the 3 people who came across the rabid bat in Pueblo. If you find any bats lurking in your house, call animal control immediately and wear gloves and a mask if you approach them.

There are signs to let you know if the animal might be infected. Joseph says, "If you see a bat out during the daytime, that can be concerning because they're not usually out in the daytime, especially on the ground."

Also, keep your pets close when they are out and about. "Make sure pets have been vaccinated against rabies and their pets are prepared with flea or tick collars or treatments," says Joseph.

Rabid bat bites Corvallis [Oregon] man
--------------------------------------
A bat that bit a man in Corvallis has tested positive for rabies and is the 1st case of its kind in Oregon this year [2016]. On Wednesday [20 Apr 2016], a man told the Benton County Health Department that he awoke to a stinging pain in his hand and discovered that a bat had bitten him. He and his wife caught the bat and brought it to the Benton County Environmental Health Division for testing. The bat was then sent to the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory for rabies testing.

The man is being treated for rabies.

"Rabies is present in the bat population and bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in wild animals for our area of the country," said Bill Emminger of Benton County Environmental Health. "If you must handle a bat, it should be done with sturdy gloves or an implement such as a shovel. Direct hand contact with bats should always be avoided."

Emilio DeBess, from the Oregon Health Authority advised all pet owners to have their dogs and cats vaccinated against rabies. "Protecting pets from rabies can provide a buffer zone of immune animals between humans and rabid wild animals such as bats," DeBess said.

Rabies signs in wildlife can include lethargy, walking in circles and loss of muscular coordination, convulsions, irritability, aggressiveness, disorientation, excessive drooling and showing no fear of humans.

Animals displaying these behaviors should not be approached or handled. Animal control or wildlife authorities should be contacted. The local county health department should be consulted whenever there has been human or pet contact with bats or any animal that appears to be sick, injured or has bitten a human or pet.

For more information about rabies go to the Oregon Health Authority website at https://public.health.oregon.gov/diseasesconditions/diseasesaz/Pages/disease.aspx?did=41.

Dog potentially exposes 2 people to rabies
------------------------------------------
DHEC [Department of Health and Environmental Control] says a dog may have exposed 2 Sumter [South Carolina] residents to rabies. State health officials say a pet dog may have exposed 2 people in Sumter County to rabies.

DHEC says they're not sure how the animal got the disease, but say a dead raccoon was found in the family's yard back in January [2016]. On 10 Apr 2016, the dog began showing neurological signs of the disease, and on 14 Apr 2016, was confirmed to have rabies. DHEC officials say the dog was not up on its rabies vaccinations.

Because of the exposure, 2 people who were around the dog have been sent to their doctor for treatment [post exposure prophylaxis, PEP]. Rabies can be fatal, and people who believe they are exposed should always seek medical help immediately. [PEP is not available for exposed pets; that is why it is critical to keep your pet current on its rabies vaccine. - Mod.TG]

The dog is the 2nd animal from Sumter County, and the 28th overall, to test positive for rabies this year [2016].

The Arizona Department of Agriculture said a horse in Santa Cruz County has become the state's 1st case of rabies in a domesticated animal in nearly 7 years. The horse, whose owner lives in the Nogales [Arizona] area, was hospitalized but did not respond to treatment, according to a news release. The horse was later euthanized, state agriculture officials said.

"While rabies among domestic animals is extremely rare, with this being the 1st case in almost 7 years, we are reminded of the importance of keeping our animals' vaccinations current," said Dr Susan Gale, the acting state veterinarian.

The state Department of Agriculture urges livestock, horse and pet owners to speak with their veterinarian about how to protect their animals. Anyone in the outdoors who notices a wild animal acting out of the ordinary is asked to call Arizona Game and Fish as 623-236-7201.

[Rabies is a deadly disease. It knows no bounds. It will affect people, dogs, cats, cows, horses, deer and others. All mammals are susceptible to the rabies virus.

Keep all your animals current on their vaccines. Yes, that includes your cattle and horses. If you have contact with that animal, then it should be vaccinated. The 1st case may raise questions regarding captive cervids. However, contact with those animals is generally at time of harvest. Furthermore, I am unaware of a rabies vaccine approved for cervids.

Rabies vaccines may only be given by a licensed veterinarian. Rabies is a public health issue and if you ever lose your rabies certificate (moving, fire, other weather) then your veterinarian should have a copy. For cats and dogs there are vaccines good for either 1 year or for 3 years. Be sure you know which your pet is getting and remember it must be done again. Vaccines for farm animals are generally for 1 year. Yes, it is an added cost, until it is you that is exposed by a farm animal and then you are faced with the charges for post exposure prophylaxis and the death of your animal. That steer will not bring in any money if it is dead because of rabies. And it may well expose you or your family. The cost of a vaccine is cheap insurance for protecting human lives.

If you think your pet has possibly been exposed, please contact your veterinarian immediately. Please contact your physician if you believe you could have been exposed. - Mod.TG
