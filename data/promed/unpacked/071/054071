ProMED Award for Excellence in Outbreak Reporting on the Internet 2020
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each year, ProMED presents an award in honor of the anniversary of its founding in August 1994. We are pleased to announce the winner of this annual award.

This year's award goes to one of our own, Deputy Editor Marjorie Pollack. Marjorie sounded an early warning of a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China on 30 Dec 2019. Alerted by social media chatter (forwarded by a Chinese-speaking ProMED reader) Marjorie quickly recognized the importance of the cluster and its resemblance to SARS, also first reported by ProMED back in 2003. The post was the 1st indication to WHO and many others of the most important pandemic in 100 years. She has worked tirelessly since that day and personally posted nearly 350 follow-up COVID reports on ProMED. Her work has helped to secure ProMED's leadership position in emerging disease monitoring.

Of course, Marjorie's prescience and diligence have not gone unnoticed. She has been cited in numerous media stories. I will quote here extensively from Debora Mackenzie's excellent book "COVID-19: The pandemic that never should have happened and how to stop the next one" (https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/debora-mackenzie/covid-19/9780306924231/):

"It was [31 Dec 2019], and in our suburban French village, just over the border from Geneva, the sun was coming up. I had family in for the holidays and had solemnly promised to stop working.

But, I told myself, that didn't mean I couldn't take a peek at ProMED, just to make sure I didn't miss anything important...

For disease researchers, public health people, and science reporters like me -- as well as anyone fascinated by the daily reality show -- ProMED is required reading. When I ducked into my office that day, hoping it was early enough that my family wouldn't notice, the giant Sina Corp's financial bulletin was reporting people with severe, undiagnosed pneumonia in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, in Hubei province...

...there was a worrying comment by Marjorie Pollack at the bottom of the post. Pollack is a doctor and epidemiologist, ... the doyenne of ProMED's international team of moderators. She was involved in one of its proudest moments: alerting the world, on [10 Feb 2003], to the mystery pneumonia in Guangdong later named SARS, nearly 2 months before China opened up about it.

What she wrote that holiday morning gave me that queasiness you get when you're trying very hard to dismiss a feeling of foreboding. Besides the news report, she observed, there was a lot of online comment about this.

Twitter and its Chinese counterpart, Weibo, weren't around when SARS broke out, but online chatrooms were. "The type of social media activity that is now surrounding this event is very reminiscent of the original 'rumors' that accompanied the SARS-CoV outbreak," wrote Pollack. "More information on this outbreak... would be greatly appreciated. And," she added hopefully, "if results of testing are released.""

Board certified in Internal Medicine, trained at CDC in the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) in enteric and neurotropic viral diseases, Marjorie did a Preventive Medicine Residency at CDC as well, with a focus on vaccine preventable diseases. She has worked as a consultant medical epidemiologist for 40 years with a focus on child survival and disease surveillance issues in developing countries (having worked in more than 50 countries) and she has been with ProMED as a subscriber since April 1995. She began working with ProMED in 1997, initially as a web searcher. In addition to her role as Deputy Editor, Marjorie serves as ProMED's Regional Network editor, its Epidemiology and Surveillance moderator, and as our liaison to GOARN [Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network].

During the 18 years we have worked together, I have very often benefited from her guidance and her wisdom; also from her humor and grace. She has trained many of ProMED's moderator and editorial staff, and her colleagues have overwhelmingly endorsed this award.
