[2] CDC Health Alert: Bacterial Contamination
Date: Thu 1 Nov 2012
Source: CDC Health Alert Network [edited]
http://emergency.cdc.gov/HAN/han00333.asp


As part of the ongoing investigation of the multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections, the CDC and the FDA continue to test medical products from the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, MA. NECC is the firm that distributed and recalled injectable steroid medications implicated in the current outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections. CDC and FDA are reporting today [1 Nov 2012] that product testing has identified bacterial contamination with several _Bacillus_ species and closely related bacterial organisms in unopened vials of betamethasone and cardioplegia solution that were distributed and later recalled by NECC on 6 Oct 2012. These bacteria are commonly found in the environment and have been rarely reported as a cause of human disease; it is not known how product contamination with these species might affect patients. Although clinical infection is possible, CDC has not received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of infection due to _Bacillus_ or closely related organisms linked to these products. CDC's recommendations to healthcare providers for diagnosing and treating symptomatic patients who have received NECC products have not changed as a result of these findings. Additional microbial organisms may be identified in recalled NECC products as additional laboratory testing is completed.

Background
---------
On 26 Sep 2012, NECC voluntarily recalled 3 lots of methylprednisolone acetate (preservative free) 80mg/mL associated with the multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections. As previously confirmed by CDC and FDA, the fungus _Exserohilum rostratum_ was identified from 2 different lots of NECC-supplied, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (Lot 06292012@26 and Lot 08102012@51); testing on the 3rd implicated lot of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (Lot 05212012@68) is ongoing. Two types of fungus not known to be human pathogens were also identified from product from the 2 tested lots, namely _Rhodotorula laryngis_ and _Rhizopus stolonifer_. Among these fungal organisms, only _Exserohilum rostratum_ has been associated with human infections in this outbreak.

On 6 Oct 2012, NECC expanded its recall to include all products in circulation that were distributed from its facility in Framingham, MA. FDA released a MedWatch Safety Alert on 15 Oct 2012 stating that the sterility of any injectable drugs, including ophthalmic drugs that are injectable or used in conjunction with eye surgery, and cardioplegic solutions produced by NECC is of significant concern. As part of the ongoing investigation, FDA and CDC have been testing various NECC products for evidence of contamination. Laboratory testing at CDC and FDA has found multiple species of _Bacillus_ and closely related bacterial organisms in unopened vials of betamethasone and cardioplegia solution, as shown in the table below.

Medication / Lot number / Microbial contamination
Betamethasone / 08202012@141 / _Paenibacillus _pabuli/amolyticus_, _Bacillus idriensis_, _B. flexus_, _B. simplex_, _Lysinibacillus sp_.
Betamethasone / 07032012@22 / _Bacillus niabensis_, _B. circulans_
Betamethasone / 07302012@52 / _Bacillus lentus_, _B. circulans_
Cardioplegia solution / 09242012@55 / _Bacillus halmapalus_, _Brevibacillus choshinensis_

Other cultures for these products, including fungal cultures, are pending.

Recommendations to Healthcare Providers
---------------------------------
CDC and FDA have previously advised that healthcare professionals should cease use of any product produced by NECC. On 15 Oct 2012, FDA issued a MedWatch Safety Alert advising clinicians to follow-up with patients who received any injectable NECC product, including betamethasone or cardioplegia solution purchased from or distributed by NECC after 21 May 2012. Clinicians were also requested to report any suspected adverse events following use of these products to FDA's MedWatch program.

CDC continues to investigate reports of potential infections in patients receiving other NECC products. As of 1 Nov 2012, CDC has received no reports of confirmed infections resulting from injection of any NECC product except those from the 3 recalled lots of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate.

CDC's recommendations to healthcare providers for diagnosing and treating symptomatic patients who have received NECC products have not changed as a result of these findings. CDC continues to recommend routine laboratory and microbiologic tests, including bacterial and fungal cultures, deemed necessary by treating clinicians.

These bacteria have been rarely reported as a cause of human disease. Nevertheless, clinicians should consider these product findings when reviewing laboratory results from patients who have been exposed to a NECC product, since _Bacillus_ and related bacteria are often considered in clinical results to be possible skin contaminants. Physicians should continue to report infections potentially related to NECC products to FDA's MedWatch and to state health departments.

[3] CDC Health Alert Network: Additional Recalls
Date: Wed 31 Oct 2012

http://emergency.cdc.gov/HAN/han00332.asp


On 31 Oct 2012, the FDA announced that Ameridose is voluntarily recalling all of its unexpired medical products in circulation. Ameridose is based in Westborough, MA and is managed by some of the same people as the New England Compounding Center (NECC), the firm that distributed and recalled injectable medications implicated in the ongoing multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections. FDA is not aware of any recent reports of infections associated with the recalled Ameridose products. However, the preliminary results of FDA's ongoing inspection of Ameridose have raised concerns about a lack of sterility assurance for products produced at and distributed by this facility. As a result of FDA's preliminary findings, Ameridose has agreed to voluntarily recall all of its unexpired products in circulation.

Background
---------
The recall of Ameridose products is different from the recent recalls of NECC products. The CDC and FDA are not aware of any recent reports of any infections associated with Ameridose products, unlike the 3 lots of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (80mg/mL) from NECC that were recalled on 26 Sep 2012 and directly linked to cases of fungal meningitis and joint infections. Therefore, at this time, FDA does not urge healthcare professionals to follow-up directly with patients who received Ameridose products.

Drug Shortage Considerations
-----------------------
FDA has identified some Ameridose products that currently are on the critical drug shortage list. These products were in shortage before the Ameridose recall, but supplies may be further affected as a result of the Ameridose recall. FDA is taking a number of actions, including working with alternative manufacturers to maintain supplies of these life-saving drugs.

Clinicians should refer to the FDA's Drug Shortage website for information on availability of drugs currently in shortage. If clinicians believe there is a drug entering shortage, notify FDA's Drug Shortage Team at <drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov>.

Recommendations to Healthcare Providers
---------------------------------
CDC and FDA are advising health care professionals to stop using and isolate for return to Ameridose all Ameridose products. Hospitals, clinics, health care professionals, and other customers with product on hand should contact Ameridose at 1-888-820-0622 to obtain instructions on how to return products to Ameridose. Products from Ameridose can be identified by markings that indicate Ameridose by name or by its company logo. A complete list of all products subject to this recall can be accessed online at http://www.ameridose.com.

At this time, CDC and FDA do not urge direct patient follow-up for Ameridose products. However, clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of infections associated with the use of Ameridose products and report to FDA's MedWatch any infection or adverse events identified in a patient known to have received a product from Ameridose. Contact FDA's MedWatch Program by fax at 1-800-FDA-0178 (or 1-800-332-0178); by mail at MedWatch, FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787; or on the MedWatch website at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch.

[The number of cases, primarily in or around the central nervous system, continues to increase in this dramatic outbreak that will likely increase the FDA control of compounding pharmacies. A smaller government, as advocated by certain facets of American politics, cannot delay such increased regulations.
