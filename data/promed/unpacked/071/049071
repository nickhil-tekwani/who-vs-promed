The total case count in the ongoing _Listeria_ outbreak linked to imported Italian ricotta cheese has expanded from 18 to 20 and one more victim has died, announced the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an update on Friday [12 Oct 2012]. [See below.]

The 2 new illnesses were reported in California. One of these 2 victims died, bringing the total number of victim deaths from 3 to 4.

Last week, Food Safety News reported on 2 cases in California that had not yet been counted in CDC's investigation update -- a pregnant mother who contracted a listeria infection and her son who was born prematurely on 19 Sep 2012 and died on 4 Oct 2012. CDC and the California Department of Public Health have yet to confirm whether the mother and her son were the newly counted 2 cases and death linked to the outbreak, but it's likely that they are, since the outbreak strain of listeria was isolated from both the baby and the placenta.

19 of the 20 people in 12 states and Washington DC, who've now been infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been hospitalized, reports CDC. One stillbirth has also been tied to the outbreak. The 11 victims who were not fetal or newborn range in age from 30 to 87 years old, with a median age of 77, according to CDC's update.

The contaminated cheese causing this outbreak is imported from Italy by Forever Cheese of Long Island City, New York, and sold under the Marte brand as Ricotta Salata Frescolina.

Multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to imported Frescolina Marte brand ricotta salata cheese
----------------------------------------------------------------
As of 11 Oct 2012, a total of 20 persons infected with the outbreak-associated strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 12 states and the District of Columbia. [The 2 new cases are from California.]

19 ill persons reported being hospitalized. 4 deaths have been reported. Listeriosis contributed to at least 2 of these deaths. One fetal loss has also been reported.

Among persons for whom information is available, dates when clinical specimens were collected range from 28 Mar 2012 to 19 Sep 2012. 19 ill persons reported being hospitalized. 9 of the illnesses were related to a pregnancy; 3 of these illnesses were diagnosed in newborns. The other 11 ill persons range in age from 30 years to 87 years, with a median age of 77 years, and 55 per cent of them are female.

Collaborative investigation efforts of local, state, and federal public health and regulatory agencies indicate that imported ricotta salata cheese is the likely source of this outbreak.

On 14 Sep 2012, Forever Cheese, Inc, issued an expanded recall of all lots and production codes of Frescolina Marte brand ricotta salata cheese and issued a market withdrawal of all cheeses they received that were produced by the Italian cheese exporter.

Frescolina Marte brand ricotta salata cheese may also have been referred to as Ricotta Frescolina Marte Tipo Toscanella or Ricotta Salata Soft (lot number T9425) during distribution.

Labeling of the recalled ricotta salata cheese after it was cut and repackaged has been inconsistent. Be aware that labels of repackaged cheese may not include the words "Marte" or "Frescolina".

Consumers who purchased recalled Marte brand Frescolina ricotta salata cheese are advised not to eat it and to discard any remaining cheese.

This is especially important for pregnant women, persons with weakened immune systems, and older adults.

Cheese retailers should not sell or serve recalled Marte brand Frescolina ricotta cheese distributed by Forever Cheese, Inc, regardless of any expiration coding.

Results of testing of clinical specimens that were collected after 24 Sep 2012 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. The recalled cheese should be off store shelves now because the recall began on 10 Sep 2012, and was expanded on 14 Sep 2012. However, more ill persons may be reported because up to 2 months can elapse between eating contaminated food and developing listeriosis.

One fetal loss has also been reported. DNA "fingerprints", -- that is, genotyping, of listeria have been used to identify cases of illness that are linked to this outbreak.
