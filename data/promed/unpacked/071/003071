A motion has been put forward in the Dutch Lower House to reverse a
decision by Health Minister Ab Klink and Agriculture Minister Gerda
Verburg to have all rams and billy goats on dairy farms infected with
Q-fever destroyed.

Since male sheep and goats can also carry the bacteria, they may
infect females during mating. As it is difficult to distinguish
between sick and healthy animals, the health and agriculture
ministers had opted to cull the males rather than take the risk.

But MPs said the measure was too drastic and have proposed that the
animals be 1st tested individually. Minister Verburg is against the
motion but has said she will await the outcome of next week's
parliamentary vote on the issue.

There are 64 sheep and goat dairy farms in the Netherlands infected
with Q-fever, but most of the farmers keep only a few males.

Subsequent to the parliamentary debate, the Minister of Agriculture
has delayed the planned culling of rams and he-goats present in the
Q-fever infected holdings. The final decision on their fate will be
taken after the final vote, planned to take place on 2 Feb 2010.
Minister Verburg said that she regards the male animals as potential
risk since they can infect covered females with their semen. She
supposed that repeated testing cannot guarantee the males' freedom of
Q fever, precluding their use for breeding. Farms which plan a new
start must guarantee the absence of infected animals.

Verburg promised to make an effort to safeguard the supply, in 2010,
of larger quantities of vaccines against Q fever than the already
ordered 1.5 million doses. The parliament wished that all sheep and
goats in the Netherlands will be vaccinated; this falls in line with
Verburg's aim. She considers the possible adoption of the combined
Chlamydophila/Q fever vaccine, currently used in France.

[On top of animal welfare aspects of the issue, there are significant
zootechnical/economical ones. Male breeding animals are selected
according to their genetic potential, their monetary value usually
much higher than that of the females and may go into 4-digit figures
or even more, in Euros. They may represent many years of breeding
efforts and investments. - Mod.AS]

The decision of Tue 26 Jan 2010 on measures concerning the seclusion
of birthing sheep and goats on holdings with public function is to go
into force today [28 Jan 2010] 11.00 am.

Children's petting farms and all other holdings with a public
function [e.g. nursing homes etc.] will be obliged to secure that
birthings of pregnant goats and sheep will take place in enclosed
spaces fully separated from the public. The separation will have to
be implemented from the end of the 4th gestation month until 2 weeks
post-parturition. The offspring are to stay by their mothers within
the separated pace during those 2 weeks [The gestation period of
sheep and goats is about 5 months. - Mod.AS].

The culling of thousands of goats after an outbreak of Q-fever in the
Netherlands has shocked many and reinforced calls for early
vaccination of animals.

It seems like an unmistakable new trend: every 2 to 3 years a major
outbreak of a veterinary disease takes thousands of animals' lives.
They are either killed by the disease itself or are culled to avoid
the plague from spreading further. Today, the Netherlands suffers
from an outbreak of Q-fever among goats; 3 years ago it was hit by an
outbreak of bluetongue (catarrhal fever); in 2003 bird flu (avian
influenza) was an issue; foot-and-mouth struck in 2001, and classical
swine fever ruled in 1997. In the meantime, mad cow disease lingered
for years. Last year [2009] was the 1st since 1997 that no new cases
of the illness were reported.

The assumption is that industrialisation of agriculture goes hand in
hand with larger, more frequent, and deadlier veterinary diseases.
But does it really?

Fred van Zijderveld, the deputy director of the Central Veterinary
Institute, thinks not. "What has changed is our perception of events
because of the large scale media attention. At the same time, people
accept less when it comes to the suffering of animals. There was an
outbreak of classical swine fever in 1952 in which 3000 farms were
contaminated, and the same happened to 1700 businesses in 1962."

The shift in perception and tolerance manifested itself during the
1997 epidemic of classical swine fever. Throughout the 1990s, a
strong non-vaccination policy was implemented in the Netherlands
because some countries importing pigs did not want them vaccinated.
The vaccine leaves traces in the animal that resembled those of the
actual disease, making it impossible to tell if an animal was ill or
had been vaccinated. That is why animals were not protected through
vaccination after an epidemic was discovered in 1997. When it spun
out of control, as many as 9.6 million pigs had to be culled.

"Non-vaccination is very risky with all the long distance transport
we have today," according to Van Zijderveld. "Exporting countries
must guarantee their animals are healthy, but an infected animal will
occasionally slip through, and viruses can spread rapidly. I think
the Netherlands today would choose to immediately vaccinate healthy
animals in the vicinity of an outbreak," he said. "Definitely in the
case of classical swine fever, because we now have a so-called marker
vaccine that helps distinguish between vaccinated and contaminated animals."

Over the last few years, farmers have argued in favour of
inoculating. "Both society at large and the farmers involved want to
stop the killing of healthy animals," a farmers' lobby organisation
wrote in a press release 4 years ago. In spite of this plea, the
government failed to vaccinate goats en masse even after bacteria
they carried had infected 2300 and killed at least 6 people. In the
past weeks, 38 000 goats and sheep were culled to prevent more humans
being infected.

Professor Roel Coutinho, the director of the Centre for Infectious
Disease Control, believes the size of the goat industry and their
proximity to humans caused the unprecedented outbreak. "We used to
say: things like this happen in China, where many people and animals
live very close to each other. But the Netherlands is the China of
Europe." With a livestock population of 119 million animals and over
16 million people, the country is prone to quick transmission of
diseases. Yet Coutinho was astonished by the impact of Q-fever. "I
was surprised by the sudden appearance of intensive goat farming," he
said. Goats had become a very popular type of cattle, largely because
other animals had proven so prone to infectious disease.

It is difficult to pass a black-and-white judgment on the relation
between modern, large scale farming and animal diseases, Van
Zijderveld said. "The scale has led to improved hygiene and the
disappearance of worm infections that originate in livestock. If
organic farming grows, tapeworm infections in humans may reappear."

Partly due to specialisation of businesses, said Van Zijderveld, a
number of diseases, like tuberculosis and brucellosis, have
disappeared completely. "In the fifties, many people got TB from
infected cattle. That was the main reason for pasteurising milk,
regular animal testing and the removal of infected animals from the
population. Since 1990, we are officially a tuberculosis-free
country," Van Zijderveld said.

Professor Coutinho was involved in round table discussions at the
ministry of agriculture in 2007. "I am amazed that people believe
risks can be eradicated," he said at the time. "I believe there is a
lot we can't predict. All it takes is one incident, and the
consequences are huge. The image of the industry in society can turn
completely." One of the other speakers replied: "That is what we do
in agriculture, we only change after incidents and the reactions they evoke."
