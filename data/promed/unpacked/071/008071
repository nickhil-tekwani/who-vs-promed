[Myxomatosis is seen in several European countries. However, this
disease is probably most famous because of its deliberate
introduction to Australia in an attempt to use this virus for
biological control of the European rabbit _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ in
1950. Schwabe, in his Veterinary Medicine and Human Health, mentions
how this epidemic with an initial case fatality rate of 99.8 percent
settled down and eventually became endemic as the virulence of the
virus decline while the rabbits became more resistant. It was also
deliberately introduced to France by a physician in 1952 and
subsequently spread to the UK in 1953.
This disease does seem to spark the imagination of artists, being the
subject of -- among others-- a poem by Spike Milligan, a Radiohead
song, both The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Watership Down
mention it by name, and a famous Australian children's TV character
is called "Mixy".
The disease itself is caused by a pox virus that causes skin lesions,
which manifest as swellings in the anogenital areas and head,
sometimes resulting in blindness. This is often referred to as
"sleepy eye". The disease is spread by insect vectors including
mosquitoes. - Mod.PC]
[Myxomatosis is one of the 3 lagomorph diseases on OIE's list of
reportable diseases (the other 2 are tularemia and rabbit hemorrhagic
disease. Details on the etiological agent, relevant diagnostic
techniques, and requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals
can be seen in chapter 2.8.1. of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals at:
