Mad cow tests on 29 cattle negative; results are pending on 38 other
animals, USDA says
-----------------------------------------------
29 cattle have tested negative for mad cow disease and will not be tested
further, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Saturday [10 Jul 2005].
USDA spokesman Jim Rogers also said on Saturday that another 38 animals
were being screened for mad cow disease and that those results are pending.
The animals must be killed before they can be screened, because officials
run tests on their brain samples.
The tests on the 67 cattle are part of the department's ongoing
investigation into a recently confirmed case of mad cow disease in a Texas
beef cow.
Officials have not released the name of the rancher or the specific
location of the Texas ranch where that cow was born and raised. The 67
cattle were from the same herd as the infected cow.
They are so called "cattle of interest," meaning they're siblings,
offspring or herd mates born about the same time.
The National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa has been
conducting the initial rapid screening tests on the 67 samples looking for
the presence of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
If results of the rapid-screening test come back inconclusive, indicating
the possibility of the disease, the animals will be incinerated and 2
additional types of tests will be conducted on the samples, Rogers said.
Animals testing negative will be sent to a landfill, he said.
The additional tests -- immunohistochemistry and Western blot -- search for
an abnormal prion protein in the animal's brain tissue. Positive results
would spur more trace-back testing similar to that being conducted now.
Humans who eat infected beef can develop a variant of the brain-wasting mad
cow disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Initial screening last year [2004] on the 12-year-old Texas Brahma
crossbreed that was eventually confirmed as infected was conducted at a
Texas A&M laboratory and came back inconclusive. More elaborate testing,
immunohistochemistry, also came back negative.
At the time, officials didn't conduct the Western blot test. Later, the
USDA's inspector general requested further testing on that cow, and last
month [June 2005], Western blot results came back positive.
The USDA has since announced that all rapid-screening tests that come back
inconclusive will be subject to the immunohistochemistry and Western blot
tests.
The department usually pays fair market value to ranchers whose cattle are
destroyed for testing.

[This appears to be an attempt to locate and test the cohorts of the animal
that tested positive on Western blot testing. Some of those cohorts were
probably born before the feed ban took effect, and we appreciate USDA
reporting the results thus far. - Mod.TG]
