Disease experts probe farm flood
--------------------------------
The BBC's science correspondent, Pallab Ghosh, said he understands that
government scientists are looking into whether a flood at Wolford farm --
where the disease was confirmed on Friday [3 Aug 2007] -- might have been
the means by which animals became infected.
He said an investigation of the [lesions] on the mouths of the cows
suggested that they were infected sometime between 18 and 22 July [2007].
Computer modelling suggests that airborne transmission from the Pirbright
site is a possibility -- but unlikely, he said.
The government says no new cases of foot and mouth disease [FMD] have been
reported in the past 24 hours. About 97 cows have been culled on 2
neighbouring farms -- most as a precaution due to "potentially dangerous
contact".
Speaking after a visit to the Regional Disease Control Centre in Reigate,
Surrey, prime minister Gordon Brown said it was a difficult time. But he
added, "I hope in a short period of time we can say we have contained,
controlled, and eradicated this disease."
Asked about farmers' anger that a research site could be the cause of the
outbreak, the prime minister urged people not to pre-judge the outcome of
the investigations currently under way. He said "every possible source" was
being investigated, adding, "I want to be able to ensure people every
effort is being made and people here are working night and day to contain
this disease."
"We've tested in up to 100 different farming establishments. We've been
testing, obviously, pigs, cattle, sheep, and in some cases goats. "It's
very important that all the tests are done and checked, particularly
obviously with blood tests on sheep. That is being carried out by 150 staff."
The National Farmers' Union [NFU] says its members will be "rightly
horrified" if the vaccine centre is to blame -- inspectors hope to have the
results of their inquiry by Tuesday [7 Aug 2007].
Meanwhile the European Commission has formalised a ban on British exports
of meat, milk products, and live animals.
After meeting Mr Brown at Downing Street on Monday [6 Aug 2007], NFU
President, Peter Kendall, said his members were "angry and very, very
concerned" about speculation linking the virus to the Pirbright facilities.
"It cannot be the case that we have a scientific institution that actually
releases disease into the environment, and our members will be quite
rightly horrified," he said.
Merial has suspended vaccine production but says it has "complete
confidence" in its biosecurity measures and to date its investigations have
shown "no breach" in procedures. Protection and surveillance zones covering
farms in the area have been expanded to 10 km (6.2 mi). But there has been
some criticism that footpaths remain open in the area.
Stephen Bowers, who owns a smallholding on the edge of the exclusion zone,
also said bridleways were open and wild deer were freely moving across the
area adding, "The countryside is open and it's open to infection."
The government has imposed a ban on the movement of all livestock in
England, Scotland, and Wales. The EC has endorsed a British ban on
exporting cattle and animal products. Northern Ireland, which has imposed a
ban on all cattle, sheep, and pigs from Britain, has been excluded.
111 000 farms across UK [have been] affected by movement ban. That includes
10m cattle, 23m sheep, and 5m pigs.
A spokesman said the EC was "very happy with the prompt response of the
British authorities." Environment secretary, Hilary Benn, has urged people
to remain vigilant, as the source of the outbreak has not been confirmed.
He said that the facilities at Pirbright were being redeveloped following a
report made in 2002, as a result of the FMD outbreak the previous year,
which had criticisms of the institute.
Last year [2006], the institute expressed concerns about cuts to its
funding in written evidence given to MPs [members of parliament].

[On top of the above-mentioned 1st outbreak in Normandy, another focus of
infection (or suspected infection? serological?) has been discovered,
namely in Elstead. The current infected zone includes areas around 3
locations: Pirbright, Normandy, and Elstead. See further updated details in
item [3] below, and a current map of the protection and surveillance zones

CVO update on latest situation on FMD outbreak
----------------------------------------------
Chief veterinary officer (CVO), Debby Reynolds, today [6 Aug 2007] set out
latest progress on tackling the FMD outbreak in Surrey. She stressed that
the operation continued to focus on containment and eradication of the
disease and that livestock keepers should continue to be vigilant and
maintain high levels of biosecurity.
Key points set out by Debby Reynolds include:
- there is currently one Infected Premises. This had animals on 3 sites.
There are 2 Protection Zones, one of which encompasses Pirbright and the
site where the original infected animals were identified. The 2nd
Protection Zone encompasses the site where infection was subsequently
found. A large Surveillance Zone of 10 km (6.2 mi) surrounds the 2
Protection Zones;
- the cull is now complete. A total of 97 animals have been culled -- 64
from the infected premises, plus 33 from 2 dangerous contact premises. The
carcasses have been disposed of by incineration;
- a major communication effort has been under way in the area. Telephone
contact has been made with all known premises in the Protection Zones and
approximately 500 packs containing leaflets and letters have been delivered
to all known premises in the Protection Zones and most of the premises in
the Surveillance Zone. The DEFRA helpline (08459 335577) is open from 0600
to 2200 every day;
- the HSE (Health & Safety Executive)-led investigation is progressing
rapidly and initial reports are expected imminently. Professor Brian Spratt
will begin his review into biosecurity arrangements at the Pirbright site
tomorrow [7 Aug 2007]. Included in the evidence will be the outcome of the
immediate investigation currently being carried out by officials from the
HSE, DEFRA, and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate; and
- as part of DEFRA's contingency plan and in order to ensure full
preparedness, 300 000 doses of strain-specific vaccine have been ordered
from the UK's vaccine bank, to be made up from antigen. No decision has
been taken on whether or not to use the vaccine.
Debby Reynolds said, "All of us share the same aim -- to eradicate FMD and
to minimise the impact on the countryside, farmers, and rural communities.
We will continue to do all that is necessary to achieve that.
"In line with contingency planning arrangements, we have ordered vaccine
production and for vaccination teams to move into the area, this is not an
indication that a decision has been taken to vaccinate. It has not.
"Production of vaccine will be carried out at the Merial laboratory,
obviously we would not be doing this without careful consideration and
assessment of the risks. Producing vaccine from antigen does not involve
use of live virus. We are working very closely with the HSE and the
Veterinary Medicines Directorate regarding any work at Merial, and they are
satisfied that it does not affect their investigation."
Debby Reynolds also paid tribute to the large number of people who worked
tirelessly since the outbreak was identified, including Animal Health,
operational partners and key stakeholders. And she stressed that the
countryside and footpaths remain open. Whilst some parks, safari parks, and
other wildlife centres have taken the decision to close or restrict access,
neither DEFRA nor the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is advising
that such action is necessary.

[Various media sources have been indicating that the FMD vaccine production
has been carried out in Pirbright for the last 15 years. This is somewhat
misleading. In fact, the Wellcome Foundation Limited had been operating the
Wellcome Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccine Laboratory at Pirbright during
decades before it was taken over by Merial. The vaccine, produced by
Welcome and later by Merial, was intended for use in other countries and
for vaccine banks; vaccination in the UK has always been forbidden.
The outcome of current deliberations on vaccination in the UK is expected
with interest. We are grateful to Miriam Roberts for the following relevant
piece of information:
"There has been one UK outbreak of FMD caused by virus type SAT2.
When? January 1960.
Where? On a farm one mile from Pirbright.
Presumed cause? Escape from the laboratory.
"Following this incident, disease security measures were improved and air
filtration was introduced to the isolation units." (Source: Animal Health,
A Centenary 1865-1965, pp 149-150.)" This reference falls in line with
Mod.MHJ's commentary in ProMED-mail posting 20070803.2523.
We look forward eagerly to the experts' report on the 2 Pirbright
facilities, expected tomorrow (7 Aug 2007). - Mod.AS]
