New suspected cases of bird flu [avian influenza, AI] and increasing frequency of suspected outbreaks, Wednesday [29 Jan 2014], were suggesting a nationwide pandemic of the animal disease ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays [30 Jan-1 Feb 2014] when tens of thousands of people travel southward to visit their hometowns.

Four new suspected cases of avian influenza (AI) have been reported since Tuesday [28 Jan 2014], bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases to 56, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. [A clarification of the term "case" will be helpful. Bird? farm? village?].

A virulent H5N8 strain of AI has been confirmed in 27 cases so far after the country reported its 1st outbreak on 16 Jan 2014 at a duck farm in Gochang, North Jeolla Province.

The animal disease is believed to have since spread to 5 other provinces including Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds the capital Seoul. Only Gangwon and North Gyeongsang provinces, both forming the country's eastern coast, along with the southern resort island of Jeju currently remain free of any suspected AI case.

Ministry officials noted an increasing frequency of suspected outbreaks, but claimed a growth in the number of suspected or confirmed cases did not necessarily mean the spread of the virus.

"We do not think it is a spread of the disease from AI infected farms," Kwon Jae-han, head of the ministry's livestock policy bureau, said at a press briefing.

He said the recent outbreaks may have been caused by AI virus planted [??] or spread before the country's quarantine efforts began. The AI virus is said to have an incubation period of up to 21 days.

The government has singled out migratory birds as the original source of the latest AI outbreaks after the H5N8 strain was confirmed in a group of wild ducks found dead at a reservoir in North Jeolla Province.

"Sporadic outbreaks are possible at any time, and under current conditions, it appears the AI virus may be present everywhere," Kwon said.

Over 2 million animals, mostly ducks and chickens, have been or are set to be slaughtered since the virus outbreak earlier this month [January 2014].

The bird flu crisis gripping Korea is showing no signs of abating. There are now fears the virus has even spread to the southeastern part of the nation in Gyeongsangnam-do [South Gyeongsang] Province. The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said on Wednesday [29 Jan 2014] that a suspected case at a chicken farm in the city of Miryang was reported Tuesday night [28 Jan 2014].

Officials say around 70 chickens were found dead at the farm. New suspected cases also popped up in several farms west of the country and the virus was confirmed in Korea's central Chungcheongbuk-do Province, and another further south in Chungcheongnam-do [North Chungcheong] Province on Tuesday [28 Jan 2014].

The government and quarantine officials have beefed up measures to prevent the virus from spreading even further over the Lunar New Year Holiday, which begins Thursday [30 Jan 2014].

The virus seems to continue its spread in spite of measures undertaken; for the locations of the reportedly affected provinces, see an administrative map of South Korea at http://www.vidiani.com/?p=4303.

The role of migratory birds in the current HPAI H5N8 epizootic has already become (similarly to previous HPAI epizootics in Asia and elsewhere, including HPAI H5N1) a matter of controversy. For a different, recently published opinion on the role of wild migratory waterbirds in the epizootic, see http://www.eaaflyway.net/wild-migratory-waterbirds-are-the-victims-of-bird-flu-not-the-cause/. - Mod.AS
