The Russian veterinary authorities have reported another 13 outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) once again across various regions, affecting wild boar and domestic pigs, according to a Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] report for the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE].

The report says that a total of 392 pigs were found susceptible, out of which 92 cases were reported. Out of the 92 affected pigs, 81 animals were found dead. A total of 83 pigs were slaughtered.

In the case of wild boar, 54 animals were found susceptible and out of these, 10 cases were found. Out of the 10 affected boars, 8 were reportedly found dead. 2 wild boars were slaughtered.

The largest number of outbreaks is still registered in the European part of Russia. Recent outbreaks have been reported in the Moscow and Vladimir Regions. Veterinary specialists are also struggling to stop the spread of ASF in the Black Earth Region (Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Tambov, and Lipetsk Regions) where the largest pig farms in the country are concentrated.

According to the recent report by Rosselkhoznadzor, 2013 was the record in terms of the spread of ASF in Russia.
