CHP notified of 2 cases of human infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in mainland China
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (15 Nov 2014) received notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission of 2 cases of human infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) affecting a woman aged 54 in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and a woman aged 45 in Jiangsu. The 54-year-old woman passed away early this month.

To date, 443 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed on the mainland in Zhejiang (139 cases), Guangdong (109 cases), Jiangsu (58 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Fujian (22 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (8 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Shandong (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

"Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," a spokesman for the DH said. "In view of cases confirmed on the mainland, members of the public should maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times during travel," the spokesman urged. "All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added. Regarding health education for travellers, the display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are proceeding. Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:
- do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
- if contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

The public may visit the avian influenza page of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html) and its website (http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf) for more information on avian influenza-affected areas.

[Reports of H7N9 avian influenza in humans began in February 2013. According to the CHP, to date there have now been 443 cases in mainland China, 57 of them in Jiangsu province according to the DH. According to FluTrackers (the infectious disease news message board), the total will now be at 4588. The most recent previous cases were reported about 2 weeks ago, in Xinjiang province and Beijing.

The H7N9 avian influenza cases in humans remain sporadic and in general associated with poultry consumption and husbandry. The travel warnings in respect to travel to mainland China seem excessive.

Among actions being encouraged by DH are avoiding live-poultry markets and farms, thoroughly cooking eggs and poultry before eating them, washing hands often, and wearing a mask if respiratory symptoms develop. - Mod.CP
