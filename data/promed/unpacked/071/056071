The [Costa Rica] State Phytosanitary Service (SFE) confirmed this morning
[15 Apr 2010] that the disease known as huanglongbing (HLB) has been
officially detected in Nicaragua, which the endangers large orange groves
in Costa Rica.

Until now, the nearest point where HLB had officially been reported was
Belize [ProMED-mail post 20090518.1853], but now it has been found in both
Honduras and Nicaragua.

The SFE reported that the bacteria spread along the coastal strip of the
Caribbean, from Miami, reaching Belize, Honduras, Cuba, Dominican Republic,
and Nicaragua. There are no commercial orange plantations in Costa Rica's
Caribbean coast, which is why the SFE is focusing on inspecting and
monitoring backyard trees to determine whether the disease is present in
the country. Later on a similar activity will be carried out in the north
of the country, where most of the 27 000 hectares [about 67 000 acres] of
commercial orange plantations are located.

This bacterium is spread by an insect already present in Costa Rica, which
makes the arrival of the disease even more dangerous because it could
spread quickly.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most
damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In Asia as
well as northern and central America and the Caribbean, it is caused by the
fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus.
Fruits become unmarketable and trees may die prematurely. The disease is
restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range
of its insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_). It is
also spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission. Disease management
requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary measures,
elimination of inoculum, and vector control.

The pathogen and vector originate from Asia. HLB was reported for the first
time in the Americas from Brazil in 2004 (ProMED-mail post 20040723.2012)
and Florida in 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050910.2683) after the vector had
arrived there earlier. Both have been spreading through the region from
both points since then.

The related _Ca._ L. africanus, and _Ca._ L. americanus cause similar
symptoms different regions.
