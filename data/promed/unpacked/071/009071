Sierra Leone's Minister of Health, Dr. Alpha Wurie, has confirmed 3 new polio cases in Sierra Leone for the 1st time in 10 years. He said the cases were recorded in Kambia, Tonkolili, and Western Area Rural District. The minister, however, said that the cases were not from the wild poliovirus strain, rather vaccine derived.

Asked how they were able to piece that together, Dr Wurie said that the samples were tested abroad and proved traceable to vaccines.

The confirmation comes a day after the health ministry said it was investigating 3 suspected cases of the viral disease.

A ministry of health spokesman earlier told Politico that 3 cases of what appeared to be acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) were being investigated.

AFP is a clinical syndrome that refers to a collection of signs and symptoms that experts say could be the result of one of many causes, including the poliovirus infection.

Harold Thomas, Communications Lead in the Directorate of Health Security and Emergency (DHSE) in the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS), said a Rapid Response Team from the ministry was deployed on the ground in the 3 districts to conduct case investigations, while samples from the cases were sent to Abidjan in Cote d'Ivoire for analysis and confirmation at the Institute Pasteur, one of 2 World Health Organization (WHO) certified laboratories in the sub-region with the capacity to confirm a test for polio infection.

The WHO Africa region was declared free of wild poliovirus on [25 Aug 2020]. That meant that 5 of the 6 WHO regions -- representing over 90% of the world's population -- were free of the wild poliovirus, moving the world closer to achieving global polio eradication. It also meant that, up to date, only 2 countries worldwide continue to see wild poliovirus transmission: Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Nigeria was the last African country to have recorded a polio case [wild poliovirus] in 2016.

Sierra Leone recorded its last case of polio in 2010.

[Reviewing the information available, it appears as though these are the 1st vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV) cases reported by Sierra Leone (ever), with the last identification of a wild poliovirus associated case in 2010. (see http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WPV_2000_2011_11Jan.pdf and http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/global-wild-poliovirus-2013-2018-20190102.pdf).

With confirmation that these cases are related to VDPVs, Sierra Leone is now the 20th African country with cases of VDPV confirmed in 2020.

Information on distribution of cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) by year, country, and type of cVDPV (type 1, 2 or 3) can be parsed from the references below and links to charts and graphs.

Information that is not available but currently presumed is that the 3 cases are due to infection with a cVDPV, type presently not defined.

ProMED would greatly appreciate receiving information on the genetic profiles of the involved viruses. Are they 3 different viruses, or are they related to the same outbreak, and are they related to ongoing transmission/outbreaks in other countries experiencing cVDPV outbreaks.
