Brain parasite caused sea otter deaths
--------------------------------------
Most of a startling number of sea otters found sick or dead on the Central
California coast last month [April 2004] were infected with a deadly brain
parasite, state scientists said on Thursday.
In April, 62 southern sea otters were found stranded alive or dead near
Morro Bay and Pismo Beach. That's about 3 times the 10 year average and
more than the previous record of 48 stranded or dead otters reported a year
earlier. After examining the animals, researchers determined most were
infected with a parasite called _Sarcocystis neurona_ and suffered brain
inflammation, according to the state Department of Fish and Game.
The parasite originates in the feces of opossum -- a small marsupial not
native to California -- and is known to cause brain damage. Researchers are
unclear how the otters came into contact with the feces. Sea otter deaths
attributed to _Sarcocystis neurona_ have been reported before, but not in a
localized cluster, researchers said.
Researchers previously suspected that a naturally occurring toxin found in
algae were behind last month's otter deaths. They now believe only a few of
the otters were killed or sickened by the toxin.
The southern sea otter is listed as a threatened species by the federal
government. A 2003 count estimated the population at 2505, and their
numbers appear to be holding steady.
