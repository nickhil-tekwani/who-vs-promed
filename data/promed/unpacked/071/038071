["Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of which can infect sheep and goats. Although most of the strains examined cause more severe clinical disease in either sheep or goats, some strains have been isolated that are equally pathogenic in both species.

"Sheep pox virus (SPPV) and goat pox virus (GTPV) are the causative agents of sheep pox and goat pox, and with lumpy skin disease virus make up the genus _Capripoxvirus_ in the family Poxviridae. Sheep pox and goat pox are endemic in Africa north of the Equator, the Middle East and Asia, while some parts of Europe have experienced outbreaks recently. Countries that reported outbreaks of the disease between 2010 and 2015 include Bulgaria, Chinese Taipei, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Morocco, Greece, and Russia, with Greece, Israel, and Russia having experienced recurring incidences." (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.13_S_POX_G_POX.pdf)

"These diseases may be mild in indigenous breeds living in endemic areas, but they are often fatal in newly introduced animals. Economic losses result from decreased milk production, damage to the quality of hides and wool, and other production losses. Sheep pox and goat pox can limit trade, inhibit the development of intensive livestock production, and prevent new breeds of sheep or goats from being imported into endemic regions."
