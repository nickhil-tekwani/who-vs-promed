New reports of trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) from Serengeti
----------------------------------------------
TropNetEurop has during the last 2 weeks received several reports of
patients with African trypanosomiasis who have been visiting the Serengeti
National Park and other parks in Tanzania.
Patients 1 and 2.
1) Centro per le Malattie Tropicali, Ospedale S. Cuore, Negrar (Verona),
Italy: After decades of absence, _T. rhodesiense_ in tourists has
reappeared in Italy (twice in 15 days, in 2 different hospitals). The
second case (treated by Dr. Lucio Bonazzi, Head, Dept. of Inf. Dis.,
Hospital of Reggio Emilia) is very serious, with a picture of DIC and MOF
and a very high parasitaemia (5-6 forms per slide field in thin film!). The
patients had visited the following parks in Kenya and Tanzania: Tsavo,
Magnara, NgoroNgoro and Serengeti. They are both being treated with
pentamidine as suramin is unavailable. The other patient apparently [had
also visited Tanzania.
Patient 3.
Paul McWhinney, Infection and Tropical Medicine, Bradford Royal Infirmary,
Bradford, UK: A 44 year-old woman went independently to Kenya & Tanzania
with her husband. She arrived in Nairobi 30 Jan 2001, and she returned to
the UK on 14 Feb 2001. She developed a 'lesion' on her leg on 16 Feb 2001
and became unwell 17 Feb 2001. After some treatment for 'cellulitis' she
was seen at her local hospital. A repeat blood film showed trypanosomes and
she was referred to Leeds, where she was treated with suramin. She has a
weak positive IgM for _T. bruceii_. She had abnormal LFT, low platelets and
WCC [white cell count? and slightly deranged clotting. No other pathogens
have [been identified. She is now doing well.
Itinerary: For first week of stay [the patient visited game parks:
Nairobi, Amboseli, Lake Manyara, Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater, Nairobi.
Then, [she spent the rest of [the holiday on [the coast at Malindi.
Patient 4.
Department of Medicine, Unit of Infectious Diseases, Karolisnka Hospital,
Stockholm, Sweden: We have admitted a patient with _T. rhodesiense_, a
41-year-old Swedish man. He is a biologist but also working for a Swedish
travel agency. Together with 2 tourists from Stockholm he spent around one
week in Serengeti/Tarangire. They started with one night near Lake Manyara
3-4 Mar 2001, then 2 days tenting in the Ikoma camp just outside Serengeti
4-6 Mar 2001(near the western corridor) and made several tours into the
park, then continued to Ngoro-ngoro for 2 days and finished with one day in
Tarangire park 8-9 Mar 2001. Especially in the Ikoma camp they had several
tse-tse bites but some also while in Tarangire and maybe also near Lake
Manyara. We have started therapy with suramine, so far the patient is doing
quite well.
Patient 5.
4) Johannesburg. We have recently admitted a patient with African
trypanosomiasis from
Serengeti - 68yrs, renal failure, acidosis, DIC, severe jaundice, still in
ICU.

[Many thanks to TropNetEurop for alerting ProMED-mail to these 5 cases.
There has been no news about trypanosomiasis in Western Tanzania since our
postings in October, 2000. At that time we urged anyone with patients among
tourist and travellers to report these cases, and it seems that there
probably is an increased risk of contracting sleeping sickness in these
areas at present. There is a large outbreak of trypanosomiasis in the Congo
(former Zaire) which may be linked to an increased activity of the disease
in Western Tanzania. Any data from national surveillance or the WHO would
be appreciated. - Mod.EP
