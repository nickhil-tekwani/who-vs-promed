Tioman Virus, Characterisation of a New Paramyxovirus from Malaysian Bats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collaboration between the University of Malaya and the CSIRO Australian
Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) has led to the characterisation of a new
paramyxovirus discovered in Malaysia. Tioman virus, named after a small
island off the east coast of the Malayan Peninsula where it was collected,
has been characterised as a [member of the genus _Rubulavirus_, of the
family _Paramyxoviridae_. It has been established that Tioman virus is
related to another virus first identified in Australia in 1997, called
Menangle virus.
Dr Chua Kaw Bing, from the Medical Microbiology Department of the University
of Malaya, explains that Tioman virus was discovered in the course of
searching for the animal host of yet another paramyxovirus, Nipah virus.
Last year, Nipah virus killed 105 people and led to the culling of millions
of pigs in Malaysia. "We suspected that bats were the animal host of Nipah
virus, as many bats had antibodies to the virus. I was able to collect urine
samples from bats and successfully isolated Nipah virus, proving the link. I
also found this related virus, also new to science, in the bat urine," Dr
Chua says.
Dr Chua spent 6 months at AAHL earlier this year, working closely with Dr
Bryan Eaton and Dr Lin-Fa Wang. The entire virus genome (approximately 15.4
kb) of Tioman virus has now been mapped and the complete gene sequence
determined. Tioman virus shares up to 80 per cent of its genetic information
with its Australian relative, Menangle virus. It is also 50-60 per cent
homologous in key protein sequences with a better known rubulavirus, human
mumps virus. The geographic distribution of Tioman virus in bats is as yet
unknown. There have been no recorded outbreaks of disease [associated with
Tioman virus in bats or any other species. "However it would not be
surprising if it did cause disease in some species, given what we know about
related viruses," says Dr Wang.
"The web of relationships between newly emerged viruses in our region is
scientifically a fascinating story. First Hendra virus was discovered in
Queensland in 1994, then Nipah virus, which is closely related, emerged in
Malaysia in 1999. In 1997, Menangle virus was identified in New South Wales,
and now we have a close relative for Menangle virus in Malaysia." AAHL's Dr
Bryan Eaton says on a practical level the grouping of related viruses poses
a diagnostic challenge. "Test reagents which are specific to the group can
be useful, but we now need to ensure we have reagents which are specific to
each virus and won't cross react," Dr Eaton says. (Contact Dr Wang

[The molecular characterisiation of this virus is a significant development.
Although the newly named Tioman virus has not yet been associated with any
human or animal disease, each of the other 3 paramyxoviruses recently
discovered in South East Asia and Australasia has disease-producing
potential. Nipah and Hendra viruses are related and differ from previously
known paramyxoviruses by the larger size of their genomes. Menangle and
Tioman viruses, on the other hand, appear to be members of the genus
_Rubulavirus_, a long-established genus of the family _Paramyxoviridae_
which includes human mumps virus, a number of avian parainfluenza viruses,
human parainfluenza viruses types 2 and 4, and porcine rubulavirus.
Curiously, most if not all of the new paramyxoviruses found in South East
Asia are associated with migratory bats and pigs. - Mod.CP
