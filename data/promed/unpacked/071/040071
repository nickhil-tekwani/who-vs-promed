So far, no studies other than visual inspections
had been done on citrus viruses occurring in
Sudan. In Sudan, most citrus are grafted on sour
orange rootstocks, which are susceptible to
Citrus tristeza closterovirus (CTV - EPPO A2
list). A survey on citrus viruses was initiated
in 2003 and 2004. Symptomatic leaves were
collected and tested by immunoprinting and nested
RT-PCR. CTV was detected in 13 leaf samples using
a mixture of specific monoclonal antibodies. 10
samples had been collected from orchards of
orange trees (_Citrus sinensis_), 2 samples came
from a mandarin (_C. reticulata_) and 1 from a
lime tree (_C. aurantifolia_). The presence of
CTV was confirmed by nested RT-PCR in 4 citrus
trees (3 orange and 1 lime tree), which had
previously given positive results with
immunoprinting. Further molecular tests will be
carried out to verify the presence of CTV in
other citrus orchards in Sudan. According to the
EPPO Secretariat, this is the first report of CTV in Sudan.
The situation of Citrus tristeza closterovirus in
Sudan can be described as follows: Present,
detected for the first time in 2003/2004 on few
samples, further studies are underway to confirm its occurrence.

[2] Citrus tristeza virus, Jordan

In Jordan, citrus are mainly grown in the Jordan
Valley. The most important species are sweet
orange (_Citrus sinensis_), mandarins (_C.
reticulata_), lemon (_C. limon_) and grapefruit
(_C. paradisi_). Approximately 98 percent of
these species are grafted onto sour orange
rootstocks (_C. aurantium_), which are
susceptible to tristeza. In the last few years,
symptoms resembling those caused by CTV,
including severe tree decline, yellowing and
stunting have been observed in various orchards
of the Jordan Valley. A survey was conducted in
2002 and 2003 on the possible presence of Citrus
tristeza closterovirus (CTV - EPPO A2 list). More
than 3000 trees in 62 orchards distributed in the
central and northern parts of the Jordan Valley
were individually inspected for symptoms. Leaf
samples (in total 844) were collected in autumn
and winter from symptomatic trees and tested
(serological and molecular tests). Results showed
that 12.7 percent and 15.2 percent of the samples from the cen!
tral and Northern Jordan Valley, respectively,
were infected by CTV. In addition, 100 leaf
samples were collected from an orchard in the Dir
Alla area (Central Jordan Valley) where severe
symptoms were observed, and 49 percent of them
tested positive for CTV. This study confirms the
presence of CTV in the major citrus-growing
regions of Jordan. It is stressed that this
represents a serious risk to the Jordanian citrus
industry. It is considered that epidemiological
studies are urgently needed to determine which
CTV strains and insect vectors are occurring in
Jordan. It is also stressed that certification
schemes and appropriate phytosanitary measures should be implemented.
The situation of Citrus tristeza closterovirus in
Jordan can be described as follows: Present, a
survey done in 2002/2003 has confirmed its presence in the Jordan Valley.

[The citrus crop plants sweet orange (_Citrus
sinensis_), mandarin (_C. reticulata_) and lime
(_C. aurantifolia_) can develop disease symptoms
when infected by citrus tristeza virus (family:
Closteroviridae, genus Closterovirus,
CTV). Symptoms may depend on the rootstock used,
and when sour orange (_C. aurantium_) is the
rootstock, the disease quick decline will develop
in sweet orange, leading to tree death. Stem
pitting, stunting or yellowing are symptoms in
scions that are not as dependent on rootstock but
their development depends on the strain of the
virus and the variety or type of citrus. There
are many strains of CTV and many isolates are
mixtures of strains and this complexity
influences disease symptoms. Some strains are
mild when tolerant rootstocks are used. The
introduction and spread (by aphids) of CTV in any
country normally results in the need for a
budwood certification and clean stock programs to
ensure groves are planted with virus tested
plants. Sudan and Jordan will now be faced with
this issue. The previous postings on CTV (see
also:) point to the widespread distribution of
this virus in the Mediterranean region and N.
Africa. CTV is found throughout the world where
citrus is grown and is considered one of the
major pathogens of citrus especially where
tolerant rootstocks are not commonly used. The
moderatorï¿½s comments in [20051108.3274] and the
other postings are worth reading for further background.
