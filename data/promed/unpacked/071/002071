Four cases of bird flu detected in Quebec farms
------------------------------------------------
The avian flu is beginning to infiltrate Quebec farms, reported at 4 separate sites in less than a week.

On Sunday [17 Apr 2022], Canada's food inspection agency (CFIA) confirmed detection of the H5N1 strain at a poultry flock in Les Sources, a municipality in Quebec's Estrie region.

Bird flu was also detected in the Brome-Missisquoi, Hait-Saint-Francois and Val-Saint-Francois regions last week.

"The infected sites have been placed under quarantine," reads the CFIA website. "The CFIA has established movement control measures and is recommending other farms in the area increase biosecurity."

Until [12 Apr 2022], the highly infectious strain had only been identified among wild geese in Quebec, but has evidently made its way into domesticated populations.

H5N1 can do serious damage to poultry farms, leading to high mortality rates.

Its risks are far less severe for humans, although experts advise anyone infected to seek immediate medical care. "There are things you can do to help, including the early use of antiviral medication and support in an intensive care unit," explains McGill infectious diseases expert Dr. Raymond Tellier.

Quebec's wildlife ministry has urged the public not to handle live or dead wild birds to prevent the spread.

The virus has been circulating in Europe since 2020 and in Canada since December 2021.

Two new bird flu outbreaks bring Ontario total to 16
----------------------------------------------------
A new strain of bird flu has spread to 16 Ontario farms and 7 Canadian provinces, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency says. [The CFIA indicates this is not a new strain, but rather H5N1 with additional locations. - Mod.TG]

Another outbreak in the Township of South Glengarry, just west of the Quebec border, as well as 1 in the city of Markham north of Toronto were added to the federal agency's list during the long weekend.

Both outbreaks were confirmed last Thursday (14 Apr 2022).

The federal agency says outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu have been found in poultry flocks in 7 provinces: Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.

The closest outbreaks to London are near Durham in the Municipality of West Grey (confirmed [9 Apr 2022]), Chatham-Kent (confirmed [6 Apr 2022]) and near Thamesford in western Oxford County (confirmed [28 Mar 2022]).

Control zones have been set up around each property, so officials can monitor movement of people and birds.

Craig Price, in charge of Ottawa's response to the outbreaks, wouldn't say how many birds have been destroyed at specific farms in order to protect the identities of the farmers involved.

Turkeys and ducks were infected in some of the initial outbreaks in Ontario, the federal agency says, and outbreaks have occurred at small farms and large operations.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is advising farmers to practise good biosecurity habits to safeguard flocks.

Bird flu is spread by wild birds, and is a significant concern as birds migrate to Canada, the agency has said.

The 1st Ontario outbreak in a poultry flock was confirmed in a turkey flock in Guelph/Eramosa Township on [27 Mar 2022].

In 2015, federal and provincial officials spent months containing and eventually eradicating another strain of bird flu. That outbreak was contained to 3 farms in Oxford County. About 80 000 birds, mostly turkeys, were wiped out.

Bird flu confirmed in additional poultry flocks in Alberta and Saskatchewan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) say avian influenza has been detected in additional poultry flocks in southern Alberta as well as in Saskatchewan.

The agency announced over the weekend the bird flu was identified late last week in flocks in the following areas:
- Mountain View County
- Warner County
- Cardston County
- Rural Municipality of Moose Mountain No. 63, Sask.
- Rural Municipality of Loreburn No. 254, Sask.

According to the CFIA, the H5 strain of avian influenza poses no significant public health concern for healthy humans who are not in regular contact with infected birds.

Zoos across North America, including the Calgary Zoo, have closed their aviaries to visitors and moved birds indoors in an attempt to shield the birds from the virus.

More than 27 million chickens and turkeys on farms in 26 states in the United States have been slaughtered in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus during the outbreak.

Small flock owners in Canada are being encouraged to keep their birds indoors as much as possible during wild bird migration when the risk of exposure to the virus increases.

PA Department of Agriculture confirms 1st case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Lancaster County
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture confirmed the state's 1st positive case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in domestic poultry, in a flock of commercial layer chickens on a Lancaster County poultry farm. A state and federal interagency task force is prepared and initiating a response plan.

While there is no risk to the public, and poultry and eggs are safe to eat if cooked properly, HPAI is highly infectious and can be fatal to domestic birds (chickens, ducks, geese, quail, pheasants, guinea fowl and turkeys).

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) avian influenza detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.

The positive samples were taken from a flock in East Donegal Township, Lancaster County, and tested at the Pennsylvania Veterinary Laboratory. The finding was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. The department has quarantined the farm and all commercial poultry facilities within a 10-kilometer [6.21 mi] radius of the infected flock.

"Protecting Pennsylvania's $7.1 billion poultry industry is a year-round top priority," said PA Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding. "We have strict biosecurity protocols in place both for Pennsylvania farms, and for poultry products shipped in and out of the state. We have had $2 million budgeted and set aside since 2016 to respond to avian influenza, in addition to equipment, supplies, laboratories and highly trained experts who have been on high alert and are supporting our poultry farmers.

"There is no immediate public health concern for Pennsylvanians, and we are prepared to respond to this agricultural issue. However, wild birds carry the virus and do not respect property or state lines," he added. "Anyone visiting a farm should be aware your vehicles and shoes may carry the virus from other places you have walked. Clean them thoroughly and stay away from poultry barns unless you have to be there. Please be vigilant and do your part to protect our farms."

An interagency HPAI task force works regularly to address the threat of disease to Pennsylvania's wild and domestic bird populations. The task force includes the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, the departments of Agriculture, Health, General Services and Environmental Protection, the State Police, the Game Commission, the Air National Guard, and U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's (APHIS) Veterinary Services and Wildlife Services.

The task force will carry out the response plan, which includes education and public outreach, and minimizing risk factors though strict biosecurity measures and continued surveillance, testing, and management.

This is the 1st confirmed case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Pennsylvania in commercial poultry since an outbreak in 1983-84. As of 15 Apr 2022 infected birds in commercial and backyard poultry flocks had been confirmed in 27 states including most states surrounding Pennsylvania.

USDA's website includes a complete listing of confirmed domestic poultry infections as well as those in wild birds. Genetic analysis of samples taken in other U.S. states has shown the virus is being spread by infected wild birds. Wild birds in Pennsylvania were confirmed to be infected in March [2022], including a bald eagle in Chester County and 4 ducks in Venango County.

Pennsylvania's 3 animal health laboratories analyzed nearly 200 000 samples for avian influenza last year [2021]. The laboratories, which make up the Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System, have the capacity to test many more samples, if necessary.

The department has reviewed procedures, inventoried supplies and protective equipment in preparation for HPAI, and has held monthly meetings with poultry producers, veterinarians, USDA officials and other stakeholders monthly, escalating to bi-monthly in February [2022] as infections were detected among migrating wild birds.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is mainly spread through direct contact between healthy birds and bodily waste from infected birds. The disease can cause sudden death without clinical signs; lack of energy and appetite; decreased egg production; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks; purple discoloration of the wattles, combs, and legs; nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, lack of coordination and diarrhea.

If you suspect your poultry is infected with avian influenza, please report your concerns 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services..

Sick or dead wild birds should be reported to the Pennsylvania Game Commission by telephone or <pgc-wildlifehealth@pa.gov>. For more information about avian influenza, visit the department's website, <agriculture.pa.gov>. For a complete listing of confirmed infections in the U.S. and detailed information on biosecurity visit the USDA's website here https://bit.ly/3xOLHpw.

Bird flu found in region
------------------------
Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was detected in a snow goose from Canyon Ferry and a Canada goose from near Belgrade just northwest of Yellowstone National Park last week. The virus was detected earlier this month [April 2022] in domestic poultry in Montana's Judith Basin and Cascade counties. Several more birds from around the state are currently undergoing testing for the highly contagious virus. Idaho is also monitoring an outbreak of avian flu in Caribou County just west of the state line from Star Valley, Wyoming. If sick birds are seen, Jackson Hole Radio Veterinary correspondent Dr. Stephanie Ninnemann says they should be reported to game officials.

Avian influenza virus is a naturally occurring virus in birds. All viruses are classified into 2 groups, based on the severity of disease they cause in infected poultry. Low pathogenic AI viruses generally cause no clinical illness, or only minor signs in birds. However, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) viruses are extremely infectious and fatal to poultry as well as some species of wild birds.

Bird flu hits Montrose County poultry site
------------------------------------------
A 60 000-bird flock at a commercial poultry operation in Montrose County is being euthanized due to an avian flu outbreak there, and a quarantine order has been issued in parts of Montrose and Delta counties to limit movement of poultry and poultry products and try to prevent the disease's spread.

The state Department of Agriculture said in a news release the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed the detection of the Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus at the Montrose operation, which the state didn't identify in its release.

The state said avian flu doesn't pose a food safety risk. It said poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly, and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.

However, it said the HPAI virus has a mortality rate among birds of 90-100% within just a few days, making flock surveillance and disease reporting critical to containing the spread of the virus.

The release said the State Veterinarian's office was notified Friday [15 Apr 2022] of a "mortality event" at a commercial broiler breeder facility in Montrose County. Samples were submitted to the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for preliminary testing, and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed HPAI at the facility Tuesday [19 Apr 2022], leading to the decision to euthanize the flock there.

The quarantine order applies to both commercial and backyard poultry operations in the affected area. It includes an area surrounding Olathe, extending south nearly to Montrose. The order applies to poultry and all other birds, along with their eggs, manure, feed, carcasses, feathers and used poultry equipment.

Under the order, no poultry or poultry products may leave any premises in the quarantine area, or be moved onto any premises in the area, without a movement permit from State Veterinarian Maggie Baldwin or her designee.

Under the order, all poultry and poultry-product producers also must comply with all epidemiological requirements established by Baldwin or her designee.

"We are working with producers in the region to implement measures to protect flocks in close proximity to the infected premises," Baldwin said in the news release. "Avian influenza has a high mortality rate and flock owners should actively monitor their birds for clinical signs of HPAI, such as ruffled feathers or swelling and purple discoloration of the comb, wattles, eyelids and legs. Anyone who notices any signs of illness or disease in their flocks should immediately notify the State Veterinarian's office."

Other signs of HPAI include sudden death without clinical signs, lack of energy or appetite, decreased egg production, soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, incoordination and diarrhea.

According to a federal Department of Agriculture website, as of Wednesday [20 Apr 2022], HPAI has been confirmed this year [2022] in commercial and backyard flocks in 29 states. It has been found in 138 commercial flocks and 75 backyard flocks, affecting nearly 29 million birds.

On [9 Apr 2022] the federal Department of Agriculture reported the 1st case this year [2022] in Colorado, in a noncommercial flock in Pitkin County.

The federal government says the disease can infect poultry, such as chickens and turkeys, and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds.

The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service "to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response," the federal Department of Agriculture said in its news release announcing the Pitkin County case. "APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities."

The state Department of Agriculture is advising poultry owners across the state to review and increase their biosecurity measures.

More information on doing so may be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov. Any illness or death in flocks should be immediately reported to the State Veterinarian's office, and dead birds should be double-bagged and refrigerated away from human food or other avian products, for possible testing.

Additional resources for bird owners may be found at <ag.colorado.gov/hpai>, where confirmed cases also can be tracked. A map at the site also shows confirmed HPAI cases in a few eastern Colorado counties, all involving wild birds.

According to the state Department of Agriculture, anyone finding 3 or more dead wild birds in a specific area within a 2-week period or seeing live birds with signs of disease should contact their local Colorado Parks and Wildlife office. Anyone with sick birds or birds that have died from unknown causes also can get help at the Colorado Avian Health Call Line at CSU.

Bird owners struggling with stress or anxiety related to HPAI can call the Colorado Crisis Services or text TALK to 38255. Farmers and ranchers can receive a voucher for 6 free sessions through the Colorado Agricultural Addiction and Mental Health Program.

[This virus is spreading rapidly across the continent. It is devastating to the flocks it affects, and has a profound impact on producers, state and federal personnel, and especially on the affected birds.

This virus demands we all take extreme precautions to protect the birds, and to be extremely vigilant regarding biosecurity. Biosecurity is not a word but it must become a regimented habit to protect your birds without any shortcuts. If you practice the same routine on entering a poultry house and exiting a poultry house, disinfecting vehicle tires, not allowing extra people, etc. onto the premises and protecting your birds from any wild birds, you can help diminish the risk to your birds.

Our domestic birds simply do not have defenses against this virus, while wild birds are not affected by it. Regardless of the size of your operation, or the number of bird pets you have, moving them inside is the best measure to try and help protect them. - Mod.TG
