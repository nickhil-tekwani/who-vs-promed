A sheep and goat plague (also called peste des petits ruminants [PPR]) has killed 3337 goats in Burundi, the East African Community's (EAC) latest report shows. The plague is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The virus can infect up to 90% of an animal herd and kill between 30% and 70% of infected animals.

Some of the goats killed were among 5438 distributed by the government to farmers, as part of the Lake Victoria Environment Management Project II financed by the World Bank. The report says the death of the imported male goats hinted a possible breach in vaccination protocols in Uganda, where they were sourced. However, experts from the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] note that the presence of the disease in Burundi before the large outbreak could not be ruled out [see comment].

Besides this plague, the region has of late been beset by many transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases such as Rift Valley fever and the fall armyworm (FAW; _Spodoptera frugiperda_, an insect damaging crops, particularly maize); however, there is no mechanism for harmonising control strategies and coordinating interventions with neighbouring partner states.

"EAC partner states need to work together to address transboundary diseases and pest threats," a report of Permanent Secretaries to the EAC Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security suggests. In February [2018], the World Bank conducted a mission alongside the FAO and OIE to collect information and identify technical and financial options to support the government of Burundi. On 2 Mar 2018, the World Bank approved a USD 2.8 million emergency response mechanism through the Contingency Emergency Response Component of the Great Lakes Regional Integrated Agriculture Development programme. By 30 May [2018], more than 3 million goats and sheep, the country's entire stock of small ruminants, were vaccinated [likely, against PPR].

[When Burundi submitted to the OIE its immediate notification of a PPR outbreak (the 1st outbreak, in the central-situated Gitega province) on 11 Jan 2018, the start of the outbreak was given as 1 Jan 2018 and the reason for notification -- "First occurrence of a listed disease in the country." In Burundi's earlier annual reports, PPR was included in the list of diseases that were not reported during the addressed year (and not as "never reported"). The quoted view of FAO and OIE experts "that the presence of the disease in Burundi before the large outbreak could not be ruled out" is rather plausible. According to the 2017 annual reports from Burundi's neighbouring countries, in Rwanda PPR was referred to as "suspected (not confirmed)"; in Tanzania, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, PPR was "present".

Links to Burundi's immediate OIE notification (posted in 20180113.5555369), to the 6 follow-up reports, and to an interactive map presenting their locations throughout the country, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=25644.

According to the most recent (no. 6) follow-up report submitted, the accumulated PPR statistics, as of 6 Aug 2018, were the following:

Total outbreaks = 8 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sheep and goats / 128 855 / 7458 / 3838 / 0 / 0

It would be interesting to note if any new PPR outbreaks have been observed in Burundi since 6 Aug 2018.

The information on mass vaccination covering the entire small ruminant population by 30 May 2028 is encouraging indeed. According to OIE's data, this population included, in 2017, about 1.752 million goats and 0.208 million sheep.

The OIE and the FAO, in their joint strategy (see http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/gsce/) for control and eradication of PPR, have set the goal of eradicating the disease by 2030.
