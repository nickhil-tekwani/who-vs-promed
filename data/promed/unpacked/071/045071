The CDC is investigating, along with the help of local public health officials, a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium associated with small pet turtles. This particular _Salmonella_ Typhimurium outbreak, associated specifically with small pet turtles with shells less than 4 inches, began in July 2019 and is ongoing. The CDC states that this investigation is different than the October 2019 outbreak.

Public health officials are aiding investigations by using the PulseNet system, which is the CDC-coordinated national database laboratory, to best understand the source of this outbreak. The reported cases of illness range from 29 Jul 2019 to 3 Dec 2019, with a total of 34 people reporting illness from this strain of _Salmonella_. Eleven patients had to be hospitalized, and children ages 12 years and under make up about 65% of the identified victims.

The 9 states that have been linked to this epidemic are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas and Utah, with the most cases (18 total) in California.

There is a federal ban on the sale and distribution of small turtles with shells less than 4 inches as pets, and yet these reptiles can still be found for sale. According to the CDC, all turtles, regardless of the size, can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria in their droppings that can spread to the turtle's body and the habitat in which it lives, making it easy to transfer _Salmonella_ bacteria to the pet owner.

_Salmonella_ Typhimurium is a relatively common strain of the bacterium that presents with symptoms including diarrhea, stomach cramping, and fever. Most people with a healthy immune system recover within a week without treatment; however, hospitalization may be required with more serious cases.

The CDC outlines important safety procedures for anyone who owns a pet turtle or comes into contact with one. This includes proper hand washing after handling a turtle as well as cleaning the tank habitat. Also, it is important to not let pet turtles out of their tank habitat; roaming turtles could potentially spread bacteria.

[In 2008, the CDC reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC. _Salmonella_ infections associated with exposure to turtles -- USA, 2007-2008. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2008; 57(03):69-72; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm). Some of the discussion of the report is reproduced below:

"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23% of _Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: Small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA increased 86% to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets.

"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90% (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes _Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate _Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7, 8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might re-contaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).

"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6% of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry _Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting _Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2, 10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20% of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis."
