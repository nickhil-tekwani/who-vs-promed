[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe
Date: Thu 22 Jan 2009

The main impact of Zimbabwe's cholera epidemic has shifted from urban
areas to rural areas, making its containment much harder, a medical
charity says. Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF] told the BBC that the
disease was spreading to remote areas, while cases in some urban
areas, like Harare, were decreasing.

The rainy season could lead to even more infections, as water sources
become contaminated, aid workers warn. MSF Zimbabwe representative
Manuel Lopez said that small villages off the main roads were now
being affected following the Christmas holidays [2008], when urban
residents went home.

[3] Gastroenteritis, fatal - Nigeria (Ebonyi)

An outbreak of a disease suspected to be gastroenteritis has claimed
an unofficial figure of 15 lives in Ndiagu-Amagu village in Ikwo
Local Government Area of Ebonyi this month [January 2009], the News
Agency of Nigeria reported on Thursday [22 Jan 2009].

Sunday Nwangele, state commissioner for health announced in Abakaliki
that 6 of the dead were male and 9 female including 5 children. He
attributed the outbreak, which infected some 120 persons, to intake
of contaminated water following the breakdown of the three boreholes
in the area.

Local media last week [week of 12 Jan 2009] reported that at least 41
children died of gastroenteritis in another community in southeastern
Nigeria's Ebonyi State [which was referred to as cholera in one
report - Mod.LL]. The disease was said to have started some weeks ago
and to have gradually grown into epidemic with children between one
to 10 being the mostly affected, with some in critical condition.

[4] Dysentery - Sudan (Lakes State)
Date: Fri 16 Jan 2009 15:21:16 +0100 (CET)
From: Ruth Jonathan <ruthjonathan@xs4all.nl>


We have seen quite a few cases with dysentery in Rumbek, Rumbek State
Hospital, South Sudan recently. Patients were sick with fever and
abdominal pain.

With antibiotic treatment they seem to recover well after some days,
however it has caused quite a few premature deliveries in pregnant
women, with their babies dying from prematurity. Unfortunately there
is no possibility to do culture or sensitivity analysis.
