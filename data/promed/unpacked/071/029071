Ukraine Reports Outbreak of Anthrax
-----------------------------------
KIEV: Several anthrax cases have been reported recently across Ukraine and
dozens of people have been hospitalized, Ukraine's Emergency Situation
Ministry said on Friday.
A farm worker from the village of Novopetrivka in the southeastern
Zaporizhia region was hospitalized with anthrax on Monday, and a
veterinarian, who had contact with the infected animal carcass, was rushed
to hospital Thursday, the Emergency Situation Ministry said in a statement.
The statement said that sanitary officials registered a second anthrax case
in the western Rivne region several days ago, with one farmer hospitalized
and dozens of infected animals killed.
In early August, an anthrax outbreak at a farm in Kiev killed dozens of
cows and 3 horses, and put 8 people into a hospital. While 7 persons have
been diagnosed with "skin anthrax," the last remaining person is still
under observation.
Ukraine's sanitary officials have tightened control over the affected zones
and meat markets in a bid to avoid further spreading of the epidemic.
