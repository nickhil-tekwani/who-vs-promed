Corposalud (the National Health Corporation) in Tachira, Venezuela, which
is a border province with Colombia, has registered 5 cases of yellow fever,
3 of them fatal, in 2004. Another, suspected, fatal case is awaiting
laboratory confirmation. It was a 37-year-old man, an agricultural
laborer from Colombian who came to neighboring Apure province 2 months
ago, and was hospitalized with ictero-hemorrhagic syndrome (fever, jaundice
& bleeding) on 1 Sep 2004. Autopsy showed bacterial infection, but
specimens have nevertheless been sent for YF testing.
Ministry of Health statistics show 23 cases, including 15 deaths [another
report gives 21 cases with 15 deaths. ­ Mod.JW]; PAHO notes that 8 of the
23 cases were infected in Colombia but fell ill in Venezuela [presumably
referring to the country office of PAHO in Caracas. - Mod.JW].
Travelers to Tachira & Zulia provinces are being vaccinated against YF, as
are children older than 1 year throughout the country. The ministry plans
to vaccinate 1 million people in townships along the Colombian border, and
endemic areas such as Anzoategui, Monagas, south Guarico & part of Cojedes,
extending vaccination to the provincial capitals of San Cristobal, Merida
& parts of Maracaibo from November 2004. In 2005 it is planned to vaccinate
all adults in the capital, Caracas, as part of a control strategy. 6.5
million doses of the vaccine are available, and 1 million more are being
purchased through the PAHO rotating fund.

[Venezuela is to be congratulated on extending mass vaccination throughout
the country to prevent the spread of YF to urban centers. These cases need
to be reported to WHO/PAHO, which did not report any cases from Venezuela
in their last update of 24 Jun 2004 ­ see last ref. below. ­ Mod.JW]
