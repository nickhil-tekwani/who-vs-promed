All 4 children who died after being administered measles vaccine in
Tamil Nadu on [23 Apr 2008] suffered severe brain haemorrhage
resulting from an anaphylactic shock, an inquiry has found.

This will be pointed out by the 5-member expert team sent by the
health ministry to investigate the deaths, when they submit their
initial report to health minister A Ramadoss on Monday [28 Apr 2008].
Experts in the team said an anaphylactic shock -- a severe,
potentially lethal systemic allergic reaction -- following a measles
vaccination is highly rare and occurs in 1 out of every 10 lakh [1
000 000] cases.

Experts in the team said that anaphylactic shock killing all 4
children -- within half-an-hour of being administered the vaccine
around the same area -- pointed to 2 likely reasons of why the deaths
occurred -- a human error resulting in mixing the freeze-dried
vaccine with a different chemical in place of saline water or a
contaminated vaccine containing a foreign protein or a bacterium
because of being kept in the open for more than 3 hours after being
reconstituted. A central team member who returned from Chennai on
Friday [25 Apr 2008] after investigations, however, confirmed that
the public health centre's cold chain system, which was used to store
the vaccines, was not at fault.

Putting to rest allegations that the nurses may have used the same
syringe to vaccinate the 3 children after dipping it in chemicals
like adrenalin or muscle relaxants, the team found that individual
syringes were used. The expert told TOI [The Times of India], "There
was no conflict between what the nurses, anganwadi [a government
sponsored child-care and mother-care service] workers, and family
members of children who died told us. The cold chain system was fine.
Police reports also showed that individual syringes were used.
However, the government hospital which carried out the post-mortem
found all died of haemorrhage, which is strange."

The Central Drug Laboratory, meanwhile, started testing 20 samples of
the vaccine from the same batch that killed the children -- 10 each
collected from the fatal site in Tiruvallur and those lying with
Human Biologicals Institute [HBI] in Hyderabad. Worried about HBI's
good manufacturing standards, the health ministry is now dispatching
a 3-member team to HBI on Tuesday [29 Apr 2008] to check the measles
vaccine production unit.

"HBI is a pre-qualified WHO (World Health Organisation) unit.
However, we need to be sure that it is following good manufacturing
standards set by WHO and the government of India. The team will
inspect the vaccine production area, check raw materials being used,
and inspect its quality control measures," a health ministry official said.

He added, "This case is really intriguing. A single child can be
sensitive to the vaccine and suffer from an anaphylactic shock. But
how can it occur on 3 children, one after another, after being
administered the vaccine from a single vial. On the other hand,
records show that 230 doses of the same vaccine batch were used in
the same PHC [primary health centre] that day but no other deaths
were recorded."

The fatal vaccine batch was manufactured in February 2008 with expiry
date of January 2010. Out of about 2.5 lakh [250 000] doses of
vaccine manufactured, 1.45 lakh [145 000] doses were supplied to
Tamil Nadu. The rest were sent to 9 other states. "Around 20 000
doses of the vaccine from the same batch were used between 4 and 23
Apr [2008] without a single death. Over 230 children were vaccinated
across 7 villages on 23 Apr [2008] but no serious adverse reaction
was detected," an official said.

[The attribution of the deaths of the 4 children to anaphylactic
shock in response to an unidentified contaminant in a single vaccine
vial is difficult to sustain in view of the circumstance that the
death of the 4th child occurred at a different site. Furthermore, the
occurrence of severe and immediate brain haemorrhage would be an
unusual consequence of anaphylactic shock

So far the investigation has established that "the cold chain" had
not been disrupted and that single-use syringes had been employed for
vaccination. The most likely explanation may be that a so far
unidentified contaminant present in a few vials of the vaccine or its
diluent may have been responsible for these deaths. Information on
the course and outcome of the continuing investigation would be welcomed.
