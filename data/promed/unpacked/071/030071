ProMED-mail replied offlist: "Re your useful comments to ProMED, you should contact BioDiaspora which does exactly that -- track population movements in relation to epidemics http://www.biodiaspora.com/contact.html."]

David answered:
"Thanks. I was aware of BioDiaspora since the NEJM article during the 2009 pandemic. There is an area where the international movements link with domestic movement patterns and community exposures that possibly needs some developmental attention as well, because this interface zone will probably be the most productive area for implementation of interventions at the pre-departure and post-arrival ends of travel chains to mitigate more effectively.

Really what I was alluding to was trying to get the movement dynamics and the epidemic case reporting onto the same page for more intuitive risk assessment/risk management support."

Public Health Surveillance and Infectious Disease Detection

Abstract
--------
Emerging infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and pandemic influenza, and the anthrax attacks of 2001, have demonstrated that we remain vulnerable to health threats caused by infectious diseases. The importance of strengthening global public health surveillance to provide early warning has been the primary recommendation of expert groups for at least the past 2 decades. However, despite improvements in the past decade, public health surveillance capabilities remain limited and fragmented, with uneven global coverage.

Recent initiatives provide hope of addressing this issue, and new technological and conceptual advances could, for the 1st time, place capability for global surveillance within reach. Such advances include the revised International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) and the use of new data sources and methods to improve global coverage, sensitivity, and timeliness, which show promise for providing capabilities to extend and complement the existing infrastructure. One example is syndromic surveillance, using nontraditional and often automated data sources. Over the past 20 years, other initiatives, including ProMED-mail, GPHIN [Global Public Health Intelligence Network], and HealthMap, have demonstrated new mechanisms for acquiring surveillance data.

In 2009 the US Agency for International Development (USAID) began the Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program, which includes the PREDICT project, to build global capacity for surveillance of novel infections that have pandemic potential (originating in wildlife and at the animal-human interface) and to develop a framework for risk assessment.

Improved understanding of factors driving infectious disease emergence and new technological capabilities in modeling, diagnostics, and pathogen identification, and communications, such as using the increasing global coverage of cell phones for public health surveillance, can further enhance global surveillance
