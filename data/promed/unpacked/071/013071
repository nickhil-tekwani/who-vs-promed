A person who attended a fraternity party in East Lansing on Saturday [22 Jan 2020] has tested positive for bacterial meningitis. Health officials are urging everyone who attended the event to be treated with an antibiotic.

The person who tested positive is a University of Michigan student who went to a ticketed event hosted by Sigma Beta Rho at Club Rush, 131 Albert Ave., the Ingham County Health Department [ICHD] and Michigan State University [MSU] said in a news release. "Based on the public health investigation by ICHD and MSU, all individuals present at this event and during this time frame are considered potential close contacts to the case of meningococcal meningitis," officials said in the release.

"All potential close contacts should receive prophylaxis in the form of antibiotic treatment to prevent the disease. This antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended regardless of meningococcal vaccination status and is given in the form of a single oral tablet." The medications include ciprofloxacin and rifampin. Close contacts should receive the antibiotic within 14 days of exposure, they said.

Antibiotics will be available for free to potential close contacts from 1 pm to 5 pm Friday and Saturday [28-29 Jan 2022] at clinics in the MSU Room on the 3rd floor of the MSU Union Building, officials said. People should enter the building from the entrance off Abbot Road and use the stairs to the 3rd floor. Parking will be available in Ramp 6 off of Grand River Avenue.

Anyone who can't attend the clinic is asked to contact their health provider to be treated with a prophylaxis. Otherwise, they can call the county health department to discuss how they can get a prescription. The contact numbers are (517) 887-4308 or (517) 342-9987 (after regular business hours).

"Early treatment for close contact will aid us in containing further spread," Ingham County Medical Director Dr. Adenike Shoyinka said in the news release, adding that no MSU students had reported symptoms suggesting they are infected.

Meningococcal meningitis is a rare but serious disease that causes swelling of the membranes around the spinal cord and brain. It is caused by the bacteria _Neisseria meningitidis_. It can be spread through coughing or sneezing, kissing, or eating or drinking from shared utensils, cups or bottles. It can also be caught by staying in a crowded space with poor ventilation for "a prolonged period," officials said.

Symptoms typically appear after one to 10 days of exposure and can include fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, rash or confusion. Anyone who experiences symptoms should see a doctor immediately, officials said.

"As soon as the infectious disease was suspected, our public health teams began working closely with campus partners, the Washtenaw County Health Department and University of Michigan officials to identify and reach out to those individuals who may have been in close contact with the identified case and could potentially be at risk," MSU Physician Dave Weismantel said. "Bacterial meningitis is rare and not easily transmissible, and we believe there is limited risk to our campus at this time."

People who might have been exposed should check their vaccination record to be sure they received a meningococcal disease vaccine or seek to get vaccinated if they are eligible, officials said. Vaccination guidelines are available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website. The county health department's immunization clinic can be reached at (517) 887-4316.

[Meningococcal meningitis is caused by bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_, which is spread person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions at close and prolonged contact (for example, coughing or kissing). People at increased risk of meningococcal disease include household members and roommates of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _Neisseria meningitidis_ as soon as possible.

Ciprofloxacin has been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal disease began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the US CDC recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (selected US counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Ceftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).

The CDC meningococcal outbreak guidance can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf. The relevant portion of the guidance is extracted below:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.3 Outbreak thresholds
-----------------------
"The purpose of declaring an outbreak is to determine when appropriate public health interventions should be considered. In contrast to previous guidance in which a threshold of 3 cases of the same serogroup with an attack rate of more than 10 cases per 100 000 population during a 3-month period was used to define both organization- and community-based outbreaks, the current guidance does not recommend the use of an absolute threshold. However, the following thresholds can be considered as guidance, with considerable flexibility to account for the unique nature of each meningococcal disease outbreak.

"For organizations, 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within a 3-month period is considered to be an outbreak (Box 4 -- see below). In most situations, 2 cases within an organization constitute an outbreak. However, in some situations, such as an outbreak within a large university (for example, one with more than 20 000 undergraduate students) where no identifiable subgroup at risk within the population can be identified, it may be reasonable to declare an outbreak after 3 cases.

"For communities, an outbreak is defined as multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period (Box 4). Several strategies may be considered to determine whether incidence is above expected in a community. For instance, incidence during the current 3-month period can be compared with the incidence during a similar time period in previous years, or in the setting of very low or unstable monthly incidence, annual incidence in the 3-5 years prior. If community incidence has historically been very low or zero, comparisons against state or national incidence can be made. Additional supportive evidence of an outbreak should be solicited, such as similarity of the strains by molecular typing and common epidemiologic or social characteristics of cases. Consultation with CDC is encouraged if an outbreak is suspected.

"Box 4. Outbreak thresholds
Thresholds by outbreak type
Organization-based: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period.
Community-based: multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period.

"Although an absolute outbreak threshold is no longer used, calculating an outbreak attack rate may still be useful in determining the magnitude of an outbreak and comparing against a historical baseline. An outbreak attack rate per 100 000 population is calculated as follows: [(number of outbreak-associated meningococcal disease cases during a 3-month period)/(population at risk)] x 100 000. The epidemiology of the cases should be used to determine the appropriate denominator for attack rate calculations and should include the population of the smallest geographic area that contains the cases and be limited to the sub-populations in which cases were reported (such as among certain age-groups or social networks). For some populations, such as MSM [men who have sex with men], determining the denominator can be very challenging. Results of local or statewide surveys (such as proportion of adult male population that is MSM, proportion of population with HIV) along with census data can be helpful in estimating population sizes.

"Previous versions of the outbreak guidance do not define the term 'cluster' of meningococcal disease, though this term is used informally by public health officials. In this updated guidance, the term cluster can be used to describe a grouping of cases thought to be epidemiologically related that are still under investigation or that do not meet the definition of an outbreak.

9. Vaccination
--------------
9.1 Decision to vaccinate
"Vaccination is the preferred control measure for meningococcal disease outbreaks of all serogroups commonly seen in the United States (B, C, W, and Y). However, many factors should be taken into consideration when determining the need for vaccination. While the number of cases is important, other factors to consider include the population size, ability to define a target group for vaccination, whether ongoing transmission is likely, feasibility of a vaccination campaign, and timing of potential vaccination in relation to cases. In situations where ongoing transmission is unlikely (such as cases limited to household members, roommates, or boyfriend/girlfriend), a vaccination campaign is not necessarily indicated as long as antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts is implemented to prevent further transmission.

"The guidance above suggests thresholds for considering vaccination, but decisions to vaccinate should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the local/state health department and CDC taking into account all circumstances and epidemiology specific to the outbreak."

The CDC recommends vaccination with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine for all preteens and teens at 11-12 years of age, with a booster dose at 16 years. Teens and young adults (ages 16-23 years) also may be vaccinated with a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine. In addition to a meningococcal conjugate vaccine, certain preteens and teens should get a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine if they have a rare type of disorder (complement component deficiency); are taking the medicine called Soliris [eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized myasthenia gravis in adults]; have a damaged spleen or their spleen has been removed; or are part of a population identified to be at increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/public/index.html).

However, we have not been told the serogroup causing meningococcal meningitis in the college student. Nor have we been told the meningococcal vaccination status for the student. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources on the case.

The university at which the meningitis patient is matriculated needs clarification. The news report above says that the patient with meningitis is a student at the University of Michigan (which is located in Ann Arbor, Michigan), but the frat party he attended was at Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing (Ingham County), Michigan. These 2 universities are separate institutions, located 61 mi (98 km) (one hour driving time) apart. The news report says that the public health response is being managed by the Ingham County Ingham County Health Department and MSU. If the student was really matriculated at the University of Michigan, his roommates at the University of Michigan should be considered close contacts and candidates for antibiotic chemoprophylaxis. A map showing the location of these 2 universities can be found at http://alldistancebetween.com/in/distance-between/michigan-state-university-university-of-michigan--ann-arbor-91055d9bc64c375a1564df26de156ac3/. - Mod.ML
