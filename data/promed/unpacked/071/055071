A plant disease that could endanger Florida's USD 9 billion citrus industry
has been found for the 1st time in the United States, agriculture officials
said Friday. The bacterial disease known as citrus greening Huanglongbing
(HLB), also known as citrus greening, also was found in samples collected
from 2 trees in South Florida, officials said.
HLB is not a threat to humans but has harmed trees in Asia, the Arabian
Peninsula, and Africa. Its 1st US detection was confirmed by the US
Agriculture Department after state scientists sent the samples there.
The disease, primarily transmitted by an insect, affects the vascular
system of plants and causes infected trees to die in a few years. "It would
definitely be devastating to the citrus industry" if allowed to spread
unchecked or if it's found to be widespread already, said Denise Feiber,
spokeswoman for the Florida agriculture department.
The Asian version of HLB was found on 2 samples of pummelo tree leaf and
fruit samples 14 miles apart in the city of Homestead, a farming center in
Miami-Dade County. Scientists and agriculture officials were investigating
whether the illness had spread beyond that area, officials said.
HLB probably arrived in Florida from infected Asian plant material that
came into contact with citrus psyllids, which spread the bacterium, Feiber
said. She said agriculture officials had been testing for CG since the
insect vector that carries it were found in Delray Beach in 1998.
Because there is no cure, trees found to have been infected will be
destroyed, as federal and state scientists determine how far HLB has
spread. But the disease is not airborne, so finding and killing carrier
insects is critical, Feiber said. The HLB threat is another headache for
Florida agriculture officials and citrus growers, who have dealt with
citrus canker for about a decade. The state has destroyed about 2.5 million
trees in commercial groves and 650 000 trees in residential areas in an
attempt to get rid of it.

[HLB greening is a highly destructive disease of citrus caused by the
bacterium _Candidatus liberobacter_ spp. Some experts consider it be the
most serious citrus disease in the world. It invades conducting tissues,
causing a decline of citrus trees and rendering them unproductive. Affected
trees citrus trees may live for 5-8 years and never produce usable fruit.
HLB probably originated in China. It seriously affects production in India,
Asia, Southeast Asia (including Indonesia and The Philippines), the Arabian
Peninsula, and Africa. To date, HLB has not been recorded in Australia, but
it was reported in Brazil (Sao Paulo State) and in south Miami-Dade County,
FL this year (August 2005). Once a tree has been infected, it cannot be
'cured' of HLB. Where the disease exists, management strategies rely on
preventing its spread into uninfected areas. A variety of measures are
employed, including regulation of the movement of propagating material,
destruction of infected trees, and control of insect vectors. HLB is
transmitted through infected planting materials and by the vector, the
Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_).
