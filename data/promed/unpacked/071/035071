The H5N1 flu virus has been circulating continuously in poultry in
south-eastern China for a decade, scientists have found. A massive
genetic analysis shows the virus has mainly been spread by poultry,
but also that wild birds carried it from southeast China to Turkey.
Yi Guan and colleagues at Shantou University, plus scientists in
Xiamen and Hong Kong, say the only way to stop the virus is to
control it in southeast China.
The researchers analysed samples taken from 13 000 migratory birds
and 50 000 market poultry in southeast China between January 2004 and
June 2005, when the Chinese government banned independent sampling.
In the markets, they found H5N1 in about 2 percent of apparently
healthy ducks and geese, and some chickens, in all but 2 of the
months in the sampling period.
The genetic make-up of the virus differed slightly between Guangdong,
Hunan and Yunnan provinces, forming distinct geographic clusters. But
they all descend from a 1996 Guangdong virus, and show the greatest
genetic variation in Guangdong and neighbouring Guangxi and Hunan,
showing they have been there longest.
Robert Webster of St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis,
Tennessee, US, a co-author of the paper, says this shows the virus
originated in those provinces, and has been circulating in the region
ever since, long enough to evolve divergent strains.
These strains then "colonised" neighbouring areas. Viruses from
Vietnam and Thailand match Guangdong viruses, while Indonesia has its
own related cluster. Genes from Vietnamese viruses reveal repeated
introductions from Guangxi, most recently in 2005. This contrasts
with past insistence by Chinese officials that H5N1 exists only in
isolated cases in China, and did not necessarily originate there.
The existence of distinct clusters also means the main carriers
cannot be wide-ranging birds -- instead, most transmission is via
local poultry movements. Co-author Malik Peiris, of the University of
Hong Kong, told New Scientist: "If there had been repeated waves of
virus introduced into, for example, Yunnan, one would expect multiple
sub-lineages of the virus. But in each place there is only one."
But wild birds are involved. The team found H5N1 in 6 apparently
healthy migratory ducks at Poyang Lake in Jiangxi province, which
borders Guangdong and Hunan, in January and March 2005, before the
northward migration. The isolates had all the genes, and certain
specific mutations, later found in geese at Qinghai Lake, 1700
kilometres northwest. And this virus, notes Peiris, is very like H5N1
in Turkey.
The team also tested whether the Poyang viruses would make ducks too
sick to fly by infecting young mallards. "Most got a bit sick then
recovered," says Webster, and all shed virus for up to a week. "The
evidence is now overwhelming that migrating birds can move H5N1 over
long distances," says Peiris. "But they are not the scapegoats for
maintaining H5N1 within poultry. There the cause and solution lies
within the poultry industry."
Another important finding of the research is that antibodies to each
sub-lineage of H5N1 did not bind readily to other sub-lineages. That
means vaccinating people or birds against one strain may not protect
against others. The team warns that H5N1 pandemic vaccines should be
developed using several strains, and constantly updated.
But to head off the threat of a human pandemic, the authors insist
"the source of the virus in southern China must be contained."
Webster adds: "Let's be optimistic that [the Chinese authorities]
will accept that this thing is out there. It is terribly important to
realise that perfectly healthy looking birds have this damn virus."

Bulgaria shut off wetland areas on Monday [6 Feb 2006] and
investigated the deaths of scores of birds after announcing its first
case of H5 avian flu in a dead swan last week, officials said.
Veterinarians also prepared to send samples from the infected swan --
found partially paralysed in the Danube river -- to Britain to test
whether it had the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus.[see
20060204.0355].
"The samples from the swan will be sent to the United Kingdom on
Monday. We expect the results in a week's time," said Margarita
Kozhuharova, spokeswoman of the agriculture ministry.
With its Black Sea neighbours Turkey and Romania battling outbreaks
of the deadly H5N1 since October 2005, Bulgaria has long been
considered a potential destination for the disease.
Since the first H5 case was announced on Friday, vets have tested
dozens of waterfowl found dead in wetland areas, including 30 ducks
which died at a farm on Sunday.
"The birds, domesticated ducks, died at a farm near the Black Sea
port of Varna," Dinko Neshovski, head of the veterinary office in
Varna, told Reuters. "We've sent samples for tests to Sofia." He
would not elaborate.
On orders from the state veterinary office, police began guarding the
lakes of Shabla and Durankulak near the northeast border with Romania
to prevent people from coming into contact with more than 100 000
wild birds that spend the winter there.
South of Europe's largest wetland area in the Danube delta, [as well
as the lakes, are situated] along the Pontic migratory route, by
which scientists believe birds travelling south from northern Russia
may have brought the disease to southeast Europe.
Hundreds of birds have died at the lakes since the start of 2006.
Veterinarians have blamed that on a severe cold snap in which
temperatures dropped to around minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4F),
but said they were stepping up measures anyway.
"We are getting ready for a possible outbreak," said Alexander
Alexandrov, head of the regional veterinary office in Dobrich.
"People should forget about taking farm animals to water at the 2
lakes until spring, when the last duck is gone."

Romania finds suspect bird flu cases outside delta
-----------------------
Romania detected new suspected cases of bird flu in domestic fowl on
Tuesday east of the Danube delta where the disease was first found in
October, the country's chief veterinarian said.
"Rapid tests made us suspect the presence of the H5 strain of the
virus in three hens found dead in the village of Cetatea in Dolj
county," chief veterinarian Ion Agafitei told Reuters.
He said samples of the dead birds would be further tested in
Bucharest to confirm the presence of the virus and they would
subsequently be sent to a British laboratory to establish whether it
was the deadly H5N1 strain.
He said 10 birds were culled in the village, which is about 500 km
(311 miles) from the delta, but more could be killed if the Bucharest
laboratory confirmed the presence of the virus.
Avian flu has been discovered in 26 villages across the Black Sea
country since the first outbreak occurred in October.
