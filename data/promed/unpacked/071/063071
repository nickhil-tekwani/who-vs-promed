[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed so far in carnivores of 6 families, canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, puma/cougar, and snow leopard), mustelids (ferrets and minks), viverrids (binturongs), procyonids (coatimundis), and hyenids (hyenas). All wild carnivores that were diagnosed with COVID-19 were held captive at zoos, except for a free-ranging mink in Utah. Lions and tigers have been the ones most frequently reported infected, which may be due to their susceptibility but also because they are common at zoos. - Mod.PMB
