A 6 year old boy died as a result of a rattlesnake bite near Colorado Springs, Colorado, prompting warnings about what you should and should not do if you or your pet is bitten by the venomous snake. The boy was bitten in Security-Widefield on 5 Jul [2022] and died on Saturday [16 Jul 2022], according to Colorado Springs TV station KRDO.

Fatal rattlesnake bites are rare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 7000-8000 people a year in the USA are bitten by venomous snakes, resulting in about 5 deaths a year. In Colorado, the most recent fatal rattlesnake bite before last week's was in 2017, when a 31 year old Colorado man died after being bitten near Golden, Colorado.

The boy's death prompted Colorado Parks and Wildlife to release the below lists of what to do -- and what not to do -- after a rattlesnake bite, according to the HerpMed website, US Food and Drug Administration, and American Red Cross.

What to do if a person is bitten by a rattlesnake:

- If the snake is still in the vicinity, move carefully to a safe location.
- If you can do it safely, take a photo of the snake for identification. Rattlesnakes do not have a sharply pointed tail; rather, the tail has rounded buttons. Also, the head of a rattlesnake is wider than its body.
- Find a place where the victim can lie flat and rest comfortably, encourage the person to remain calm, and offer reassurance.
- If in a group, send one member to notify local emergency staff and the nearest hospital. Do not leave the victim alone. Carry a cell phone with you [and hope you have a signal. - Mod.TG].
- Allow the bite to bleed freely for about 30 seconds, then cleanse and disinfect the bite area with Betadine (iodine) or soap and water.
- If hospital treatment is more than 30 minutes away and the bite is on a hand, finger, foot, or lower arm or leg, a wide elastic bandage can be used as a pressure dressing.
- Wrap the bandage quickly from an area just above the bite past the knee or elbow joint, immobilizing it. Wrap no tighter than for a sprain. The goal is to restrict the movement of venom into the bloodstream without cutting off circulation to the limb. Check for pulse above and below bandage and rewrap if too tight.
- Apply direct pressure to the bite using a 4-by-4-inch gauze pad folded in half twice. Soak the pad in iodine and tape it in place.
- Remove all rings, watches, jewelry, and tight-fitting clothing from the bite area, because most of the bitten appendage will swell.
- Immobilize the bitten extremity as much as possible, using splints if necessary.
- Try to keep the bite location even with the heart. Raising it above the heart will increase the spread of venom into the body, and swelling will increase if it's kept below heart level.
- After administering first aid, take the victim to the nearest hospital or medical facility. Have someone call ahead to the nearest hospital so it will be prepared.

What not to do if a person is bitten by a rattlesnake:

- Do not assume that a bite is not serious, or treatment can be delayed.
- Do not apply oral suction to the bite. Such action could introduce harmful bacteria into the wound causing sepsis. [Venom in your own mouth could cause issues as the mucous membranes of the mouth absorb it quickly, especially if there is a small nick near a tooth or a sore on your tongue. - Mod.TG]
- Do not make any sort of incision into or around the bite marks. This will only increase trauma to the bite location.
- Do not apply a narrow, constrictive tourniquet such as a belt, shoelace, or cord. Restricting blood flow puts the bitten extremity at a high risk for amputation.
- Do not engage in strenuous physical activity. This will only speed the spread of venom to vital organs.
- Do not apply ice or hot or cold packs to the bite. Those have not proven beneficial and may compound tissue damage through burns or frostbite.
- Do not allow the victim to take aspirin or use any medication.
- Do not give the victim anything to eat or drink unless approved by a physician.
- Do not remove pressure dressings until antivenom is available.
- Do not waste time or take any additional risks trying to kill or capture the snake. [If possible, a photo taken -- without delay and from a safe distance -- may be helpful. - Mod.TG]

What to do (and not) if your dog is bitten by a rattlesnake:

- Move a safe distance from the snake and calm the dog.
- Clean the wound with soap and water and treat with antibiotic ointment if available.
- A Sawyer or other venom extractor should not be used, because the dog's hair will prevent a good seal from forming.
- Limit physical exertion and get the animal to veterinary care immediately, calling ahead if possible.

What to do if you encounter a rattlesnake:

- Snakes are often heard before they are seen. If you hear a rattlesnake, freeze in place until you or a companion can see it. Trying to move away from a snake you can't see may lead you closer to it.
- Even if the snake can be seen, not moving will reduce the threat you pose to the snake and help you calmly assess the situation.
- Once you assess the situation, establish a safe distance. Rattlesnakes can strike to a distance of half their body length. A good rule of thumb is to put at least 5 ft [1.5 m] between yourself and the snake.
- Move by slowly backing the way you came. [Do look behind you so you don't stumble on a rock or step on another snake. - Mod.TG]
- Do not under any circumstances try to catch, kill, provoke, or move a rattlesnake. Many people who suffer snakebites are bitten as a result of trying to handle or kill the snake.
- Move around the rattlesnake at a safe distance.

How to avoid a rattlesnake bite:

- Wear sturdy leather boots, which afford good protection for the feet and ankles. [Running/walking/tennis shoes are inadequate to stop a snake bite from penetrating your skin. - Mod.TG]
- Watch where you place feet and hands at all times, especially around logs and rocks where rattlesnakes shelter.
- Do not use headphones or ear buds, because a rattlesnake usually warns, if you are too close, by making a rattling sound.
- Be especially aware of rattlesnakes around dusk, when snakes become active hunting and human visibility drops.
- If the snake coils up and rattles, you are too close and should move away slowly. Stepping back just a few feet can be enough to show the snake you are not a threat. Most rattlesnakes will not strike at people unless they feel threatened or are provoked.

[Snake bites may consist of a dry bite, meaning no venom was injected. If the snake has recently eaten or struck something else, the venom sacs may not be full. There are not always 2 fang marks. Snakes are capable of biting, and injecting venom, with only one fang. Young snakes are just as hazardous as older, larger snakes. Younger snakes may not have learned how to control the venom and may inject all they have. The younger and smaller the snake, the more you may think it was a sticker (small thorn) or bee sting. Do not discount small or single marks. In addition to snake venom, other envenomations may be from bees, wasps, or even scorpions and result in allergic reactions, which can also be life-threatening.

"Rattlesnakes do not usually attack humans unless they feel threatened or surprised. There are about 30 species of rattlesnakes in the world. Because of a continuing reflex, they can still bite hours after death. About 7000 to 8000 people will get bit by rattlesnakes each year, and only about 5 of these people will die. If a bite occurs, the area will immediately swell up and change color. [Often there is pain associated with a bite, but a very small snake may cause minimal pain but still inject enough venom to kill or to cause serious tissue damage. - Mod.TG]

"Symptoms can include the following:
- bleeding
- difficulty breathing
- blurred vision
- numbness in face and limbs
- sweating
- salivating
- low blood pressure
- nausea and vomiting
- rapid pulse
- tissue damage

"Rattlesnake venom has hemotoxic properties that damage internal tissues, destroy blood cells, and cause internal bleeding. It can also have neurotoxic properties that cause nervous system issues including making the person stop breathing. Usually, rattlesnake venom has more hemotoxic effects than neurotoxic effects.

"Treatment for rattlesnake bite
It is a medical emergency if someone has been bit by a rattlesnake. If left untreated, rattlesnake bites can be fatal. If you are there when a person receives the bite, wash the affected area with soap and water and cover it with a bandage. Try and keep the affected area below [or very close to - Mod.TG] the level of the heart. Do not try to suck out the venom. Get the person to the hospital as soon as possible.

"The main course of treatment is the rattlesnake antivenom, also known as antivenin (crotalidae) polyvalent or Crofab, given in the hospital setting. This is created from the blood of a horse or sheep injected with rattlesnake venom. Dosing is as follows [individuals with allergies to horses need special treatment - Mod.TG]:

"'The following initial doses are recommended [per Rx List]:
- no envenomation: none
- minimal envenomation: 20-40 mL (contents of 2-4 vials)
- moderate envenomation: 50-90 mL (contents of 5-9 vials)
- severe envenomation: 100-150 mL or more (contents of 10-15 or more vials).
These recommended initial-dosage volumes are in general accord with those of others. [The record number of antivenin for a single rattlesnake bite is approximately 900-1000 vials. The cost of a single vial is not insignificant. - Mod.TG]

"The need for additional antivenin must be based on the clinical response to the initial dose and continuing assessment of the severity of poisoning. If swelling continues to progress or if systemic symptoms or signs of envenomation increase in severity or if new manifestations appear, for example, fall in hematocrit or hypotension, administer an additional 10-50 mL (contents of 1-5 vials) or more intravenously. For severe envenomation, a total of 200-400 mL (contents of 20-40 vials) may be necessary. There is no recommended maximum dose. The total required dose is the amount needed to neutralize the venom as determined by clinical response.'" (http://fromnewtoicu.com/blog/2017/7/26/rattlesnake-bite-treatment) - Mod.TG
