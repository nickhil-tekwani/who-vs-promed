Russia: suspected human cases of avian influenza in St Petersburg
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2 cases of "bird" influenza transmitted from person to person were recorded
this year [2004] in Saint Petersburg. Previously, physicians thought that
the disease could be contracted only from infected birds, but now it seems
that this is not so. Specialists now consider that "bird" influenza is a
direct danger to humans because of the absence of pre-existing immunity.
The symptoms of avian influenza are the following: high fever, difficulties
in breathing, coughing, sore throat, muscle pains, and conjunctivitis.
According to physicians, this form of influenza can lead to pneumonia and
can cause complications involving the heart and kidneys. The disease is
especially serious for young children and can be fatal. So far, avian
influenza is being treated with the same procedures as employed in the
treatment of ordinary influenza. But epidemiologists are warning that the
virus may mutate, and drugs currently used [?] will become ineffective.
An epidemic of ordinary influenza in St Petersburg is not expected until
Jan-Feb 2005. In the meantime, medical authorities are recommending
vaccination for 3 categories of people: the elderly, children, and those
with chronic diseases. Vaccination is also being recommended for those who
work in health care, transportation, education, and sales areas.

[This report has to be treated with considerable skepticism, as it offers
no information on how the diagnosis was achieved, nor the basis for the
conclusion of person to person transmission, nor the precise antigenic
identity of the "bird" virus. Limited person to person transmission of H7N7
avian influenza was observed during the epidemic of avian influenza in
poultry in the Netherlands in 2003. There is sparse evidence for person to
person transmission of H5N5 avian influenza virus during the extensive
outbreaks of avian influenza in East Asia in 2004. In general, in the
absence of outbreaks of avian influenza, there is little or no direct
transmission of avian viruses to humans. If person to person transmission
of avian influenza were occurring in the Saint Petersburg region, it would
imply that extensive outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry were occurring
in this area of Russia. - Mod.CP]
