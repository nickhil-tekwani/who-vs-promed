Jul 16, 2001 (M2 PRESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- BSE has been diagnosed in a cow
born in 4 Dec 1996, just over 4 months after 1 Aug 1996, when extra
control measures on animal feed containing mammalian meat and bone meal
(MMBM) were considered to have been fully implemented.
The State Veterinary Service is investigating the source and background in
order to establish whether anything about the BSE epidemic can be learnt
from it.
The Food Standards Agency advises that there are no implications for food
safety from this case and stress the importance of identifying the source
if possible.
Animal Health Minister Elliot Morley MP said: "We do not yet know the
significance of this case but it does not change in any way our view that
we have the toughest rules in place to protect public health and to
eradicate the disease."
Notes for editors
1. The cow - aged 54 months at time of slaughter - would not have entered
the human food chain because of the rule which prevents the sale for human
consumption of meat from animals aged over 30 months. It would also have
been ineligible for our Date Based Export Scheme (DBES) because of its age.
The cow's mother has been traced and was killed under the Over 30 Months
Scheme (OTMS) on 4 Sep 2000. The 2 offspring of the case have already been
traced, and will not enter the food chain either.
2. In accordance with standing procedures cohort animals (animals from the
same herd born 6 months either side of this animal) will be traced, placed
under movement restrictions and barred from the food chain. In this case,
the cohort animals will, in any case, be excluded from the food chain
because of their age.
3. The State Veterinary Service will be carrying out a detailed
investigation into the background of this case in order to study the
possible origin of the infection. However, previous investigations of BSE
cases have shown that it is frequently impossible to determine the precise
source of infection of an individual case, especially after 4 years have
elapsed. Possible routes of transmission include: a) some animals might
have been exposed to BSE through feed carried over from before 1 Aug 1996;
or b) some animals might have been exposed to BSE through maternal
transmission; or c) there may be routes of transmission which have not yet
been identified. Although there is no evidence for these to date, they
might become evident as the BSE epidemic declines to very low levels.
4. The overall BSE epidemic continues to decline along predicted lines. The
number of BSE cases confirmed during 2000 was 1311, 42 percent lower than
in 1999,
and the number of BSE suspects reported this year to date, 598 is 45
percent lower
than in the same period last year.
5. Experts have been predicting that there would be a small number of cases
born after 1 Aug 1996 for some time. The Oxford Group, headed by Professor
Anderson, predicted that the first case born after 1 Aug might appear in
1998 or 1999. Their predictions are available in tables attached to hard
copies of this release from the Press Office.

[This is the second case born after the controls on animal feed were
implemented; one has also been diagnosed in Northern Ireland. I checked our
postings and the first case was born in May of 1997 (it was in the BSE
update 24 (BSE update (24) June 2001 20010621.1181). - Mod.MP]
[Yahoo.com reported: "This case brings the number of cases of BSE in
animals born after August 1996 to 3 in Britain. One case has also been
diagnosed in Northern Ireland, DEFRA said." Where this information came
from I don't know, as it is not in the DEFRA news release. - Mod.MHJ]
