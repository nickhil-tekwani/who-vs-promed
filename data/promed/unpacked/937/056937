[Re the possibility of the New York West Nile-like virus being carried south
by migrating birds
I used satellite radio telemetry to track migration of "the world's fastest
bird," the peregrine falcon. I followed them from breeding areas in North
America (eastern Alaska and Utah and Arizona) to non-breeding sites from the
southern U. S. south to Argentina. Two birds I tracked migrated to Brazil
and one migrated through Brazil on
its way to Argentina (but not via New York). However, I believe other
researchers have noted peregrines migrating through New York to and through
Brazil (documented by banding and possibly satellite telemetry).
Their migration was slow on average (averages of 274 and 173 km/day for
Alaska adult and juvenile peregrines and 174 and 49 km/day for adults and
juveniles from Utah and Arizona). (I don't have the maximum speed of
migration at this moment but could get it.)
The peregrine is among the fastest fliers but its migration is relatively
slow. There are some birds which migrate to South America by flying from
the north Atlantic coast over water directly to South America. One author
discusses this and estimates they make the trip in 86 hrs +/- 12 hrs.
Species he mentions that make this trip include golden plover, godwits,
ovenbird, blackpoll, other _Dendroica_ warblers, etc.

I am sure there are other references.

[We note that the peregrine data is from radio tracking and banding, whereas
that for other birds is an estimate. Peregrine´s viremia (virus in the
blood) would have been long gone by the time they arrived in S. America, but
if the estimate for other species is good, then it is perfectly possible for
a bird bitten by an infected mosquito in New York to arrive in South America
still circulating virus. Another possibility is for the bird to be carrying
ticks which also become infected from the bird´s blood and pass it to other
birds on arrival. There was a news report that ticks are being collected in
New York as part of the current investigation - Mod.JW
