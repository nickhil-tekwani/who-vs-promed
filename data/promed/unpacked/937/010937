The 2nd laboratory blood test confirmed on Saturday [7 Apr 2007],
that a 29-year-old man, who died last Thursday [5 Apr 2007], had the
H5N1 bird flu virus, bringing the death toll in Indonesia to 74, an
official said on Saturday [7 Apr 2004].
Muhammad Nadirin, head of the Health Ministry's anti-bird flu center,
was quoted by local reports as saying that the man had contact with
infected chickens before he was treated in a hospital for nearly a
week in Central Java province.
Indonesia has become the hardest hit country by bird flu in the world
with the highest number of deaths. [However more cases (but fewer
deaths) were recorded in Viet Nam during the period between the
beginning of 2003 and the end of 2005, when the outbreak there was
finally controlled; see

Last month [March 2007], 5 people died of bird flu in Indonesia and
[this month (April 2007) there have already been 2 more deaths]. The
Indonesian health authorities have imposed a firm policy separating
[poultry] from humans and intensifying surveillance of the virus. In
addition, the authorities have forbidden the raising [of poultry] in
residential areas.
Over 32 million families in Indonesia's vast archipelago have [been]
raising chickens in backyards, according to the Indonesian
Agriculture Minister, Anton Apriantono.
