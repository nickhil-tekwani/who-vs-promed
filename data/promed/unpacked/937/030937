Deer deaths puzzling to wildlife authorities
--------------------------------------------------
Sun 23 Sep 2001 - Even as hunters prepare for another big-game season
characterized by severe restrictions on deer harvest, the full verdict
remains out on the cause of continuing [fawn] mortality in Colorado's
herds. [While some have blamed coyotes] the likely culprit is bovine
virus diarrhea, or BVD.
In the course of placing radio collars on 100 deer for a test
conducted on the Uncompahgre Plateau west of Montrose, Division of
Wildlife researchers found that 60 tested positive for the disease.
"This doesn't mean the deer were active carriers at the time, but it
does indicate exposure at some point in their lives," said Tom Pojar,
the DOW biologist directing a series of deer studies around the state.
What really stirred Pojar's suspicions was the subsequent discovery,
on the north end of the plateau and within 2 days of each other, of 2
fawn carcasses with classic symptoms of BVD. "The disturbing part is
that it's unusual to actually find a carcass, let alone 2 so close
together," said Pojar, who fears this might indicate a problem far
more widespread than anyone imagined.
Acute fawn mortality often has been cited as a primary reason for
lagging regeneration of deer herds. The Uncompahgre study, in its
third and final year, indicates that coyotes never have been
responsible for more than 13 percent of total fawn deaths, deepening a
mystery that only now may be coming clear.
One by one, Pojar has crossed many of the usual suspects off the list.
Bears were charged with only 9 fawn fatalities in three years of
study. In the first year, 6 deaths were attributed to mountain lions
and/or bobcats, but only 2 the second and none the third. Other deer
were lost to unknown traumas, such as automobiles or fences. "Some
just get beaten up by something," Pojar said. "We suspect they get
kicked by other deer, perhaps females driving away strange fawns
trying to suckle."
This leaves us with the twin culprits: sickness and starvation.
During the first year of data, 1999, 30% of all fawns died very young,
a grisly statistic that declined to a less startling 11 and 12 percent
the next 2 years. But the survey also produced another surprise, one
which Pojar terms, "a real red flag for future research." While
searching the Uncompahgre Plateau, this relatively small crew of Pojar
and 8 associates stumbled across 5 stillborn or otherwise deceased
fawns. "If we ran across 5, that makes me think a lot more were out
there in the woods," said Pojar, who found a telling story in their
physical condition. "They were so tiny; some weighed just 2.75 pounds
against normal weight of 7 to 8 pounds."
This finding dovetails with another statistic from the Uncompahgre
study. During 1999 ultrasound tests of pregnant does, Pojar found a 93
percent pregnancy rate, with a total yield of 1.71 fetuses per doe,
both very normal. "That simply can't be reconciled with the December
fawn/doe ratio," Pojar said. "At his time, we should have 70 to 75
fawns per 100 does, but instead wind up with 50 to 55 percent. "This
additional mortality has to come in the last trimester of pregnancy or
during birthing time. The first thing that pops into mind is nutrition
or disease."
Whether these bold directional arrows can or will point to bovine
virus diarrhea remains to be seen. Certainly ample opportunity exists
for transmitting the disease from livestock on shared grazing and
wintering territories.
"The symptoms of BVD are small, undernourished fawns at birth, the
same as for malnutrition," said Pojar, who plans to coordinate with
state agriculture and animal health officials to determine any
coincidence between areas with a higher incidence of BVD in cattle and
profound fawn mortality. "We have a lot of anecdotal evidence with
nutrition that indicates that when does are well fed, natural
reproduction improves
dramatically," Pojar said.
To that end, cooperative programs on the Uncompahgre Plateau with the
U.S. Forest Service aim toward deer-friendly habitat improvement
through range rejuvenation and controlled burning. "With a 1.71 fetus
ratio, we'd have deer all over the place if you put all those on the
ground," Pojar said.

know whether they were laboratory-positive for BVD. - Mod.MHJ]
