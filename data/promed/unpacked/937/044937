At least 178 fall sick as gas leaks at Andhra Pradesh's Anakapalle Special Economic Zone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least 178 employees of Seed Intimate Apparel unit fell sick after a gas, suspected to be ammonia, reportedly leaked at Brandix Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Atchyutapuram, Anakapalle district on Friday [3 Jun 2022]. Officials from the pollution control board and District Collector P Ravi Subhash rushed to the scene to find the source of the gas leak.

Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed officials to ensure such incidents do not recur. At a meeting with officials concerned, he enquired about the gas leak and directed them to provide proper treatment to those who fell ill.

The officials informed Jagan all those hospitalised are out of danger, and reported the situation is under control. They added all the women working at the unit have been evacuated. Around 12 noon, a number of women employees from the apparel unit rushed out complaining of nausea and breathlessness. Some of them started vomiting; some others fainted.

The management alerted the health and district authorities and provided first aid to them at the health clinics located on the SEZ premises. As many as 20 ambulances were pressed into service to shift those who were exposed to the gas to Anakapalle Area Hospital and other hospitals for treatment.

Industries Minister Gudivada Amarnath visited the SEZ and said, most people are undergoing treatment at NTR Hospital in Anakapalle, while a few are admitted to private hospitals in Atchyutapuram.

Eight people, whose condition is reportedly serious, have been shifted to the KGH in Visakhapatnam. Asserting the situation is under control, the minister said, "Several people were discharged in the evening and some are being closely monitored."

District Collector Ravi Subhash said approximately 1800 people -- who were in the SEZ at the time of the incident -- have been evacuated.

Stating the source of the gas leak is yet to be identified, he reported officials of the pollution control board, factories and revenue department along with police personnel have formed teams to ascertain the same (the source). "It is still not known whether the gas which leaked was ammonia or not," he added.

Meanwhile, the scenes at the hospital were chaotic, as families and relatives of the employees were not allowed to enter the wards. "I don't know what is happening, my daughter is inside," a middle-aged woman told the reporters, while trying to go inside the ward.

When contacted, the pollution control board officials told The New Indian Express the possibility of the gas being ammonia is low and it could most probably be some solvent.

Stating they will inspect the meters fixed at the industrial units to determine the quantity of emissions at the time of the incident, they said a report would be shortly submitted to the district authorities.

[It is difficult to ascertain what possible gas was leaking as clinical signs of the individuals involved are not reported. However, the information below provides some insight into ammonia toxicity.

Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most commonly produced industrial chemicals. It is used in industry and commerce, and also exists naturally in humans and in the environment. Ammonia is essential for many biological processes and serves as a precursor for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. In the environment, ammonia is part of the nitrogen cycle and is produced in soil from bacterial processes. Ammonia is also produced naturally from decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals and animal wastes.

Some chemical/physical properties of ammonia are:
- At room temperature, ammonia is a colorless, highly irritating gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.
- In pure form, it is known as anhydrous ammonia and is hygroscopic (readily absorbs moisture).
- Ammonia has alkaline properties and is corrosive.
- Ammonia gas dissolves easily in water to form ammonium hydroxide, a caustic solution and weak base.
- Ammonia gas is easily compressed and forms a clear liquid under pressure.
- Ammonia is usually shipped as a compressed liquid in steel containers.
- Ammonia is not highly flammable, but containers of ammonia may explode when exposed to high heat.

About 80% of the ammonia produced by industry is used in agriculture as fertilizer. Ammonia is also used as a refrigerant gas, for purification of water supplies, and in the manufacture of plastics, explosives, textiles, pesticides, dyes and other chemicals. It is found in many household and industrial-strength cleaning solutions. Household ammonia cleaning solutions are manufactured by adding ammonia gas to water and can be between 5 and 10% ammonia. Ammonia solutions for industrial use may be at concentrations of 25% or higher and are corrosive.

Most people are exposed to ammonia from inhalation of the gas or vapors. Since ammonia exists naturally and is also present in cleaning products, exposure may occur from these sources. The widespread use of ammonia on farms and in industrial and commercial locations also means that exposure can occur from an accidental release or from a deliberate terrorist attack.

Anhydrous ammonia gas is lighter than air and will rise, so that generally it dissipates and does not settle in low-lying areas. However, in the presence of moisture (such as high relative humidity), the liquefied anhydrous ammonia gas forms vapors that are heavier than air. These vapors may spread along the ground or into low-lying areas with poor airflow where people may become exposed.

Ammonia interacts immediately upon contact with available moisture in the skin, eyes, oral cavity, respiratory tract, and particularly mucous surfaces to form the very caustic ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium hydroxide causes the necrosis of tissues through disruption of cell membrane lipids (saponification) leading to cellular destruction. As cell proteins break down, water is extracted, resulting in an inflammatory response that causes further damage.

Inhalation: Ammonia is irritating and corrosive. Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia in air causes immediate burning of the nose, throat and respiratory tract. This can cause bronchiolar and alveolar edema, and airway destruction resulting in respiratory distress or failure. Inhalation of lower concentrations can cause coughing, and nose and throat irritation. Ammonia's odor provides adequate early warning of its presence, but ammonia also causes olfactory fatigue or adaptation, reducing awareness of one's prolonged exposure at low concentrations.

Children exposed to the same concentrations of ammonia vapor as adults may receive a larger dose because they have greater lung surface area-to-body weight ratios and increased minute volumes-to-weight ratios. In addition, they may be exposed to higher concentrations than adults in the same location because of their shorter height and the higher concentrations of ammonia vapor initially found near the ground.

Skin or eye contact: Exposure to low concentrations of ammonia in air or solution may produce rapid skin or eye irritation. Higher concentrations of ammonia may cause severe injury and burns. Contact with concentrated ammonia solutions such as industrial cleaners may cause corrosive injury including skin burns, permanent eye damage or blindness. The full extent of eye injury may not be apparent for up to a week after the exposure. Contact with liquefied ammonia can also cause frostbite injury.

Ingestion: Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia from swallowing ammonia solution results in corrosive damage to the mouth, throat and stomach. Ingestion of ammonia does not normally result in systemic poisoning.

There is no antidote for ammonia poisoning, but ammonia's effects can be treated, and most people recover. Immediate decontamination of skin and eyes with copious amounts of water is very important. Treatment consists of supportive measures and can include administration of humidified oxygen, bronchodilators and airway management. Ingested ammonia is diluted with milk or water.
