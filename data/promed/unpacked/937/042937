Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location 1: Agua Caliente, San Juan, Intibuca
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Apr 2021
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 1400 / 70 / 70 / 840 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Heavy breeding hens on a multi-age poultry farm

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The passive epidemiological surveillance system for poultry diseases intervened following a report of mortality in domestic poultry in a single-age commercial artisanal layer farm; the birds presented clinical signs and lesions compatible with fowl typhoid (_Salmonella_ Gallinarum). Routine bacteriology and biochemical tests were performed and _Salmonella_ Gallinarum was diagnosed on 29 Apr 2021. The affected farm was quarantined; epidemiological surveillance is being maintained in the zone with restrictions on the movement of birds, and continuous surveillance is being maintained, with sampling. The disease has not been detected during the tracing carried out within a radius of 10 km [6.2 mi] around the outbreak, and the disease has not been detected among the epidemiological links of the affected farm; therefore, the disease is contained in the affected farm.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: Traceability, surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone, surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone, zoning, quarantine
Control measures different from event level, additional measures: Selective killing and disposal

["Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _S._ Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterized by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses."

"Clinical signs of fowl typhoid are typical of a septicemic condition in poultry and include increased mortality and poor quality in chicks hatched from infected eggs. Older birds show signs of anemia, depression, labored breathing and diarrhea causing adherence of feces to the vent."

"_Salmonella_ Gallinarum and _S._ Pullorum are host adapted to avian species and are considered to pose a minimal zoonotic risk. Although the genome is adapted to a non-intestinal environment and has lost flagella genes to help evade host immune responses, it is continually evolving, which could theoretically widen the host range in future" (Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual, 2019 - Chapter 3.3.11 Fowl Typhoid and Pullorum Disease https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.03.11_FOWL_TYPHOID.pdf). - Mod.CRD
