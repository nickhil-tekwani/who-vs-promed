Aerial spraying of Staten Island; clarification
-----------------------------------------------
The aerial spraying of Staten Island was undertaken because there are many
marginal areas where ground ULV treatments cannot reach mosquitoes. Under
appropriate conditions (wind speed and temperature) aerial application of
insecticides usually results in a more uniform deposition of the
insecticide, in this instance Anvil 10 + 10. It's a physical thing.

A preference for crows?
-----------------------
Jose Campione-Piccardo's recent comments [West Nile virus surveillance -
USA (06) are quite relevant to the overall West Nile virus (WNV) studies
as I see it. While the vertical canopy stratification throughout New York
and other WNV - soon to be enzootic(?) - locations is not as spectacular as
tropical rain forests, it nonetheless is there and urgently needs
investigation.
While a postdoctoral with the late George B. Craig, Jr., at Notre Dame's
Vector Biology Laboratory, Dr. Robert Novak and fellow students conducted
some very elegant studies of _Culex spp._ host-seeking and stratification
within 24 hr periods. Bob and fellow imaginative engineers erected several
high towers (rented heavy-duty construction scaffolding) and set out light
traps and bird-baited traps from ground level to the highest level of the
towers. By analogy, they found comparatively few _Culex_ feeding at
"chicken flock" level. However, up in the canopy at the "crow rookery"
level, the numbers of _Culex_ collected and engorgement rates were simply
amazing! Were I looking for the potential vector, I'd be hanging baited
traps along with CDC light traps 100+ feet up in the canopy as did Novak et
al., and within crow rookeries. Catches there during the crows' inactive
period with the expected heightened crepuscular activity of ornithophilic
and anthropophilic _Culex_ would be very revealing. To the towers...!

[This string has featured some interesting discussion, but it has strayed
rather far from the original six questions/comments enumerated by C.H.
Calisher. Consequently the string is now cut. There has been a notable
lack of response from official sources. Those responsible for media
management should be aware that their communication skills need to be
improved. - Mod.CP
