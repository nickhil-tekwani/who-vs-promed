Bad hygiene blamed for typhoid in Russia
-------------------------------------------
Russian and Ukrainian authorities said outbreaks of typhoid, a
disease usually confined to less developed countries, had hit Moscow
and southern Ukraine. The authorities also said that poor sanitation
was to blame.
Epidemiologists, quoted by Russian media, reported 2 cases in a
family just outside Moscow, with a 3rd relative under observation.
All had eaten food purchased at a local market.
"This is quite unusual for Moscow, though less so for other parts of
the former Soviet Union," a medical source said on Tue 27 Jul 2004.
"It is no cause for alarm, but, amounts to a lesson not to buy food
at markets, where there is no proper refrigeration."
Diseases like typhoid and diphtheria were virtually eliminated during
the Soviet period but have made a comeback since the fall of
communism due to a decline in health care.
Interfax news agency reported a case of typhoid on the far eastern
island of Sakhalin, saying the victim had come from ex-Soviet
Tajikistan, where the disease was relatively common.
In Ukraine, health officials reported 13 cases, in the Black Sea port
of Odessa, traced to a local market. They said the infection had come
from outside Ukraine, and the market had been closed down a number of
times before.

[The Tajik and Ukraine clusters have been previously posted (see
below, 20040722.1998 and 20040721.1986).
Although this report consists of just a few cases, with no clear
microbiological, or epidemiological, links to the clusters of typhoid
fever in other areas of the former Soviet Union, it may be the case
that the cases in Moscow are related to these clusters.
Alternatively, the food handler involved here may be the equivalent
of Typhoid Mary. - Mod.LL]
