The foot and mouth disease outbreak was discovered at the Cheale Meats
abattoir at Little Warley, near Brentwood, Essex, on Monday by a qualified
veterinarian who was on meat inspection duty. He noticed some of the 720
pigs being slaughtered were lying down and lethargic - signs they were
unwell. Then he spotted tell-tale blisters setting alarm bells ringing
right to the top of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF).
The signs suggested the 27 pigs could either be suffering from foot and
mouth disease (FMD) or the less serious swine-vesicular disease. Symptoms
in pigs are very similar. Vets immediately started identifying the farms on
the Isle of Wight, Buckinghamshire and Yorkshire where the sick pigs
originated.
The abattoir deals with livestock from all regions of the United Kingdom.
As this was happening, a bull on the farm next door to the abattoir -
Orchard Farm, which is also run by Cheale Meats - fell sick and was later
confirmed with FMD. It has since been destroyed, along with 49 other cattle
there.
Within hours of the vet's discovery, movement restrictions were imposed for
5 miles around 2 farms - Greenway Farm at Great Horwood, Bucks and another
at Freshwater Bay on the Isle of Wight. Restrictions were also placed on
the abattoir and its adjoining farm, and arrangements were made to destroy
all of the livestock there. This will happen over the next few days.
A farm in Yorkshire has been placed under lesser restrictions because one
of the sick pigs arrived at the abattoir after being sold at a market in
Selby. Given the stage of the disease in this animal, it is believed it
contracted the disease long after it left the farm.
No other animals on any of the farms outside Essex have so far shown signs
of FMD.
