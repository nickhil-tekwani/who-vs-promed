All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last Notice was sent out.
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the State of
California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 22
commercial operations in California. On 16 Jan 2003, END was also
confirmed in a backyard flock in the State of Nevada. A backyard flock was
confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003, in the State of Arizona. * On 9 Apr
2003, END was confirmed in backyard fowl in Texas.
Clinical signs in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and
gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed birds.
Investigations are on-going and all figures are pending final
validation. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel
and other federal government personnel are working with the States to
consider additional resources to meet the labor demands at the Task
Forces. APHIS has implemented a plan for enhanced national END surveillance.
* Situation Update (as of 8:00 p.m. PST, 9 Apr 2003)

Birds depopulated to date 269 / 3 455 269 / 2746 / 164 / 3 458 448
Counties with quarantined premises: La Paz Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange,
San Bernardino, San Diego, Ventura Clark,El Paso
* The last infected premises in Arizona was depopulated on 7 Feb 2003.
** The last infected premises in Nevada was depopulated on 29 Jan 2003.
Operational Update: Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal
quarantine that regulates the interstate movement of all species of birds
and poultry products from Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, CA.
Effective 17 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Clark and a portion of Nye County, NV.
Effective 10 Feb 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
all of La Paz and Yuma Counties and a portion of Mohave County, AZ.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada. These
declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority within Arizona,
California and Nevada.
* END has been confirmed in backyard fowl near El Paso, TX. The sequencing
at the cleavage site of the fusion protein gene is RRQKR/F, which is
identical with that found in the Arizona, California, and Nevada isolates
of ENDV. The nucleotide sequence of the 180-bp segment flanking the
cleavage site is 100 percent identical with the Arizona, California, and
Nevada isolates of ENDV. Additional sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of
a larger segment of the matrix and fusion genes is in progress and should
be available sometime next week. The infected flock contained 164 backyard
fowl. The premises has been depopulated and depopulation of adjacent and
dangerous contact sites has begun.
* APHIS is proceeding with a declaration of extraordinary emergency and the
establishment of a federal quarantine for the Texas counties of El Paso and
Hudspeth, and the New Mexico counties of Luna, Dona Ana, and Otero. An
Incident Command Post is being established in El Paso, Texas, for task
force activities in TX and NM.
Currently there are 22 commercial flocks in the State of California
affected by END. The breakdown of the commercial premises involved is as
follows: 4 premises in Riverside County (3 infected and 1 contact), 7
premises in San Diego County (7 infected), and 11 premises in San
Bernardino County (11 infected).
* Of the 2556 premises designated for depopulation, 98.1 percent have been
completed.
The Inland Desert and South Coast ICPs have realigned their service
territories so that all of Los Angeles County will now be handled by the
South Coast ICP. The South Coast ICP also will be responsible for all of
San Diego County, except in cases involving commercial premises.
Previously, the Inland Desert ICP handled portion of Los Angeles County, as
well as certain areas of San Diego County (both backyard and commercial
premises).
The Central Valley Incident Command Post in Modesto, CA, is staffed and
working cooperatively with approximately 15-20 county officials to
implement efficient surveillance measures throughout the Central Valley.
Outreach Activities: On a daily basis, Task Force personnel are
communicating information concerning surveillance, depopulation, and
cleaning and disinfection operations to all affected city managers in
Southern California.
Currently, Task Force information personnel field approximately 450 calls
per week from the public through the Joint Information Center phone
bank. This is a 20-fold increase from the number of calls in October
2002. On average, approximately 300 of these calls require follow-up
action by the Inland Desert or South Coast Incident Command Posts.
The Task Force information staff provides daily updates to approximately 50
media outlets in California. In addition, in Area Command alone, the
information staff field approximately 70 media calls per week.
