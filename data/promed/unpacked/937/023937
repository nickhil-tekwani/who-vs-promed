At least 3 children have developed kidney failure after being diagnosed with _Escherichia coli_ infections that are linked to eating ice cream from a farm. A cluster of infections due to Shiga toxin producing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) O26:H11 has been traced to the tourist attraction Efstidalur II farm in Blaskogabyggd in the south of Iceland.

The 17 ill children are aged between 14 months and 12 years. At least 3 of them developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a severe condition associated with _E. coli_ infections that causes kidney failure. Around one-third of employees at the farm have also been investigated, but none tested positive for the bacterium.

It was initially suspected that children who fell ill after visiting the farm were infected because of contact with calves, but further investigation found some children had no contact with this animal while 9 had eaten ice cream and the 10th child was infected by a sibling.

Product testing of ice cream did not find the outbreak strain, but samples were not the same as what the children had eaten, as new product was being sold. An investigation found the _E. coli_ strain that infected the children was also detected in feces from calves.

Officials from the Directorate of Health urged anyone who had visited the farm between 10 Jun 2019 and 4 Jul 2019, and developed diarrhea within 10 days, to contact a doctor to be tested for the bacterium. "After contact with animals, before eating or preparing food and especially after caring for individuals with diarrhea, hand-washing with soap and water is strongly recommended. Alcohol-based hand-sanitizer is an optional addition but may not be sufficient on its own against many causes of diarrhea," added the agency.

The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (Matvaelastofnun) recently detected EHEC in 30% of lamb samples and 11.5% of beef samples it tested. Of 148 samples of Icelandic sheep meat, 44 samples were positive for EHEC, and in the 148 samples of domestic and foreign beef, 17 samples were contaminated.

Symptoms of infections caused by EHEC include abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The incubation period can range from 3 to 8 days and many people recover within 10 days.

[It may well be that contact with the calves was the initial transmission event and the ice cream eating using unwashed hands facilitated transfer. Alternatively, since the outbreak strain was found in calves, were there milk-producing cows present, and, if the ice cream was made there, was the milk used to make the ice cream pasteurized?

Three of 17 cases developing HUS is a high proportion. Some strains seem to produce a higher risk of HUS, but the use of antimicrobials early in the infection can increase the risk of HUS. In episodes of diarrhea (with or without blood) with significant abdominal pain and little or no fever, EHEC must be suspected and antimicrobials withheld. - Mod.LL
