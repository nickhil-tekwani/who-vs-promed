[Since 4 Jun 2016, when lumpy skin disease (LSD) was 1st observed in Serbia, close to the border with Macedonia (FYROM), 150 outbreaks, in 4 regions, have been reported as of 15 Jul 2016. This demonstrates the potential of the vectorborne LSD virus for rapid spread when climatic conditions are adequate. The new outbreaks have spread westwards and northwards, approaching Romania's south-west (see map at source URL).

The following summarised data, updated on 15 Jul 2016, are derived from OIE's WAHIS archive:

Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 150 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1346 / 173 / 0 / 84 / 0

LSD has been spreading in the Balkans since its resurgence in northern Greece (where it had circulated in 2015), in early 2016. By now, it seems to have become entrenched in Bulgaria, Macedonia (FYROM) and Kosovo. The 1st outbreak in Albania started, reportedly, on 28 Jun 2016, was confirmed on 6 Jul 2016 and a notification was submitted to the OIE on 8 Jul 2016. This outbreak was located near the border with FYROM (and not with Kosovo, as erroneously stated in 20160711.4337862; thanks to Nic Honhold for the correction).
