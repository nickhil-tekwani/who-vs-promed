Thousands of dead mussels have washed up this week [20-26 Aug 2016] on the shores of Long Island [New York], baffling scientists. Mussels thrive in the Long Island Sound's typically mild temperature. However, experts say this year's [2016] high temperatures may have killed them off.

A Stony Brook University marine science professor says he examined the blue mussels that have come ashore in Jamesport and says the die-off could have to do with the hot summer. Professor Christopher Gobler says the mussels thrive in the Long Island Sound's typically mild temperature. He says the mussels appear to have been born in 2013 and 2014, both cooler years. But he says this summer's high temperatures probably caused them to die and wash ashore.

Residents said the mussels are starting to smell, and they hope the tide takes them away. A Jamesport resident told The Suffolk Times there are 'hundreds of thousands' of mussels lining the shore between Iron Pier Beach in Jamesport and United Riverhead Terminal in Northville, a 1.7 mile stretch of beach. The smell on Wednesday afternoon [24 Aug 2016], as the shellfish dried in the heat, was worse than in the early evening, [he] said. 'They're all about the same size, all clean shells,' he said. 'It's not like anything I'd ever seen growing on the Long Island Sound.'

The state Department of Environmental Conservation tells WCBS-TV mussel wash-ups can occur a few times a year across the region.

[Mortality rates of bivalves have been shown to be greater in warm summer years than in cold summer years (Mar Ecol Prog Ser 2009; 384: 135-145, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/42361273). For bivalve populations living at high latitudes, temperature may generally affect multiple ecological and physiological processes. - Mod.PMB
