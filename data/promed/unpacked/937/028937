From: Jose Luis Ferrero <jferrero@cantv.net>

In the [most recent epidemiological week, 738 cases of dengue have been
reported, eight more than in the previous week. 122 cases have been labeled
as DHF. To date 33,814 cases have been reported in the country. 23% of the
cases are from Distrito Federal, where the capital Caracas is located.
These data were presented as part of an interview with the director of the
national epidemiology division of M.S.A.S. published in the national press.
We believe there is a huge amount of under-reporting, particularly in private
clinics and private hospitals.

[It would be interesting to know the basis of Dr. Ferrero's belief. I
assume M.S.A.S. is a Venezuelan government agency. - Mod.CHC
