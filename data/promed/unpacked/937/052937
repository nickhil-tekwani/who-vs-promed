A health board is investigating 4 cases of the infection [due to] _Legionella longbeachae_ linked to gardening compost. 2 patients are being treated in intensive care while 2 more have been discharged from hospital, NHS Lothian said. The 4 people affected are keen gardeners between the ages of 62 and 84.

Dr Richard Othieno, NHS Lothian consultant in public health and chair of the incident management team, said: "This type of _Legionella_ is quite rare in that unlike other strains it has never been identified in man-made water systems, like cooling towers. We are working with experts to trace the source of the infection and samples of the compost have been sent for testing. We know that all of the 4 cases are keen gardeners and had purchased different products containing compost prior to acquiring the infection. Gardening is a healthy hobby but there are risks and it is important that people take some simple precautions when working in their garden or with gardening products. I would like to add further reassurance that the risk to the wider public is low."

The symptoms of _Legionella longbeachae_ [infection] include headaches, diarrhoea, or a dry cough followed by pneumonia. Most people recover after treatment with antibiotics but those with underlying medical problems are more vulnerable, the health board said. It is not known exactly how the infection is passed from compost to people but health experts assume it is through breathing in very small dust particles or drops of contaminated water. The infection is not transmitted from person to person.

Anyone handling garden materials such as potting mix, mulches, composts, or garden soils is advised to open bags carefully, wear gloves and keep doors to greenhouses or sheds open when potting plants or filling hanging baskets. Gardeners are also advised to wear a mask if the air is dusty, particularly indoors, and to wash their hands immediately after using compost and before smoking.

There is no link between the current cases and the outbreak of [infection due to] _Legionella pneumophila_ in southwest Edinburgh in 2012, NHS Lothian said.

NHS warns killer legionnaires' disease could be in your garden as bug shuts down school and hospitalises 4 people. The particular strain of the bug, which shut down Cargilfield Preparatory School and left 2 elderly victims fighting for their lives yesterday [13 Sep 2013], can be found in compost.

Already 4 Scots gardeners have been struck down by the deadly legionnaires' disease caught from compost. 2 elderly victims were last night [13 Sep 2013] fighting for their lives in intensive care, while 2 others have been treated in hospital.

A school [Cargilfield Preparatory School] was also closed down yesterday [13 Sep 2013] after a member of staff was diagnosed with the bug. Health bosses issued a warning to all gardeners over the rare strain of the killer bug. They are being urged to wear facemasks when handling compost. All 4 gardeners affected by the _Legionella longbeachae_ strain come from the Lothian area and are aged between 62 and 84.

The same strain killed a Scots gardener and made 5 others sick in May last year [2012]. There is not believed to be a link between the current cases and the outbreak of _Legionella pneumophila_ in southwest Edinburgh in 2012 that killed 4 people and left 100 more infected.

NHS Lothian last night [13 Sep 2013] issued this guidance to gardeners to avoid contracting the bug for anyone handling garden mixes -- bagged or unbagged -- such as potting mix, mulches, composts, and garden soils: Read and follow any manufacturers' instructions on the bag; open any compost or potting mix bags carefully, if possible using a blade; wear gloves when handling compost; keep the door open in greenhouses or sheds when potting-up plants or filling hanging baskets; wear a mask if the air is dusty, particularly indoors; wash hands immediately after use of compost; if you are going to smoke while gardening, please wash your hands before doing so.

[Legionnaires' disease is caused usually by inhalation of aerosols containing _Legionella_ species; more than 70 percent of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf).

_L. longbeachae_ is found in soil and potting mix (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV: _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387), and legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil. Australian potting soil is reportedly not sterilized during manufacture and contains a complex mixture of bacteria and free-living amoebae; elevated storage temperatures appear to foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in potting soil. Unlike _L. longbeachae_, _L. pneumophila_ is found in water sources, such as natural aquatic bodies, including rivers, lakes, and thermally polluted waters.

The primary transmission mode is believed to be inhalation of dust from contaminated potting mix, compost, or soil. Wetting down the potting mix to reduce the dust and wearing a facemask when using potting mix have been suggested as methods to prevent infection with this organism (http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/Legionnaires_disease.aspx).

_L. longbeachae_ was first isolated from a patient in Long Beach, California. In addition to Australia and New Zealand, cases of legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ have been reported in other countries including the USA (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, potting soil - USA: May-Jun 2000 20000904.1503), Japan (Koide M, Saito A, Okazaki M, et al: Isolation of _Legionella longbeachae_ serogroup 1 from potting soils in Japan. Clin Infect Dis 1999; 29(4): 943-4; available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/943.long; and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17929472), and the UK (ProMED-mail posts Legionellosis, hotel - UK (02): (Scotland) background 20110328.0974 and Legionellosis - UK: (Scotland) L. longbeachae, compost, fatal 20120529.1148827).

Although healthy individuals can contract this disease, legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

Lothian is a region of the Scottish Lowlands, lying between the southern shore of the Firth of Forth and the Lammermuir Hills and includes Edinburgh City (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothian).
