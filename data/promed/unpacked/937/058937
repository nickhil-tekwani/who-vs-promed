[The previous report on this outbreak included no horses. Their involvement strongly indicates that tabanid haemophagic biting flies were involved. Horses are large, attractive black-body targets for the female flies. There is no further information on the original source for this outbreak on the northwest border with Russia. But if tabanids were involved with the Kazak horses the 1st flight of flies may have come from a Russian outbreak within 5-15 km. With thanks to Cristina for this prepared report. - Mod.MHJ
