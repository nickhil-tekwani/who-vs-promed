Last week [last of October 2020], wild bighorn sheep herds in Washington and Oregon have been detected with deadly pneumonia, likely caused by a deadly pathogen spread by domestic sheep grazing on public lands. The bighorn are dying slow and painful deaths because they have no natural immunity to the livestock-borne disease.

In Washington, the Department of Fish and Wildlife announced that deadly pneumonia had been detected in the Cleman Mountain herd of bighorn sheep, located primarily in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest northwest of Yakima. A day later, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife announced the detection of pneumonia in the Burnt River herd, southeast of Baker City. Both herds of bighorn likely contracted the illness from domestic sheep or goats.

The Forest Service has been failing to address the threat that domestic sheep allotments pose to bighorn sheep, making infections all but inevitable. Bighorn sheep pneumonia is caused by pathogens carried by domestic sheep and goats, who typically remain asymptomatic themselves. The pathogens, which include the primary infectious agent _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ as well as a variety of bacteria that act as secondary agents to make bighorn sheep ill, originally traveled with domestic sheep from the old world to the new. The bacteria reached the American West in the mid-1800s as enormous bands of domestic sheep were brought to graze lush mountain meadows throughout the region, decimating populations of bighorn sheep, who hadn't evolved with the bacteria and thus had no natural immunity. Several states saw their bighorn populations extirpated entirely, while others saw them reduced to a fraction of historic numbers. The bighorn deaths have continued for more than a century, reducing the remaining native herds as well as reestablished herds through sudden all-age die-offs and through subsequent annual losses of lambs, who can contract the bacteria from their mothers long after the initial disease event appears to have passed.

Science tells us that domestic sheep need to stay far away from bighorn in order to keep our wildlife safe -- that is, social distancing for the Bovidae. But the Forest Service is going to need to start making firm decisions about grazing permits, taking the political heat, and giving priority to native wildlife.

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a complex multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggest that these events may be linked to a shared environmental determinant.

However, recent evidence indicates that in the northwestern USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ (Mo), an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids. This has implications for land use and management practices and creates room for conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders.

Recent research showed that one mechanism by which the pathogen persists in bighorn sheep populations is by chronic carriers. Experimental removal of Mo chronic carrier ewes proved to significantly reduce the risk of infection and mortality due to this disease (https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6146). These results hinted that Mo is a primary causative agent of persistent or recurrent respiratory disease in bighorn sheep populations and can be maintained by a few chronic carriers.
