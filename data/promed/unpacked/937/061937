The Epidemiological Surveillance of Assisi recorded the death of a 21 year old woman in the early hours of 3 Apr 2014 caused by spotted fever. It is the 1st confirmed case of the disease in 2014.

According to the nurse responsible for Epidemiological Surveillance of Assisi, Nilsa Milk, the probable location of the infestation of the ixodid tick, _Amblyomma cajennnese_, i.e. where the young girl was bitten, will be investigated by the Superintendent of Endemic Disease Control.

There is suspicion that the tick may have been brought by a paternal uncle who stayed at a ranch of Porto de Almeida during the week before he came to the house. "The location cited by the mother also will have to be investigated, as well as other possibilities," says Nilsa.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _R. rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains and also in parts of southern Canada, Central, and South America.

It cannot be stressed enough that early recognition of this disease is quite important in minimizing morbidity and mortality. This is especially true in areas where the infection is not as classically known. The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (an area that is red and has small, confluent bumps) at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial (red or purple spots caused by minor hemorrhage) and purpuric (purple spots) involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
