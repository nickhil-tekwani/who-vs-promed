The National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) said on Friday [31 May 2013] that 15 children have died from dengue fever in the 1st 19 weeks of this year [2013], while the mosquitoborne disease infected 2527 people during the same period.

NDCP Director Ngan Chantha lamented the 15 deaths but noted that the fatalities were fewer than in the same period last year [2012], when 17 children died and 3651 were infected, and the situation was much improved from the epidemic year of 2007, when 57 children died throughout the country in the 19 week timeframe.

"Although we have seen a decreasing number of dengue infections, we still need to pay attention to dengue prevention for fear of a new outbreak," Mr Chantha told a crowd of some 1200 high school students who were participating in a dengue awareness raising walk from Chaktomuk High-School to Wat Botum.

"[Dengue] fever has decreased by 46 per cent during the 1st 19 weeks of this year [2013] compared to same period in 2012," he said.
