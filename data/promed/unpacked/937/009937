According to Agence France-Presse [AFP], experts from the World Health Organization [WHO] investigation team visited the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan on Sunday [31 Jan 2021]. More than a year ago, the first reported new corona [COVID-19] pneumonia epidemic was related to this market.

Since January last year [2020], the South China Seafood Market has been under lockdown. According to an AFP reporter at the scene, after WHO experts entered the market, security personnel immediately set up roadblocks to prohibit others from entering. A member of the delegation, Peter Daszak, tweeted that this field visit is "essential to understanding the epidemiological principles of the new coronavirus that began to spread in late 2019".

WHO experts did not accept questions from reporters at the scene, and security personnel asked the media personnel waiting outside to leave. Later, a reporter shouted loudly and asked whether the experts were satisfied with the visit. One of the members of the investigation team responded with a thumbs up.

On Sunday morning [31 Jan 2021] local time, the WHO expert team also visited the Baishazhou Market in Wuhan. It is reported that the experts' vehicle drove directly into the market, and other personnel including the media were turned away. When the car entered the market, a loudspeaker played a notice: "It is forbidden to display imported cold chain food; retail cold chain food is prohibited".

Chinese officials are promoting the heroic success of its anti-epidemic actions, emphasizing that China not only has controlled the number of deaths from the new corona pneumonia to a low level of more than 4000 but also has put the national economy on a recovery track.

On Saturday [30 Jan 2021], the WHO investigation team in Wuhan was arranged to visit the "Wuhan Anti-epidemic Achievements Exhibition," aimed at highlighting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Earlier, the WHO investigation team visited 2 hospitals in Wuhan and talked with the first-line medical staff in the earliest stages of the epidemic. The itinerary of the WHO investigation team is not public, and reporters from various countries in Wuhan can only learn the location of their visit by following the investigation team's vehicle. The members of the investigation team also did not directly accept media interviews.

The director of WHO's emergency response department, Michael Ryan, told the outside world on 29 Jan 2021 that the WHO investigation team's first visit to China may not necessarily be able to find the origin of the virus immediately and accurately. The task now is to collect all data, carry out an assessment, and determine what other studies are needed to explore the source of the new coronavirus.

[The inclusion of a visit to the Baishazhou Wholesale market, Wuhan on the itinerary of an expert team tasked to investigate the source of SARS-CoV-2 deserves to be explained. The market, which was suspected to be the source or hub of the pandemic, is the Huanan Seafood market. In contrast to the previous mission (WHO China Joint Mission on COVID-19, 16-24 Feb 2020, 24 members), the current WHO investigation team includes veterinarians to address the animal side of the issue.

The alarming public health situation that emerged in Wuhan in late December 2019 prescribed application of severe control measures in the Huanan market, regarded at that time as the hub of the epidemic. According to traditional animal health criteria for the control of a rapidly spreading animal pathogen, such measures include a declaration of "standstill" of the affected animal population. The movement prohibition allows the immediate exercising of control measures such as clinical inspections of the animals, their sampling, testing, and -- if required -- stamping out (culling, incineration, and disinfection). The power to exercise such measures is derived from the country's primary legislation.

To the present day, there is no information on sampling of live animals in the Huanan market or their testing results, in vivo or in vitro, prior to or following Huanan's closing down (31 Dec 2019-1 Jan 2020). There are no official data on the animal species present in the market prior to its closure, nor their numbers and clinical status. Have the animals, in the absence of authority to act (or of timely action), escaped examination, sampling, testing, and possibly culling? Were the Chinese veterinary authorities empowered to act as professionally required? The issue was public health; no animal disease was observed or suspected.

ProMED has repeatedly published requests for information on the said issues since the early days of the pandemic, remaining pending (most recently in 20210121.8124456). The recent publication of revisions in China's national legislation, going through a fast track, may indicate that China's authorities are cognizant of such shortcomings and have forcefully undertaken their correction (see item 2, further). - Mod.AS]

[2] Revision of China's Animal Epidemic Prevention Law
Date: Tue 26 Jan 2021
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/26/chinas-new-animal-health-rules-alone-wont-stop-zoonotic-outbreaks-experts-warn


China's top lawmakers last week approved revisions to the country's law on preventing the spread of animal diseases. Amendments to the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law, due to come into force in May [2021], were accelerated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The outbreak of the deadly pig disease African swine fever (ASF), which has decimated [sic] as much as 40% of China's pig production since 2018, has been an added impetus for reform.

The new measures include a system of quarantine standards for captive bred wildlife; revisions to a system for classifying animal epidemics based on their potential impact on human health, the economy and the public; compulsory vaccinations; and stipulations for veterinarians to pass qualification tests.

However, observers said the challenge was poor enforcement of rules rather than the need for new ones [see comment]. "If China is truly to prevent and tackle future viruses, it is immensely important that the revised law is not simply adopted or revised and then ignored," Peter J Li, a China policy specialist at the Humane Society International, told the Guardian. Li said existing laws were already strong enough to have prevented both the COVID-19 pandemic and the SARS epidemic but that rules largely were not followed or enforced.

Anyone raising captive bred wildlife must already ensure that animals pass health inspections and quarantines, but these rules are not strictly followed within the wildlife farming community, he said. Central and local government authorities who view the wildlife trade as a cash cow do little to enforce the law. It is already prohibited to transport animals without health certification and to fail to report outbreaks. Existing rules mandated wastewater treatment and sterilisation facilities; and rules requiring farms, slaughterhouses and processing facilities to be located far from human activity were on the books, he said. "Unfortunately, these articles have universally been violated or held in contempt by the animal-related businesses, and local authorities have failed massively to enforce the law," Li said.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization and WHO both declined to comment on the amendments when contacted by the Guardian.

"The Chinese government, especially the local health and law enforcement authorities, must put more efforts and resources into policing and enforcing the laws," said Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and an expert in China's animal-related laws. "Otherwise, the laws will just be reduced to, as the Chinese say, empty words on a piece of paper."

Increasing the number of qualified veterinarians across China to help with inspections, quarantines, and general animal health is seen as an important step. According to Wang Gongmin, deputy chief of the agriculture ministry's Department of Veterinary Services, by 2018, China had around 100 000 veterinarians, but the country needs nearly 400 000 to adequately address animal disease prevention.

The problem is particularly acute in rural areas where pay is low and recently graduated veterinarians are less likely to go. Opening a pet shop and clinic in a major city is much more profitable. "Producing more veterinarians can be a solution, and licensing the existing veterinary practitioners may be a short-cut," Li said.

While China moved to stop all breeding of wildlife for meat consumption in mid-2020, it still allows the use of wildlife for fur farming, traditional Chinese medicine, and other similar uses, raising concerns of the potential for disease in the absence of proper biosecurity measures. The wildlife ban angered thousands of farmers who had been encouraged to raise wildlife by local government. Many breeders still do not understand why they were shut down with no proof that the COVID-19 virus came from the species of animal they raised.

"I used to raise pigs, then ASF hit, and my pigs were culled. Then I turned to raising bamboo rats, and then this happened," said a 34 year old former soldier turned farmer in Fujian province. "The authorities made a mistake [in thinking bamboo rats spread COVID-19], but the country just went with it, and now we're suffering as a result," he said.

[Z] from Hunan province, who had raised nearly 500 bamboo rats, said he was only able to get 27 000 yuan (USD 4178) in compensation for his culled animals, although he had invested over 120 000 yuan in the operation. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, no inspectors or veterinary authorities ever came to check on his bamboo rat business, which he had operated since 2013, Z said. "This is a special type of farming, and there are just too many of us for that."

[Comprehensive explanation of the stepwise development of the revised Animal Epidemic Prevention Law and background on the revisions included, published after the final endorsement of its 3rd draft by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, is available (in Chinese) at http://www.npc.gov.cn/wszb/zb14/zzzb14.shtml.

The following selected 3 explanatory notes are available at http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/dwfyfxdca003/202101/5d4958df985f44a88b7de48639d44b21.shtml:

1. In order to make it more clear that the degree of harm to human health and the degree of economic loss and social impact of animal diseases are used as the basis for the classification of animal diseases, the 3rd review draft has been revised to classify animal diseases into "particularly serious harm to humans and animals," "serious hazards," and "hazards," as well as, in relation to economic loss and social impact, "significant," "larger," and "a certain degree," are used as the basis for the classification of animal diseases into the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd categories.

2. The lack of relevant quarantine regulations is a shortcoming in the current work on the prevention and control of wild animal epidemics. The 3rd review draft adds relevant provisions: The State Council's agricultural and rural administrative department, together with the State Council's wildlife protection department, formulates wild animal quarantine measures.

3. Animal epidemic prevention work should focus on the role of social forces. The 3rd review draft adds regulations to encourage and support practicing veterinarians, rural veterinarians, animal diagnosis and treatment institutions, and related enterprises to carry out animal epidemic prevention and provide epidemic prevention services.

The full revised text of the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law (in Chinese), which will take effect on 1 May 2021, is available at https://tinyurl.com/y5ror2ye (An official English version is expected to become available later).

Additional information is available at https://npcobserver.com/legislation/animal-epidemic-prevention-law/.

China's revisions in the relevant legislation are a step forward; however, and as expressed in some views presented in the above Guardian report, China's attempts to prevent another zoonotic disease outbreak will fail without deep changes in enforcement, oversight, extensive investment, and the involvement of local governments (municipal veterinary units) to ramp up veterinary capacity. - Mod.AS
