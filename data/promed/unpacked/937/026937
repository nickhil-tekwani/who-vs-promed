The Virginia Zoo announced on Wed 6 Aug 2014 that 3 young cassowary chicks died from eastern equine encephalitis EEE).

According to the zoo, 2 of the 28-day-old chicks were found dead on the morning of 17 Jul 2014, and a 3rd died later that day. The zoo said one of the parent birds also died, but test results have not yet been completed.

Tests were performed when the rare birds died, and EEE was confirmed as the cause of death on 4 Aug 2014. The zoo described EEE as a mosquito-borne viral infection that can be fatal in both humans and animals. The deaths of the birds were reported to the relevant agencies.

The Norfolk Department of Health reported there were no EEE positives in any of the mosquito pools or sentinel chickens in Norfolk, according to a news release from the zoo.

The zoo said there have been no published cases of cassowary deaths resulting from EEE, and there is no bird-specific vaccine for the virus. There is an equine vaccine, and the zoo said their remaining cassowaries were vaccinated.

[EEE is caused by a virus transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Serological evidence suggests that numerous species of birds are exposed to this virus.

Cassowaries (_Casuarius_ spp.), like ostriches, are flightless birds known as ratites. They are native to the tropical forests of New Guinea, nearby islands, and northeastern Australia. For a picture, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary#mediaviewer/File:Jurong_Southern_Cassowary.jpg.
