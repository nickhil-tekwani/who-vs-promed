Dr Abiboulaye Sall, deputy chief medical officer of the regional capital health center announced Sunday [30 Jun 2013] that Fatick region, with a rate of 23 percent, has the highest number of notified dog bites to humans.

"Dog bite cases are quite common" in Fatick, said Dr Sall during a rabies information meeting, for journalists. According to him, in 2012, 2 people had contracted rabies. "This year [2013], he announced, one case has been recorded and it is estimated that for each patient detected or reported, there are 100 cases unreported. So, for these 3 patients diagnosed, an estimated 300 have not been reported" to health facilities, he said, stressing that the exposure to rabies in Fatick region is common because of the many stray dogs.

According to Dr Sall, due to the high rate of dog bites, a unit to treat victims of dog bites and rabies has been opened to serve the Fatick Health District, in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute of Dakar and the Department of Infectious Diseases at Fann (Dakar). Treatment [presumably post-exposure immunisation] of a dog bite costs 40 000 CFA francs [about Euro 60, USD 80], he said.

[It is unclear precisely how many of the presumed 300 victims of dog bites will have actually contracted rabies virus infection, and likewise what proportion of the canine population can transmit rabies.
