Bulletin: Cholera and AWD Outbreaks in Eastern and Southern Africa, Regional
---------------------------------------------------------------
Approximately 3385 cholera / AWD cases including 19 deaths have been reported in 10 out of the 21 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa Region (ESAR), with an average case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%, since the beginning of 2019. These countries include Angola, Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Somalia, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Kenya accounts for 35.4% (1198) of the total case load reported in 2019, followed by Mozambique at 31% (1048).

Of the 10 countries with reported cholera / AWD outbreaks in ESAR since week 1 of 2019, 6 (Mozambique, Tanzania, Somalia, Kenya, Zambia, and Burundi) have ongoing cholera outbreaks. During the week under review, Mozambique reported the highest number of new cases (1048 cases). Tanzania and Burundi have recorded the highest CFR in 2019 at 1.3% and 1%, respectively, of the countries with active outbreaks.

Mozambique: Cholera cases in cyclone-hit Mozambique and its associated flooding have risen to 1048 cases including 1 death (CFR 0.09%). The Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of cholera on 27 Mar 2019 with cases reported in Beira and Nhamatanda districts. Recent assessments have shown that health facilities have been destroyed by the cyclone, complicating response efforts. The disease is a major concern for the hundreds of thousands of cyclone survivors in the southern African nation now living in squalid conditions in camps, schools, or damaged homes. Some [people] drink from contaminated wells or filthy, stagnant water. The 1st round of an oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign is starting on 3 Apr 2019, with the 2nd round of vaccination planned in 3 months. The OCV campaign will target Beira, Buzi, Dondo, and Nhamatanda.

Tanzania: An increase in the epidemic trend has been noted in the last 2 weeks. During week 12 (week ending 24 Mar 2019), 38 new cases were reported, compared to 23 cases reported in week 11 (week ending 17 Mar 2019). This raises the total number of cholera cases reported since the beginning of 2019 to 154, including 2 deaths (CFR 1.3 %). All new cases emerged from Tanga region in the following areas: Korogwe DC (24), Korogwe TC (11), and Handeni DC (3). Cumulatively, a total of 33 475 cases including 552 deaths have been reported since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2015.

Somalia: A slight increase in the epidemic trend has been noted in the last 2 weeks. During week 11, 34 new cases were reported from Banadir region compared to 32 cases reported in week 10 (week ending 10 Mar 2019). Cumulatively a total of 635 cases with no deaths have been reported since the beginning of 2019. Children under 5 years bear the brunt of the cholera outbreak, representing 50% of the total case load reported in week 10 and 44% in epidemiological week 11. During the last 2 weeks, the most affected district in Banadir was Madina, accounting for 27.5% (12/32) of the total number of cases reported during week 10 and 26.5% (9/34) of total cases reported in week 11. Overall (from epidemiological week 8-11), the Banadir districts with the highest case numbers are Madina (36), followed by Daynile (24).

Kenya: Since January 2019, cholera outbreaks have been reported in Narok, Kajiado, Nairobi, Garissa, and Machakos counties. As of 1 Apr 2019, a cumulative total of 1198 cases including 4 deaths (CFR 0.3%) have been reported in these counties since the beginning of 2019. Nairobi and Machakos are the latest counties to report confirmed cases of cholera. During the week under review (epidemiological week 13), 26 new cases were reported from Nairobi (16), Garissa (6), and Machakos (4) counties.

Zambia: The latest cholera outbreak notified on 22 Mar 2019 hit Nsama district in Northern province. The index case, a 9-year-old child from Chaushi village, developed signs and symptoms on 16 Mar 2019. As of 31 Mar 2019, a cumulative total of 88 suspected cases and 4 deaths (CFR 4.5%) have been reported since the onset of the new outbreak.

Burundi: As of 1 Apr 2019, 206 cases including 2 deaths (CFR 0.97%) were recorded since the onset of the cholera epidemic on 18 Dec 2018. Of these, a total of 104 cases including 1 death (CFR 0.96%) have been reported since the beginning of 2019. Cases recorded since the beginning of 2019 emerged from 3 provinces: Bujumbura (56), Rumonge (45), and Cibitoke (3).

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018, 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 l [4.2 qt] in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
