Nearly all the 3.5 million fall chinook salmon smolts scheduled for
release from Ringold Springs Hatchery near the Tri-Cities on the
upper Columbia River have died, probably due to botulism poisoning.
The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said the 5-month-old
fish represent about 20 percent of the fall chinook salmon smolts for
release from the upper Columbia.
The vast majority of fall chinook in the upper Columbia River are
wild fish, originating from the Hanford Reach, the free-flowing
stretch downstream of Priest Rapids Dam.
John Kerwin, hatcheries division manager, said the 3-inch smolts
began dying shortly after they were transported in mid-May 2006 from
Oregon's Bonneville Hatchery to Ringold.
Tests for routine viruses and bacterial infections came back
negative. There were no problems at Bonneville Hatchery, which rears
the fish under an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Two weeks ago, Washington officials learned 2 of 10 samples sent to
Cornell University tested positive for the bacteria that produce
botulism. "We're still waiting for the results from other tests, but
botulism appears to be the most likely suspect," Kerwin said.
Botulism can be toxic to humans as well as fish. But Mira Leslie, an
epidemiologist for the Washington Department of Health, said there is
little risk to humans. "Botulism in humans is a rare disease," she
said. "Unless someone were to eat these small fish raw, I really
don't see any human health risk."
Kerwin said the dead fish were covered in lime and buried on the
hatchery grounds to kill botulism toxins.
The last botulism poisoning at Ringold was in spring chinook in 1999.
The earthen floor and sides of the rearing pond at Ringold could be
the source of the botulism toxin, Kerwin said. The pond is 9 acres
with depths up to 12 feet, making it difficult to monitor the
condition of the fish.
Requests for money to split the pond into more manageable units have
been denied.
