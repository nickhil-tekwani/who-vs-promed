Russian authorities have confirmed an outbreak of avian influenza on a 500 000-bird commercial farm in Kostromskaya, a region to the north-west of the country.

According to the disease report, sequencing analysis showed the virus (H5N2) belonged to the Asian strain which has been detected in multiple wild bird and poultry cases across Asia, Africa and Europe since 2014.

There have been no human cases associated with H5N2 HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) infection in areas where it circulates.

The latest outbreak of H5N2 HPAI is overlapped by 3 migration flyways - the Central Asian, the West Asian and the East Atlantic and it is this flyway which also brings wild migratory waterfowl to the UK.

Therefore, as the autumn migration season approaches, the risk to the UK will start to increase. If wild birds are involved in the long-distance movement of the virus, poultry farms in north-east and north-west Europe may be at risk in the coming months.

Since early June [2018], 67 outbreaks of H5 have been reported in commercial poultry across several regions of western Russia. However, in backyard flocks there is no information on the full strain identification.

If Russia's outbreaks are all caused by the H5N2 HPAI virus and if this virus is not poultry-adapted and therefore can jump into wild waterfowl, then migratory waterfowl may have only partial immunity if they were exposed to H5N6 HPAI last year or H5N8 HPAI in the previous year.

A Defra spokesman said: "We strongly recommend that all poultry keepers - including backyard keepers - should familiarise themselves with government guidance on good biosecurity and how to report suspicion of disease appropriately."

[The Russian HPAI H5N2 recent outbreak on a commercial poultry farm in Kostroma, addressed in the above report, was reported to the OIE on 16 Aug 2018 (see 20180818.5972764). Out of 498 485 susceptible birds, 506 died (reported as "cases"), 1223 were "killed and disposed of"; no stamping out applied.

The following commentary was included in the above reported "immediate notification": "The virus isolate was identified as H5N2 subtype by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The comparative analysis of the obtained nucleotide sequences of the H gene and N gene fragments revealed that the isolate belongs to the Asian genetic lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza (Clade 2.3.4.4.) which spread in the Russian Federation as well as in Asian, European, Middle Eastern and African countries in 2016-2018. The hemagglutinin cleavage site has a -REKRRKRGLF- structure, characterizing the virus as potentially highly virulent".

DEFRA's message, and their advice to all UK poultry keepers -- with special reference to backyard keepers --, to apply good biosecurity and to report suspicion of disease appropriately, deserves to be followed throughout the EU and Europe at large. - Mod.AS]
