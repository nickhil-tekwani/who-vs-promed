All the animals at a Phillipsburg game farm will be killed, to prevent
the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD). An elk on the farm
died of the disease 3 weeks ago. State officials received
confirmation of the diagnosis on Wednesday.
The animals at the David Kessler farm have been under quarantine
since June 1998. Another elk from the Kessler farm died of the
disease in Oklahoma. CWD strikes deer and elk, and causes brain
damage. State officials say it's similar to "mad cow" disease in
cattle.
