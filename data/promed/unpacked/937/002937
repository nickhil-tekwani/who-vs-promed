Some 1500 people die annually from rabies in the United Republic of Tanzania alone, according to scientific estimates. Official numbers are lower, because many cases are not reported and not all reported cases appear in the official statistics. Most rabies victims are children and dog bites are the main path of transmission.

Rabies is an infectious disease of public health concern for the entire East African region and beyond. Against this backdrop, the EAC Secretariat supports the World Rabies Day, which takes place on [Thu 28 Sep 2017], through the 'Support to Pandemic Preparedness in the EAC Region' project that is implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on behalf of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Rabies is the most fatal virus zoonosis (disease that can be transmitted between animals and humans) known to mankind. Once an infected person shows signs, there is no cure to rabies. In Africa and Asia, many humans get infected by rabies through dog bites. The World Health Organization (WHO) underscores the importance of dog vaccination as the most effective intervention against rabies, decreasing rabies in dogs and having a direct impact on public health by reducing transmission to humans.

Supported by the EAC Secretariat, WHO and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) among others, Mbwa Wa Africa Animal Rescue will vaccinate an estimated 5000 dogs across 20 vaccination stations in Arusha City on World Rabies Day. In addition, Mbwa Wa Africa raises awareness in about 70 schools in Arusha on how to safely approach dogs and on how to read possible signs of rabies infection and to distinguish infected from healthy dogs. Weekly rabies awareness articles will be published in both English and Swahili newspapers.

The activities are planned in collaboration with the Arusha City Council in liaison with the Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries and the Ministry of Health.

A total of 11 people died in the province of Cuanza Norte during the 1st half of this year [2017], victims of rabies, after having been attacked by infected dogs. This means 10 more [than the number of rabies cases] during the same [period during] 2016, informed the supervisor of the epidemiological surveillance area in the Provincial Health Department, Kende Alfredo.

On [Thu 28 Sep 2017], World Rabies Day, the official said that the reported cases occurred among a total of 768 people bitten by dogs, cats and monkeys in the province.

He made it known that the Cazengo municipality (the county capital of the province) leads the statistics with 8 deaths related to rabies among 370 cases of dog bites.

Compared to the same period of 2016, Kende Alfredo said that there was an increase of 431 cases of animal bites, justifying this increase with the high number of stray dogs that circulate in the streets of different localities of the province.

The above report was originally submitted by Dr Neida Ramos to ProMED-PORT (in Portuguese). The moderator, RNA, acknowledged the sender and included, in the commentary, request for additional information on canine rabies control strategies in Angola as well as on the prevailing and applied pre-and post-exposure prevention strategies for humans. He asked if the reported cases received any kind of post-exposure care, including serovaccination and if the post-exposure treatment was complete and timely.

According to the most recent available annual report of Angola to the OIE, the number of dogs vaccinated against rabies during 2015 was 429 165; 85 cases of rabies in (dead) dogs were reported.

The number of officially reported human cases, countrywide, during recent years was:
2013 - 111; 2014 - 91; 2015 - 69. The data for 2016 are not yet available. - Mod.AS

Over the past month cases of rabies have been reported in the King Cetshwayo District (Eshowe to Richards Bay), moving south through the Ilembe District
(Ndwedwe and Maphumulo) into Inanda township in Durban - and now in the greater Ballito area.

Most recently Sables Creatures volunteer, Dee Allan picked up an aggressive stray puppy running from Salt Rock to Ballito on Ocean Drive on [Thu 14 Sep 2017]
last week and took it to Aloe Veterinary Clinic in Ballito.

It was put to sleep and yesterday [Tue 19 Sep 2017] the results from the post mortem revealed that it tested positive for rabies.

Salt Rock Veterinary Clinic's Dr Janet Hulbert said a white, female holidaymaker reported at their clinic after being bitten by a dog on [Thu 14 Sep 2017]
last week.

"We now have reason to be very concerned that the same dog that bit her was the one that was euthanased at another local veterinary clinic the same day,
and has been confirmed as rabid on post mortem.

She said it was urgent that the holidaymaker was found immediately.

"If you are bitten by any animal, it is important to immediately wash the wound with hot water and soap for 15 minutes and go to a doctor straight away."

Aloe Veterinary Clinic's Dr Jeremy Lamb said it was crucial that the public did not touch strays.

"Any animal can get rabies if they are not vaccinated and are bitten by a rabid animal," said Dr Lamb, who has never before seen a rabies case in his
clinic.

He said rabies is a viral disease, affecting the central nervous system. It is spread through contact with the saliva of infected animals, through bites
or any break in the skin.

"Make sure your pets' annual vaccinations are all up to date.

"Vaccination will provide your pet with much greater resistance to rabies if he is exposed to the disease, but you must be aware that there is no cure once it occurs."

He said the only way to confirm if a dog has rabies is by putting the dog to sleep and examining the brain to test for rabies.

"If you have been bitten by an animal, go to the hospital straight away to get treatment. There is no point in taking the risk."

The above report from South Africa should serve as reminder of the crucial piece of information: never pick up a stray puppy, including the ones which look sad and needy. Dogs can get infected from their earliest age if their mothers were not vaccinated, threatening the life of contacts. Puppies have been found notoriously a common source of human infection, in particular of children. - Mod.AS

The death of a 2-year-old from rabies in north-east KZN has prompted the KZN Veterinary Services to step-up the fight against the disease.

KZN Veterinary staff have reduced animal rabies by 90 percent in the province over a period of time since 2007 (473 cases down to 47).

Spokesman Khaye Nkwanyana said the shock death of the baby had 'strengthened our resolve to fight and combat it so that no additional life must be lost through rabies.'

"Until recently, the province has been human rabies free, working in partnership with World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation conducted mass dog vaccination programmes that broke the disease across the province, and established KZN as the Africa leader in rabies control."

"The Province is now on a massive drive to eliminate rabies completely in order to prevent more human deaths. What we are targeting is the vaccination
of more than 70 percent of the dogs in these Districts as they remain the main source of the disease for the rest of province. We have taken a decision to
set aside a budget for the next 6-month intensification of the vaccination programme, especially in rural areas working with local authorities."

Residents of the capital Sanaa and other governorates are suffering from the daily attacks of stray dogs which have raised the incidence rate of suspected rabies to 30-40 cases/day. According to the rabies control officer at the Republican hospital in Sanaa, the number of rabies cases this year, 2017, has reached 248 cases with 16 deaths among them. He attributed this rise in human rabies cases to the absence of rabies control programme activities due to lack of funding.

The human rabies cases statistics described above in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, illustrate the need for effective control efforts directed to minimize the risk of human exposure, which seems to be inevitable due to the collapsing health infrastructure. The rabies related fatalities mentioned above may be due to the lack of post-exposure prophylaxis for the victims plus the absence of a rabies vaccination program for animals, especially dogs. - Mod.MM

The statement "the number of rabies cases this year, 2017, has reached 248 cases with 16 deaths among them" is in need of some discourse. A human rabies "case" would generally mean that the patient has been suffering clinical signs suspected to be rabies. Such cases are practically always fatal. In the current event, the reporter probably attributed the term "cases" to people exposed to rabies (eg bitten by a rabid animal). The number of such has been, according to the above report, 248. The number of "cases" was, at the time of the reporting, 16 and the incidence rate, at the time of the reporting, 6.45 percent. This rate could increase if, during that point in time, some of the 248 exposed persons were incubating the disease. - Mod.AS]

A family of 9 in Nkayi has been put under surveillance as it is feared to have contracted rabies after consuming milk from a cow that had been bitten by a stray rabid dog.

The family admitted to have milked the cow for over a month until it died last week [week of Sun 3 Sep 2017] after it had been bitten by the dog.

Rabies in humans is fatal in most cases and infected people slowly become paralysed and eventually slip into a coma and die.

Nkayi District Medical Officer Dr Thabani Moyo said the family reported to the Department of Veterinary Services after their cow suddenly died [comment] and tests confirmed that it had succumbed to rabies. Dr Moyo said even though the family members are not showing any signs and symptoms of rabies, there are fears that they contracted it after milking an infected cow and consuming its milk for a month.

"The family members who are not yet showing signs and symptoms of rabies are under surveillance," said Dr Moyo.

He said environmental health technicians are monitoring the family which has since purchased the anti-rabies vaccine. Dr Moyo said it can take between 2 months and 6 years before humans can show signs and symptoms of rabies.

"Rabies can be contracted through consuming products from a rabid animal," said Dr Moyo.

"The family admitted to have been milking the cow since August [2017] until it died.

"They reported the matter to the veterinary services who took samples from the carcass [comment] which tested rabies positive. We received the report and advised the family to procure treatment as it was possible that they could have contracted the disease."

Dr Moyo said it was unfortunate that there is no rabies vaccine in the district but the family was advised to purchase the vaccine elsewhere.

"A family member, Mr Roni Ndlovu has since managed to secure the rabies vaccine for his family in Bulawayo, costing up to USD 45 per full course per person," he said.

Matabeleland North Provincial Medical Director Dr Nyasha Masuka urged all people who own dogs to ensure that they are vaccinated.

"All stray dogs should be reported to the local Department of Livestock and Veterinary Services so that they can be put down. If anyone is bitten by a dog they should find out the vaccination status of the dog from the owner.

"If the dog is not vaccinated or if people are not sure, they should go to the nearest health facility for treatment and rabies vaccination.

"Other animals like donkeys and cattle can bite human beings if they are infected with rabies and people should quickly report such unusual behavior by domestic animals," he said.

According to the report, the suspected cow was milked for over a month after it had been bitten by a "stray rabid dog", then died "suddenly" leading the family to report the case to the Department of Veterinary Services. This deserves some deliberation:
1. Generally, rabies infected animals - including cattle - show, during the final stages of their life, some clinical signs caused by the affection of their central nervous system (brain). In milking animals, this may be accompanied by drop in the milk yield, which, by itself, is also a sign of disease. "Sudden" death may occur but is exceptional.
2. Human cases due to non-bite exposures to rabies are very rare. Scratches, abrasions, open wounds, and mucous membranes contaminated with saliva or other potentially infectious material (such as brain tissue) from a rabid animal constitute non-bite exposures. Inhalation of aerosolized rabies virus is also a potential non-bite route of exposure, but other than laboratory workers, most people are unlikely to encounter aerosolized rabies virus. There are no published studies that have demonstrated the presence of rabies virus in cow milk. Although transmission of rabies virus from consuming unpasteurized milk from an infected animal is theoretically possible, no human has ever been reported to develop rabies via this route. Milk that has been heat pasteurized presents no risk for rabies virus transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/news/2005-12-23.html).
3.Those who have attended the rabid cow during her last week of life could have been exposed to the virus which is particularly present in the saliva. The decision to apply post-exposure treatment is fully justified and necessary.
4. When a farm animal is known to have been bitten by a wild animal, or by a dog suspected to be rabid, the incident deserves immediate reporting to the veterinary authorities who are entrusted with the issuance of relevant measures/guidelines. In any case, the bitten animal should remain under veterinary observation for at least 3 months. In some countries, the law allows the slaughter of the exposed animal within a limited time-frame (less than a week) immediately after the incident; in case not slaughtered - the bitten animal should be kept under observation, while forbidding its sale/movement to other location(s).

According to the report, "samples from the cow's carcass tested rabies positive". It may be assumed that the tested tissue was sampled from the cow's brain, the only animal tissue appropriate for rabies testing. - Mod.AS

[7] Rabies vaccine required globally - Comment
Date: Fri 29 Sep 2017
From: Merritt Clifton <Animals24.7@frontier.com> [edited]


Re: PRO/IN> PRO/AH/EDR> World Rabies Day 2017: eradication prospects discussed

It has been estimated that should [rabies vaccine for canines] production continue at 2015 levels, there will be a cumulative shortage of about 7.5 billion doses to meet expected demand to achieve dog rabies elimination by 2030.

On the other hand, if intensive ring vaccination is practiced in the relatively few areas where verifiable rabies cases are actually occurring, accompanied by saturation vaccination and dog sterilization in the hot zones, canine rabies should be eradicable by 2030 with the present vaccine supply, even though a much greater supply and more vaccination would be ideal.

The trick will be to accurately target the use of the available vaccines to where the most urgent need is.
