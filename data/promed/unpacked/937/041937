China confirms SARS infection in 2 previously reported cases -- update 4,
29 Apr 2004
-----------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported diagnostic confirmation
of SARS infection in 2 patients previously under investigation in Beijing.
Confirmation is based on the results of laboratory tests, clinical
symptoms, and a history of close contact with a known case.
Both patients are relatives -- the mother and an aunt -- of a 20 year old
nurse who treated what is thought to be the index case in the outbreak. The
nurse subsequently developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to
hospital on 7 Apr 2004. She was visited the next day by family members,
including the mother and aunt. The 44 year old mother is now in a critical
condition. The 36 year old aunt, who was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia
earlier this week, is in a stable condition. Both patients are part of a
3rd generation of cases that includes the nurse's father and 2 other
patients hospitalized on the same ward, including one patient who shared a
room with the nurse.
The number of SARS cases either clinically confirmed or under investigation
remains 9: 7 in Beijing and 2 (including the single fatality) in Anhui
Province. In Beijing, all 7 SARS cases are now being treated in isolation
at Ditan Hospital. This is a risk reduction strategy aimed at preventing
further spread through the hospital system.
According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,
classification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires
independent verification of results by an external international reference
laboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the
implications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public
health.

China reports additional SARS case -- update 3 28 April 2004
----------------------------------
Chinese health authorities have today announced that an additional case of
SARS is under investigation. This brings the total number of cases in
China, reported since 22 Apr 2004, to 9. Of these, one has died.
The new case in Beijing is a 49 year old woman retired doctor. On 12 Apr
2004, she was admitted to the same hospital ward where a 20 year old nurse
was being treated for pneumonia. The former doctor began developing
SARS-like symptoms on 19 Apr 2004 and on 22 Apr 2004 was transferred to
Ditan Hospital and placed in isolation. Her condition is listed as
critical. The 20 year old nurse, previously reported to WHO as a confirmed
case, has been linked to an additional 5 cases. These include the one
reported today and 4 reported on Sunday. To date, all cases have been
linked to chains of transmission involving close contact with an identified
case. The 2nd confirmed case, who remains hospitalized in Anhui Province,
is a 26 year old postgraduate student who had been conducting research at
the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. She is thought to be the
index case in the present outbreak.
During the 2003 outbreak, the transmission of SARS was greatly amplified in
hospital settings. As a risk reduction strategy in Beijing, all 7 SARS
cases are now being treated in Ditan Hospital. But patients were treated or
assessed in open wards at 7 hospitals (5 in Beijing and 2 in Anhui) before
suspicions of SARS were raised and procedures of isolation and infection
control were introduced. In addition, the 2 patients in Anhui travelled
long distances within China by train. As these events created opportunities
for multiple exposures, Chinese authorities have undertaken extensive
tracing and follow-up of contacts. In Beijing, nearly 700 persons have been
isolated or placed in quarantine.
SARS has a relatively long incubation period, generally accepted to be 10
days. Based on present knowledge about the disease, people exposed to the
virus are not infectious before the onset of symptoms. For these reasons,
rapid detection and isolation of cases, and rapid tracing and follow-up of
contacts have been used successfully to bring a SARS outbreak under control.
Investigation of the outbreak
Following a request by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the initial members
of a WHO team are now in Beijing to assist in the investigation and control
of the outbreaks there and in Anhui. Investigation of the source of
infection will focus initially on biosafety procedures at the National
Institute of Virology in Beijing. 2 of the 9 cases reported by China,
including the earliest case, were researchers at the institute, which has
been conducting work using the live SARS coronavirus.
Chinese authorities are providing WHO with detailed clinical and
epidemiological information on all cases. This information is important in
assessing the severity of illness caused by the virus and the extent of its
transmission. Of the 8 patients currently hospitalized for treatment, the
patient in Anhui Province continues to improve. In Beijing, 2 patients are
in critical condition, and the others remain under treatment for pneumonia.
If the source of infection is determined to come from the National
Institute of Virology in Beijing, this will be the first SARS outbreak
caused by a laboratory-acquired virus, which could possibly cause different
patterns of illness and transmission. Previous laboratory-associated cases
-- a single case each in Singapore in September 2003 and in Taiwan, China
in December 2003 -- did not result in any further transmission. Both cases
fully recovered.
In addition, 4 cases (3 confirmed and 1 probable) were reported in
Guangdong Province in December 2003 and January 2004, presumably acquired
from an environmental source. Unlike the present outbreak, these cases were
associated with mild illness only and did not result in secondary
transmission to others.

[Since the last update additional laboratory results have come in on 2
previously reported suspected cases. No reports of new cases associated
with this current outbreak have been reported in the past 24 hours.
According to the China MOH daily update, confirmation of SARS Co-V
infection in the 2 newly confirmed cases mentioned above was based on IgM
and IgG serologic findings. As mentioned in the discussion, official
confirmation will depend upon independent testing from an international
reference laboratory. Based on the clinical and epidemiologic pictures of
this current outbreak, it is highly likely that these probable cases will
be confirmed by independent laboratory testing
