City officials' latest message to would-be swimmers in lake Springfield:
"Use at your own risk." "We've decided after many meetings and things that
we have done to lift the advisory on Lake Springfield," Mayor Karen Hasara
said at a lakeside press conference Monday.
The advisory had been in effect since July. Hasara and the city's special
medical consultant, Dr. Donald Graham, admitted they still do not know how
the lake got contaminated with leptospira, the bacterium that causes the
rare, water-borne illness. But after careful tracking of anyone who might
have been infected, authorities concluded there have been no cases of
leptospirosis in Springfield since July, said Graham. The city's efforts to
protect lake users will now switch to an education program.
The decision to lift the advisory came after months of effort by city,
state, and federal authorities to find the source of the contamination.
Leptospirosis first appeared in Springfield in mid-July (1998), after a
number of contestants from the June 21 Ironhorse Triathlon here complained
of fever, nausea, muscle pain, red eys, and dark urine. All told, 97 of
851 participants came down with probable leptospirosis. Of them, 49 tested
positive for leptospira. The illness also showed up in recreational users
of Lake Springfield. Among 278 swimmers who had probable leptospirosis and
124 who had some but not all of the symptoms, 14 tested positive using one
or more tests for leptospira.
(Nobody's really used the lake much since July, they shut the beach down,
boaters were mad about the money they spent on licenses. The paper said
the need to tell people what to expect prompted the decision to lift the
advisory, even though it's winter now and lake usage is at a minimum. It
said people are making decisions such as renewing boat licenses and
planning summer activities at the various lake clubs. - KM)
