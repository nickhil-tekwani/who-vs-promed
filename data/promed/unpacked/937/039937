Malaysia recorded 19,544 dengue cases in 1997, 37.4% higher than the
number reported in 1996 and the highest recorded since the disease was
made notifiable in 1973. Of the 19,544 cases, 806 were dengue
haemorrhagic fever with 50 deaths. Cases were reported throughout the
year but peaked in July. Although all the states in the country were
affected, most cases were reported in urban areas with high population
density.
Of the 5,433 specimens submitted to the WHO Centre for laboratory
confirmation, 56.5% were positive serologically. The male:female ratio
was 1.28:1 and the 21-25 years age group was the highest affected. The
majority of the cases was in Chinese (49.3%), followed by Malays (35.8%)
and Indians (10.8%). Of the 100 virus strains isolated, 64 were dengue
1, 33 dengue 2 and 3 dengue 3.
The WHO Centre is intensifying its surveillance in 1998 since several
factors may affect disease patterns. The prolonged drought caused by El
Nino may affect vector density, and the economic downturn has caused
reduction in massive construction which previously was associated with
dengue outbreaks. Hopefully, the reduction in the health budget will not
adversely affect the dengue situation.
Dengue endemic countries in Southeast Asia which share similar problems
to Malaysia should monitor the situation closely and submit country data
to the WHO Regional Offices in Manila and New Delhi on a regular basis.
The WHO Centre will be glad to provide the 1997 WHO Annual Report to
those interested and to collaborate in dengue surveillance affected by
adverse weather patterns and economic factors.
