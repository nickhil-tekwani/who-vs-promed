[1] New outbreaks on pig farms
Date: Fri 29 Mar 2019

Japan's central government has disclosed its decision to cull about 2400 pigs on Fri [29 Mar 2019] following confirmation of 2 more [outbreaks] of [classical] swine fever [CSF] at the farms in the region. "It is extremely difficult to foresee when the outbreak will wind down," Farm Minister, Takamori Yoshikawa, told a news conference, referring to the epidemic.

Concise News learned that the Aichi prefectural government reported the 15th and 16th [outbreaks] of CSF, also known as hog cholera, in pigs in the cities of Seto and Tahara since September [2018]. Authorities detected the virus at one farm in Seto during their inspection, following the outbreak at nearby facilities earlier this week.

Another [outbreak] was confirmed at the Tahara farm after one pig was found dead there on Thursday [28 Mar 2019].

The local government has suspended shipments of pigs and the transportation of feed crop and droppings from facilities located within 10 km [6.2 mi] of each of the 2 farms. The government says the disease poses no risk to humans, but a series of outbreaks has hurt local farmers' livelihoods.

In September [2018], Japan's 1st swine fever outbreak in 16 years was confirmed at a farm in neighbouring Gifu, and 2 months later, the 2nd case was reported at a Gifu public livestock park.

[According to the above information, the addition of the 2 new outbreaks on pig farms brings the total number of such outbreaks, since the start of the event in September 2018, to 16. The new outbreaks on domestic swine farms are yet to be reported to the OIE. - Mod.AS]

The Aichi Prefectural Government started work Sunday [24 Mar 2019] to vaccinate wild boars against swine fever, in the 1st attempt at vaccinating wild animals in the country. Aichi officials placed feed containing a vaccine in the ground at some locations in Aichi Prefecture, including at a forest in Komaki.

Classical swine fever (CSF) outbreaks have occurred at pig farms mainly in central Japan since last year [2018]. Wild boars are believed to have spread the disease.

Aichi Prefecture will conduct the work at a total of 60 locations in the cities of Komaki, Kasugai and Inuyama. Five more rounds of vaccination work will be conducted by February 2020, prefectural officials said.

On Monday [25 Mar 2019], the Gifu Prefectural Government also began placing vaccine-containing feed in the ground. The prefectural government plans to set the feed at 900 locations in mountainous areas in 18 municipalities by Friday [29 Mar 2019].

The prefectural government will monitor whether the feed is eaten by wild boars using security cameras. It will also capture some of the hogs to check whether they test positive for an antibody. The 2nd round of vaccination work will be conducted in late April [2019], and 2 more rounds are set for the summer and winter, Gifu officials said.

On Sat [23 Mar 2019] the agriculture ministry said a new case of CSF was confirmed at a pig farm in Yamagata, Gifu Prefecture. The prefecture will slaughter some 2000 pigs raised at the farm.

The latest CSF case is the 12th in Japan since September last year [2018], when the nation's 1st instance of the disease in 26 years was confirmed in the prefecture. Gifu Governor Hajime Furuta called the timing of the outbreak "extremely regrettable."

[The CSF event in Japan started 3 Sep 2018. As of 25 Mar 2019, a total of 230 outbreaks were reported to the OIE, of which 12 were on pig farms and 218 in wild boar, with the following OIE epidemiological statistics:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Domestic pigs / 52 592 / 235 / 34 / 52 558 / 0
Wild boar / Not available / 235 / 81 / 154 / 0

Links to all (22) reports submitted so far to the OIE, as well as an interactive map presenting the locations of all outbreaks in domestic swine and wild boars, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27871.

The most recent follow-up report, number 21, submitted to the OIE on 26 Mar 2019, included the following summary of the wild boar surveillance carried out in Japan:

"As of 25 Mar 2019, 890 wild boars (130 dead and 760 captured) in Gifu prefecture have been tested and 228 (83 dead and 145 captured) were found to be positive for CSF virus (CSFV) by RT-PCR since 13 Sep 2018. A total of 140 wild boars (16 dead and 124 captured) in Aichi prefecture have been tested and 13 were found to be positive (2 dead and 11 captured) for CSFV by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2018. Among the other prefectures, 255 wild boars (232 dead and 23 captured) in 40 prefectures were tested and all were found to be negative for CSFV by RT-PCR since 14 Sep 2018."

The Japanese CSF epizootic is characterised by wide virus dissemination in wild boar within the 2 affected prefectures, with spillovers to several domestic pig farms (a total of 16 so far, according to the recent media data; see section [1] above).

The governments of both Gifu and Aichi prefectures have recently launched their respective oral vaccination projects, aiming to control the disease in wild boar (section [2] above). - Mod.AS
