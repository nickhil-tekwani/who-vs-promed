An article was published on 19 Dec 2012 titled "Poliomyelitis - worldwide (15): Pakistan, global update", with archive number: 20121218.1458209. In paragraph 3 of section one of this alert, there is a mistake (on Karachi, Pakistan, re. violence against vaccination teams, quoted from NY Times).

It is reported that "Pakistan accounted for 198 new cases last year [2011], the highest rate in the world, followed by Afghanistan and Nigeria." As a matter of fact, 198 is just a number and not the rate, and numbers are not enough to compare the rate of diseases at different levels. You need to report disease rates (for example, numbers of cases of disease per 100 000 or million population) in order to reduce confusion at the time of comparison. In this case, if one calculates the polio rate in endemic countries, Pakistan is not the number one country with polio case rates at the global level in the last 2 years; in 2011, Pakistan was number 2, and in 2012 to date, Pakistan is 3rd, while Afghanistan was number one in 2011 and holds the same position to date in 2012.

Endemic countries: Total pop (millions) / Cases to date 2012 / Cases to date 2011 / Total cases 2011 // Cases per million pop (to date 2012) / Cases per million pop (to date 2011) / Cases per million pop (all cases 2011)

Pakistan: 173.593 / 56 / 173 / 198 // 0.32 / 1.00 / 1.14
Afghanistan: 31.412 / 34 / 61 / 80 // 1.08 / 1.94 / 2.55
Nigeria: 158.423 / 118 / 46 / 62 // 0.74 / 0.29 / 0.39

Countries are ranked as per data available on the Polio Eradication Initiative website, which was accessed [19 Dec 2012]
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx.

On a separate note, killing NID [national immunization day] volunteers is not only limited to Pakistan. We are losing our good people every day all over the world. But some, like Health Authorities of Pakistan, report it to recognize the dedication of the health care workers toward polio eradication, and some countries do not report it for their own reasons, such as Afghanistan. A student who was working as volunteer for polio eradication in her district was shot dead in Kohistan district of Kapisa province in Afghanistan at the beginning of December 2012. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/05/afghanistan-woman-health-volunteer-assassinated. The polio drive was not stopped, and President Hamid Karzai ordered an investigation of this murder on 7 Dec 2012.

This is not only an ethical issue. Reporting the real situation is a recognition and appreciation of those who give their lives to eradicate poliomyelitis.
