TUBERCULOSIS IN DEER?:RFI - ARGENTINA (PATAGONIA)
=================================================
Date: 27 May 1997

The request for information came from Werner Flueck in Argentina. He said:
For several years now I have studied various aspects of the introduced red
deer in Patagonia, and while collecting wild females for other purposes, I
came across a lactating female with lesions (December 1996). Opening the
abdomen I first noted that
the 'fat' of the omentum was in form of an accumulation of small,firm,
spherical lumps (2-5mm in diameter), rather than smooth strands along the
blood vessels. The liver contained several hard nodes of 2-3cm diameter on
the surface and which penetrated 2-3cm into the liver tissue. These nodes
appeared to be a dense accumulation of smaller lumps of 2-3mm, like a
raspberry. The lungs showed several adhesions to the thorax, but I did not
investigate the lung tissue any further. The inner lining of the thorax was
covered with a layer of nodular-like pale tissue,
relatively firm and resembling fat, 2-5mm thick. Although these nodules were
all individually distinct, they covered the lining to such an extent that
the ribs were not visible.
As I was in a very remote situation, not prepared well for such an
encounter, and suspecting TB, I collected a larger node from the liver in
formalin and a second I kept 'fresh' for 2 days by keeping it in a container
in cool creek water. I also took
pictures of the omentum, thorax-lung adhesions, and node in liver. The
samples I submitted to a USDA-type institution for histology and culturing.
Later I was informed that the personnel decided it was not worth culturing
from the fresh tissue as it was likely contaminated. A Ziehl-Neelsen stain
was negative. There were many macrophages with acidophilic material in the
cytoplasma.
The lab report therefore states that it is not possible to determine if in
fact it was a case of TB. The following facts are also relevant for a
diagnosis:
- there are cases of bovine TB in cattle in this area
- the deer population is at very high density and use the
same range as livestock
- there are reports (but not confirmed) of TB in
establishments which have deer fenced in this same
region

My questions are:
- have these clinical symptoms been described for TB in
cervids?
- is it possible that the Ziehl-Neelsen stain is negative, yet
it is in fact a case of TB?
- if not TB, what might be a cross-diagnosis?
I would appreciate if you or someone else could comment on these observations.

One reply has been posted to WildlifeHealth:

>From your description ...possibilities [other than TB] that came to my mind
were:
- granulomas: could be due to mycobacteria, but also to many other types of
bacteria or fungi (e.g. nocardia, actinomyces pyogenes, corynebacterium
pseudotuberculosis, etc...)
- steatitis/fat necrosis: the fact that these lesions appear to be located
mostly in the omentum and underneath the pleura, where there is abundant
deposition of fat, lead me to suspect steatitis. This is found mostly in
ruminants, and the cause is often unclear, although vitamin E deficiency is
possible. It can lead to formation of yellowish white nodules in areas of
fat, like you describe. The presence of macrophages with cytoplasmic debris
is not inconsistent with this, as the fat necrosis lead to a granulomatous
response.
