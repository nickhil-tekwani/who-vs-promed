Varicella is indeed a significant infection in the newborn infant. The
varicella zoster virus is a known human teratogen. Fetuses exposed in utero
may exhibit skin lesions, limb abnormalities, eye abnormalities including
cataracts, chorioretinitis or blindness, brain atrophy, mental retardation,
and death. Those infants who are exposed in utero and delivered before the
transfer of significant maternal antibody are at risk for severe infection
and a 20-30% mortality rate (this would include infants whose mothers
developed the disease within 5 days prior to delivery or within 2 days
after; generally refers to infants developing a rash between the first 5-10
days of life). Infants developing a rash in the first 5 days usually have
received some maternal antibody and have a less severe course. Those
infants developing the varicella rash after 10 days generally are felt to
have acquired the disease after birth and also tend to do better.
Generally, an infant born to a mother who has developed varicella within 5
days of delivery should receive varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) 125
units within 48 hours of delivery, preferably as soon as possible. This
will not prevent neonatal varicella, but will modify its course. Acyclovir
may also modify the course, but should not be necessary if VZIG has been
given. Isolation of the mother and baby may be necessary depending on
whether mother is in incubation period, baby is in a neonatal intensive care
unit, etc.

There's a case report of varicella in a pregnant woman that goes through
some of the considerations, as well. It's in a recent Clin Inf Dis
