A horse in Greendale Township has been euthanized due to complications of West Nile virus [WNV infection].

"This is the 1st known positive WNV horse in Midland county," stated Midland County Mosquito Control (MCMC) Director Carl Doud. "The positive horse is an indication of human WNV risk as horses are a dead end host like humans. It is evidence that the virus has moved beyond the normal mosquito-bird-mosquito cycle."

This season [2017], MCMC has seen 18 birds (crows and blue jays) test positive for the disease, the most ever observed in a season. The average annual number of positive birds is 4.1.

"The 1st birds to test positive occurred in May [2017], which is unseasonably early and an indication of higher than normal virus circulation," Doud said.

The area where the horse died, on 3 Aug 2017, is receiving enhanced fogging from county roads. Additionally, Mosquito Control is currently requesting the MDNR (Michigan Department of Natural Resources) for special approval to fog an area of state forest in the immediate area of where the horse contracted the virus. The approval will be needed as this area of the forest was not already approved for fogging. Mosquito trapping efforts are focused on this area to monitor the activity and provide mosquitoes to test for the virus.

Midland County Mosquito Control crews are also making a 3rd seasonal treatment of catch basins throughout the county. Catch basins are crucial for WNV disease mitigation as the _Culex_ mosquitoes known to transmit the virus often emerge from the water in that habitat.

No human cases of WNV have been documented in the state this season [2017]. Most individuals (80 percent) who receive a bite from a WNV-infected mosquito do not suffer apparent sickness. About 20 percent will suffer at least some extent of viral infection signs/symptoms. A small percentage (1 percent) will develop serious manifestations including encephalitis.

The current map of WNV equine cases in Michigan, which includes the positive horse in Midland County is provided at http://bit.ly/2hZ5Pjn. A similar map with positive birds is provided at http://bit.ly/2wJE8yw.

West Nile virus has been in Michigan since 2002 and is detected in Midland County most years. The virus is maintained in the environment in a cycle that involves birds and mosquito species that feed on birds. Humans, horses, and other non-typical hosts can become infected when bitten by a mosquito that has picked up the virus by biting a WNV positive bird.

Given the perceived risk of WNV it is important that residents take precautions to avoid mosquito bites:
- the _Culex_ mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus often develop in container habitats around the home. Where possible, discard or empty water from flower pots, clogged rain gutters, swimming pool covers, scrap tires, and similar sites where mosquitoes can lay their eggs;
- use insect repellent containing DEET, IR3535, or picaridin, according to the manufacturer's directions when adult mosquitoes are present;
- be aware of peak mosquito hours. The hours of dusk to dawn are peak biting times for many species of mosquitoes. Take extra precaution by using protective clothing and insect repellent during evening and early morning hours ... or consider avoiding outdoor activities at these times;
- wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors;
- keep vegetation trimmed down as much as possible around the home and make sure that doors and windows have tight-fitting screens. Repair or replace screens that have tears or holes.

Any resident that spots a dead blue jay or crow is asked to call Mosquito Control at 989-832-8677.

[The county surveillance system is tracking the cases and is aware of the increased viral load in the area. It is sad residents are not paying attention to this, presuming the data are frequently made public. If residents are aware of these data then one has to wonder why the horse owners are not vaccinating. Location in the United States northern region is not insulation from mosquito borne diseases. There is a very effective vaccine for horses and it represents cheap insurance considering the investment in a horse. - Mod.TG

[2] Colorado (Larimer county)

http://theprowersjournal.com/2017/08/first-confirmed-case-in-2017-of-equine-west-nile-virus-wnv-in-colorado/


A horse residing in Larimer county has been diagnosed with West Nile virus [WNV]; this is Colorado's 1st confirmed case of WNV in a horse in 2017. This index case was diagnosed by Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins on 2 Aug 2017.

Vaccines in horses have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses having been vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot. If an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3 to 4 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

"Strict insect control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of West Nile Virus. I encourage livestock owners to keep an eye out for standing water for mosquito populations," said State Veterinarian, Dr Keith Roehr.

Infected horses may display signs including head tilt, muscle tremors, stumbling, lack of coordination, weakness of the limbs, or partial paralysis. The clinical signs of WNV are consistent with other important neurological diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpes virus; therefore it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing. Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses.

The transmission of the disease varies from year to year and depends on a number of factors including mosquito numbers. The WNV can be amplified and carried by infected birds and then spread locally by mosquitoes that bite those birds. The mosquitoes can then pass the virus to humans and animals.
