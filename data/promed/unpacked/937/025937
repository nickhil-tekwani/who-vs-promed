https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/12/drc-ebola-10-new-cases-on-december-10-16-this-week-3340-total.html

As of 11 Dec 2019, 3 new cases, 3340 total confirmed plus probable cases, 3225 probable cases, 42 cases in the last 21 days, 1088 survivors, 2207 deaths.

The MoH/WHO AFRO Ebola DRC KIVU 2018 Dashboard reported 10 new cases on 10 Dec 2019. As Helen Branswell notes in a tweet, this is clearly the result of the pause in the response effort because of local violence. That brings this week's cases to 16, 42 in the last 21 days, and 3340 since the outbreak was declared. Out of 3000 contacts, 600 are going untraced. - MM

[The report states that "One suspect died and the oral sample was not taken and the body was secured and returned to the family." That seems risky since the suspect may have had Ebola. One hopes the family follows best practices in preparing the body for burial.

It is also notable that "3 traditional healers registered among new confirmed cases, including 2 in Mabalako and 1 in Mandima." This is sad and problematic since the healers certainly will have had contact with other villagers seeking medical care whom they may have inadvertently infected with Ebola. - Mod.LK]

Situation update; data as reported by Sun 8 Dec 2019
----------------------------------------------------
In the week of 2 to 8 Dec 2019, 11 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases were reported from 4 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The confirmed cases were reported from Beni (55%; n=6), Mabalako (27%; n=3), Mandima (9%; n=1), and Oicha (9%; n=1). Compared to the previous week (25 Nov-1 Dec 2019), the proportion of confirmed cases coming from known contacts (70% (7/10) vs. 73% (8/11)) and the proportion of community deaths among confirmed cases (20% (2/10) vs. 9% (1/11)) remain relatively similar. The volume of alerts reported and contacts traced are slowly improving after a reduction due to insecurity in recent weeks, but they are not back to the levels observed before the security incidents.

In the past 21 days (18 Nov-8 Dec 2019), 28 confirmed cases were reported from 14 of the 71 health areas within 4 neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces: Mabalako (43%, n=12), Mandima (25%, n=7), Beni (25%, n=7), and Oicha (7%, n=2). The majority of the cases (93%, n=26) are linked to known chains of transmission. More than half (54%; n=15) of the cases over the last 21 days have epidemiological links to a funeral in Lwemba Health Area.

As of 8 Dec 2019, a total of 3324 EVD cases were reported, including 3206 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2209 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1873) were female, 28% (939) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (164) were healthcare workers.

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring

Another 6 Ebola infections have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) outbreaks, part of fluctuating levels that health officials have warned about in the wake of recent attacks and security incidents that have temporarily shut down response activities in some of the current hot spots.

In other developments, the Christian humanitarian group World Vision yesterday [9 Dec 2019] released 2 reports based on interviews with people affected by the outbreak, one of which airs fears and concerns voiced by children and the other describing the impact of the events on children.

Infections rise amid response stalls
------------------------------------
The 6 new infections come after 4 were reported yesterday [9 Dec 2019], and appear to be part of ongoing activity in a few hot spots, which have been riddled with civil unrest and violent clashes involving rebel groups. The outbreak total is now 3330 cases [as of 10 Dec 2019, 3340 cases], and authorities are still investigating 351 suspected cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard, 1 more death has been reported, raising the fatality count to 2207.

Meanwhile, the DRC's Ebola technical committee today [10 Dec 2019], in its latest daily update, had locations for yesterday's 4 cases; 2 were from Beni and 2 were from Mabalako. It added that response activities are still suspended in Beni, Mangina, and Biakato, due to security reasons.

Humanitarian group interviews Ebola-affected populations
--------------------------------------------------------
In other developments, World Vision, a Christian humanitarian group based in California, yesterday [9 Dec 2019] released the results of interviews and focus group meetings with people in Beni and Butembo who have been affected by the Ebola outbreak. It included input from 268 people, 139 children and 129 caregivers.

One of the 2 reports focuses on interviews with 30 children who survived Ebola or were orphaned by the disease.

"The findings give an insight into children's lived experiences. These have informed the development of a set of recommendations that will guide World Vision's advocacy and response to the Ebola crisis in Eastern DRC," the group wrote.

A separate document provides a more detailed description of the outbreak's impact on children, covering armed conflict, displacement, poor access to health and educational services, rumors, and the impact of fear, isolation, and stigmatization regarding Ebola.

The group included 4 recommendations for international donors and the DRC government, which include:
- immediate scale-up of a fully funded response;
- investments in long-term health and child protection systems;
- rapid expansion of support for children affected by Ebola; and
- prioritizing psychosocial assistance when managing Ebola.
