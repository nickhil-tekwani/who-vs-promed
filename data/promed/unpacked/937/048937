The Winnebago County (Illinois) Health Department is investigating a rash of bacterial infections locally from ear piercings. At least 9 people in Winnebago and Boone Counties have contracted _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ following upper ear piercings at a shop in Rockford. Many had to be hospitalized. The shop was not identified, other than that it was inspected by state health officials as well as the county and that the owner has suspended piercing operations.

The health department says the cases range in age from 13 to 39 years, and all had their ears pierced between late May [2013] through 9 Jul 2013. "_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ is [a] bacterium that can cause serious infection that can carry some potential for permanent disfigurement," said Winnebago County Health administrator Mike Bacon in a news release.

"Pseudomonas infections of ear cartilage can be difficult to treat. In all, 6 patients were admitted to the hospital; 7 required an incision to drain an abscess, as part of their treatment. There is concern that there may be other cases in the community that have not been reported or adequately treated. Failure to treat the infections could result in permanent ear deformity, or, more seriously, the infection could spread to other parts of the body," added Bacon.

If a person who has had an ear piercing develops redness, swelling or pain following a piercing, especially of the upper ear, they should be assessed by a physician for potential infection, and should contact their local health department. They recommend that anyone who has recently had a piercing and is experiencing symptoms should call a primary care physician or go to an immediate care clinic for follow-up. Because this is an on-going epidemiological investigation, they should also contact their county health department to report a recent history of ear piercing and that they are experiencing an infection at the site of ear piercing.

The Winnebago County Health Department has identified the tattoo parlor they say is responsible for at least 12 infections related to ear piercings, 6 of whom were hospitalized. They have also found another 4 additional cases they feel are likely related. They say that Euro Tattoo at 5920 E. State Street is being investigated as the source of the infections, all of which were _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ bacterial infections from piercings of the upper ear. On Monday, 15 Jul 2013, an inspection was conducted of the tattoo shop and "the owner has voluntarily suspended all piercing operations at the shop. The owners and staff have been cooperative in this investigation."

The Health Department initially declined to identify the business, citing internal policy, but did release the information in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Cases range in age from 13 to 49; all had ears pierced between 28 Mar 2013 and 9 Jul 2013, and live in Winnebago, Boone, Ogle, Dekalb, and Stephenson Counties. It is unclear how so many people became infected, and laboratory tests are pending while the investigation continues.

[Perichondritis is an infection of the lining of the ear cartilage associated with trauma, often caused by upper ear piercing through the ear cartilage. As many as 70 per cent of perichondritis cases are caused by the organism associated with this outbreak, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, a waterborne organism that commonly contaminates cleaning solutions used in the aftercare of piercing. The cartilage infection requires aggressive antimicrobial therapy, usually intravenously, and drainage if necessary, and can easily lead to enough damage to the cartilage to cause prominent deformities of the external ear. - Mod.LL
