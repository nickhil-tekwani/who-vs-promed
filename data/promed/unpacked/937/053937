SARS-associated Coronavirus: Sequencing Progress at CDC
--------------------------------------------------------
The CDC coronavirus sequencing team has completed and assembled 17.5
kilobases of nucleotide sequence of the Urbani strain [i.e. a virus
isolated in Hanoi from patient Urbani] of SARS-associated coronavirus. [The
complete unedited sequence determined by the BC group referred to above
runs to 29 736 bases. - Mod.CP] These sequences represent all of the
genome except for the 1a region of the polymerase gene. The availability
of this sequence provides important information relating to rapid
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of SARS. The complete genome of the
Urbani strain should be available on Mon 14 Apr 2003.
It should be noted that analysis of sequences from 3 different regions of
the genome confirm the initial observation that the Urbani strain of the
SARS-associated coronavirus is distinct from all previously recognized
coronaviruses and sequence studies are not likely to identify a source for
this novel coronavirus.
Sequence information provided by collaborators at National Microbiology
Laboratory, Canada, University of California at San Francisco, Erasmus
University, Rotterdam and Bernhard-Nocht Institute, Hamburg facilitated
this sequencing effort.
The partial nucleotide sequence of CoV-SARS is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/pdf/nucleoseq.pdf>. Coronavirus protein
analysis phylogenetic trees are available at

Nucleotide Sequencing of the Genome of the SARS-associated Coronavirus
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists in Canada announced over the weekend that they had broken the
genetic code of the virus suspected of causing severe acute
respiratorysyndrome (SARS). Sequencing the genome which computers at the
British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver completed at 4 a.m. on Sat 12
Apr 2003 after a team slaved over the problem 24 hours a day for a mere six
days is the first step toward developing a diagnostic test for the virus
and possibly a vaccine.
The genome appears to be that of a "completely new" coronavirus unrelated
to any known human or animal viruses, a scientist at the Canadian agency
said. a competing United States team at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta is reaching the same conclusion, and scientists from
both teams said the virus's startling novelty could make it harder to trace
what animal or bird it came from, if it did jump from another species.
A spokesman for the World Health Organization called the speed at which the
gene was sequenced "stunning." "It was just three weeks ago that the
coronavirus was identified as the likely cause," said the spokesman, Dick
Thompson. "Don't forget that it took several years to find the virus that
causes AIDS. The way people worked together is just great." Dr. Marco
Marra, Director of the Genome Sciences Center at the Canadian cancer
agency, said he hoped that "this isn't viewed as `beating the C.D.C.';
we're trying to help." Because 13 people in Canada have died of the
syndrome, known as SARS, and 274 more are believed to be infected with it,
Canadian scientists feel a sense of urgency about the project, he said. No
one is believed to have died of the mysterious respiratory ailment in the
United States, where 160 people are believed to be infected.Also, Dr. Marra
said, samples should be sequenced in different laboratories so scientists
can check one another's work. Cautioning that his lab's work is "a draft";
there are probably still errors in it," he said he still expected it to be
posted for public use today on the Web site of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Md., part of the National Institutes
of Health.
The virus appears to be unique. "It doesn't look any more like one known
coronavirus than another," he said. With 29 736 nucleotides, he said, "it's
a biggie for a coronavirus." Viruses usually have thousands of these base
pairs, while bacteria have millions and the human genome has over three
billion. [In general, the genomes of coronaviruses are larger than those of
other RNA viruses, and the size of the SARAS-associated coronavirus genome
is not unexpected. - Mod.CP]. Dr. Marra said the genome his lab found was
"equidistant" from coronaviruses isolated from turkeys, cows and mice.
Ideally, the sequence will make it possible to come up with a rapid test.
Right now, there are three different tests for coronaviruses, but they can
take days, by which time a patient may have died or recovered. Because
rapid tests for other coronaviruses exist, "our confidence level is quite
good," Dr. Marra said. Knowing the sequence of base pairs will indicate
what proteins the DNA will build, which will hint at which protein-blocking
drugs might make the virus impotent. The possibility of a vaccine is more
remote. While vaccines have wiped out or slowed smallpox, chicken pox,
measles and other viruses, a vaccine against AIDS has eluded scientists for
more than a decade.
Scientists are still trying to prove that this coronavirus causes SARS. To
that end, a laboratory in the Netherlands is infecting primates with it to
see if they become sick and whether particles of the same virus can be
found in them. Dr. James Hughes, of the National Center for Infectious
Disease at the C.D.C., which is working on a sample cultured from a throat
swab on a patient who died in Asia, said it was also finding a
new,unrecognized virus. Known coronaviruses fall into three groups based on
their surface proteins, he said, "and it looks like this is a fourth." "If
it had looked like it came from a turkey or a chicken," he said, "you could
have taken steps to diminish the likelihood of exposure." It is impossible
to know how much having a fully sequenced genome will trim the time it
takes to create a diagnostic test or a vaccine, Dr. Hughes said. A test
could come rapidly because another preliminary test based on pieces of the
genome was created within days, he said, though it is still in trials. He
said he did not expect a marketable vaccine within a year.
The Canadian work began after Dr. Marra and the project's leader, Dr.
Caroline Astell, volunteered to put aside their cancer research and devote
their 20 scientists and 100 000-square-foot lab to the coronavirus. Last
week, the team received material that was isolated from a patient who had
died in Toronto and was grown in primate cells at the National Microbiology
Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The "sensitive, very delicate" work of
converting the sample's RNA into DNA took about five days by a two-person
team, Dr. Marra said, while "the rest of us reorganized the laboratory so
it could run rapidly." Dr. Simon Sutcliffe, the cancer agency's president,
described the lab scene as "a lot of tired and excited-looking young people
standing in front of their machines." Their average age is "probably 23 or
24," he said, and they are "very genome-focused and technologically adept."
On Friday afternoon, the samples were ready for the sequencing computers,
which identify the bases in snippets of DNA about 500 bases long, and then
sort them, trying to build something like a whole ladder out of hundreds of
pieces of a ladder whose rungs have been sawed apart at different lengths.
"We were on pins and needles waiting for data," Dr. Marra said. "It began
to appear at around 9 or 10 Friday night, and everything looked promising."
About 4 a.m., the computers finished their draft and before 8 a.m., Dr.
Sutcliffe was being called out of the shower and was giving the
authorization to make the announcement.

[The completion of sequencing of the genome of the SARS-associated
coronavirus is truly a remarkable achievement, as the genomes of the
"nested set" viruses (the order _Nidovirales_, which includes the family
_Coronaviridae_) are substantially larger than other RNA-containing
viruses. The data released by the BC group are raw data which require
further editing and refining, but they are now in the public domain which
is a commendable initiative. Preliminary analysis confirms that the
SARS-associated coronavirus is a unique virus not closely related to any of
the known species of animal and human coronaviruses. - Mod.CP]
