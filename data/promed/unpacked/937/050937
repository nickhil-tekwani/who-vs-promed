Background information on typhoid in Tajikistan
------------------------------------------------------
1865 cases were reported in 1996; an estimated 24 000 during 1996 to
1999; 7335 in 1999; 4415 in 2000.
Rates per 100 000: 118.3 in 1999; 70.7 in 2000.
An epidemic (most in Kulyab; 34 percent below age 14) was reported
during May to June 1996. This and subsequent outbreaks numbered
almost 400[0] cases, and were ascribed to a breakdown in drinking
water supply following dissolution of the USSR.
During 1997, an outbreak of multidrug-resistant typhoid fever spread
from Dushanbe (8901 cases - 95 fatal) to Kulyab and Tursunzade;
municipal water was identified as the source.
52 typhoid fatalities were reported in 1981; 46 in 1982; 32 in 1985;
44 in 1986; 36 in 1987; 22 in 1988; 19 in 1989; 15 in 1990; 10 in
1992.
89 cases of paratyphoid were reported in 1999; 60 in 2000. Rates per
100 000: 1.4 in 1999; 0.9 in 2000.

Would be interesting to know how the diagnosis was made in the index
cases. By culture? Widal test (unreliable but the most common way in
Asia) or by other means. A large-scale outbreak of typhus in the
Cambodian refugee camps was first (and for some time) diagnosed and
treated as enteric fever.

[The report does not specifically state the method of diagnosis but
does say that a blood test was used initially. Cultures of the blood
or bone marrow (the latter with a higher yield) are the best
diagnostic tests; only about 30 percent of stools are positive for
_S. enterica_ serotype _typhi_ during acute typhoid fever.
The Widal test, measuring antibodies against H and O antigens of the
organism, can have false positive and false negatives, but some
centers (Papua New Guinea and Vietnam) have found it useful. - Mod.LL]
