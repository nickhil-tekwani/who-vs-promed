First Report of Rhizomania Disease of Sugar Beet Caused by Beet
necrotic yellow vein virus in the Great Lakes Production Region.
William M. Wintermantel, USDA-ARS, 1636 East Alisal Street, Salinas,
CA 93905; Teresa Crook, Michigan Sugar Company, 725 South Almer, P.O.
Box 107, Caro, MI 48723; and Ralph Fogg, Monitor Sugar Company, 2600
South Euclid, Bay City, MI 40706. Plant Dis. 87:201, 2003; published
on-line as D-2002-1209-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 23 Nov
2002.
Rhizomania, caused by Beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus (BNYVV) and
vectored by the soilborne fungus _Polymyxa betae_ Keskin [Pb], is
one of the most economically damaging diseases affecting sugar beet
(_Beta vulgaris_) L. The virus likely originated in Europe and was
first identified in California in 1983 (1). It has since spread among
American sugar beet production regions in spite of vigorous
sanitation efforts, quarantine, and disease monitoring (3).
In the fall of 2002, mature sugar beet plants exhibiting typical
rhizomania root symptoms, including proliferation of hairy roots,
vascular discoloration, and some root constriction (2) were found in
several fields scattered throughout central and eastern Michigan.
2 to 5 sugar beet root samples representing numerous cultivars were
collected from fields and sent to the USDA-ARS in Salinas, CA for
analysis. Hairy root tissue from symptomatic plants was used for
mechanical inoculation of indicator plants. Mechanical inoculation
produced necrotic lesions on _Chenopodium quinoa_ and systemic
infection of _Beta vulgaris_ ssp. _macrocarpa_, both typical of BNYVV
and identical to control inoculations with BNYVV.
Symptomatic sugar beet roots were washed and tested using DAS-ELISA
for the presence of BNYVV using standard procedures and antiserum
specific for BNYVV (3). Sugar beet roots were tested individually,
and samples were considered positive when absorbance values were at
least 3 times those of greenhouse-grown healthy sugar beet controls.
Samples were tested from 16 fields, with 10 confirmed positive for
BNYVV. Positive samples had mean absorbance values ranging from 0.341
to 1.631 (A405 nm) compared to the mean of the healthy control
(0.097). Fields were considered positive if one beet tested positive
for BNYVV, but in most cases, all beets tested from a field were
uniformly positive or uniformly negative.
Soil-baiting experiments were conducted on 7 of the fields. Sugar
beet seedlings were grown in soil mixed with equal parts of sand for
6 weeks and were subsequently tested using DAS-ELISA for BNYVV.
Results matched those of the root sampling. Fields testing positive
for BNYVV were widely dispersed within a 100-square-mile
(160-square-km) area including portions of Gratiot, Saginaw, Tuscola,
and Sanilac counties in the central and eastern portions of the Lower
Peninsula of Michigan.
Confirmation of rhizomania in sugar beet from the Great Lakes Region
marks the last major American sugar beet production region to be
diagnosed with the disease, nearly 20 years after its discovery in
California (1). In 2002, there were ca. 185 000 acres (ca. 7400 ha)
of sugar beet grown in the Great Lakes Region, (Michigan, Ohio, and
southern Ontario, Canada).
The wide geographic distribution of infested fields within the
Michigan growing area suggests the entire region should monitor for
symptoms, increase rotation to nonhost crops, and consider planting
rhizomania-resistant sugar beet cultivars to infested fields.

[Rhizomania is also known as "crazy root" or "root madness." The
disease can cause marked reduction in sugar yield and tonnage. The
disease was first described in Italy in 1952 and has probably been
distributed to major sugar beet production areas worldwide. It is
spreading in Eastern Asia, Eurasia, and the Mediterranean and North
American regions. It has been, but with no evidence of spread in the
U.K. When Pb infects roots of sugar beet plants, the virus is
released and replicates and spreads within infected sugar beets.
Fungal spores spread the disease from plant to plant via water in the
soil. Wider distribution in fields results from cultivation, dragging
of infested soil during ploughing or being carried on other
agricultural machinery. Spread from field to field and from farm to
farm can be by the transport of infested soil on farm machinery,
vehicles, transplanted crops, wind, or other means.
Management of the disease involves planting seed at soil temperatures
less than 18 deg C, avoiding saturated soils, and providing adequate
drainage. Several commercial varieties with partial resistance to
rhizomania are now widely available. Use of resistant varieties in
conjunction with planting into cool soils reduce losses to this
disease.
Do any of our Canadian readers know whether rhizomania occurs in
Canada? Please let me know.
