2 more anthrax cases reported in China
--------------------------------------
Another 2 cutaneous anthrax infections were reported in northeast
Liaoning Province, bringing the total number of people who were
hospitalized for the disease to 32, health authorities said Tuesday
[16 Aug 2011]. The 2 cases were found Monday in Donggang City, more
than 100 km [62 miles] away from the city where the disease was 1st
reported, the Liaoning Provincial Health Department said in a
statement.

Health experts noted that all the cases originated from the same
source.

As of 8 p.m. Monday [15 Aug 2011], 4 cases have been confirmed while
28 others were still being investigated, according to the health
department. An initial investigation by local health authorities
showed that the patients contracted the disease after direct contact
with diseased cattle.

The government of Liaoning has since killed or disinfected more than
400 heads of cattle in the province and carried out a survey among
over 20 000 people.

Cutaneous anthrax is an infection of the skin caused by direct contact
with infected animals or animal products. It is rarely fatal if
treated.

[It is sometimes difficult, in all meanings of the word, to interpret
'killed or disinfected.' As carriers are not recognised in livestock
anthrax, any reason to kill sick animals instead of treating them with
antibiotics is foolish. But some countries insist on doing it. If
animals suspected of incubating an infection are treated with long
acting antibiotics the infection is aborted; and follow that up with
vaccination to ensure that they and the rest of the herd are protected
for the next 6-9 months. If there is an infected animal on a farm you
can be sure that it had not been vaccinated, and probably the herd
and/or flock had not been vaccinated either.
