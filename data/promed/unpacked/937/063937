FOOD SECURITY AND EMERGING PLANT DISEASES
*****************************************
Date: Monday, 7 July 1997
From: Pamela K. Anderson <p.anderson@cgnet.com>

In our original posting, Reflections on Plants and the ProMED-
mail Electronic Conference (archive 960425), we argued that the
loss of crops and the higher production costs that result from
increasing disease incidence translate into decreased food
availability and increased malnutrition. Malnutrition is a
complex socio-economic issue that is, both directly and
indirectly, related to the capacity of a society to produce its
staple foods, i.e. food security.

1. WHAT IS FOOD SECURITY ?
Although there are dozens of definitions for food security (see
Maxwell 1996), one of the standard definitions states:
"Food security exists when all people at all times have
physical and economic access to sufficient food to meet their
dietary needs for a productive and healthy life. Food security
has three dimensions:
AVAILABILITY of sufficient quantities of food of appropriate
quality, supplied through domestic production or imports;
ACCESS by households and individuals to adequate resources
to acquire appropriate foods for a nutritious diet; and
UTILIZATION of food through adequate diets, water,
sanitation and health care. " (USDA 1996)
When we consider emerging plant diseases, with respect to food
security, we are essentially talking about availability and
access, that is, how emerging diseases are affecting the quantity
of food produced and how plant diseases may affect prices of that
food, which in turn affects the access by the poor to basic food
staples.

2. WHAT ARE THE FOOD CROPS THAT WE DEPEND UPON ?
In 1976, Harlan presented a list of the 30 principal foods that
nourish humans (see Table 1, below). I am unaware of an analysis
more recent than Harlan's, and would welcome any updates that our
subscribers could provide:
Table 1. The thirty major crops that nourish humans (based on
Harlan 1976).

*Millions of metric tonnes
In the same article Harlan cautioned:
"The trend for more and more people to be nourished by fewer
and fewer plant and animal food sources has reached the
point today where most of the world's population is
absolutely dependent on a handful of species.
The four crops at the head of the list contribute more
tonnage to the world total than the next 26 crops combined.
This is a relatively recent phenomenon and was not
characteristic of the traditional subsistence agriculture
abandoned over the past few centuries. As the trend
intensifies, man becomes ever more vulnerable. His food
supply now depends on the success of a small number of
species, and the failure of one of them may mean automatic
starvation for millions of people. We have wandered down a
path toward heavy dependence on a few species...." (Harlan
1976).

There does not seem to be much dispute that on a global basis our
most important food crops are rice, wheat, maize and potatoes.
However, these are clearly aggregated data. Disaggregation of
the data, for calorie and protein intake, show that staple food
profiles among countries is variable. And within countries,
staple foods often vary from region to region. If any of our
subscribers have information on crops that are important (regional)
staples, but not on the list above, we would appreciate receiving
that information.
Over the coming weeks, ProMED-plant will focus on emerging plant
diseases in our principal food security crops. We invite and
urge our ProMED-mail subscribers to send in postings that share
any information that you have on plant diseases that are emerging
in our food security crops, as well as information on risk
assessment, quarantine, diagnosis, crop protection measures,
additional information sources, or meetings that you consider
relevant to these emerging diseases.
