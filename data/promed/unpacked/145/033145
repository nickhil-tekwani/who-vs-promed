SARS coronavirus from market animals unlikely to be source of SARS outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A paper by Y Guan and colleagues, entitled "Isolation and characterization
of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in southern China"
has been published online in Sciencexpress, 4 Sep 2003.* The Abstract
states that: "A novel coronavirus (SCoV) is the etiological agent of the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. SCoV-like viruses were isolated from
Himalayan palm civets found in a live animal market in Guangdong, China.
Evidence of virus infection was also detected in other animals, including a
raccoon-dog, and in humans working at the same market. All the animal
isolates retain a 29-nucleotide sequence, which is not found in most human
isolates. The detection of SCoV-like viruses in small wild mammals in a
live retail market indicates a route of inter-species transmission,
although the natural reservoir is not known."
The following extract from the paper contains most of the important
conclusions derived from this analysis. "When the full genome of 2 animal
[Himalayan palm civet] and 5 human viruses were compared, the most striking
difference was that these human viruses have a 29-nucleotide deletion
(5'-CCTACTGGTTACCAACCTGAATGGAATAT -3', residue 27869 to 27897) at 246
nucleotides upstream of the start codon of the N gene. Of human SCoV
sequences currently available in GenBank, there was only one (GZ01) with
this additional 29-nucleotide sequence.
"In addition to that, there were 43 to 57 nucleotide differences observed
over the rest of the genome. Most of these differences were found in the S
gene coding region. The existence of the additional 29-nucleotide sequence
in the animal viruses results in [disruption of] open reading frames (ORFs)
10 and 11 and merging these 2 ORFs into a new ORF encoding a putative
protein of 122 amino acids. This putative peptide has a high homology to
the putative proteins encoded by ORF10 and ORF11. Since ORF11 does not have
a typical transcription regulatory sequence for SCoV the putative ORF11
reported by others may just be the direct result of the deletion of the 29
nucleotide sequence. BLAST search of this peptide yields no significant
match to any other known peptide. Further investigation is required to
elucidate the biological significant of this finding.
"When the S-gene sequences of 4 animal viruses [3 Himalayan palm civet and
one raccoon dog] were compared with 11 human SCoV viruses [HKU65806,
Urbani, Tor 2, HKU 39849, HKU 66078, CUHK-W1, HKU 36871, GZ50, GZ01, GZ60
and GZ43], 38 nucleotide polymorphisms were noted, with 26 of them being
non-synonymous changes. The S genes among the 4 animal viruses had 8
nucleotide differences, whereas there were 20 nucleotide differences among
11 human viruses. Thus the animal viruses, though isolated from [the same]
market, are no less divergent than the human viruses isolated from Hong
Kong, Guangdong, Canada, and Vietnam. However, whereas 14 (70 per cent) of
the 20 polymorphisms among the human viruses were non-synonymous mutations,
only 2 (25 percent) of the 8 nucleotide substitutions within the animal
viruses were. An amino acid deletion (nucleotide positions: 21690-21692)
was observed in 2 of the human viruses (GZ43 and GZ60). Of the 38
polymorphisms, there were 11 consistent nucleotide signatures that appeared
to distinguish animal and human viruses. [Phylogenetic analysis showed
that] the human and animal viruses [form distinct clusters], which makes it
highly unlikely that the isolation of SCoV-like viruses in these wild
animals is due to the transmission of SCoV from human to animals.
"Our findings suggest that the markets provide a venue for the animal
SCoV-like viruses to amplify and transmit to new hosts, including humans,
and this is critically important from the point of view of public health.
It is not, however, clear whether any one or more of these animals are the
natural reservoir in the wild. It is conceivable that civets, raccoon dogs,
and ferret badgers were all infected from another as-yet-unknown animal
source that is in fact the true reservoir in nature. However, because of
the culinary practices of southern China, these market animals may be
intermediate hosts that increase the opportunity for transmission of
infection to humans.
"Further extensive surveillance on animals will help to better understand
the animal reservoir in nature and the inter-species transmission events
that led to the origin of the SARS outbreak."

[Complete sequencing of the genome of 2 coronaviruses isolated from
Himalayan civet cats and partial sequencing of the genomes of virus from
another civet and a raccoon dog indicated that these viruses are
phylogenetically distinct from viruses recovered from humans at different
geographic locations during the course of the SARS outbreak. The authors
interpret their results with due caution and suggest that the animals held
in captivity in markets may not be the direct source of the virus
responsible for the outbreak of SARS in humans, but may merely have
themselves been infected from an-as-yet-unidentified source. The failure of
a WHO team to find evidence of SARS coronavirus in domestic poultry and
farmed animals reinforces the view that the wild animal markets common in
South China may constitute a suitable environment for exposure to exotic
viruses. The observation that most, but not all, of the human isolates have
a 29-nucleotide deletion of sequence in comparison with the market animal
virus sequences is intriguing but difficult to interpret, since it has been
reported that a deletion of sequence in the same region occurred during a
few passages of the Frankfurt 1 strain of SARS coronavirus in cultured
cells. - Mod.CP]
