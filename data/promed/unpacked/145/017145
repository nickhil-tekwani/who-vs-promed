Suriname banana sector threatened by Moko
-----------------------------------------
The banana industry in Suriname is currently facing a serious threat from Moko disease, which has affected nearly a quarter of the country's 2000 hectares [4942 acres] of commercial banana plantations.

"The outbreak of the disease poses a serious threat to the survival of the banana sector in our country. The government has already sought international aid to assist a national crisis team in finding solutions to this national issue," President Desi Bouterse said.

Banana exporter Food and Agriculture Industries (FAI) and [workers] unions rang the alarm bell, after almost 400 hectares [988 acres] of the 1000 hectares [2471 acres] at one plantation was affected. "This is a disaster," said union leader Michael Sallons. All tools must be sterilized and boots disinfected to prevent the spread of the disease.

Numerous small-scale farmers have also been affected. People should not just buy banana plants, since they could be infected. The company and the unions have launched an awareness campaign over the looming crisis.

According to [the] unions, policymakers ignored early warnings when the disease was discovered several years ago. [They] said that, even before FAI acquired the company, the disease was identified in 2008. [They] blame poor border control for the problem [and the failure] to ensure compliance with the import rules.

[Moko, as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana and plantain known as blood disease and bugtok, are caused by members of the _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs) species complex (see link below). Within the complex, strains causing moko and bugtok are closely related causing similar symptoms (including wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, bacterial ooze), while the blood disease bacterium is more distantly related with characteristic red internal discolouration ("blood") of fruits and pseudostems. Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases, with reported yield losses of over 70 per cent, but all 3 diseases cause severe yield losses and eventually death of the plants.

The bacteria are spread by water, wind, infected plant material or soil, and mechanical means (including human activities, animals, insects). Suckers for propagation pose a high risk of spreading the diseases. Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen strain. The primary means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and eradication of infected plants where the pathogens are present. Disease management may also include cultural, chemical (for example soil treatments), and biocontrol (antagonistic microorganisms) measures, or combinations of these. Certified clean planting material is essential. No resistant banana or plantain cultivars are known.

Members of the _R. solanacearum_ complex affect more than 200 plant species including many important crops (for example, causing brown rot of potato). The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts.
