Abstract
--------
Background
In fall 2017, 3 solid organ transplant recipients from a common donor developed encephalitis within one week of transplantation, prompting suspicion of transplant-transmitted infection. Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) infection was identified during testing of endomyocardial tissue from the heart recipient.

Methods
We reviewed medical records of the organ donor and transplant recipients and tested serum, whole blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue from the donor and recipients for evidence of EEEV infection by multiple assays. We investigated blood transfusion as a possible source of organ donor infection by testing remaining components and serum specimens from blood donors. We reviewed data from the pre-transplant organ donor evaluation and local EEEV surveillance.

Results
We found laboratory evidence of recent EEEV infection in all organ recipients and the common donor. Serum collected from the organ donor upon hospital admission tested negative, but subsequent samples obtained prior to organ recovery were positive for EEEV RNA. There was no evidence of EEEV infection among donors of the 8 blood products transfused into the organ donor or in products derived from these donations. Veterinary and mosquito surveillance showed recent EEEV activity in counties nearby the organ donor's county of residence. Neuroinvasive EEEV infection directly contributed to the death of one organ recipient and likely contributed to death in another.

Conclusions
Our investigation demonstrated EEEV transmission through solid organ transplantation. Mosquito-borne transmission of EEEV to the organ donor was the likely source of infection. Clinicians should be aware of EEEV as a cause of transplant-associated encephalitis.

[EEEV transmission via organ transplants is extremely rare. One assumes that the donor of the solid tissues showed no signs of EEEV infection prior to death. Testing organs for presence of EEEV is prudent in areas where this virus is endemic and being transmitted in nature currently. The above report does not indicate where and when the donor acquired the EEEV infection, although the virus was circulating in nearby counties. The ProMED posts below and the variety of locations of the authors of this report do not provide a clue as to the locality of these cases. - Mod.TY
