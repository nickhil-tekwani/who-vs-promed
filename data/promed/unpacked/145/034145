The Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat] researched a
rabies positive bat in the Villa Tehuelches area [Magallanes
Province]. Professionals of the Epidemiology and Zoonoses Units were
sent to evaluate the situation on the ground and take the appropriate
measures [for the situation].

The Health SEREMI, Maria Isabel Iduya, asked the people who live in
this locality and the community in general for calm, explaining that
they are applying the established protocols for the safety of the
population.

In this context, they are carrying out epidemiological surveys and
looking for people and animals that had contact with the bat, as well
as applying preventive rabies vaccine to people and animals, among
other measures.

"The role of the community is important in the notification of cases
such as this, where a bat is found behaving strangely, which is highly
suspicious due to [the fact] that rabies virus affects the nervous
system. The main things when encountering a bat are avoiding direct
contact, trying to isolate it, and immediately notifying the Health
SEREMI or [health] post in that locale," Iduya indicated.

[The species of bat is not specified in this report. Because the
extent of the range of the common vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_) is
Uruguay, northern Argentina, and central Chile, and this locale is in
southern Chile's Patagonia, it is unlikely that a vampire bat is
involved. Insectivorous bats in Chile have been shown to have rabies
virus. As indicated in the comments in the 25 Feb 2011 post (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20110225.0624) a reference to a long-term
study was published: "M Favi C, L Rodriguez A, C Espinosa M, V Yung P:
Rabies in Chile 1989-2005
(http://virusberriostechegaray.blogspot.com/2011/01/rabia-en-chile-1989-2005.html,
in Spanish).
English summary: "A retrospective epidemiological study about
epidemiology of rabies in Chile between years 1989 and 2005 was done.

A database of 39 793 national registries of rabies samples was
analyzed by means of statistical packages. Out of 39 793 analyzed
cases, 719 bats, 7 dogs, 7 cats, 1 bovine, and 1 human were positive
to rabies throughout the 17 years of this study. The statistical
analysis established a significant increase in the proportions of
positivity in bats, with predominance of variant 4 between the
reservoirs. Given the complexity of the wild cycle of the rabies in
Chile, it is necessary to maintain a program control of rabies,
directed to educate people for a responsible possession of domestic
animals, due to the risk of rabies transmission from bat to the
susceptible species." - Mod.JG

Not included in the English summary of the reference above, (trans. &
summ. Mod.TY): Of the 17 081 bats tested, the species _Tadarida
brasiliensis_ had the most (rabies) positive individuals (672
individuals) in comparison with other bat species including _Histiotus
macrotus_ (13), _Lasiurus sp._ (27), and _Myotis chiloensis_ (7).

Normally, ProMED-mail would not report the occurrence of a single
rabies-infected bat in the Americas, since rabies in bats
(insectivorous bats throughout the Americas, vampire bats in the
American tropics and subtropics) occurs in every country there.
However, reports of rabies in Chile have been very infrequent, and
this report is a good reminder that rabies in bats is widely
distributed geographically, and the current observations may be of
interest to ProMED subscribers. The species of bat reported above is
not specified. However, the reference above suggests that the bat was
most likely an insectivorous species."
