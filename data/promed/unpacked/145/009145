The Ministry of Health in Saint Lucia is currently engaged in an active search for cases of the mosquito-borne disease chikungunya, which has now surfaced in the neighbouring island of Dominica [and in Martinique, which is closer. - Mod.TY]

At least 10 cases have so far been found in St Martin [many more than 10. - Mod.TY]

Chikungunya is a viral disease carried mainly by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito and causes [transmits] a dengue-like sickness. Symptoms include a sudden high fever, severe pain in the wrists, ankles, or knuckles, muscle pain, headache, nausea, and rash. Joint pain and stiffness are more common with chikungunya than with dengue.

Chief Epidemiologist Nahum Jn Baptiste told Saint Lucia News Online that one suspected case emerged over the weekend [18-19 Jan 2014]; however it has not been confirmed since tests results have to be sent to Trinidad for confirmation. "As part of our protocol we are testing both for dengue and for chikungunya," he said.

Jn Baptiste said while there are no special measures being employed at the island's ports of entry as a result of the chikungunya alert, routine surveillance is being done for such communicable diseases on a daily basis, as required under the international health regulations.

[Should this suspected case be confirmed as a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection, it would be of interest to know if the patient has a travel history of visits to any of the Caribbean islands where that virus is circulating currently. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving news about the results of tests being done in Trinidad.

The Director of the Office of Epidemiology and Investigation in the Department of Health, Dr Brenda Rivera Garcia, urged the population of the island to take preventive measures to avoid the risk of infection by chikungunya virus (CHIKV). To date, no cases of CHIKV have been reported in Puerto Rico.

According to the epidemiologist, one of the reasons for which the population of Puerto Rico is at risk [of CHIKV infection] is the constant circulation of travelers who leave [Puerto Rico] to visit Caribbean islands, including St Martin/St Maarten.

[Evidently, the suspected case of chikungunya virus infection in Puerto Rico reported on 21 Dec 2013 (ProMED-mail archive no 20131221.2130000] was not confirmed. Although this was a false alarm, the warning about the risk of the virus reaching Puerto Rico via travelers is real. Puerto Rico has abundant populations of vector mosquitoes that could transmit CHIKV, as they already do for dengue viruses.

Health officials have confirmed 3 more cases of chikungunya disease in Dominica. There is now a total of 4 confirmed cases of the disease on the island.

The new confirmed cases are from the Health Districts of Marigot, Castle Bruce and Roseau, health officials said on Tuesday afternoon [28 Jan 2014], adding they are all local transmissions.

The island confirmed its 1st imported case of the disease on 16 Jan 2014. The infected person had a history of traveling to St Martin, according to officials.

Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by _Aedes aegypti_, which also transmits dengue virus, and the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitos.

[Since these 3 new cases are locally acquired, it indicates that transmission of chikungunya virus is occurring with a high risk of ongoing spread.

[4] Martinique: index case
Date: Mon 27 Jan 2014
From: Denis Malvy <denis.malvy@chu-bordeaux.fr> [edited]


A 28-year-old female residing in Chateauboeuf quarter, Fort de France, Martinique, from August 2012 to 28 Dec 2013 experienced an abrupt algo-eruptive fever on 2 Nov 2013 (week 44). Additional symptoms occurred on 4 Nov [2013] with incapacitating joint pain in knees, ankles, toes, wrists, fingers, and the left shoulder.

Fever and extensive cutaneous rash lasted for 4 days, but joint manifestations persisted over time. 10 weeks later, on 10 Jan 2014, she was admitted to our clinics because of persistent long standing severe limiting arthralgia located on similar joints. Laboratory investigation of the condition ruled out dengue virus infection whereas ELISA testing was positive for chikungunya fever specific IgM and IgG.

The serological features were consistent with a recent chikungunya [virus] infection and with the recent clinical history experienced by the patient. Of note, she denied any previous travel in Africa or Asia, nor in any other places in the Caribbean region, especially during the 2 weeks preceding the initial acute phase of sickness. Indeed the patient stayed in Martinique, mainly in Fort de France (mostly Chateauboeuf and Redoute, and sparsely Dillon, Centre-Ville and Sainte-Therese quarters), with sparse, short outings in the Lamentin and Trinite locations.

The spread of chikungunya in the Caribbean had been noticed in mid-October 2013 on St Martin island with the 1st 2 confirmed cases and accounts for the 1st known outbreak of chikungunya virus in the western hemisphere. Subsequently, 3 locally-acquired cases from Martinique have been noticed during week 50 2013 (mid-December). Thus, the case above, laboratory-confirmed from late serum sample analysis, is ascertained to be the 1st documented indigenous case of chikungunya occurring in Martinique.

The case has been reported to the regional health agency and local and national health authorities have been informed.
