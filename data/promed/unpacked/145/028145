A cave myotis _Myotis velifer_ collected from the James Selman Cave
system in Woodward County, Oklahoma, has tested POSITIVE for
_Geomyces destructans_. _G. destructans_ is the fungus associated
with white-nose syndrome. Anne Ballman, a Wildlife Disease Specialist
with the USGS National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, WI just
called to notify me. The bat was collected by a graduate student
working for the Oklahoma Biological Survey on 3 May 2010.

The lab initially ran a PCR test which was positive for _G.
destructans_. Follow-up genetic sequencing confirmed the find is a
100 percent match for _G. destructans_. However, the pattern of
infection was not consistent with white-nose syndrome observed on
bats from the eastern U.S., nor were characteristic conidia observed
to assist in identifying the fungus observed. This means that the bat
is harboring the _G. destructans_ fungus, but should only be
considered "suspect positive" for WNS. The cave will now be
considered contaminated with the _G. destructans_ fungus. We will
need to communicate this finding with our partners to ensure that the
cave is closed to human visitation.

This is the 1st known record of _G. destructans_ in Region 2. This is
an extremely interesting find because _Myotis velifer_ is not known
from the eastern United States

Richard Hatcher is the Director of the Oklahoma Department of
Wildlife Conservation (ODWC), and we just spoke about closing the
cave to public access and possibly issuing a joint press release
early next week. Mr. Hatcher tells me that the cave is not generally
open to the public.

This situation has a number of unusual circumstances associated with
it. 1st, this is the 1st detection of possible WNS in the cave myotis
species. It is the 1st detection of possible WNS in Region 2 or in
Oklahoma, and this represents the most western detection of WNS in
the United States. This raises concerns for other bat species
throughout the states in Region 2. Richard Stark provides a link
above that will show you the range of cave myotis.

We believe that this makes the 13th state where WNS has been found in
the United States.

Officials at Ozark National Scenic Riverways have announced the
closure of all caves in the park effective immediately. On 2 May
2010, bat researchers from Missouri State University found an
infectious fungus in 5 gray bats netted just outside a cave in
Shannon County, Missouri. The bats tested positive in a genetics test
for the _Geomyces destructans_ fungus, which causes White-Nose
Syndrome (WNS). Scars on their wings were a clue that the bats
probably were infected over the winter, when the fungus grows on the
bats' faces and skin during hibernation. The cool, damp conditions in
many caves provide an environment in which the fungus thrives.

WNS is a serious disease that has been responsible for the deaths of
over one million bats since its discovery in New York in 2006. The
1st occurrence in Missouri, the 12th state to document the disease,
was discovered in Pike County in April 2010. Six bat species were
known to be vulnerable, but the recent find is the 1st known case in
Shannon County and the 1st case in the federally endangered gray bat.

The westward spread of WNS is believed to occur primarily through
bat-to-bat contact but might also be transmitted on the clothes and
gear of humans who have visited an infected cave. Closing bat caves
to human entry reduces human disturbance of bats, which exacerbates
the mortality rate caused by WNS, and reduces the risk of possible
human-borne transmission. WNS does not infect other animals or humans.

The 4 biologists who discovered the infected bats are graduate
students supervised by Dr. Lynn Robbins at Missouri State University
and are conducting a bat research project supported by a grant from
the National Park Service. They had obtained netting permits from the
Missouri Department of Conservation, National Park Service, and U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service for that purpose.

The cave, owned by the Missouri Department of Conservation, is on the
Current River within the boundaries of Ozark National Scenic
Riverways. The name and location are withheld to avoid disturbance of
the cave, which contains many natural resources and several species
of bats. A cave gate on the entrance prevents trespassers from entering.

Ozark Riverways protects over 300 caves within its boundaries. Access
to several of these has previously been restricted in order to
protect fragile resources and ecosystems. Due to WNS, the park is
exercising caution in managing activities that impact caves and bats.
Park Superintendent Reed Detring has determined that WNS is an
imminent threat to the cave bats in the park, and every effort should
be made to prevent or slow its spread.

The park is asking visitors to observe all closures and to avoid
other caves or passages of caves that may contain hibernating
populations of bats.

Round Spring Caverns will remain open to public tours at this time,
although the park will implement screening measures and precautions
designed to reduce the risk of human transmission of WNS. Visitors
should decontaminate all clothing, footwear, and gear upon exiting
any cave in order to reduce the possibility of transmitting the
disease. For more information regarding decontamination of clothing
and cave gear, please visit:
<http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html>,
<http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html>.

According to Detring, this new policy will be reviewed regularly as
new information about the spread of WNS becomes available. "The
park's biologists have been working diligently to gather information
about WNS since its discovery and to assess the cave resources at
Ozark Riverways. We are using the best scientific data at hand to
make decisions about our future management actions in this situation.
We will continue to gather information and cooperate with other
entities in order to protect these valuable resources."

The discovery of WNS in Missouri, a state with more than 6300 caves,
is troubling to the state's leading cave resource experts. "Missouri
is home to at least 12 species of bats," explained Missouri
Department of Conservation Cave Biologist Bill Elliott. "They are our
front-line defense against many insect pests including some moths,
certain beetles and mosquitoes. Insect pests can cause extensive
forest and agricultural damage. Missouri's 775 000 gray bats alone
eat more than 223 billion bugs a year, or about 540 tons. They also
play a vital role in cave ecosystems, providing nutrients for other
cave life through their droppings, or guano, and are food for other
animals such as snakes and owls."

The National Park Service will join other resource agencies in June
2010 to begin work on a comprehensive Statewide White-Nose Syndrome
Action Plan to address management of this issue.
