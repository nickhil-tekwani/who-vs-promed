[Re: Chicken breasts BSE risk - UK ex Netherlands -- see ref. below. A short
synopsis: "Quantities of frozen chicken adulterated with beef protein
powder, which the authorities admit could present a risk of BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy), are being consumed in Britain, a Guardian
[newspaper] investigation has revealed. The beef proteins are added to make
the chicken absorb extra water in a process called "tumbling" so that it can
be sold for more profits."]

Any information to suggest this practice in the US?

Regarding a process termed "tumbled chicken," poultry products containing
solutions are nothing new. While binders are allowed in boneless and
bone-in poultry, they must be determined by USDA (and FDA) to be safe and
suitable for use, and they must be identified on labeling (ingredients
statement), as well as in qualifiers to the product name when present over
certain levels of use.

Hydrolyzed (species) proteins have been used globally for decades as
flavoring agents and must be declared as "hydrolyzed (species) protein"
according the USDA rules. Only if the hydrolysis is incomplete can such
proteins be considered to be water binders.

USDA rules require that all ingredients must be declared by common or usual
name on the labeling of meat and poultry products and that all proteinaceous
ingredients must be declared by common or usual name. Further, all proteins
of animal origin must be declared by species and common or usual name on the
labels of meat and poultry products, except for gelatin. Gelatin is
permitted as a binder in various poultry products and has to be declared as
such; however, it has limited allowable uses in livestock products.

[It would seem that solutions are allowed in US food products, but they are
species-specific and must be noted on the label. Hence it would seem to be
unusual to have beef solutions used in chicken.

The risk of BSE in the US is currently said to be essentially non-existent.
According to the Harvard Risk Analysis, there is almost no chance of BSE in
the US -- therefore, there should be no risk from the tumbled chicken
breast, as long as no imported beef is involved. - Mod.TG/JW]
