Deaths from unidentified infection in DR Congo
-----------------------------------------------------
A Congolese friend forwarded me the following message (concise translation
from the French): "More than eighty (80) people died recently in villages
situated in the sectors of Lueta and Kabelekese, territory of Lwiza, in the
Congolese province of west-Kasai, after eating meat from contaminated pigs.
The lack of veterinary products makes it virtually impossible for the local
competent authorities to intervene. The contaminated pigs seem to have high
fever and diarrea and die within a few hours.
I hope someone can confirm the correctness of this message.

[Could anybody confirm the above information on the human and/or animal
mortality (which might not necessarily be interelated)?
In case affirmative -- any available diagnostic data, or at least
description of the clinical symptoms and observed gross-pathological
changes, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
