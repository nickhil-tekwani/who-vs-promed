Suspected foot and mouth in Brazil was false alarm
----------------------------------------
The Brazilian Agricultural Ministry says that a suspected outbreak of foot
and mouth disease (FMD) in the state of Mato Grasso do Sul during December
was a false alarm. A farm located near Paraguay was quarantined after 28
cattle tested positive for the infectious disease.
While the initial tests were positive, further testing negated that earlier
ruling. The Ag Ministry suspects that the false positives were the result
of the cattle being vaccinated for foot and mouth disease 4 days prior to
testing.
During 2004, there were 2 outbreaks of foot and mouth in Brazil, one of
which led their primary beef customer, Russia, to ban most imports. Brazil
has the world's largest commercial herd, and due to the U.S. being mostly
out of the marketplace for 2004, is expected to be the leading beef exporter.
