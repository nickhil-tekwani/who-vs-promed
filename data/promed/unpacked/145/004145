Yesterday [Fri 5 Mar 2021], a new focus of bird flu virus was discovered in Batna wilaya, in the east of the country.

The Agriculture Directorate of Batna State stated that "a focus of avian influenza virus has been confirmed in the Seriana region in the state."

The directorate demanded that poultry keepers in the region attend a meeting to be held on Sunday [7 Mar 2021] in the Seriana region to take advantage of instructions and directives to avoid the spread of infection. According to the statement, these measures aim to preserve the livestock and economic resources of poultry farmers. The statement did not mention additional details about the extent of the virus spread or the number of dead poultry.

Last month [February 2021], Algeria declared a state of high alert after the World Organisation for Animal Health announced the registration of a bird flu focus in the eastern state of Oum El Bouaghi (adjacent to the state of Batna), which was spotted at the end of last January [2021].

The Ministry of Agriculture attributed the source of the virus at the time to migratory birds and confirmed that "the epidemic has been brought under control."

Laboratory analyzes revealed the spread of avian influenza in the Ain Fakroun region in the state of Umm El-Bouaghi, and 51 200 chickens were affected, most of them dead, before the area was isolated [see comment].

The previously mentioned event in Ain Fakroun, Oum El Bouaghi was reported by the Algerian authorities to the OIE in an immediate notification dated 8 Feb 2021 (see 20210211.8183060). It was serotyped by the National laboratory as HPAI H5N8. According to later media reports, the disease has since been observed in other locations in Algeria; this information has been posted by ProMED-MENA (see at https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8196268).

Most likely the outbreaks which followed the initial one, including the current outbreak, were caused by the same HPAI H5N8 strain.

HPAI H5N8 has been spreading widely throughout Eurasia since October 2020, most likely borne by migratory birds from Central Asia.
