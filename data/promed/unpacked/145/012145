Migrating animals pose bird flu problems for Vietnam
---------------------------------------------------
World health officials warn the virus has become more resilient,
deadly and mobile, but Vietnam still faces a huge problem trying to
contain infected animals on the move.
Deep in the rice paddies of the Mekong Delta where officials rarely
venture, the Vietnam government's bird flu awareness campaign hasn't
gotten far. Ducks run into areas where wild birds play -- migratory
fowl which might carry the bird flu virus.
One duck farmer said, "I raise ducks here because it's now the rice
harvest and I can save money as I don't need to buy food for the
ducks. They come to the rice paddy, eat the seeds and produce eggs so
I'll earn more money." He says he has heard about bird flu, and knows
he should spray his ducks with disinfectant. But no one has told him
to keep them away from other creatures to prevent any cross-species
spread.
The greatest risk of a pandemic, experts say, is the uncontrolled
movement of animals.
Rach Gia is a market town, a typical hub on the bank of one of the
multiple arteries along the Mekong River.
Several bird flu outbreaks here have been attributed to human and
poultry smuggling from Cambodia, a country with far less capacity to
detect and fight bird flu.
On the border a booming trade in cheap Cambodian produce flourishes;
Cambodian mangos are more delicious, many say, and Cambodian
chickens, too.
Inspectors in this no man's land check all goods coming in. Anyone
who tries to bring in live animals or meat is sent home. A border
guard said, "I've caught people smuggling chickens and ducks from
Cambodia into Vietnam 3 to 4 times. I confiscated the animals and
killed them. The smugglers were detained at a distance from the main
border gate."
Borders in Indochina are long and porous, and no government can fully
control crowds of entrepreneurial people on the move, anymore than
they can control the movements of stray animals.
Just who is in charge out here? The state? Or the law of nature?
-----------------------------------------------
Wild heron don't know or care that they have crossed an international
border. Neither does the bird flu virus. If the disease is to be
controlled, experts say, every country in Southeast Asia has to join
in a coordinated effort.
In the short term, bird flu awareness and surveillance needs to be
improved; over a longer period there lies the massive task of
restructuring farms in the region.
And while UN agencies estimate a total cost of USD 300 million, they
emphasise it is a small price to pay to stave off a worldwide bird
flu pandemic.

Thousands of health volunteers to monitor bird flu
--------------------------------------------------
The Thai government has organised more than 850 000 health-care
volunteers across the country to closely monitor for local outbreaks
of bird flu in order to contain the disease.
Organised by the Ministry of Public Health, the scheme is intended to
prevent human's catching the infection, the newly appointed Public
Health Minister, Dr.Suchai Charoenrattanakul, told TNA.
"Infection from birds to humans should be down to zero, as we are
implementing tough monitoring measures", he said.
Volunteers will monitor the death rate of chickens in every village
and report regularly to the districts' health-care chiefs who will
report to the Ministry of Public Health. Officials in Thailand's
upper central and lower northern regions have been told to beef up
their monitoring system because these areas have had repeated
outbreaks of the disease in the past 2 years. Since the system was
introduced several months ago, no fresh cases of bird flu patients
have been found.
But local public health workers have been told not to lower their
guard, the public health minister said.

UN gives Myanmar funds to fight bird flu
----------------------------------------
The United Nations has provided funds to help Myanmar fight bird flu,
although no case of the disease has been confirmed in the country, a
semi-official newspaper said Sunday [21 Mar 2005]. The funds from the
UN Food and Agriculture Organisation will be used for administrative
support, veterinarian training and equipment for disease diagnosis,
the Myanmar Times said.
The money, totaling USD 350 000 (euro 271 000), will be shared with 9
other Asian countries.
Than Tun, director of the government's Livestock Breeding and
Veterinary Department, said earlier that bird flu was unlikely to
break out in Myanmar because only some 15 percent of chickens are
grown commercially.
The disease often breaks out among dense poultry populations such as
found on commercial farms.
Myanmar banned poultry imports in January 2004 from countries where
bird flu has been detected, and officials are monitoring poultry
farms in the country.

Governor plays down bird flu scare
-----------------------------------
West Java Governor Danny Setiawan said on Monday [21 Mar 2005] that
isolation of all of the province's chicken farms was not necessary
because only a small number of farms were affected by bird flu.
He said that he had requested a review of the policy from the
directorate general of production and farming supervision at the
agriculture ministry on the move to isolate all the farm animals from
West Java. South Sulawesi's farms were also ordered to be isolated
last week.
"They (the ministry) have confirmed that not all chickens have to be
isolated, only those in affected areas," he said.
Head of the health subdivision at West Java's animal husbandry
office, Musni Suatmodjo, claimed that bird flu had mostly affected
quail and was no longer found in the province. The cases occurred
between January and early March 2004 in 4 areas: Subang, Cirebon,
Indramayu and Sukabumi; affecting over 16 000 fowl.
The governor said the number of affected chickens was small,
particularly in relation to the millions in the province.
