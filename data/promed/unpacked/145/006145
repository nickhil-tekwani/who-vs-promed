In the village of Bestamak, Alga district, Aktobe region, an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a dangerous viral disease, was detected. "Infected animals cannot chew and lose weight in 2 days. Some came from the pastures sick: they froth at the mouth. My husband is a veterinarian. He separated the rest of the animals and treats the sick with antibiotics," said [SN], a resident of the village of Bestamak.

"There is no veterinary laboratory in the regional center of Alga," [SS], another Bestamak resident, said. "Therefore, rural veterinarians in such cases turn to the regional center -- Aktobe."

On Saturday [20 Nov 2021] evening, a community meeting was held in Bestamak, where the main topic was a dispute over a local pig farm. The conflict has been going on for a year -- hundreds of residents of the Bestamak village demanded the closure of a pig farm near the village, speaking of the impending environmental disaster.

The owner, represented by the Parizhskaya Kommuna company, stores the waste of the pig farm in a pit near the village. Residents say that this stenchy pit is the cause of their troubles, including the infection of animals with dangerous diseases.

Zhaksygali Imankulov, deputy governor of Aktobe region, who was present at this meeting, apologized to the residents that he could not resolve the issue with the pig farm for a year, although he promised twice. However, according to the authorities, the pig farm and its waste "have nothing to do" with the death of animals from FMD. Akim of the Alga region Nurbol Yerzhanov said that FMD was found in 3 more villages, but "there are no pig farms there."

To stop the spread of FMD, local authorities have launched an emergency vaccination program for animals. To date, 8000 head of livestock have received the vaccine [see comment].

Bestamak is a town in Aktobe region, west Kazakhstan; see the map at <tinyurl.com/336atyyr>. It is located about 95 km (59 mi) from the Russian border on its north.

During OIE's last General Session, May 2021, Kazakhstan was re-accredited by the Assembly as one of the members "having FMD free zones where vaccination is not practised," according to the provisions of Chapter 8.8 of the Terrestrial Code. West Kazakhstan is included in Zone 1; the northeastern part of Aktobe region is included in Zone 2. The full list has been published by OIE as follows (https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/05/a-r13-2021-fmd.pdf):

- Zone 1 consisting of West Kazakhstan, Atyrau, Mangystau and southwestern part of Aktobe region;
- Zone 2 including northeastern part of Aktobe (Aqt√∂be) region, southern part of Kostanay region and western part of Karaganda region;
- Zone 3 including northern and central parts of Kostanay region, western parts of North Kazakhstan and Akmola regions;
- Zone 4 including central and eastern parts of North Kazakhstan region and northern parts of Akmola and Pavlodar regions;
- Zone 5 including central and eastern parts of Karaganda region and southern parts of Akmola and Pavlodar regions.

A map, presenting the above zones, is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/map/A_Kazakhstan.jpg.

Kazakhstan's last report of FMD dates back to 2013. In the past, the FMD serotypes reported from Kazakhstan were O and A.

Confirmation or otherwise from an official source of the information published today (21 Nov 2021) by the Kyrgyz branch of Radio Liberty, including the results of the laboratory tests, the application of vaccination, clinical and epidemiological findings, are anticipated. As assumed from the media report, which includes an "illustrative photo," the affected animals are cattle. This deserves confirmation as well. - Mod.AS
