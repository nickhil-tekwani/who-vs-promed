Anthrax has again appeared in South Dakota livestock. Dr. Sam
Holland, State Veterinarian, reports the disease has struck a cattle
ranch in Tripp County. The State Veterinarian was called on Wed 28
Jul 2004 and specimens were collected and taken to the lab, which
confirmed the diagnosis on Thu 29 Jul 2004.
The case involves a pasture containing a group of approximately 180
unvaccinated cow-calf pairs, with losses including 8 head (7 females
and 1 calf). The herd was scheduled to be treated immediately with
antibiotics and vaccinated, and carcasses properly disposed of under
the supervision of the Animal Industry Board.
The cattle affected are approximately 6 miles from the area in Tripp
County where a ranch was affected in 2003.
Producers [have been] alerted to outbreaks so they can consult their
veterinarians and vaccinate their livestock if deemed appropriate.
Dr. Holland says he advised practicing veterinarians to be alert for
Anthrax in his July newsletter. Rendering companies have also been
alerted so that carcasses are not rendered but properly burned and
buried on the farm.

[Thanks to Sam for this prompt report of an outbreak in the southeast
corner of South Dakota. The state has been having an on-again,
off-again small number of sporadic outbreaks, which are probably the
long-term cost of the environmental contamination from the severe
outbreaks afflicting the Dakotas, Nebraska, and adjoining parts of
Minnesota in the 1930s, and maintained by sporadic cases in the
intervening years. It is unusual to see calf losses, presumably
because they are not solely dependent on grazing and are not vigorous
grazers anyway. One should remember that cows consume some 2-3 kg of
soil each day while grazing. Immediate treatment of an exposed herd
with long-acting antibiotics is very effective in heading off any
incubating infections, but as the Sterne vaccine is "live," one
should then wait 7-10 days for the antibiotic levels in the blood to
fall away. Sterne vegetative cells are very sensitive to antibiotics,
which therefore nullify any vaccinal advantages if given
simultaneously with the vaccine. - Mod.MHJ]
