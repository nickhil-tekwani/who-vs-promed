The article is not very clear as to the agent involved. Different species or
sub-species (depending on who you talk to) of _Trypanosoma_ infect humans
(African sleeping sickness), and another is devastating to cattle. I would
be very interested in knowing what drugs they are talking about. Perhaps
someone could explain what they mean by "a high level of reinversion causing
failure at the site where deltamethrin was used".
