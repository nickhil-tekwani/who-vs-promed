On 25 Jun 2010, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) reported a suspected
case of yellow fever [YF] in Titule, Base Ouele district of Orientale
province (northern part of the country). Between March and June 2010,
11 other suspected cases were reported, including 2 deaths.

The index case was identified as a 43-year-old male farmer who
presented with clinical symptoms of fever, jaundice and haematuria
(blood in urine). The onset date of his illness was 15 Mar 2010, and
he died a few days later. He had no history of yellow fever
vaccination. Laboratory tests conducted by the Institut National de
Recherche Medicale (INRB) in Kinshasa showed IgM positive by ELISA
test and was confirmed by the regional reference laboratory for
yellow fever at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal with more
specific tests (plaque reduction neutralization test or PRNT).

Following identification of the index case (the 43-year-old male), an
investigation is being conducted in the town, inhabited by some 17
000 people, for the purpose of determining the scope of the outbreak
response and to prepare for emergency vaccination.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is among Africa's yellow fever
endemic countries and, in 2003, introduced yellow fever vaccine in
the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) for all children at 9
months of age. The DRC has not yet benefited from preventive
vaccination campaigns.

[The 12 YF cases raise the question of whether these cases represent
infections from the sylvan transmission cycle from mosquitoes feeding
on YF virus infected non-human primates or the urban,
human-mosquito-human cycle. The absence of any additional cases after
June 2010 suggests that ongoing YF virus transmission to humans may
have ended. Any additional information from this area would be of
interest.
