Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rodent-borne viral disease
characterized by severe pulmonary illness and a case-fatality ratio of 43%.
Sin Nombre virus is the primary hantavirus that causes HPS in the United
States, and the deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) is its predominant
carrier.
***********************************
CDC-sponsored studies of rodent populations since 1994 have yielded data
that suggest an increased risk for infection for humans in some areas of the
southwestern United States during the summer of 1999.

This report describes increases in human cases during January-May 1999,
current hantavirus prevalence in rodent populations, the need for renewed
attention to reduce the risk for hantavirus exposure, and the importance of
physician awareness and early detection in the treatment of HPS.
Human HPS
-----------------
HPS is clinically defined as a febrile illness and the presence on a chest
radiograph of bilateral infiltrates resembling acute respiratory distress
syndrome (1). As of May 28, 1999, CDC had confirmed 217 cases of HPS in 30
states. From January through May 1999, seven cases of HPS were confirmed in
Colorado, New Mexico, New York, and Washington. An additional 11 suspected
cases with preliminary clinical and serologic evidence of HPS were reported
in Arizona, California, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, and Washington.
Eight of the confirmed and suspected cases are from Arizona, Colorado, and
New Mexico. In the same 5-month period during each year from 1995 through
1998, this area averaged approximately two cases each year.
Rodent Monitoring
-------------------------
Since 1994, CDC has sponsored continuous monitoring studies of rodent
populations at nine sites in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico (2).
Population densities of deer mice at New Mexico monitoring sites during
January-May 1999 were lower compared with densities during spring 1998;
however, densities at one site in Colorado in May 1999 were greater than 50%
higher than 1 year earlier.
Hantavirus antibody prevalences in deer mouse populations surveyed during
spring 1999 were 35%-45% in some populations in New Mexico and up to 40% in
Colorado. In comparison, prevalences during the population peaks of spring
1998 were less than 10% in New Mexico and approximately 20% in Colorado.
These figures were comparable with a prevalence of 10%-15% in deer mouse
populations sampled
throughout the United States since 1993; during the 1993 outbreak,
prevalences of 30% were detected (3).

Editorial Note:
-------------------
Hantavirus infection can occur after inhaling infectious aerosols from
rodent saliva or excreta. HPS typically begins as a prodrome of headache,
fever, and myalgia soon followed by pulmonary edema, which often leads to
severe respiratory compromise. Thrombocytopenia, presence of immunoblasts,
and hemoconcentration are characteristic laboratory findings. Other than
supportive care, no treatment exists
for hantavirus infection.
The probability of surviving HPS increases with early recognition,
hospitalization, and aggressive pulmonary and hemodynamic support (4). The
highest concentration of HPS cases has occurred in the western United
States, and CDC rodent monitoring has focused on this area. However,
hantavirus reservoir species occur throughout the United States, and cases
of HPS have occurred nationwide. All primary health-care providers are
strongly encouraged to become familiar with the signs and symptoms of HPS
(5) and to immediately report suspected cases to their state health
departments.
Risk for human disease is proportional to the frequency with which persons
come into contact with infectious rodents, and rodent population density and
the prevalence of
infection in rodents may help to quantify risk for communities. Both
population densities and prevalences vary from site to site and can change
markedly from season to season and from year to year. Population densities
may vary 10-fold within 2 or 3 months. Prevalences of hantavirus infection
in deer mouse populations occasionally have been greater than 60% at
specific sites in the southwestern United States,
California (6), and Montana. Infrequently, environmental conditions result
in the simultaneous occurrence of high rodent population densities and a
high prevalence of hantavirus infection among rodents. This combination,
which appears to be occurring this year in some rodent populations in the
southwestern United States, results in a greater number of infected mice and
leads to a higher risk for transmission to humans. The increased number of
HPS cases reported in the southwest this year supports this interpretation.
Although increased physician awareness of HPS cannot be ruled out, the
number of confirmed cases this year exceeds the average number identified
during the same periods in 1995 through 1998 and suggests that the increase
is real.
The importance of adherence to risk-reduction measures should be emphasized
by increased efforts to educate the public, especially among residents of
rural areas of the southwestern United States. The most effective way to
decrease the risk for HPS is to limit exposure to rodents and their excreta.
Most persons with HPS who had high-risk exposures are thought to have been
infected in and around their homes; therefore, limiting opportunities for
peridomestic exposure is particularly important. Measures to prevent HPS can
be divided into four areas: eliminating rodent harborage (7),
controlling rodent populations, properly cleaning up rodent infestation, and
avoiding rodents in outdoor settings (see box).
Recommendations for Preventing Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.Eliminate rodent harborage
Keep cooking, eating, and food storage areas clean
Cover human food and animal feed
Contain and elevate garbage
Seal holes and cracks in dwellings to prevent entrance by rodents
Clear brush and trash from around homes and outbuildings
2.Control rodent populations by maintaining snap traps and/or using
rodenticides; in areas where plague occurs, control fleas with insecticides
3.Safely clean up rodent-infested areas
Air out infested spaces before cleanup
Spray areas of infestation and all excreta, nesting, and other
materials with household disinfectant or 10% bleach solution, then clean up,
seal in bags, and dispose
Avoid sweeping, vacuuming, or stirring dust until the area is
thoroughly wet with disinfectant
Wear rubber gloves; disinfect gloves before removal, and wash
hands afterwards
In areas where plague occurs, spray insecticide on trapped rodents
and nesting materials to prevent fleas from abandoning rodents to find new
hosts
4.Avoid rodents when outdoors
Do not disturb rodent droppings or camp or sleep near burrows or
areas where trash is present
Avoid feeding or handling rodents, even if they appear friendly
No restriction of travel to areas where HPS has been reported is necessary.
However, activities that may disrupt rodent burrows or result in contact
with rodents or aerosolization of rodent excreta should be avoided.
Clinical principles of recognition and support for HPS were reviewed in a
video conference in May 1999; a videotape of this conference is available

Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, (404) 639-1510.
