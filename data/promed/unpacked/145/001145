The Western Australian Seabird Rescue group believes a possible botulism outbreak is the cause of a number of reported duck deaths at a lake in Meadow Springs. The disease, which is produced by a bacteria found in rotting food, carcasses, and soil, leads to paralysis and is one of the most common causes of death in birds. The lake is in a park bordered by Glenelg Way, Pebble Beach Boulevard, and Grandmere Parade.

Western Australian Seabird Rescue said botulism outbreaks happen every year following "the 1st autumn rains" and occurs when the birds eat food or drink water that contains the toxin.

"The heavy rains have re-flooded many wetlands, and we are about to have a few warm days, so botulism outbreaks could occur anywhere," their Facebook post read.

"It's critical to remove the dead birds from the water so other birds don't feed on their carcasses and become affected too," the post continued. "If you walk your dogs around this park, please keep your dogs on lead (so they don't pick up an infected carcass). And please do not throw bread or other food into the water, as this will affect the nutrient quality and exacerbate the issue."

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and, to a lesser extent, type E. - Mod.PMB
