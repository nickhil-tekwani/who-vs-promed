Does the vaccine stop transmission?
-----------------------------------
How to understand the difference between vaccination to prevent COVID-19 and shots to halt infection.

The purpose of the COVID-19 vaccines is to prevent death and serious health complications that strain our overburdened healthcare system. All the vaccines authorized for emergency use do this, and their safety and effectiveness in clinical trials have surpassed expectations. But most people, quite understandably, want to know something more: Will being vaccinated stop the spread of COVID-19 so they can socialize outside their bubbles and dine indoors with abandon?

Eventually, yes.

Many scientists are reluctant to say with certainty that the vaccines prevent transmission of the virus from one person to another. This can be misinterpreted as an admission that the vaccines do not work. That's not the case. The limited data available suggests the vaccines will at least partly reduce transmission, and the studies to determine this with more clarity are underway. There should be more data within the next couple of months. Until then, precautionary measures like masking and distancing in the presence of unvaccinated people will remain important. [see section [3] below on preliminary data. - Mod.MPP]

It is true that, according to the clinical trial data, both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are highly effective at preventing COVID-19, the disease, but it's unknown how well they prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus. Although COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 are often used interchangeably, they are fundamentally different. You can't have the disease without the virus, but you can have the virus without the disease -- as many asymptomatic people already know. It's possible that vaccinated people are protected against COVID-19 themselves, but still spread SARS-CoV-2 to others who are not vaccinated.

Why would scientists make vaccines that protect against only a disease rather than the virus that causes it? They don't set out to do that, but it is the result, in part, of the exigencies of clinical trials. Practically, clinical trials can be completed more quickly if the endpoint of the trial -- the main scientific question the trial is investigating -- is something that can be easily observed. If SARS-CoV-2 infection were the trial endpoint, participants in the clinical trials would need to be tested at least weekly. It's easier to identify participants who develop COVID-19 symptoms and then swab them to confirm. So for efficiency's sake, the primary endpoint of the clinical trials was whether the vaccines protect against COVID-19 symptoms.

This study approach also makes sense from a public health perspective. Most people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not die, but many will become very sick and require medical care. This fills up hospitals and places significant strain on the healthcare system. Vaccines that can transform what would normally be a severe illness into something mild and manageable relieve this burden, saving lives and improving their quality.

When scientists develop a vaccine against a novel virus, it's difficult to predict whether vaccination will completely prevent infection -- what's called sterilizing immunity. If the COVID-19 vaccines do not provide sterilizing immunity, it means a vaccinated person can still inhale enough of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to develop an infection, and it will be swiftly cleared from the body before becoming COVID-19, but that person could still pass the infection to another person.

There are many vaccines that do not provide fully sterilizing immunity but nonetheless have huge public health benefits. Every year, the flu vaccine saves lives and keeps people out of the hospital despite the fact that it doesn't prevent infection altogether.

From everything we know so far, it's highly unlikely that vaccines that are 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic disease would have no impact whatsoever on infection. Data from animal studies and vaccine trials suggests that vaccination reduces asymptomatic infection, as well as the amount of virus produced in people infected. In Israel, where a substantial portion of the population has been vaccinated, there has been a significant decline in cases since vaccination began in December [2020], with a 49 percent decrease observed in people over age 60, according to a preliminary report. Studies to better determine the impact of vaccines on transmission are ongoing, and in the meantime, if precautions like masking are paired with increasing immunization, SARS-CoV-2 cases should plummet.

Historical evidence shows that vaccines that do not prevent virus infection can still stop epidemics in their tracks. The polio vaccine developed by Dr Jonas Salk, which does not provide sterilizing immunity, resulted in the rapid elimination of polio in the United States beginning in the 1950s. People lined up eagerly to receive the vaccine to protect their children and themselves. The Salk vaccine was highly protective against the devastating impact of the disease and also worked to reduce spread of the virus because so many people were vaccinated and could clear their infection.

These COVID-19 vaccines are as much a victory for public health now as the Salk vaccine was then. We would do well to remind ourselves of the transformative power of vaccines that prevent disease without completely preventing infection when enough people take the vaccine. The sooner we reduce spread in the community and protect as many people as possible through vaccination, the sooner we'll be able to relax.

[This opinion piece follows on ProMED mail COVID-19 update (75): mutation & recomb, transmission, school, Tanzania, WHO 20210223.8207677. The public needs to understand the difference between protection from disease versus protection from infection, and finally infection but prevention of secondary transmission. If an individual were able to become infected following vaccination, virus replication may be decreased by the presence of neutralizing antibody stimulated by the vaccine, thereby preventing severe disease, as well as successful transmission to a 2nd party because the dose to which that party is exposed is below the level of virus needed to be infectious. As illustrated with polio above, virus infection need not necessarily be totally stopped to halt an epidemic. - Mod.LK]

[2] Variants
[A] Variant B.1.125 detected in 13 countries
Date: Fri 19 Feb 2021
Source: The Guardian / LiveScience [edited]
https://tinyurl.com/pw9vrs6p


A new coronavirus variant has been detected in the UK, Nigeria, and 11 other countries, including the US, according to a report by researchers at the University of Edinburgh. The variant, dubbed B.1.125, contains a mutation in the virus's spike protein, which allows it to bind to and enter human cells. Scientists worry that because of this mutation, known as E484K, current vaccines may be less effective against this new variant.

This mutation also appears in the coronavirus variants that have previously been found in South Africa, and Brazil, according to The Guardian. It's also turned up in some samples of the UK variant, known as B.1.1.7, as Live Science previously reported. Researchers think that the E484K mutation can help the virus evade so-called neutralizing antibodies, which bind to the virus and prevent it from infecting cells, according to The Guardian.

Simon Clarke, an associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told The Guardian that the E484K mutation makes the South African variant resistant to some vaccines, and he worries that the new variant may also be somewhat resistant. "We don't yet know how well this [new] variant will spread, but if it is successful it can be presumed that immunity from any vaccine or previous infection will be blunted," Clarke told The Guardian.

According to the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the viral variants from South Africa, the UK, and Brazil all seem to be more contagious than the original coronavirus strain. But that has not yet been found true for this new variant. "There is currently no evidence that this set of mutations causes more severe illness or increased transmissibility," Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said in a statement, according to Reuters.

As of [17 Feb 2021], 46 cases of the new variant had been confirmed by gene sequencing in the UK, according to government documents. B.1.125 was 1st detected in samples from people with COVID-19 in Nigeria in December 2020, according to the University of Edinburgh report, though PHE notes in a blog post that "investigations are ongoing to confirm its country of origin." The University of Edinburgh report also notes that as of [17 Feb 2021], the variant had been detected by genetic sequencing in 12 US cases.

[B] Variant: USA (California)
Date: Tue 23 Feb 2021
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/23/world/covid-19-coronavirus#two-studies-confirm-a-new-variant-in-california-is-more-contagious-but-the-scale-of-its-threat-is-unclear


A variant 1st discovered in California in December [2020] is more contagious than earlier forms of the coronavirus, 2 new studies have shown, fueling concerns that emerging mutants like this one could hamper the sharp decline in cases overall in the state and perhaps elsewhere.

In one of the new studies, researchers found that the variant has spread rapidly in a San Francisco neighborhood in the past couple of months. The other report confirmed that the variant has surged across the state, and revealed that it produces twice as many viral particles inside a person's body as other variants do. That study also hinted that the variant may be better than others at evading the immune system -- and vaccines. "I wish I had better news to give you -- that this variant is not significant at all," said Dr Charles Chiu, a virologist at the University of California, San Francisco.

Neither study has yet been published in a scientific journal. And experts don't know how much of a public health threat this variant poses compared with others that are also spreading in California.

A variant called B.1.1.7 arrived in the United States from Britain, where it swiftly became the dominant form of the virus and overloaded hospitals there. Studies of British medical records suggest that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible but more lethal than earlier variants.

Some experts said the new variant in California was concerning, but unlikely to create as much of a burden as B.1.1.7. "I'm increasingly convinced that this one is transmitting more than others locally," said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in the research. "But there's no evidence to suggest that it's in the same ballpark as B.1.1.7."

Dr Chiu 1st stumbled across the new variant by accident. In December [2020], he and other researchers in California were worried about the discovery of B.1.1.7 in Britain. They began looking through their samples from positive coronavirus tests in California, sequencing viral genomes to see if B.1.1.7 had arrived in their state. On New Year's Eve [31 Dec 2021], Dr Chiu was shocked to find a previously unknown variant that made up 1/4 of the samples he and his colleagues had collected. "I thought that was crazy," he said. It turned out that researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles separately discovered the same variant surging to high levels in Southern California. Dr Chiu announced his initial finding, and the Cedars-Sinai team went public 2 days later.

Since then, researchers have been looking more closely at the new variant, known as B.1.427/B.1.429, to pinpoint its origin and track its spread. It has shown up in 45 states to date, and in several other countries, including Australia, Denmark, Mexico, and Taiwan. But it has so far taken off only in California.

It was unclear at 1st whether the variant was inherently more transmissible than others, or whether it had surged in California because of gatherings that became superspreading events.

[As variants continue to be identified, it is important to determine their prevalence, origin, and importantly, their biological impact on the virus's virulence, infectiousness, and transmissibility, as well as their ability to escape protection provided by the vaccines. Because SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, mutations will keep occurring, especially with the high levels of activity being observed. The more the virus replicates, the more mutations will occur. And if mutations occur in the primer-probe region, they may be missed, so there may be even more mutations than have been detected. - Mod.LK]

[3] UK: vaccination impact
[A] Overview
Date: Mon 22 Feb 2021 [abridged, edited]
Source: The Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/covid-vaccines-protection-uk/2021/02/22/216b1dac-751a-11eb-9489-8f7dacd51e75_story.html



In the 1st study to describe the nationwide effectiveness of 2 vaccines, researchers in Scotland reported Monday [22 Feb 2021] that both the 1st doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca shots greatly reduced hospital admissions for COVID-19 among the elderly -- changing by up to 85 percent and 94 percent, respectively.

British public health officials hailed the results from the "real-world" studies, which are showing that the vaccines are beginning to have a positive impact on the coronavirus pandemic. Arne Akbar, president of the British Society for Immunology, called the initial data "extremely promising."

The Scottish researchers analyzed a data set covering the entire Scottish population of 5.4 million, of which 1.1 million people -- about 20 percent of the population - have received a 1st dose of the Pfizer or Oxford vaccines. Then, they compared the vaccinated with the unvaccinated, and they saw strong evidence of protection. From December [2020] until the middle of February [2021], more than 8000 people ended up in the hospital with COVID-19 in Scotland, but only 58 of those patients came from the vaccinated group. Combining results for both vaccines for people 80 and older, there was an overall 81 percent reduction in hospital admissions by the 4th week, said Aziz Sheikh, professor of primary care research and development at the University of Edinburgh and one of the principal investigators. Sheikh cautioned that the immunity offered by the 1st doses of the vaccines could wane. But more will be known as researchers follow the vaccinated after their 2nd doses. Josie Murray of Public Health Scotland, another leader in the study, told journalists "the other fantastic news" is that the vaccines should already be helping reduce the COVID-19 burden on National Health Service hospitals.

Previous results about vaccine efficacy have come almost exclusively from clinical trials. The 1st population-level studies have been reported from Israel. They looked at the effectiveness of just one vaccine, Pfizer-BioNTech, which has been shown to be almost 96 percent effective in preventing hospitalizations and death. Israel has vaccinated almost half its adult population. The Scottish research was released in a preprint Monday [22 Feb 2021] and is not yet peer-reviewed. In a statement, the co-developer of the Oxford vaccine, Sarah Gilbert, said the high effectiveness in protecting those over 80 after a single dose increases "confidence in using this vaccine in adults of all ages."

In a 2nd study, also released Monday [22 Feb 2021], Public Health England scientists presented preliminary data showing that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears to provide high levels of protection not only against symptomatic COVID-19 but against coronavirus infection.
Researchers have been examining a cohort of vaccinated healthcare workers every 2 weeks -- whether they have COVID-19 symptoms -- and they found that one dose reduced the risk of infection by more than 70 percent, rising to 85 percent after the 2nd dose. "This suggests the vaccine may also help to interrupt virus transmission, as you cannot spread the virus if you do not have infection," the PHE researchers said in a statement.

Alongside these encouraging results, Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined the next steps Monday [22 Feb 2021] in lifting the country's national lockdown, a "road map" that he said he hopes will be "cautious but also irreversible." It will be a slow march, Johnson warned. He outlined detailed plans in Parliament, telling lawmakers that there would be 4 stages, with a minimum of 5 weeks between each stage. The earliest possible date that most of the restrictions could be lifted is [21 Jun 2021], the prime minister said. The 1st big changes will occur [8 Mar 2021], when all schools in England will reopen, 2 people from different households will be able to meet outdoors and nursing home residents in England can receive one regular visitor. In April [2021], hair salons, barbers, gyms, and nonessential shops may open. In May [2021], pubs and restaurants. In June [2021], foreign holiday travel could resume.

The British government is being far more tentative about easing restrictions this time, even as its vaccination rollout is going astonishingly well -- about 1/4 of the population has had at least one shot of the vaccine. The new changes will be rolled out slowly. At each stage, the government says its decisions will be driven by data -- figures on the vaccine rollout program, hospital admissions and deaths, infection rates, and the impact of any new variants. The semiautonomous governments in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales have their own timetables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
The BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy against infection in phase 3 clinical trials and are now being used in national vaccination programmes in the UK and several other countries. There is an urgent need to study the 'real-world' effects of these vaccines. The aim of our study was to estimate the effectiveness of the 1st dose of these COVID-19 vaccines in preventing hospital admissions.

Methods
We conducted a prospective cohort study using the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) database comprising of linked vaccination, primary care, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing, hospitalisation and mortality records for 5.4 million people in Scotland (covering [approximately] 99% of population). A time-dependent Cox model and Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate effectiveness against COVID-19 related hospitalisation (defined as 1- Adjusted Hazard Ratio) following the 1st dose of vaccine.

Findings
The 1st dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76 to 91) for COVID-19 related hospitalisation at 28-34 days post-vaccination. Vaccine effect at the same time interval for the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 94% (95% CI 73 to 99). Results of combined vaccine effect for prevention of COVID-19 related hospitalisation were comparable when restricting the analysis to those aged ≥80 years (81%; 95% CI 65 to 90 at 28-34 days post-vaccination).

Interpretation
A single dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccines resulted in substantial reductions in the risk of COVID-19 related hospitalisation in Scotland.

Funding
UK Research and Innovation (Medical Research Council); Research and Innovation Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund; Health Data Research UK.

Research in context
-------------------
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and medRxiv for observational studies using the terms "COVID-19 vaccine effect." We found one preprint that reported a 51% relative risk reduction against SARS-CoV-2 infection 13-24 days after the 1st dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech) vaccine. This study used data from a state-mandated health provider in Israel covering 503 875 individuals. We also found a correspondence article that reported adjusted rate reductions for SARS-CoV-2 infections of 30% and 75%, respectively for the periods 1-14 and 15-28 days after the 1st dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine in a cohort of 9109 healthcare workers in Israel's largest hospital.

Added value of this study
UK policy for use of vaccines against COVID-19 involves an offer of a 1st dose followed by a 2nd dose 12 weeks later. To our knowledge, this is the 1st study of COVID-19 vaccine effect against hospitalisation for an entire nation after a single dose of vaccine. We found that a single dose of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect (VE) of 85% (95% CI 76 to 91) for COVID-19 hospitalisation 28-34 days post-vaccination. A single dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect 94% (95% CI 73 to 99) at 28- 34 days post-vaccination. VEs increased over time with a peak at 28-34 days post-vaccination for both vaccines. Comparable VEs were seen in those aged [greater than or equal to] 80 years for prevention of COVID-19 hospitalisation with a high combined VE of 81% (95% CI 65 to 90) at 28-34 days post-vaccination.

Implications of all the available evidence
We provide compelling evidence that the 2 COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the UK vaccination programme substantially reduce the risk of COVID-19 related hospital admissions in the population who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.

Introduction
As of [18 Feb 2021], 1st dose vaccine coverage of over 22% has been reported in Scotland with over 1.3 million vaccines administered across the Scottish population, and delivery targeting specified priority groups of those most at risk of harm (including the elderly and healthcare workers).[2,4]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 adenoviral vector vaccines have been rapidly rolled out in the UK. We determined the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in our healthcare worker (HCW) cohort study of staff undergoing regular asymptomatic testing.

Methods
The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff working in publicly funded hospitals. Baseline risk factors, vaccination status (from [8 Dec 2020-5 Feb 2021]), and symptoms are recorded at 2 weekly intervals and all SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody test results documented. A mixed effect proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution was used to calculate hazard ratios to compare time to infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants to estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all (asymptomatic and symptomatic) infection.

Findings
Vaccine coverage was 89% on [5 Feb 2021]. Significantly lower coverage was associated with prior infection (aOR [adjusted odds ratio] 0.59 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.64), female (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.82), aged under 35 years, being from minority ethnic groups (especially Black, aOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.21-0.32), porters/security guards (aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.90),or midwife (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.97), and living in more deprived neighbourhoods (IMD 1 (most) vs 5 (least) (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.87). A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine demonstrated vaccine effectiveness of 72% (95% CI 58-86) 21 days after 1st dose and 86% (95% CI 76-97) 7 days after 2 doses in the antibody negative cohort.

Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that the BNT162b2 vaccine effectively prevents both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working age adults; this cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7 and demonstrates effectiveness against this variant.

Research in context
-------------------
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and medRxiv for studies including "asymptomatic" and "symptomatic" SARS-CoV-2 results after vaccination. Only a single paper existed for ChAdOx1 which stated that it reduced all (symptomatic or asymptomatic) infection by 51.9% (95% CI 42.0-60.1%). 3 studies from Israel demonstrated that those who attended symptomatic testing had reduced infections 2 weeks post vaccination; a single healthcare worker cohort study in Israel demonstrated vaccine effectiveness of 75% (95% CI 72-84%) from 15 to 28 days following the 1st dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine to reduce symptomatic infection. No data on asymptomatic infection through routinely collected swabs asymptomatic testing was available for the BNT162b2 vaccine.

Added value of this study
This is a large established cohort study in HCWs that enables accurate measurement of asymptomatic and symptomatic infection rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated population.

It measures the impact of a single dose of vaccine over the 1st 8-week period. We have estimated the vaccine effectiveness against all (symptomatic and asymptomatic) infection for the BNT162b2 vaccine to be at least 70% 21 days after the 1st dose, which increased to at least 85% 7 days after the 2nd dose.

It also highlights the vaccine coverage and uptake among hospital staff. Further engagement is required in groups that have not yet accepted the vaccine offer.

Implications of all the available evidence
We provide strong evidence that vaccinating working age adults will substantially reduce asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore reduce transmission of infection in the population. However, it does not eliminate infection risk completely and therefore personal protective equipment, non-pharmaceutical interventions and regular asymptomatic testing will need to be continued until prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is extremely low to reduce the risk of transmission in healthcare settings.

Introduction
Following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the UK Government selected a vaccination strategy with the aim of rapidly reducing hospitalisations, severe outcomes, and preventable deaths from COVID-19. The initial phase targeted individuals at high-risk of severe COVID-19, such as care home residents and their carers, people aged 80 years and older, and frontline HCWs, recognising this group's particular high exposure and potential role in transmission. On [30 Dec 2020], the JCVI published their recommendation to delay the 2nd dose of the deployed coronavirus vaccines by up to 12 weeks with the aim of optimising the public health impact of the vaccination campaign in the population by doubling the number of people who would receive the 1st dose. By [19 Feb 2021], the UK had vaccinated more than 17.2 million people (25% of the population).

Vaccine effectiveness against infection
There were 977 new infections during 710 587 person days of follow-up in the unvaccinated group, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000 person days of follow-up (table 2). In the vaccinated group, 21 days after the 1st dose, there were 71 new infections (incidence density 8 per 10 000 person-days of follow-up) and 9 new infections7 days after the 2nd dose (incidence density of 4 per 10 000 person days of follow-up).

Discussion
Our follow-up of this large cohort of over 23 000 HCWs, whose prior SARS-CoV-2 infection history is known for 2 months after vaccine roll-out provides unique real-world data on the short-term vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine against both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. The regular PCR-testing of participants, regardless of symptom status, allowed for the detection of asymptomatic infection, an important proxy for reduction in transmission. 2 months after roll-out commenced, 89% of our cohort had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine; 8% had received 2 doses. We detected modest variability in coverage, with lower coverage observed in participants with prior infection, from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic backgrounds, and living in areas of higher deprivation. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness against infection for the BNT162b2 vaccine to be at least 70% 21 days after the st dose, increasing to at least 85% 7 days after the 2nd dose in our study population. This demonstrates that the BNT162b2 is effective against the B1.1.7 variant given its predominance throughout the study period.

This is the 1st study that describes the reduction in all cases of infection with BNT162b2.

Most data on vaccinated UK individuals are from people older than 75 years, where vaccine effectiveness may be lower due to immunosenescence. The SIREN cohort is taken from working age people, making the conclusions more relevant for the overall adult population. However, the healthy worker effect bias may underestimate the disease impact compared to the general population.

[Impression: things are looking very promising for vaccine effect in terms of illness prevention and more serious illness prevention. The Scottish study reflected the vaccine effect with a bias to the older population whereas the English study reflected more rigorous testing but in a younger age group (they call it "the working age" population, which probably does include the older age group, so I have taken exception to their terminology here). As seen in the Washington Post report, there is a plan to slowly lift restrictions, allowing for adequate time to evaluate the impact of doing so.

May we reach the luxury of interruption of transmission of this less than friendly virus? The appearance of multiple variations may prevent that, but if vaccine can prevent too serious illness, that would definitely be a game changer. The world will be watching Israel and the UK. - Mod.MPP]

The number of new deaths also continued to fall for the past 3 weeks, with nearly 66 000 new deaths reported last week, a 20% decline as compared to the previous week. A total of 4 out of 6 WHO regions reported declines in new cases (Table 1), with only South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean regions showing a small 2% and 7% increase, respectively. The Americas continue to see the greatest drops in absolute numbers of cases. Meanwhile, the number of new deaths declined in all regions apart from the Western Pacific (6% increase).

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of new cases continue to be the United States of America (480 467 new cases, a 29% decrease), Brazil (316 221 new cases, a 1% decrease), France (131 179 new cases, a 3% increase), the Russian Federation (92 843 new cases, an 11% decrease), and India (86 711 new cases, a 10% increase).

Special focus: WHO COVID-19 vaccine policy recommendations
----------------------------------------------------------
WHO relies on the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) to issue policy recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination to Members States. SAGE has issued 3 sets of interim recommendations to date, covering: the Pfizer- BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine, the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, and the AstraZeneca-Oxford University AZD1222 vaccine.

The last of these reviews examined AstraZeneca core clinical data from the Phase 1-3 clinical trials. The WHO interim recommendations that ensued apply to AZD1222 (named generically as ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) vaccine against COVID-19, developed by Oxford University (United Kingdom) and AstraZeneca, as well as to ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) vaccines against COVID-19 produced by other manufacturers. These include the Serum Institute of India and SK Bioscience (South Korea), both of which rely on the AstraZeneca core clinical data and have demonstrated equivalence in their regulatory review. It will be the responsibility of regulatory bodies and WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) process to ensure that products emerging from different manufacturing facilities are equivalent.

For each of these 3 vaccines, SAGE was able to issue policy recommendations because of the publication of appropriate data by the vaccine developers and on the basis that the vaccine was in the process of acquiring EUL from WHO or a marketing authorization from a stringent regulatory authority, such as the European Medicines Agency. It should further be noted that EUL is a WHO time-limited regulatory recommendation based on a risk-benefit assessment of limited amount of quality, safety, and efficacy data for use during a public health emergency. SAGE recommendations, on the other hand, are policy recommendations to guide ministries of health and their recommending bodies and disease programmes on the use of regulated products to optimize the individual and public health benefit of vaccines. The 2 sets of recommendations are complementary.

SAGE is issuing product-specific recommendations for COVID-19 and will likely continue doing so for additional candidate vaccines. In the longer run, these recommendations may be regrouped into overall recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination.

An essential starting point to this process was the preparation and release of 2 critical documents forming the foundation for future vaccine-specific interim recommendations. These consist of the WHO SAGE values framework for the allocation and prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination and the WHO SAGE Roadmap for Prioritizing Uses of COVID-19 Vaccines in the Context of Limited Supply, which jointly guide countries in their prioritization of target groups. The Roadmap highlights the importance of vaccinating frontline health workers and older people with and without comorbidities first, and outlines how additional groups can then be vaccinated as more vaccine becomes available, in keeping with the local epidemiological context.

For all 3 vaccines reviewed to date, SAGE concluded that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks. The high efficacy of each of the products was acknowledged, despite insufficient data on if and how these vaccines impact virus transmission, although it is likely there will be some level of protection against transmission.

Based on current data for each of these 3 vaccines, a regimen of 2 full doses of the same vaccine is recommended, injected intramuscularly in the upper arm. This means the dosage cannot be reduced, or interchanged (that is, if the 1st dose is Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the 2nd should not be Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines). There are multiple reasons for this, including a lack of research so far on interchangeability. Furthermore, each vaccine has a different minimum interval time between doses: a 2nd dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be administered after 3 weeks; the Moderna vaccine requires a minimum interval of 4 weeks, which can be extended to 6 weeks; and the AstraZeneca vaccine requires an interval of no less than 8 weeks which can be extended to 12. This latter WHO recommendation deviates slightly from the vaccine developers, who have determined the product is sufficiently efficacious when a 2nd dose is administered after 4 weeks. SAGE preferred to recommend a longer interval for the AstraZeneca vaccines based on the evidence that supported an improved vaccine performance (for efficacy and immunogenicity) when delaying the 2nd dose by a few weeks.

WHO recommendations on who may be vaccinated with each of the 3 vaccines are summarized in Table 2, with the assumption that people falling into high-risk groups (such as health workers or people with comorbidities) are being prioritized as per the WHO SAGE Roadmap on COVID-19 vaccines.

While these vaccines, and others coming through the pipeline, offer us reason to be optimistic, the current lack of evidence of their effect on transmission, circulating variants of concern, coupled with a continuing limited supply of the vaccines, mean that more data collection is required, and public health and social measures (PHSM) must continue, and should be practised by all individuals regardless of vaccination status, including use of face masks, physical distancing, hand-washing, and other measures.

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
-------------------------------------------------------
Further information on the background of the variants of concern (VOCs) is available from previously published Disease Outbreak News and recent publications of the Weekly Epidemiological Update [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports]. Here we provide an update on ongoing studies and the geographical distribution of select VOCs as reported by countries, territories, and areas (hereafter countries) as of [23 Feb 2021]. New variants of potential interest or concern are continuously emerging; we provide here an update on 2 such variants currently under review.

Results of ongoing studies of VOCs are summarized in Table 3 below. While many countries worldwide are currently experiencing a decline in overall SARS-CoV-2 infections likely as a result of the public health and social measures (PHSM) implemented, there has been an increased number of reports of variants which are of concern. As surveillance activities at local and national levels are strengthened, including strategic genomic sequencing to detect cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants, the number of countries reporting VOCs has continued to increase in the past 2 weeks (Table 3, Figures 3, 4, and 5, Annex 2). In addition, the number of countries reporting local transmission of VOCs has increased in the same period.

Increased transmissibility has been reported for some VOCs resulting in increased incidence in settings experiencing community transmission.

Table 3: Overview of emerging information on key variants of concern, as of [23 Feb 202].
Annex 2: List of countries, territories, and areas reporting variants of concern as of [23 Feb 2021]

1. Variant VOC 202012/01
Since our last update on [16 Feb 2021], VOC 202012/01 has been detected in 7 additional countries. As of [23 Feb 2021], a total of 101 countries across all 6 WHO regions have reported cases of this variant (Figure 3). Community transmission has been reported in at least 45 countries across 5 WHO regions, noting that transmission classification is currently incomplete for 23 (23%) countries reporting this variant.

Since January 2021, several countries and in the European Region in particular, have observed a marked increase in the number and proportion of cases infected with VOC 202012/01 among samples tested by PCR-based screening and whole genome sequencing. [22] As of [8 Feb 2021], the proportion of sequenced samples in which VOC 202012/01 was detected in Spain varied across the different regions from 0.4% to 53.3%. [23] During epidemiological week 6 (from [7 to 14 Feb 2021]), Germany detected VOC 202012/01 in 22% of the specimens analysed (23 000 samples tested), [24] 36% in France, [25] and 47% in Denmark. [26],[27] In the United States of America (USA), genomic sequencing by one commercial laboratory suggested prevalence of VOC 202012/01 to be approximately 1% nationwide, and over 2% in some States as of [3 Feb 2021]. [28] Another study estimated a 3.6% prevalence of VOC 202012/01 by the end of January 2021 using the S-gene target failure (SGTF; a proxy used to identify cases infected with VOC 202012/01). [29] As of [21 Feb 2021], the USA has reported a total of 1661 cases from 44 States in the United States of America. [30] Additionally, the VOC 202012/01 has increasingly been associated with outbreaks in several different settings. [31],[32]

On [21 Jan 2021], the United Kingdom's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) released analyses suggesting increased disease severity and risk of death in cases with SGTF compared to cases without SGTF. [3] When comparing cases with SGTF to cases without SGTF: (i) one study reported the relative hazard of death within 28 days of testing to be 1.35 (95% CI: 1.08-1.68); (ii) one study reported the mean case fatality ratio to be 1.36 (95% CI 1.18-1.56) by a case-control weighing method; (iii) one study reported a mortality hazard ratio of 1.91 (95% CI 1.35-2.71) (studies unpublished to date). In addition, a matched cohort analysis reported a death risk ratio of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.21-2.25) for cases infected with VOC 202012/01 compared with non-VOC 202012/01 cases. Although there are limitations to these studies including representativeness of the dataset used, these findings follow an initial assessment that there was no significant difference in the risk of hospitalization or death as compared to other variants, conducted in December 2020. The absolute risk of death of SARS-CoV-2 remains low, and additional studies are required to investigate these findings. Based on available information, VOC 202012/01 has not been associated with decreased neutralization activity of polyclonal antibodies such as vaccine-derived or convalescent sera. However, the genomic changes of the epitope which binds to the host cell receptor, such as deletions in the N terminal domain, may affect binding of this variant to monoclonal antibodies, indicating possible effects on the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies used as therapeutics.[33]

A pre-print study with a small sample size (n=65, including 7 infected individuals with VOC 202012/01), suggested that individuals infected with VOC 202012/01 had longer duration of acute infection and similar peak viral load when compared to non-VOC 202012/01 variants. [34] However, these are preliminary findings and require further investigations with larger cohorts.

Figure 3: Countries, territories, and areas reporting SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 as of [23 Feb 2021]

2. Variant 501Y.V2
Since the last update on [16 Feb 2021], 501Y.V2 has been reported from 5 additional countries -- now totalling 51 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 4). Community transmission of 501Y.V2 has been reported in 13 countries across 4 WHO regions, noting the transmission classification is currently incomplete for 21 (41%) countries reporting this variant. In several areas within the African Region, variant 501Y.V2 has been reported to comprise a high proportion of sequenced samples. [35]

Studies highlighting reductions in neutralizing antibody activity against 501Y.V2 following either natural infection or vaccination, with potential to impact re-infection risk or vaccine effectiveness have been discussed previously (see Table 3, and past editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update). A preliminary report with a small sample size (n=20) indicated that the serum neutralization capacity of serum elicited by BNT162b2 vaccine, produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, was weaker against variant 501Y.V2 by approximately two thirds as compared to that of another variant. [36] Further studies are needed to fully understand efficacy of existing vaccines.

Recent preliminary evidence suggests that variant 501Y.V2 may compromise immunity indicating potential increased risk of reinfection. There is now growing evidence that the mutations present in this variant may help the virus evade immune system responses triggered by previous infections of SARS-CoV-2 or by vaccines. There has been a report of a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection with the 501Y.V2 variant months after recovering from a 1st episode of COVID-19 with a more severe clinical presentation. [37]

Figure 4: Countries, territories, and areas reporting SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 as of [23 Feb 2021]

3. Variant P.1
Since our last update, variant P.1 has been reported in 8 additional countries. To date, this variant is reported in 28 countries across all 6 WHO regions (Figure 5). Community transmission of P.1 has been reported in at least 3 countries in one WHO region, noting the transmission classification is currently incomplete for 8 (28%) countries reporting this variant.

In a genomic survey conducted from April to November 2020 in Amazonas State, Brazil, variant P.1 was found to be the most prevalent variant among 148 whole-genomes sequenced, comprising 47% (69/148) of specimens collected from 12 municipalities. [38] During the period of [1 Nov 2020] to [13 Jan 2021], sequencing of samples from different municipalities in Amazonas found rapid increase in the proportion of variant P.1 in the state. In the state capital Manaus, cases associated to the P.1 variant were initially detected on the [4 Dec 2020] and as of January 2021, 91% of cases were infected with the P1 variant. Furthermore, the variant was found in a widespread geographic distribution in the state.[39]

4. Emerging variants of interest or concern
To inform local, national, and regional risk assessments, surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants continues globally with timely sharing of sequence data. As of [23 Feb 2021], over 590 000 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 globally have been uploaded into publicly available databases. New variants of potential interest or concern are continuously emerging and undergo assessment. We provide here an update on 2 such variants currently under review.

Variant B.1.525 (also referred to as VUI-202102/03, and previously UK1188), was first detected in the United Kingdom and Nigeria in December 2020. [40] Since then, it has been detected in at least another 13 countries. [41] This variant is partially similar to the 501Y.V2 variant and contains mutations which may be associated with some degree of biological significance, including the E484K, Q677H and F888L mutations, as well as a similar number of deletions that are contained in B.1.1.7.

A variant of B.1.1.7 with an E484K mutation (labelled VOC 202102/02 by the United Kingdom health authorities) has been detected in South West England. As of [17 Feb 2021], 26 cases of this variant have been detected in the United Kingdom. [33] Local authorities are responding with enhanced PHSM with the aim to prevent further spread. The E484K mutation is a mutation in the spike protein and has been associated with antigenic change, as well as increased binding affinity to the human host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in conjunction with the N501Y mutation. [42] E484K has been labelled as an escape mutation, so called because it may help the SARS-CoV-2 virus to evade host immune defences. It has been identified as an adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in at least one immunocompromised patient with long lasting infection. [43] The E484K mutation has been identified independently in several variants (including 501Y.V2 and P.1.), indicating convergent mutations, where distinct lineages independently acquire similar genetic mutations. [42],[44] Although there is no evidence that this mutation alone is associated with increased disease severity or higher transmissibility, E484K is of significance due to its possible impact on immune response, vaccine efficacy, and transmissibility. [40]

WHO is working to increase sequencing capacities globally and has published a comprehensive implementation guide and risk-monitoring framework to support countries set up high-impact sequencing programmes for SARS-CoV-2 variants and maximize public health impact.

PHSM have proven to remain effective against VOCs to date. WHO continues to advise that the application and adjustment of PHSM should be driven by detailed data analyses of epidemiology at the most local level possible (for more information, please see our technical guidance).

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (71 411), Brazil (63 090), and France (20 064) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 477 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 22 Feb 2021 to late 23 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, India (13 463), Italy (13 299), Russia (11 823), Czech Republic (11 311), and Sweden (10 933). A total of 46 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 46 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and none are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 0.60%%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 15.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 11.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 25.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Similar to previous assessments, the global daily reported cases totaled over 350 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 112.64 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.47 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. And 7 day average daily newly confirmed cases and deaths are dropping from previous days calculations suggesting there may be a leveling off in improvements seen. - Mod.MPP]
