[1] Impact of prior infection
[1a] Date: Fri 30 April 2021

A single dose of vaccine boosts protection against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus variants, but only in those with previous COVID-19, a study has found. In those who have not previously been infected and have so far only received one dose of vaccine, the immune response to variants of concern may be insufficient.

The findings, published today [Fri 30 Apr 2021] in the journal Science and led by researchers at Imperial College London, Queen Mary University of London, and University College London, looked at immune responses in UK healthcare workers at Barts and Royal Free hospitals following their 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.*

They found that people who had previously had mild or asymptomatic infection had significantly enhanced protection against the [variants that were first detected in] Kent and South Africa after a single dose of the mRNA vaccine. In those without prior COVID-19, the immune response was less strong after a 1st dose, potentially leaving them at risk from variants.

Professor Rosemary Boyton, Professor of Immunology and Respiratory Medicine at Imperial College London, who led the research, said: "Our findings show that people who have had their 1st dose of vaccine, and who have not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2, are not fully protected against the circulating variants of concern. This study highlights the importance of getting 2nd doses of the vaccine rolled out to protect the population."

Blood samples were analysed for the presence and levels of immunity against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the variants of concern [that were first detected in] Kent (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351). Along with antibodies -- the Y-shaped proteins that stick to the virus and help block or neutralize the threat -- the researchers also focused on 2 types of white blood cell: B-cells, which "remember" the virus, and T cells, which help B cell memory and recognise and destroy cells infected with coronavirus.

They found that after a 1st dose of vaccine, prior infection was associated with a boosted T cell, B cell, and neutralizing antibody response, which could provide effective protection against SARS-CoV-2, as well as the Kent and South Africa variants.

However, in people without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, a single vaccine dose resulted in lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the variants, potentially leaving them vulnerable to infection and highlighting the importance of the 2nd vaccine dose.

The team looked at 2 variants of concern, however, they think it possible that the findings will apply to other variants in circulation, such as the [variants first detected in] Brazil (P.1) and India (B.1.617 and B.1.618).

It remains unclear precisely how much protection is offered by T cells. Interestingly, the mutations in variants [B.1.1.7 and B.1.351] here resulted in T cell immunity, which could be reduced, enhanced, or unchanged compared to the original strain, depending on genetic differences between people.

Professor Boyton commented: "Our data show that natural infection alone may not provide sufficient immunity against the variants. Boosting with a single vaccine dose in people with prior infection probably does. As new variants continue to emerge, it is important to fast track global rollout of vaccines to reduce transmission of the virus and remove the opportunities for new variants to arise."

Professor Danny Altmann, Professor of Immunology at Imperial, commented: "At a time of generally improving outlook in those countries with substantial vaccine rollout programmes, this study reminds us of the need to be vigilant about the threat of the variants. Most vaccinated people in the UK have received just one dose. While we know this offers remarkable protection against the original virus, our data suggest this leaves people susceptible to variants of concern."

Professor Aine McKnight, of Queen Mary University of London, said: "Our study offers reassurance and a warning. We show that current vaccines offer some protection against variants of concern. However, people who have received only the 1st course of a double-dose vaccine show a more muted immune response. We must ensure that the global vaccination programme is fully implemented. Current events in India make painfully clear the cost of complacency."

A single dose of Pfizer's (PFE.N) coronavirus vaccine may not generate a sufficient immune response to protect against dominant new variants, except in people who have already been infected with COVID-19, according to a UK study published on Friday [30 Apr 2021].

The Imperial College-led study, which looked at immune responses among healthcare workers in Britain after their 1st dose of the Pfizer shot, found that those who had previously had mild or asymptomatic infection had enhanced protection against more infectious mutated variants that emerged in Britain and South Africa.

But the immune response after a 1st dose of the shot was weaker in people who had not previously been infected, potentially leaving them at risk from such variants, researchers leading the work said.

"This study highlights the importance of getting 2nd doses of the vaccine rolled out to protect the population," said Rosemary Boyton, a professor of immunology and respiratory medicine at Imperial who co-led the study. "People who have had their 1st dose of vaccine and who have not previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are not fully protected against the circulating 'variants of concern'."

The research, published in the journal Science, analysed blood samples for the presence and levels of immunity against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the so-called UK variant, known as B.1.1.7, and another known as B.1.351, which emerged in South Africa.

It found that, after a 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine, a boosted immune response in the shape of T cells, B cells, and neutralising antibodies was associated with prior infection. In people who had not had COVID-19, however, a single vaccine dose produced lower levels of neutralising antibodies against the original virus and its mutant variants.

Danny Altmann, an Imperial professor of immunology who co-led the study, said this meant there would be a "window of vulnerability" for people between their 1st and 2nd doses.

The work builds on previous findings published earlier this year [2021] in The Lancet.

Also see:
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/29/science.abh1282 and https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/04/29/science.abh1282/tab-pdf.

Abstract. "SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollout has coincided with the spread of variants of concern. We investigated if single-dose vaccination, with or without prior infection, confers cross protective immunity to variants.

We analyzed T and B cell responses after 1st dose vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in healthcare workers (HCW) followed longitudinally, with or without prior Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 infection.

After one dose, individuals with prior infection showed enhanced T cell immunity, antibody secreting memory B cell response to spike and neutralizing antibodies effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351.

By comparison, HCW receiving one vaccine dose without prior infection showed reduced immunity against variants.

B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike mutations resulted in increased, abrogated or unchanged T cell responses depending on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms.

Single-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 in the context of prior infection with a heterologous variant substantially enhances neutralizing antibody responses against variants."

"It is striking that the high IC50 titers in those vaccinated after infection provide such a large protective margin that responses to authentic B.1.1.7 and B.1.351variants are also high. In contrast, nAb responses in individuals several months on from mild infection show much lower IC50s against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, often less than 100. Similarly, the majority of responses in naive individuals after one dose show weak recognition of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. This finding indicates potentially poor protection against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 in individuals who have experienced natural infection or who have only had one vaccine dose.

It is important to map the effect of VOC mutations on any evasion of T cell immunity. The case has been made that reductions in antibody neutralization of mutant spike may be mitigated by protective T cells. A case has been made for the role of T cells as correlates of protection. Our evidence from this analysis 22d (+/- 2) after one dose is that T cell immunity is mostly variably low but also relatively unperturbed by the N501Y mutation. The other mutations we considered that overlay CD4 epitopes were, as might be predicted, distributed across the range of HLAII polymorphisms. Those alleles associated with loss of CD4 response to the variant pool tended to be those with a lysine in pocket 4 of the groove (HLA-DR residue 71[beta]), while those with an increased response to the variant pool tend to be those with a smaller, alanine. In HLA-DRB1*0401 transgenics we confirmed that in the context of a given HLAII heterodimer, the N501Y mutation can result in ablation of this part of the T cell response, demonstrating that HLA polymorphisms are likely to be significant determinants of responder/non-responder status with respect to vaccine escape.

SARS-CoV-2 immunity now encompasses post infection plus either zero, one, or 2 vaccine doses and 1st and 2nd dose naive vaccinated. Single-dose vaccination post infection achieves similar levels of S1 RBD binding antibodies to 2 doses in naive vaccinated individuals, and 2nd dose vaccination in one-dose vaccinated post-infection individuals offers no additional enhancement. Moving forward, it will be important to resolve the quantitative and qualitative differences between these groups in terms of neutralizing antibody repertoire as well as phenotype and durability of memory B and T cell responses. Durability of immunity to natural infection and following vaccination, as well as sustained vaccine efficacy and vaccine escape, need to be monitored over time."

[2] B1.617 variants
Date: Fri 30 Apr 2021 15:53 EDT

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9526599/Coronavirus-Indian-variant-cases-UK-rise-400-three-types.html


- UK rate of the variant [first detected in India] spikes 8-fold in a fortnight as cases surge to 400, and [PHE] Public Health England confirms there are 3 types of the strain.
- The variant accounted for 1.7% of positive cases in Britain by 10 Apr [2021], up from 0.2% at the end of March [2021].
- Majority of the infections with the B.1.617 variant are understood to have been in returning travellers.
- It is not clear to what extent the mutant strain is spreading inside the UK, but cases have risen sharply.
- Public Health England defines it as 3 variants, because each type has a slightly different set of mutations.

Public Health England said that "case numbers remain low and geographically dispersed in England." It said extra contact tracing and testing is being done.

Cases have been found scattered across the country, leading officials to believe that they are mostly coming from travellers and not spreading around England. The Wellcome Institute data shows where the most cases have been found, picking out Leicester, Harrow, and Hounslow as the hotspots, with 11, 6, and 5.5 samples testing positive per week since the variant was found.

PHE has divided the variant into 3 separate strains, simply named B.1.617.1, .2 and .3.

The variant [first detected in South Africa] is thought to make vaccines about 30% less effective at stopping infections, but it's not clear what effect it has on severe illness.

Professor Sharon Peacock, of PHE, claimed there was "limited" evidence of E484Q's effect on immunity and vaccines. Lab studies have suggested it may be able to escape some antibodies, but to what degree remains uncertain.

[3] Transmission on flight
Date: Mon 26 Apr 2021
Source: Fox News [abridged, edited]
https://www.foxnews.com/health/52-coronavirus-cases-flight-india-hong-kong-despite-negative-tests


[RF's] anxiety levels spiked as she boarded the red-eye flight from New Delhi to Hong Kong with her family. COVID-19 cases were surging in India, and the plane was packed almost to capacity.

Within 2 weeks of landing, [RF], her husband, and 2 children tested positive for the coronavirus at their quarantine hotel. More than 1/3 of the passengers on flight UK6395 -- 52 so far -- have tested positive, the most from any plane arriving in the city. The cluster is stirring debate among health experts in Hong Kong over how they got infected, and highlights the struggle facing the aviation industry as it seeks to get people traveling again.

Speaking from the hospital, [RF] said she feared her family picked up the infections on the 3 Apr [2021] journey, despite wearing masks almost the entire time and avoiding using the restrooms on board.

Some passengers -- including one in the same row -- coughed repeatedly during the 6-hour flight, people took masks off to eat, and some parents walked their crying children up and down the aisle, she said.

The airline and the organizers of the chartered flight told The Wall Street Journal that they did everything possible to minimize potential transmission.

Vistara airline, run by Tata SIA Airlines Ltd., said it ensures "strict compliance with all guidelines issued by the Indian as well as the destination countries' authorities for all flights."

Experts say that plane travel is generally safe. But even with the best precautions there are risks associated, as coronavirus cases continue to soar in some parts of the world and with young children not yet eligible for vaccination.

There could, for example, have been passengers with particularly virulent strains of the virus. Being packed in tightly, no matter how good the ventilation, puts certain passengers in the way of potential infection through respiratory particles from people sitting nearby or on surfaces in restrooms. And there is the risk of the virus spreading at airports before and after flying.

Other possibilities being discussed by health experts include whether travelers became infected at quarantine hotels in Hong Kong after arrival, or a failure by India's overloaded health system to accurately detect cases before the passengers left, though only 4 tested positive on arrival.

India is in the grips of a startling 2nd wave of coronavirus infections. On Friday [23 Apr 2021], the country reported more than 332 000 new infections, the highest one-day tally recorded in any country since the pandemic began. It would also be possible, epidemiologists say, that some passengers on the plane got infected in the country after their preflight virus test.

It is unclear how many passengers on the flight had received any COVID vaccinations. At the time of boarding, 4.76% of India's population had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according to Our World in Data, an Oxford University project tracking the global vaccine rollout. [RF] and her husband were not age-eligible for a vaccine at the time.

Hong Kong suspended flights from India for 2 weeks on Tuesday [20 Apr 2021] and upgraded India to the list of extremely high-risk countries for arrivals. The city has one of the most stringent testing, tracing, and quarantine systems in the world, mandating 21 days of hotel quarantine for almost all inbound international travelers and subjecting them to several rounds of COVID testing over the period. This offers a more detailed glimpse of travelers' infection status. Most of the cases on the flight from New Delhi weren't discovered until days after the group had landed in the city.

University of Hong Kong scientists who work with the city's health department are sequencing genomes from the passenger cluster and examining information to discern whether they were infected on board.

Hong Kong-based GC Nanda & Sons Ltd., known as Nanda Travel, which organized the charter flight, said the Airbus A321neo plane was at 85% capacity, with 146 passengers and 7 infants.

All passengers produced evidence of a negative COVID-19 test from reputable labs taken within the 72 hours before the plane took off, the company said. Six passengers were denied boarding by the charter operator as their test-results certificates didn't meet the travel company's standards.

Passengers were required to wear masks except for when eating prepackaged meals. Alcohol wipes and hand sanitizer were provided.

"We're shocked by this," said Poonam Nanda, the director of Nanda Travel. "This one flight appears to be an astonishing outlier, and we are all confounded by these numbers."

Of 29 charter flights the company has operated to bring stranded travelers back to Hong Kong in the past few months, less than 1% of passengers tested positive on arrival, and on many flights there have been zero subsequent cases, she said. The company will enhance its protocols, such as requiring negative COVID-19 test certificates from not more than 48 hours before departure on future flights, she said.

"The risks of air travel are generally quite manageable with staggered seating and consistent mask usage, especially when using toilet facilities," said Siddharth Sridhar, a clinical virologist at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Microbiology.

[When less than 5% of a population is immunized, as is the case in India, it becomes almost impossible to control spread of virus on an airplane and in a hotel to others who are also not vaccinated. All one can do on an airplane to protect oneself [other than vaccination] is wear a very efficient mask (N95) and not remove it during the flight, wash one's hands thoroughly and frequently, and don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. It will be important to analyze the sequencing results to determine whether transmission may also have occurred after the flight in the quarantine hotel. A seating map of the infected passengers indicates some clustering, but it is spread throughout the plane, mostly economy class with 2 exceptions (see map of seats with positive cases spotted at https://twitter.com/tripperhead/status/1383769373563752455/photo/1). - Mod.LK]

- "Cases have now increased for the 9th straight week," said the director-general of the WHO, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to intensify around the globe.

Doctors in Papua New Guinea say the coronavirus crisis is only getting worse as some hospitals shut their doors to patients and others struggle without supplies as basic as gloves.

Health officials and doctors interviewed by RNZ Pacific have described a health system teetering on the brink of collapse and a country that has no real grasp of just how widespread the virus really is.

Officially, the country has recorded 10 915 cases of COVID-19 and 107 deaths, according to government figures released on Wednesday [28 Apr 2021] night.

David Mills, a doctor at a hospital in Enga province, which covers a remote chunk of the country's rugged Highland interior, said, "Those numbers just need to be ignored."

"They're not even a remote figure of what's going on ... It's really moving about as fast as it could possibly move.

"It's very hard for us to just guess the number of actual cases that are out there, because the more mildly ill, they're not even coming within cooee [i.e., a shout that originated in Australia] of us."

Fewer than 90 000 tests have been carried out in a country of 9 million people since the start of the pandemic, according to government figures, and in many remote parts, testing capacity just isn't there.

[Papua New Guinea had COVID under control until February [2021], when their founding father, the 1st prime minister of the country, died. There was a funeral and mass gatherings for mourning; more people gathered at the burial. Thus, people were in close contact. This is how the virus spreads most rapidly. The country is short of medical workers and supplies (see https://www.npr.org/2021/04/14/987372086/behind-the-covid-19-surge-in-papua-new-guinea). - Mod.LK]

The positivity rate of COVID-19 tests in the country has come down below 10% after 40 days. Experts see it as a result of the ongoing restrictions on movement. They said maintaining physical distancing is a proven method to reduce virus transmission, and it is more important now [with] the context of the grim pandemic situation in neighbouring India.

"It is obvious that this a result of the ongoing restrictions on movement. But we cannot say the transmission is under control. The downward trend must continue for at least 2 weeks," Dr Mushtuq Hussain, consultant at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told The Daily Star yesterday [29 Apr 2021].

He said if people maintain health safety guidelines, the transmission rate will go down no matter how dangerous the COVID variants are.

Against a total of 24 928 tests conducted in 24 hours till 8:00 a.m. yesterday [29 Apr 2021], the positivity rate was 9.39%.

The rate was 9.39% on [20 Mar 2021], and it crossed the 23% mark on [2 Apr 2021]. It started going down from [17 Apr 2021].

The highest positivity rate of 23.57% in the 2nd wave of COVID-19 in the country was recorded on [9 Apr 2021].

Meanwhile, a total of 88 people died of the virus in the same 24-hour period, raising the tally to 11 393.

In this period, 2341 people tested positive for the virus. With this, the total number of novel coronavirus cases rose to 756 955 in the country.

Of the 88 deceased, 52 were men and 36 women; 3 of them died at homes and the rest at hospitals.

As usual, Dhaka division saw the highest deaths yesterday [29 Apr 2021] with 48 deaths, followed by Chattogram with 22, according to a handout of the Directorate General of Health Services.

The rush of COVID-19 patients at hospitals has also continued easing. As of yesterday noon [29 Apr 2021], 58 ICU beds out of 257 were vacant, while 2028 general beds out of 3481 were unoccupied in public hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 patients in Dhaka city.

Countrywide, 685 novel coronavirus patients were undergoing treatment in the COVID-19-dedicated hospitals.

As the data showed the transmission rate is declining, the government has extended the ongoing movement restrictions until [5 May 2021], which, according to experts, should be maintained until before and after the Eid-ul-Fitr festival, scheduled to be held next month [May 2021].

"Continuing the movement restrictions fully may not be possible, but the health safety guidelines must be maintained," Dr Mushtuq said.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-19-daily-case-count-inching-closer-to-the-4-lakh-mark/articleshow/82318359.cms


For the 9th day in a row, India recorded over 3 lakh [300 000] cases, inching closer to the 4 lakh [400 000] mark with 386 693 cases on [Thu 29 Apr 2021]. The country reported 3502 deaths, amid widespread reports of underreporting of fatalities with a gross mismatch of reported deaths and actual cremations across the country.

Cases have been higher than 3 lakh [300 000] for 9 days in a row now. The country's positivity rate is at 21.2% (based on smoothed 7-day rolling average of cases and tests). This means that 21 out of 100 people who are being tested are turning positive. Such a high positivity rate means many infections are going undetected. Several experts, including Dr Devi Shetty, feel that the actual level of infections could be at least 5 times more than the cases reported.

The daily case count breached the 1 lakh [100 000] mark on [6 Apr 2021] and since then it has inched closer to the 4 lakh [400 000] level. The impact of this level of cases was observed on deaths after a week, and on [13 Apr 2021] deaths also touched their previous peak level.

A bird's-eye view of past data shows a broad pattern, and there seems to be a week's lag in the reflection of the impact of increasing cases on daily deaths. Cases, for instance, touched 1.15 lakh [115 000] on [6 Apr 2021] and the death toll crossed the 1000 mark on [13 Apr 2021]. Similarly, the case count crossed the 2 lakh [200 000] mark on [15 Apr 2021] while deaths breached the 2000 level on [20 Apr 2021].

Since [21 Apr 2021] cases have crossed the 3 lakh [300 000] level while over 3000 deaths are being reported since [27 Apr 2021]. If this pattern is followed and cases continue to rise this steadily, then India should brace itself to see even a higher level of daily deaths in the coming days.

Among states, Maharashtra reported 66 159 cases, the country's highest, and was followed by Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka -- each reporting between 30 000 to 40 000 cases. The national capital reported 24 235 cases, which was the country's 5th-highest.

While saying that the spread of COVID-19 in companies in the country is on the rise, Chief Epidemiologist Dr Sudath Samaraweera said today [29 Apr 2021] the risk of infection was quite dramatic in closed and air-conditioned spaces.

He told the media that they had noticed a fair rise in the number of COVID cases within office premises.

"People would be vulnerable to the virus in a closed room, especially in air-conditioned spaces. Thus, it is recommended to stay in an environment with opened windows. We also urge people to strictly follow health guidelines when they stay in a closed room or an air-conditioned room," he said.

Meanwhile, Dr Samaraweera requested people to immediately report to the hospital when they suffer from COVID-19 symptoms or feel unwell.

"It has been reported that people tend to stay at home when they feel unfit and experiment with various medicines without seeking proper medical assistance. Thus, we urge people to report to hospital when they come up with COVID symptoms and even feel unfit," he stressed.

He also urged the general public to be cautious as the new variant detected in Sri Lanka had high transmissibility.

"Those infected with the new variant show complication, unlike the previous strain. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to strictly follow health guidelines and restrict unnecessary movement," he said.

Meanwhile health officials urged all private and state companies who have staff reporting to work to conduct temperature checks and maintain all health guidelines.

All companies have been urged to get minimum staff to report to work as a work-from-home policy was now in place.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 30 Apr 2021 at 03:27 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 18 754 984 / 208 313 / 150
Pakistan: 815 711 / 17 680 / 79
Bangladesh: 756 955 / 11 393 / 69
Nepal: 317 530 / 3246 / 110
Sri Lanka: 106 484 / 661 / 31
Afghanistan: 59 745 / 2625 / 66
Maldives: 29 370 /73 / 133
Bhutan: 1066 / 1 / 1

Over the last 7 days, 2 491 289, 20 881, 31 603, and 25 378 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal, respectively, compared with 1 971 778, 28 712, 38 926, and 10 098 cases in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the steep growth curve of new cases in India, a downward trend in Bangladesh and Pakistan, but an exponential growth in Nepal.

The daily number of deaths associated with COVID-19 in Bangladesh was below 100, and the daily case positivity dropped below 10% after 40 days, but the rate as such, which was 9.39% yesterday (29 Apr 2021), is still alarming. The county-wide lock-down imposed in the country since 14 Apr 2021 will continue until 5 May 2021, if not extended further, to curb the spread of the virus. Bangladesh started mass vaccination against COVID-19 on 7 Feb 2021 with Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) produced by the Serum Institute of India, and more than 5.818 million people were vaccinated by 25 Apr 2021. Administration of the 2nd dose of the vaccine started from 7 Apr 2021, and 2.326 million people received the 2nd dose since then and before 25 Apr 2021. The country decided to suspend administering the 1st shot of the vaccine from 26 Apr 2021 due to uncertainty of the next shipment of the vaccine.
(https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/bangladesh-suspend-1st-dose-covid-vaccination-237025)

The total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in India has already crossed a grim figure of 200 000. Over the last 9 days the daily total case count was more than 0.3 million in a row, and the daily fatality would probably touch the mark of 4000 soon. There is seemingly no indication of improvement of this dire situation prevailing in the country, although mass vaccination is ongoing across the country. By 29 Apr 2021, at least 152.24 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered across the county.
(https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coronabytes).

Over the last 7 days, a total of 7762 new cases were recorded in Sri Lanka compared with 2773 in the previous 7 days, indicating more than 2-fold increase in new cases in the country. Only time would say whether or not this is the beginning of a new wave of the disease in Sri Lanka, and whether or not the country would be able to revert the trend by imposing immediate preventive measures. Of note, the circulation of a highly transmissible variant virus has reportedly been detected in Sri Lanka, as indicated in item [5]; but the genetic character revealing the variant of concern cannot be known from the description in the article.
