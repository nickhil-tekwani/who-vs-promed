Ohio Department of Agriculture state veterinarian Tony Forshey recently confirmed one case of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in Ashtabula County and is urging horse owners to contact their veterinarian to ensure their animals' vaccine and boosters are up-to-date.

The virus responsible for the disease is transmitted to horses by mosquitoes and attacks the animal's central nervous system. In horses, onset is abrupt and usually fatal. Signs include unsteadiness, erratic behavior, a marked loss of coordination, and seizures. Horses are particularly susceptible, but the virus can also cause serious illness in people as well as other animals such as poultry and deer.

Because the disease can also be transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, animals sick from the disease are a sign that people should also take steps to guard themselves against mosquitoes by applying repellent and wearing protective clothing. The disease is very rare in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the U.S. each year. There are no confirmed human cases associated with this outbreak in Ohio.

The Ohio Department of Agriculture is working with the Ohio Department of Health and local health officials to monitor the outbreak. Suspect horse cases should be reported to a veterinarian as soon as possible. Citizens who are concerned about an illness should contact their physician.

Four more horses have tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), prompting the risk level for infection to rise to critical in 4 new Massachusetts towns, health officials said Thursday [29 Aug 2019].

Brookfield, Granby, Holliston, and Medfield are now at critical risk for the rare and potentially deadly virus that's transmitted via mosquitoes. Twenty-eight communities in Massachusetts are now at critical risk, 37 are at high risk, and 126 are at moderate risk, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

See this map for more information on risk levels across the state: https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/MAP-Massachusetts-Communities-at-Risk-EEE-558713581.html?7841fa).

"As we head into the Labor Day weekend and the month of September, people should not forget to bring and use an EPA-approved mosquito repellent for any outdoor activities," Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel said in a statement. [Use repellants safe for horses if you are applying to your horse. - Mod.TG]

"We got the bug spray, and we said we're going to come out now, before the mosquitoes come out," one mom at Lake Winthrop said Thursday [29 Aug 2019].

All nighttime outdoor school activities have been cancelled or rescheduled.

"We're just staying inside after dusk," said resident Alecia Thomas. "Normally, we would have had dinner at the pool, hang out for the evening. I just said, 'We've got to go home.'"

At the Out Post Farm, the outside tables weren't as busy as usual, with people opting to eat inside or get takeout.

The farm is taking extra steps to protect its workers.

"We have field crews who are out at night," said co-owner Kevin Drake. "We're actually making them come in at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, so we're trying to get all our work done beforehand because we know at dusk, mosquitoes are coming out." [This statement is a bit odd. They are out all night, but early dawn is when mosquitoes are active, as well as the dusk or late evening time. Hopefully, if workers are in the field harvesting all night, they are in before the early morning time of mosquitos, and the day workers are in before the dusk time of the mosquitoes. - Mod.TG]

Four people across Massachusetts have been diagnosed with EEE this summer, according to the Massachusetts Department of Health. The family of one woman said she died after being diagnosed, though health officials haven't confirmed that.

On Wednesday [28 Aug 2019], New Hampshire reported its 1st EEE diagnosis in a horse this year [2019].

Seven horses in Massachusetts have tested positive for EEE this year [2019], according to the state health department. A goat has also tested positive.

EEE is a mosquito-borne virus that can affect the nervous system and kills about one in 3 people who contract it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The state has been spraying from airplanes to help mitigate the mosquito population, and the town of Holliston said Thursday [29 Aug 2019] it will begin spraying from trucks over the weekend as well.

To protect against EEE, use bug spray, wear long sleeves and pants outdoors, and avoid activities in the evening and early morning, when mosquitoes are most active, health officials say.

[Vaccinations to prevent EEE are available for horses. These are very effective when administered correctly. Initially a horse needs a set of 2 vaccines about 3 weeks apart, and then annually thereafter. However, immunity to EEE in a horse wanes fast, and it is recommended, in areas where there is EEE, to revaccinate horses about every 4 months. The vaccine is considerably cheaper than losing an animal to death or paying for an extended animal hospital stay. Most horse owners have a substantial investment in their animals, so please take care of the investment and the animals and vaccinate them. There are also mosquito and fly sprays specifically for horses. Please use these too.

Also protect yourself with appropriate sprays and limit your time out of doors to when the mosquitoes are less active, which is the main part of the day. Mosquitoes are most active at dusk and dawn. Use appropriate mosquito repellent spray on yourselves. - Mod.TG
