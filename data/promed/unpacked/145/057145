Point Pleasant Beach plans cat roundup after rabies outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey, plans to round up feral cats after an
outbreak of rabies in a town which is home to an estimated 300 stray cats,
a report in the Asbury Park Press said.

Attacks by cats, including 2 children in separate incidents, alarmed
residents, who expressed concerns in a Wednesday [26 Aug 2009] town hall
meeting, according to the report. A cat that tested positive for rabies
attacked a 17 year old in his backyard, the report said.

Officials said they plan to capture stray cats and place them in cages in
rented, climate-controlled trailers for 60 days of observation, according
to the report. Authorities will kill infected cats, while healthy adult
cats will be vaccinated, neutered and returned to their colonies, the
report said. Kittens will be put up for adoption.

Council members said the stray cat problem stems from people abandoning
pets, and others providing food and water to colonies.

[The action plan regarding strays seems to be appropriate animal control.
Vasectomized males have proven useful in reducing colonies.

While 60 days may reveal those infected with rabies, it should be
remembered that kittens may also be susceptible to the virus and may need
to be held in quarantine a bit before releasing for adoption. Rabies can be
difficult to diagnose in cats. Some become unusually quiet and docile while
others, like the one mentioned in the article, become aggressive.

It would be an excellent time to have some rabies vaccination drives of
both dogs and cats. It is also a time to educate the public that adoption
of an animal is a commitment not a convenience, to be discarded when ever
the novelty has worn off.

Rabies is fatal in our companion animals and with rare exception is fatal
in humans and other animals as well.
