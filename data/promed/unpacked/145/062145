Military to get mandatory swine flu shots soon
----------------------------------------------
US military troops will begin getting required swine flu [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus] shots in the next week to 10 days, with active
duty forces deploying to war zones and other critical areas going to the
front of the vaccine line, a top military commander said on Tuesday [29 Sep
2009].

Air Force general Gene Renuart also told the Associated Press that as many
as 400 troops are ready to go to 5 regional headquarters around the country
to assist federal health and emergency management officials if needed as
the flu season heats up.

The Pentagon has bought 2.7 million vaccines, and 1.4 million of those will
go to active duty military. National Guard troops on active duty are also
required to receive the vaccine, as are civilian Defense Department
employees who are in critical jobs.

"Because I can compel people to get the shots, larger numbers will have the
vaccine," said Renuart, commander of US Northern Command. "They will, as a
percentage of the population, be vaccinated more rapidly than many of us.
So we may see some objective results, good or not, of the vaccinations."

Shots will be doled out on a priority basis, with troops preparing to
deploy first, followed by other active duty forces, particularly any who
might be needed to quickly respond to a hurricane or other emergency.
Families of military members will receive their shots through the military
bases, who will be working with state officials and get their own shipments
of the vaccine. Renuart said it appears there is enough of the vaccine to
meet the military's needs.

Inoculating the military is a key requirement of the Pentagon's emergency
plan, as a way to ensure that troops are available to protect the nation.
They also will be on tap to provide help to states if problems come up as
the flu season continues.

So far, Renuart said that between 15 and 20 troops have been dispatched to
each of the 5 regional headquarters, to work with officials from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and
Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and state leaders.
But the military presence could rise to 80 in each regional office if
needed, he said. "If you see the virus begin to mutate or have a broader
affect, or pockets where the vaccine isn't available or is less effective,"
and the local authorities need help, the military would send the additional
support, Renuart said.

For the general population, the 1st swine flu vaccine should be in some
doctors' offices as early as 5 Oct 2009, according to US health officials.
The early batches will protect 6 million to 7 million people, but over
time, the government expects to have a total of 250 million doses of the
new vaccine. About 10 per cent of that has been promised to other
countries. Vaccine shipments will go directly to doctors, clinics, and
other providers designated by each state.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
swine flu is widespread in 26 states now, up from 21 a week ago. While the
CDC doesn't have an exact count of swine flu deaths and hospitalizations,
reports suggest the infection has caused more than 600 deaths and more than
9000 hospitalizations.
