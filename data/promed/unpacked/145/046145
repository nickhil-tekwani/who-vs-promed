Due to the constant notification of suspected hantavirus [infections] in the province, especially in El Ramal, the provincial Ministry of Heath issued a series of recommendations that urge the people to maintain cleanliness and stay away from rodent habitats. Active surveillance of febrile cases was initiated in the endemic area to control the disease.

So far this year [2012], there are about 260 suspected hantavirus [infection] cases, of which 22 resulted positive and, regretfully, 6 people died of the disease in 2012. The localities in which positive cases have been reported are Yuto, Calilegua, Fraile Pintado, Caimancito, Lobaton, La Mendieta, Libertador Gral, San Martin, San Pedro and Palma Sola, with just one in the capital [Buenos Aires].

Referring to this, the Chief of Epidemiological Surveillance, Ariel Solis, explained that preventive measures and surveillance were suggested based on the large number of suspected cases, and he added that 8 weeks ago, there was an outbreak of hantavirus [disease] in La Mendieta, clarifying that an "outbreak" signifies a high number of reported suspected cases, of which only 4 of 50 were confirmed.

Beyond the statistical data, the physician stated that what is important is the initiation of active surveillance of febrile disease in the endemic area, El Ramal in Jujuy, in order to rapidly treat possible cases, and carrying out an etiological investigation, taking into account that [hantavirus infections have] symptoms of other diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, malaria, rickettsiosis, leptospirosis, and sometimes influenza.

"This is considered a zoonosis because the disease [virus] is transmitted by a rodent. Rodents are present in the Ramal area, and there are some that are infected by [a] hantavirus," the Chief of Epidemiology explained, adding that the cities most associated with this disease are San Pedro and Ledesma, due to their location and climate.

With respect to symptoms, Solis said that the 1st sign is fever, and that the hantavirus Andes is not found in the province, which can be transmitted from person to person.

"The people have to take into account that the disease [virus] is transmitted because we permit rodents to come into the house, or we invade the places [habitat] of the rodent. Also, we have to know that there are rats in some places where we should not go, because many times, dried urine that contains the virus is inhaled," stated Ariel Solis.

The Office of the Director General of Epidemiology issued recommendations for prevention to be adopted against hantavirus [infection], which should be taken especially seriously by groups at risk, such as rural workers. It was also specified that the disease is transmitted to people through contact with secretions from wild rodents infected with the virus. Initially, the infection causes an influenza-like clinical picture with a sore throat, fever, cough, and muscle pain; in a few days, this evolves to serious respiratory difficulty. He also noted that no specific treatment exists for this disease, which can be fatal, in the province as well as in other countries in the world.

He also explained that the people at greatest risk are rural workers and residents, transport workers, refuse collectors in rural areas, park guards, campers, tourists, and anyone whose activity includes frequent contact with rodents or places infested with them.

Hantavirus infections are contracted by inhaling air contaminated by feces, urine, or saliva of certain species of wild rodents through direct contact with these or their excreta or through bites. The virus is vulnerable [to inactivation] in open air and even more in sunlight, in which it remains active for only 2 hours. As a result, closed places such as storehouses, closets, sheds, caves, and abandoned houses are the most common places for transmission. Because of this, before handling dead rodents and rodent excreta or their nests, they should be sprayed abundantly with a disinfectant solution. Once they have been disinfected, they should be placed in double plastic bags and then buried or incinerated.

The symptoms that present with this disease are similar to influenza, which can make hantavirus infection difficult to recognize. The symptoms are muscle pain, fever, migraine, cough, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Some organs fail, and there can be respiratory difficulty. This latter symptom is caused by an accumulation of fluid in the lungs and can result in respiratory arrest or an inability to breathe.

[Because Jujuy is in the far northwest part of Argentina, adjacent to the border with Chile, one would suspect Andes virus to be the hantavirus involved in these cases, [but] the above report indicates that Andes virus is not present in this province. This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved.

As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like virus Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana virus (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran virus (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo virus (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case or which rodent species were implicated as reservoirs.
