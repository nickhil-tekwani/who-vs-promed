In the last 2 weeks, 6 cases of a disease bearing a close resemblance to
diphtheria surfaced from Surendranagar, among which one patient died. State
health department officials are not sure of the mysterious ailment that is
reported to have gripped Chandragadh village of Surendranagar recently.
At the V.S. Hospital in Ahmedabad, 6 patients were admitted with symptoms
of 'atypical diphtheria' that may have led to either Guillain-Barre
Syndrome (GBS) or Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP), an infection to which one
patient succumbed recently. Head of the paediatrics department in V.S.
hospital, Rajesh Joshi, admitted they had received a few cases of what
appeared to be either GBS or AFP, suspected as due to viral [or] bacterial
infections.
State health commissioner V.A. Sathe confirmed that 6 cases of 'atypical
diphtheria' have shown symptoms of GBS or AFP in patients at V.S. Hospital.
They are from Chandragadh in Halvad taluka. Health officials have conducted
a house-to-house survey to ascertain whether there are any more cases.

[The neurological manifestations of diphtheria include: 1. hypesthesia and
local paralysis of the soft palate; 2. weakness of the posterior
pharyngeal, laryngeal, and facial nerves, causing a nasal tone in the
voice, difficulty in swallowing, and risk of death from aspiration; 3.
cranial neuropathies that characteristically occur in the 5th week and lead
to oculomotor and ciliary paralysis, which manifest as strabismus, blurred
vision, or difficulty with accommodation; 4. symmetric polyneuropathy that
begins within 10 days to 3 months after oropharyngeal infection and
principally causes motor function deficit with diminished deep tendon
reflexes; and finally 5. proximal muscle weakness of the extremities
progressing distally and, more commonly, distal weakness progressing
proximally. Clinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in distal
weakness are indistinguishable from findings of polyneuropathy of
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Paralysis of the diaphragm can ensue.
The absence of a description of the oropharyngeal manifestations of
diphtheria make it difficult to postulate _C. diphtheriae_ infection as the
etiology here.
AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) is multifactorial. The syndrome may be caused
by paralytic polio infection, although the paralysis in poliomyelitis tends
to be asymmetrical as compared to the symmetrical changes as described
above for GBS or diphtheria. Other enteroviruses may cause a polio-like
syndrome, as has been observed in West Nile virus infection. - Mod.LL]
[According to the National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP) of India
(<http://www.npspindia.org/>) as of 20 Sep 2003 there have been 3 cases of
polio due to wild poliovirus identified in Gujarat this year. The most
recent identified case in India (according to the NPSP data) was in Uttar
Pradesh, with a date of onset of 20 Sep 2003. In addition, according to
the WHO polio surveillance data
(<http://www.who.int/vaccines/casecount/afpextractnew.cfm>), there have
been 132 wild poliovirus associated cases of polio in India to date this
year. The above newswire does not give the ages or specific clinical
spectrum of the mentioned cases, but mention of the pediatric hospital
suggests that these cases may be in the pediatric group. One can't help
but muse on the possibility that the "unusual diphtheria" outbreak
described above might well be an outbreak of polio. More information from
authoritative sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
