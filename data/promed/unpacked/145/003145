Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 11
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 105 / 15 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 621 / 33 / 0 / 0 / 1
Goats / 182 / 23 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics (rates apparent, expressed in percentages)
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 14.29 / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00
Sheep / 5.31 / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.16
Goats / 12.64 / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Illegal movement of animals

Epidemiological comments:
In addition to the control measures mentioned, the following measures are being implemented:
- crisis cells at national and regional levels,
- burying of offal and bones between 2 layers of lime,
- disinfection of vehicles leaving the affected governorates,
- vaccination points of susceptible species at the entrance of livestock markets,
- epidemiological investigation to determine the origin of the infection,
- communication plan.

Control measures:
Measures applied: quarantine, movement control inside the country, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), modified stamping out, no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[Since the start of this epizootic, reportedly on 25 Apr 2014, 38 new outbreaks have been reported from almost all parts of Tunisia; see interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15183.

The accumulated total numbers of the affected animals, since the start of the event (38 outbreaks), are as follows:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1209 / 95 / 0 / 0 / 9
Sheep / 1777 / 218 / 0 / 0 / 1
Goats / 309 / 25 / 0 / 0 / 0

It may be assumed that the actual number of infected animals is considerably higher than the given figures (which refer to observed clinical cases, while infection may be subclinical). As to the causative agent and regional implications, subscribers are referred to Dr Benkirane's commentary below (item [2]). - Mod.AS]

Foot and mouth disease hit Tunisia a couple of weeks ago, and neighboring countries to the west are aware of the official situation as declared to OIE. However, there has been no post so far giving the genotype of the serotype O presently circulating in Tunisia, while it is said that vaccination is under way both in Tunisia and in neighboring parts of Algeria. Does the vaccine strain confer a solid and long-lasting immunity against the wild virus strain? If so, I believe this should be spelled out and disseminated to ProMED-mail readers.

Morocco stopped vaccinating in 2007 and has embarked on the OIE/FAO pathway to obtain the status of freedom without vaccination. Thus, the threat is of utmost importance to this country, as receptive livestock is totally naive vis-a-vis FMD virus. I suggest that ProMED publish an RFI requesting the Moroccan veterinary authorities to share with ProMED-mail information about their actual contingency plan -- if there is one -- in order to sound the likelihood of the possible spread of the disease in this country should the virus flare up originating from Algeria as it did in 1999.

[According to Tunisia's page on the website of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) at Pirbright, the FMDV serotypes reported from Tunisia in the past are as follows:

FMDV-O: 1970, 1975, 1989-1990, 1994, 1999
FMDV-A: 1979, 1982
FMDV-C: 1965, 1967, 1969
FMDV-Asia 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 2: 0000
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000

Hopefully, the recent isolate from Tunisia has already been submitted to the FMD reference laboratory for confirmation of the serotyping and for genotyping. When they become available, the results are anticipated to be published on the said web-page, namely http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/tun.htm. - Mod.AS
