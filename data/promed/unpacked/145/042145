Anthrax site cleanup may finally near end
-----------------------------------------------
The old American Media Inc. building that endured the country's 1st
anthrax attack more than 5 years ago could spring back to life within
weeks. Palm Beach County public-health officials are confident the
next stage of the anthrax decontamination, which started Monday [27
Nov 2006], really will be the final steps in a cleanup that began 2
1/2 years ago.
Plans call for Marcor Remediation Inc., the 2nd company to take on
the project, to test the 3-story building to make sure it's
anthrax-free. It's a step designed to check the work of Bio-ONE, the
1st company hired to rid the tabloid publisher's former home of the
toxin. Palm Beach County Health Department Director Dr. Jean Malecki
said Bio-ONE has a good track record and she's confident in the
process the company used. However, public-health officials never saw
data showing Bio-ONE's results from the office floors because of a
contract dispute between the building owner, David Rustine, and the
company. Rustine said he had nothing new to talk about regarding the
building but that he would "real soon."
Marcor decontaminated the building's basement and thousands of boxes
that held decades of celebrity photos and mundane office items. Over
the next few days, Marcor crews will enter the building, still
quarantined, to take samples. Those samples should be sent to the lab
next week, public-health officials said. They hope to get results
around 20 Dec 2006.
Malecki said an advisory group of national experts would review the
results. If they show the building is safe, a decision on the
building would be made immediately.
The attack occurred in early October 2001. Anthrax came mixed in a
white powder by mail. Bob Stevens, an AMI photo editor, was killed
and 17 others were made sick.

[Way back when, I met the person responsible for getting this
building disinfected. He told me that the contamination was
throughout the building. The only way it could be explained was that
when the janitorial team came in following the opening of the spore
bearing envelope(s) (there is a suspicion that there might have been
more than one), the vacuum cleaners just energized the spilt spores,
and the internal ventilation system did the rest, which just goes to
show that host factors play an important part in selecting who gets
infected or not. Fortunately, with few exceptions, it was "not." -
