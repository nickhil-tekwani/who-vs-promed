The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of central province of Quang Ngai today [25 Nov 2022] reported that the avian virus killed 2240 ducks in 3 households and farms in November [2022].

Right after test results showed that waterfowl in the province were positive for influenza A/H5N1 virus, Quang Ngai Sub-Department of Livestock and Veterinary Medicine coordinated with local authorities to immediately implement preventative measures to control the epidemic such as disinfection with Benkocid chemical, lime powder as well as killing 1340 ducks in the herd.

On one breeding farm, in Mo Duc District's Duc Hoa Commune, roughly 600 ducks died. On a 2nd farm, in Duc Pho town, which raised 640 waterfowls, 300 of them were dead while 340 were killed to curb the spread of the disease. On a 3rd farm, in Quang Ngai City, 800 birds had to be killed while 200 were dead due to the avian virus. Most ducks are 28-100 days old, weighing from 1.2 kg to 2.5 kg.

According to the Quang Ngai Sub-Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, in the coming weeks, the risk of the introduction of the bird flu virus on poultry farms is higher because the weather is complicated at the moment; plus, according to the results of tested monitoring samples, 38/168 samples taken in markets in Quang Ngai Province were found to be positive for influenza virus A/H5N1 while 4/168 samples were positive for influenza virus A/H5N6 the avian influenza virus since the beginning of the year [2022].

The local authorities in the affected districts were advised to continue implementing epidemic prevention and control measures according to regulations with a focus on vaccination and disinfection as well as transportation of poultry products in and out of epidemic areas according to the present law, to prevent the epidemic spread.

[The last case of HPAI H5N1 affecting poultry in Viet Nam is dated 26 Oct 2022 (https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf). Viet Nam introduced in 2005 vaccination against HPAI H5N1. The efficacy of the commercially available vaccines against recent strains of the HPAI H5N1 virus has been subject to recent discussions.

The 2022/2023 season of HPAI H5N1, synchronized with bird migration, started in October 2022 in several eastern Asia countries (China, Japan, South Korea), in tandem with the season's start in other regions within Eurasia. - Mod AS
