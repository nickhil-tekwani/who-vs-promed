Mild avian flu strains cause disease in wild birds
-----------------------------------------------
Mild forms of avian flu can cause illness among wild birds, slow their
migration and spread faster than previously believed, a study found on Wed
31 Jan 2007. The findings alter the view that wild birds did not suffer at
all from low pathogenic bird flu. Although milder forms of bird flu are
themselves harmless to people, they can pose a serious threat if mixed with
human strains. "The study sheds new light on the transmission of these
types of viruses but also of highly pathogenic viruses in wild birds," said
Ron Fouchier of the Department of Virology at the Erasmus Medical Centre in
Rotterdam, who took part in the research.
Current concern over bird flu is focused on the highly pathogenic H5N1 form
of the virus, which originated in Asia and has killed at least 164 people
since 2003. Scientists fear that H5N1 could mutate into a form easily
spread between humans, sparking a worldwide pandemic.
The report, compiled by Dutch scientists and published in the U.S.
scientific journal PLoS ONE, monitored 12 swans, 2 of which had low
pathogenic flu strains H6N2 and H6N8. Its results showed the infected birds
launched their migration later, fed slower and flew shorter distances than
the healthier birds. "The fact that the birds get sick is certainly no
guarantee that they cannot transmit the virus amongst each other," Fouchier
said.
Fouchier added it was previously believed that birds infected with highly
pathogenic flu could not transmit the virus because they would be too sick
to fly. "Because of their slower migration, ill birds get in touch with
many more healthy birds passing by them on migration. In this way, the
virus can spread itself more rapidly than previously thought," said Jan van
Gils of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, which also participated in
the study.
Last winter, the Dutch scientists attached GPS navigation chips to the neck
collars of the 12 swans and monitored them closely with the help of
volunteer bird watchers. The 2 infected birds launched their migration to
spring breeding grounds in northwest Russia in late January-early February,
a month later than the healthy swans. The sick birds flew only 35 km (21.7
miles) instead of the usual 250 km to their next stop, and their digestion
seemed to be impaired, the study said. Both birds returned to the
Netherlands in the beginning of this winter and appeared fully recovered.
Van Gils said acquiring more knowledge about mild strains was important
because they had formed the origin of past pandemics such as the 1918
Spanish Flu, the worst in modern history, which killed about 50 million people.

It is increasingly acknowledged that migratory birds, notably waterfowl,
play a critical role in the maintenance and spread of influenza A viruses.
In order to elucidate the epidemiology of influenza A viruses in their
natural hosts, a better understanding of the pathological effects in these
hosts is required. Here we report on the feeding and migratory performance
of wild migratory Bewick's swans (_Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell_)
naturally infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A viruses of
subtypes H6N2 and H6N8. Using information on geolocation data collected
from Global Positioning Systems fitted to neck-collars, we show that
infected swans experienced delayed migration, leaving their wintering site
more than a month after uninfected animals. This was correlated with
infected birds traveling shorter distances and fueling and feeding at
reduced rates. The data suggest that LPAI virus infections in wild
migratory birds may have higher clinical and ecological impacts than
previously recognized.

[Readers should note the small sample size for the infected birds, 2. This
is one bird more than for an anecdote. But the authors raise a valid point.
Hopefully, other researchers can test the hypotheses raised by this paper.

Re: Avian influenza, poultry vs. migratory birds (09), part (1) Global and
interregional spread
-----------------------------------------------
I would like to mention that very similar conclusions regarding possible
HPAI introduction and spread in North America as in the article written by
A. M. Kilpatrick et al. (Predicting the global spread of H5N1 influenza A,
PNAS 103: 19368-19373, December 2006) were published in another recent
paper (Birds and influenza H5N1 virus movement to and within North America
- Emerg. Infect. Dis. 12: 1486-1492, October 2006), accessible at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no10/05-1577.htm>.
