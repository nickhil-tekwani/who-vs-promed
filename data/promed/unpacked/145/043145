Nearly 80 Argentinian cops participating in the safety measures for
the 4th Americas Presidential Meeting in Mar del Plata suffered
illness after eating.

The agents, who belong to Federal Police and who on the evening of 2
Nov 2005 ate pasta in the hotel where they are staying, received
medication, but none of them had to be taken to the hospital, police
sources indicated today, 3 Nov 2005.

Police spokesman, Officer Daniel Rodriguez, pointed out that the
group of agents "developed vomiting and diarrhea", and they were
cared for by medical personnel from the police force, and he said
that "in the next few hours everyone will return to duty. Of the 80
ill police, 7 are women", he pointed out, before adding that "700
officers ate in the same hotel and only a group suffered this
problem" in Mar del Plata, where the Presidential Meeting will
commence next Fri, 4 Nov 2005.

9000 police and military personnel have been deployed in order to
guarantee security in the aforementioned meeting, which 34 presidents
or heads of state will attend.

[ProMED thanks Matias Sacla for the contribution. Mar del Plata is
located about 400 km south of Buenos Aires on the Atlantic Coast in
Buenos Aires Province.

The original posting referred to the food eaten as "rotten." Although
the etiology of the outbreak and whether the pasta was indeed the
source have yet to be established, food-borne illness is not
necessarily caused by 'rotten' but rather by contaminated food.
Indeed, the food is likely to look and taste normal. The illness
occurred in about 11.5 percent of those eating in the hotel. It is
not known if the whole group of 700 ate pasta.

If the incubation period of the illness was relatively short, the
illness may have been caused by pre-formed bacterial toxins such as
those produced by _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Bacillus cereus_, and
_Clostridium perfringens_ or other toxic substances. These illnesses
may cause vomiting, diarrhea, or both and are usually short in
duration (less than 24 hours) and not associated with prominent
fever. Longer incubation periods (more than 24 hours) are often
caused by true infections due to bacteria (salmonella, shigella,
campylobacter) or viruses (norovirus, rotavirus), which can cause
fever and often last for several days. - Mod.LL]
