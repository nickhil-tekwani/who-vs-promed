WHO has received reports of an outbreak of yellow fever in Batie, Gaoua,
and Banfora districts in Burkina Faso in the south east of the country,
near the border with Cote d'Ivoire. 4 cases including 1 death have been
laboratory-confirmed by Centre Muraz, Burkina Faso and by the WHO
Collaborating Centre for Yellow Fever, the Institut Pasteur, Dakar,
Senegal. The fatal case, a boy 4 years old, came from Bouna region in Cote
d'Ivoire.
A team from the Ministry of Health and WHO in Burkina Faso and a team from
the Ministry of Health, WHO and UNICEF in Cote d'Ivoire quickly
investigated the outbreak in this cross-border area characterized by
increased population movements. A mass vaccination campaign is being
prepared in both countries to protect the population at risk and to prevent
the spread of the disease to densely populated urban settings.
The WHO Regional Office for Africa is working with both Ministries to
determine the most appropriate strategies for disease control in the
cross-border area and to raise funds for outbreak response activities.

[As can be seen from the ProMED-mail archives below, this cross-border area
is endemic for YF, and a case was imported into Germany in 1999, where,
fortunately, there were no vector mosquitoes to start an epidemic. - Mod.JW]
