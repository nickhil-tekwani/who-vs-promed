8 people who were bitten by 4 dogs in Perlis [state] recently were reported to be in good health despite 2 of the dogs being confirmed infected with rabies. Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said all victims were given outpatient treatment and those with bite wounds were given rabies vaccine.

The Perlis Health Department (JKN) had also stepped up several preventive measures including opening a Rabies Prevention and Operations Control Room since last Saturday [22 Aug 2015] as well as issuing health alerts to medical practitioners in the state on the detection of dogs infected with rabies, he said in a statement here today [28 Aug 2015]. "At the same time, Perlis JKN has also stockpiled rabies vaccine and intensified the promotion of preventive measures to residents on the disease," he said.

Noor Hisham said people living in border areas about 30 kilometres [about 19 miles] from Thailand such as Perlis, Kedah, Perak and Kelantan were advised to take preventive measures to avoid being bitten by dogs or wild animals.

Perlis is a very small state in the northwest corner of Malaysia tucked up against the Thai border; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlis.

So far, so good. The veterinary response was posted earlier; see ProMED-mail post 20150825.3599775. As this canine exposure occurred on 27 Jul 2015, and rabies was confirmed on 4 Aug 2015, the fact that none of the human contacts, vaccinated or not, have demonstrated symptoms means they are probably in the clear. But the public health response has been slow, i.e. initiated only on 22 Aug 2015. - Mod.MHJ
