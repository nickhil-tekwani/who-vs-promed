100 more fall ill as swamp fever rages
--------------------------------------
Deadly swamp fever (leptospirosis) continues to spread in the Western
Province of Kenya, with 4 more primary schools, in Webuye division, within
Bungoma District, recording new cases.
At least 100 pupils of Ngwelo, Katimany, Ngachi, and Khalumuli primary
schools were admitted to Webuye district hospital after developing symptoms
associated with the illness. Some of the pupils were treated and
discharged, while others, whose blood samples were taken to the Government
laboratory in Nairobi, were put in isolated wards.
Earlier, the disease struck Matulo primary school, where a pupil died, and
80 others were hospitalized in critical condition, sweating heavily, and
vomiting.
Following the outbreak, councilor Batroba Soita of Sidikho ward, on Sun 11
Jul 2004, pleaded with the Ministry of Health to set up a treatment camp in
the area. He said the hospital was 27 kilometers away and expressed fears
that some of the pupils could die while being transported on bicycles to
the facility.
Swamp fever, whose medical name is leptospirosis, was 1st diagnosed at
Chesamisi Secondary School in Kimilili, where it claimed 6 students. 2
pupils at the neighboring primary schools, and 5 villagers, also succumbed
to the disease.
Health Minister Charity Ngilu visited the area and set up camps at Makhonge
Health Center, and at the school, which are being manned by officials from
the ministry and the World Health Organization. At the onset of the
outbreak, at least 100 students of Chesamisi were admitted to Webuye hospital.

[As reported, this outbreak of leptospirosis continues to spread. A
water-borne disease, this spread supports the likelihood of a continuing
source of contaminated water, but, not necessarily continued contamination,
since the leptospires can survive for weeks to months in the environment.
The above follow-up relates that some of these afflicted persons were put
in isolation, but human-to-human transmission of this infection is not
considered to be a major mode of transmission. Without a denominator, a
case-fatality rate cannot be calculated, but overall, it is likely to be
low. - Mod.LL]
