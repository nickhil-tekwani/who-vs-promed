Researchers have identified the bacteria responsible for the deaths of
hundreds of Maine lobster last year. However, the lobster sickness is still
puzzling. Researchers say a bacteria distantly related to the one that
causes cholera [_Vibrio_ caused lobsters to die in traps and at lobster
pounds last year.
Working with researchers from the University of Maine, a microbiologist at
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says he has identified the culprit.
Ben Tall performed tests on lobster samples sent to him since the problem
began afflicting lobsters in Maine and New Brunswick more than a year ago.
Because lobsters are eaten only after they've been cooked, the bacteria
should not spread to humans. Scientists have found that the bacteria cannot
survive temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius, or about 80 degrees
Fahrenheit. There have been no reports of people being sickened after
eating lobsters.
