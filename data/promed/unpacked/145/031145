Wheat stem rust hits Rift Valley farmers
----------------------------------------
Wheat stem rust Ug99 continues to threaten the livelihoods of
hundreds of farmers in Kenya's Rift Valley region. Wet and misty
conditions since November 2009 are making Ug99 even harder to
control. Small-scale farmers who account for 80 percent of wheat
growers are especially hard hit.

"Farmers this [2010] season are complaining that despite spraying
their crop it has been affected by the rust," the agriculture
extension officer in Njoro District (Rift Valley) said. "Before, we
would spray the field twice but now we are being forced to apply the
chemical up to 5 times," a farmer said.

According to a crop breeder with the Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute (KARI), Peter Njau, farmers are embracing disease control.
Spraying fields when infestation is already too high or using the
wrong products are some of the problems.

Of about 11 000 wheat varieties screened in 2005, less than 2 percent
were found to have some resistance to Ug99. KARI is among the centres
to develop Ug99-resistant wheat varieties and have produced 2 that
are ready for trial.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 percent are reported, but
some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the
most dangerous at present is strain Ug99 (discovered in Uganda in
1999), which has overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our
current wheat varieties. Since then Ug99 has appeared in Kenya,
Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen, and Iran, and even more virulent variants of
Ug99 able to overcome additional resistance genes have emerged
including, for example, in Kenya's Rift Valley in 2009 (ProMED-mail
post 20090312.1019). A new source of Ug99 strains was recently
reported in South Africa opening up additional routes of transmission
and increasing the threat in the southern hemisphere (ProMED-mail
post 20100602.1834).

Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw, and some
grasses or volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing
inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management may include
fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat, and resistant
varieties if available. Breeding programmes have been set up in
international cooperation (Delhi Declaration) to establish wheat
varieties resistant to Ug99.

As mentioned in the report above, bad timing and unsuitable chemicals
may well be a reason for the increased need of fungicides to control
stem rust in Kenya. However, cereal rust strains with new fungicide
resistances are emerging worldwide and the possibility of Ug99
strains developing additional fungicide resistances cannot be
excluded. Such strains would be even more difficult to control.
