Summary
-------
Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) pose an urgent risk to global human health. CRE that are non-susceptible to all commercially available antibiotics threaten to return us to the pre-antibiotic era. Using single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing we determined the complete genome of a pandrug-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolate, representing the 1st complete genome sequence of CRE resistant to all commercially available antibiotics. The precise location of acquired antibiotic resistance elements, including mobile elements carrying genes for the OXA-181 carbapenemase, were defined. Intriguingly, we identified 3 chromosomal copies of an ISEcp1-blaOXA-181 mobile element, one of which has disrupted the mgrB regulatory gene, accounting for resistance to colistin. Our findings provide the 1st description of pandrug-resistant CRE at the genomic level, and reveal the critical role of mobile resistance elements in accelerating the emergence of resistance to other last resort antibiotics.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Zowawi for bringing this study to our attention.

Dr Zowawi and colleagues describe an 87-year-old man, hospitalized in the United Arab Emirates in April 2014, who was found to be colonized with _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ in urine and a pre-sacral pressure wound that was resistant to all commercially available antibiotics relevant to the treatment of a bacterial infection due to _K. pneumoniae_, which included cephalosporins, penicillins, carbapenems, aztreonam, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin, colistin, tetracyclines, tigecycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin. Insertional inactivation of the mgrB gene by a mobile chromosomal genetic element caused resistance to colistin in the _K. pneumoniae_ isolated from the UAE patient. ProMED-mail recently posted a report of colistin resistance encoded on a mobile genetic element; in that case it was located on a plasmid (ProMED-mail Antibiotic resistance - China: colistin, plasmid-encoded, humans, animals 20151122.3810204).

Antibiotic resistance caused by mobile genetic elements potentially can move between bacteria of the same species and, in some cases, even can move across species and genus boundaries. Resistance can then be transferred in a horizontal fashion to a variety of pathogenic species. Because genes that encode antibiotic resistance are often linked together, gene transfer can result in resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics.

The source for this organism in the UAE index patient was unknown, and there have been no further isolates with this resistance phenotype at the UAE patient's hospital. The authors recommend global surveillance for this type of organism. - Mod.ML
