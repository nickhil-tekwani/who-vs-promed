Smallpox rumors - Pakistan: NOT
-----------------------
Rumours reported by the media of a cluster of smallpox cases in Swabi
district, Pakistan have been investigated by a team from National
Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, health officials from the North
West Frontier Province and WHO. All cases were children and showed
typical features of chickenpox. No evidence of smallpox was found.
Samples are being tested at NIH.

[Many thanks to the WHO Outbreak Response Team for this very rapid
feedback on the rumor generated by a report in the Pakistan English
language newspaper Dawn. As mentioned earlier, it's an unfortunate
occurrence when these incorrect newswire reports are published as
with today's communication age, these rumors take on a life of their
own and result in significant unnecessary concern and fears. -
