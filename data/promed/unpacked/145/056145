Scientists investigating a mystery contaminant in the blood thinner
heparin are closing in on what they believe is a counterfeit
substance, most likely made in China from animal cartilage, that was
chemically altered to act like the real drug.

But in interviews, heparin experts in China and the USA, including a
researcher involved in the inquiry, said that a chemically altered
substance called over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate is probably the
contaminant that the FDA says is linked to hundreds of allergic
reactions and 19 deaths.

Even so, researchers said they were not certain that the contaminant,
constituting between 5 percent and 20 percent of the drug, is what is
causing the allergic reactions nor do they know precisely how or when
it was mixed into the active ingredient.

Chondroitin sulfate is a widely used supplement to treat joint pain.
In its unaltered state, it does not have the blood-thinning
properties found in the contaminant. But scientists and researchers
say the act of changing the molecule gives the substance
anti-coagulating properties.

Scientists who have examined batches of the contaminated heparin
distributed by Baxter International in the USA said in interviews
that they suspected that the heparin-like molecule was intentionally
mixed into the drug.

"A child could tell you it's counterfeiting," said Dr. Jawed Fareed,
a professor of pathology and pharmacology at Loyola University
Chicago, who has been studying batches of heparin since the problems
with the drug were discovered.

Dr. Fareed said he was conducting his own investigation because he
was concerned that the quality problems with heparin were far more
widespread than acknowledged. "Of 7 or 8 batches I have, 6 are
contaminated," said Dr. Fareed. "And these were used by doctors at
Loyola University Medical Center."

An American chemist, who asked not to be identified because he had
signed a confidentiality agreement, said he and the FDA had looked at
chondroitin sulfate, a substance derived from animal cartilage, as a
possible contaminant because of its structural similarities with
heparin. "It is something that is a little bit different," said the
chemist, "like a distant family relative you don't recognize." He
added, "once we have the exact fingerprint, we will try to figure out
how it got into the product."

Zhang Tianmin, 80, a retired professor at the Shandong University
School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, said counterfeiters would likely
choose chondroitin sulfate, from animal cartilage, or chitosan, from
shellfish, as a base substance to create a heparin-like molecule,
because both substances are cheap. But since neither has natural
blood-thinning activity, counterfeiters would have to add something
that does. "Sulfate groups appear naturally in the heparin molecule,"
Mr. Zhang said, "but they can also be produced by chemical synthesis."

Baxter has recalled virtually all of its heparin products in the USA,
and since that recall there have been no new deaths, the FDA said
last week.

Dr. Fareed said it was too early to say whether the contaminant is
causing the adverse reactions. A variety of reactions have been
observed, including abdominal pain, hypotension [low blood pressure],
a burning sensation, vomiting, diarrhea, rising temperature and
anaphylaxis, he said, "but one cannot link all of these to one
substance."

"This is a deliberate act of chemically manipulating a heparin-like
substance and mixing it with heparin to increase the yield," he
added. But some batches of heparin containing the contaminant did not
elicit adverse reactions, casting uncertainty on their root cause,
Dr. Fareed said.

[More information is slowly becoming available. The oversulfated
chondroitin sulfate appears to be the contaminant that may have
caused the adverse reaction. It is likely to have been a deliberate
contamination. - Mod.LL]
