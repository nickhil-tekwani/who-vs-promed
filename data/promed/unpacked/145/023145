Vaccine strain BTV-14 in Latvia and Poland: Update Outbreak Assessment
-----------------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
An update to the EU Reference Laboratory (EURL) for BTV at the Pirbright Institute has confirmed the samples from Poland have 100 percent sequence similarity to a South African vaccine strain of BTV-14. In addition, the National Reference Laboratory in Latvia has similarly confirmed strong similarity to the South African reference strain. Further samples have been sent to the EURL. In addition, the report notes that these samples are also similar to partial sequences from samples from Russia and Spain in 2011. Clinical disease has not been reported associated with these cases.

2. Situation Assessment
These data collectively suggest the release of the BTV-14 reference or vaccine strain into the field, possibly indicating the use of a live BTV-14 vaccine. The similarities of these different samples (Russia 2011, Spain 2011, Poland 2012 and Latvia 2012) indicate that they are derived from a common source and suggest significant spread of the virus in the field.

It will be important to determine whether vectors are responsible for the spread or whether there is wider use of the live vaccine.

We should remind livestock keepers that the use of live attenuated BTV vaccines is not authorised in the EU.

3. Conclusions
Several of these East European countries are likely to be entering the vector-free period, and, therefore, the risk of spread is reduced; nevertheless a new serotype through the possible use of live vaccine entering the EU even with few clinical signs is always a concern.

Bluetongue Virus in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland
-----------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
Lithuania reported in November 2012 that a calf exported to Spain in August 2012 had tested positive by PCR for BTV. As a result of this information, Lithuanian authorities tested a further number of cattle at the place of origin of the calf and found 15/51 more were also positive by ELISA. The serotype is unknown. (European Commission Fax Bluetongue 01/2012 - 13 Nov 2012).

On 19 Nov 2012, Latvia reported seropositive cattle (PCR negative) again, not serotyped (European Commission Fax Bluetongue 02/2012). According to the Ministry, samples were 1st detected as seropositive in September 2012 as a result of bulk milk testing.

On 22 Nov 2012 (European Commission Fax Bluetongue 03/2012), Poland reported 3 holdings in Podlaskie region, bordering Lithuania and Belarus, with PCR positive cattle. Serotyping was negative for BTV 1, 6, 8 and 11, but partial sequences aligned significantly with BTV-14.

Also on 22 Nov 2012, (European Commission Fax Bluetongue 04/2012) Estonia reported seropositive cattle on a farm in Saare region (an island in the Baltic Sea, west of the mainland). [But see item 3].

All countries have sent samples to the EU Reference Laboratory for BTV at the Pirbright Institute for serotyping. Preliminary results have confirmed the Polish samples as BTV-14 by real time RT-PCR and sera from Latvia to contain BTV-14 antibodies. Serum samples from Lithuania are still being investigated [but see item 1], and to date, samples from Estonia have not been received. Clinical disease has not been reported associated with this possible infection.

2. Situation Assessment
The most likely pathways for disease introduction would be in live animals, infected vectors, or possibly as a result of vaccination with a live vaccine. [The latter has been confirmed in the meantime; see item 1 above].

On a regional basis, the country which has most recently reported BTV-14 is Russia in Smolensk region, West Russia, where cattle, sheep and goats were reported as infected (OIE, 2011). It is not known whether further surveillance was carried out around the infected premises or in any other susceptible animals since this report [see item 3].

The recent reports of Schmallenberg virus from Poland and Estonia would suggest that vectors are active and likely to have been capable of transmitting aroboviruses over the summer months.

A vaccine is manufactured by the Onderstepoort Company, which is a combination live attenuated vaccine against BTV 1, 4, 6, 12 and 14. It is not suitable for use in the EU because of the risk of reversion to virulence following passage, possible transmission of the strain via vectors, potential to recombine, and possible teratrogenic effects. In addition, the vaccines have only been validated for use in sheep. Vaccine strains have appeared before in Europe due to illegal use, notably BTV-6 and BTV-11, causing limited spread and no clinical disease. This route of introduction cannot be ruled out yet.

BTV-14 has been reported in the USA previously, particularly in the Southeast States (MacLachlan, 2006). In the USA, some disease may occur as a result of infection with various bluetongue serotypes, particularly in sheep, but not in other species. Therefore, these bluetongue serotypes are not considered a high priority in terms of impact, and vaccination is rarely used in sheep and not at all in cattle; BTV-14 is understood to be one such serotype.

3. Conclusions
According to TRACES [Trade Control and Expert System], the EU electronic trade notification system [for monitoring the movements of animals and products of animal origin both within and coming from outside of the EU], there have been no imports into the UK of live cattle or small ruminants in the last 6 months from Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania. However, there have been a handful of cattle from Poland. These will be traced. Future consignments will also be checked for compliance with health certification.

Several of these East European countries are likely to be entering the vector-free period, and, therefore, the risk of spread is reduced; nevertheless, a new serotype entering the EU, even with few clinical signs, is always a concern.

Analysis results from a lab in the UK that arrived at the end of last week indicate that a beef cattle animal in the Saaremaa island that was suspected to be suffering from bluetongue disease does not have the disease, but to be completely certain, vets will conduct blood tests on 900 cattle and sheep in the Saaremaa island, LETA/Saarte Haal ["Islands Voice"] writes.

Estonian Veterinary and Food Board director general Ago Partel told Saarte Haal that the analyses conducted last week in the Pirbright laboratory in the UK indicate that while the test made on 19 Nov 2012 showed that the animal had the virus, the test from 25 Nov 2012 is completely clean.

Partel said that it is now 99.9 percent certain that there wasn't any virus, but a final confirmation will arrive in 2 weeks. According to the law, since an earlier test showed the presence of the virus, around 900 blood samples must be collected from cattle and sheep in 20-km radius and sent to the Veterinary and Food Laboratory in Tartu to be tested.

http://www.fsvps.ru/fsvps-docs/ru/iac/2012/files/reports/iac_report_1_2012.pdf


The disease [bluetongue] has not been recorded in the Russian Federation since 1994. 1st cases were diagnosed in imported cattle in 2008.

On 26 Dec 2011, Russia notified the OIE about the identification of bluetongue virus serotype 14 in the Smolensk region (Urgansk district) in 5 head of cattle, one goat and 4 sheep.

In the 1st quarter of 2012, bluetongue disease was detected and registered in the Smolensk region (5 cattle) and in the region of Niznii Novgorod (4 cattle). Seropositive animals continued to be identified in the Smolensk region (230 cattle) and in Kaluga region (126 cattle). No seropositive animals have been detected during the 2nd quarter of 2012.

In accordance with the data obtained from the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 15 074 head of cattle were serologically examined during the 1st half of 2012, of which 362 were positive (Kaluga, Smolensk, Niznii Novgorod, Tyumen regions).

[The following information on the live-attenuated BTV South African vaccine is available on the web-site of the producer, Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP):
"The vaccine is presented as a series of 3 separate injections with different serotypes of bluetongue virus in each bottle. The bottles are marked A, B and C and must be injected in the following sequence: A, 1st, B, 3 weeks later, and the bottle marked C, 3 weeks after B. If necessary, this interval can be longer but never shorter than 3 weeks. It is necessary to inject the full series, A, B and C in order to get the widest possible protection."

The user's instructions above are intended for the South African and Namibian markets. See "Bluetongue vaccine for sheep" at http://www.obpvaccines.co.za/Cms_Data/Contents/OBPDB/Folders/Product/~contents/GL42GL73FYR4L9CU/2013%20Bluetongue_PI.pdf.

Details on the contents of the different 3 bottles are available in the paper "The use of vaccination in the control of bluetongue in southern Africa" by B. Dungu, T. Gerdes and T. Smit (2004), Veterinaria Italiana, 40 (4), 616-622.

According to the said paper, bottle A includes BTV serotypes 1, 4, 6, 12, 14. Bottle B includes serotypes 3, 8, 9, 10, 11. Bottle C includes the serotypes 2, 5, 7, 13, 19.

Vaccine strain BTV-6 (Germany, Netherlands, 2008) is included in bottle A, similarly to BTV-14. It may have been used to protect against BTV-4 and/or BTV-1, which have been circulating in several European countries (see FEFRA's map, item 1).

Vaccine strain BTV-11 (Belgium, 2008) is included in bottle B, which may have been used to protect against BTV-8.

Where, when, and to which animal species have these vaccines been applied remains to be investigated.

So far, the 3 vaccine strains have not been shown to be involved in clinical disease. - Mod.AS
