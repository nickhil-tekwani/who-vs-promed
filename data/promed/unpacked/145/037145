Outbreak of human pneumonic plague with dog-to-human and possible human-to-human transmission -- Colorado, June-July 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Runfola JK, House J, Miller K, et al]

On 8 Jul 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) laboratory identified _Yersinia pestis_, the bacterium that causes plague, in a blood specimen collected from a man (patient A) hospitalized with pneumonia. The organism had been previously misidentified as _Pseudomonas luteola_ by an automated system in the hospital laboratory. An investigation led by Tri-County Health Department (TCHD) revealed that patient A's dog had died recently with hemoptysis. 3 other persons who had contact with the dog, 1 of whom also had contact with patient A, were ill with fever and respiratory symptoms, including 2 with radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Specimens from the dog and all 3 human contacts yielded evidence of acute _Y. pestis_ infection. 1 of the pneumonia cases might have resulted through human-to-human transmission from patient A, which would be the first such event reported in the USA since 1924.

This outbreak highlights 1) the need to consider plague in the differential diagnosis of ill domestic animals, including dogs, in areas where plague is endemic; 2) the limitations of automated diagnostic systems for identifying rare bacteria such as _Y. pestis_; and 3) the potential for milder plague illness in patients taking antimicrobial agents. Hospital laboratorians should be aware of the limitations of automated identification systems, and clinicians should suspect plague in patients with clinically compatible symptoms from whom _P. luteola_ is isolated.

Investigation and results
-------------------------
Patient A, a previously healthy middle-aged man, developed fever and cough on 28 Jun 2014. Over the next 24 hours his condition worsened with increasing cough and the production of bloody sputum. He was admitted to a local hospital where he was diagnosed with pneumonia (Figure [for figure and tables see source URL above URL. - Mod.LL]). Blood cultures collected on [30 Jun 2014] grew a Gram negative rod that was initially identified as _P. luteola_ using an automated identification system. Over the next 6 days patient A's respiratory status deteriorated, and he was transferred to another facility where he required intubation. Because of the severity of his illness and previous reports of misidentification of _Y. pestis_ as _P. luteola_ (1,2), the isolate was sent to the CDPHE laboratory for further testing. On 8 Jul 2014, the specimen was correctly identified as _Y. pestis_, and patient A received a diagnosis of pneumonic plague. Patient A was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including levofloxacin and streptomycin, and recovered after hospitalization for 23 days.

TCHD initiated an investigation, consisting of interviews with patient A's family, evaluation of potential exposures to the patient, and an environmental assessment to determine the risk for further disease transmission. The investigation revealed that patient A's dog, a male American pit bull terrier aged 2 years, became ill with fever, jaw rigidity, drooling, and right forelimb ataxia on 24 Jun 2014 (Table). The dog was kept overnight at a veterinary clinic and humanely euthanized the following day after developing dyspnea and bloody sputum. Patient A had close contact with the dog during euthanasia. Necropsy revealed gastric and pulmonary hemorrhage. Samples tested negative for evidence of rabies virus infection and anticoagulants; histopathologic examination of the tissues was declined by patient A. Following patient A's diagnosis with plague, liver and lung tissues from the dog were tested for _Y. pestis_, and results were positive by both polymerase chain reaction assay and culture. Archived formalin-fixed tissues from the dog were processed for histopathology, revealing severe acute bronchopneumonia with intra-alveolar bacteria. The investigation also identified 3 other persons who had been in close contact with the ill dog, one of whom who also had contact with patient A. All 3 subsequently received diagnoses of plague, and all 3 recovered (Table, Figure).

On 30 Jun 2014, 2 days after patient A became ill, patient B, a female veterinary clinic employee, developed a fever and cough and visited an urgent care facility, where bronchitis was diagnosed. She reported close contact with the ill dog on 24-25 Jun 2014. After her symptoms failed to improve with self-initiated amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, patient B visited an emergency department on 5 Jul 2014, received a diagnosis of pneumonia, and was treated with azithromycin, with improvement over the next several days. After notification on 10 Jul 2014 of her exposure to plague, she visited a health care provider and was treated with oral levofloxacin. A polymerase chain reaction test on a sputum specimen was positive for _Y. pestis_. Subsequent testing of paired acute and convalescent serum specimens demonstrated a 4-fold increase in antibody titers to _Y. pestis_, indicative of recent infection (Table).

Patient C, a female veterinary clinic employee, also had close contact with the dog on 24-25 Jun 2014 and self-initiated a 6-day course of oral doxycycline on 25 Jun 2014. On 4 Jul 2014, she experienced fever, chills, myalgia, and fatigue; symptoms progressed to chest tightness and cough. Following notification of the exposure to plague on 9 Jul 2014, patient C self-initiated a second course of doxycycline and was medically evaluated later that day. Crackles were heard during chest auscultation; however, results of a chest radiograph were normal. A full course of oral doxycycline was continued with resolution of symptoms. Initial and follow-up serum specimens tested positive for antibody to _Y. pestis_, with a greater than fourfold decrease in antibody titers at follow-up 6 months later (Table).

On 4 Jul 2014, patient D, a woman who was a close contact of patient A, experienced chest tightness, dyspnea, and fever. She was evaluated at an emergency department, received a diagnosis of pneumonia, and was treated with oral levofloxacin. Patient D handled the body of the dog on 25 Jun 2015 after it died, at one point getting blood on her hands. She also had extended close contact with patient A on 29-30 Jun 2014 while he was coughing bloody sputum. On 8 Jul 2014, after patient A was identified with pneumonic plague, patient D was hospitalized and treated with levofloxacin and streptomycin. Paired acute and convalescent serum specimens for patient D demonstrated a greater than 4-fold increase in antibody titers to _Y. pestis_ (Table).

Public health response
----------------------
TCHD evaluated potential exposures from each patient and conducted an environmental assessment to determine the risk for further disease transmission. Case status was assigned according to case definitions developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists for CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.

Medical personnel and personal contacts of all 4 patients were notified of their possible exposure to plague. A total of 114 persons had close contact with the dog or one or more of the human patients: 36 in veterinary settings, 58 in human health care settings, and 20 as close personal contacts. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended for 88 persons interviewed within 7 days of exposure. The remaining 26 were advised to monitor for fever for 7 days and to seek medical attention immediately if symptoms occurred.

On 9 Jul 2014, TCHD surveyed patient A's property for evidence of plague. Live rabbits were observed on the property but no other wildlife. Inactive prairie dog burrows were present; however, it was reported that the prairie dog colony had been intentionally eradicated in October 2013.

CDPHE issued press releases for public awareness and Health Alert Network notifications to health care providers and veterinarians on 9, 10, and 18 Jul 2014. Medical facilities were instructed to use droplet precautions for persons with suspected plague. TCHD staff members distributed information on plague symptoms and transmission risk to homes in the vicinity of the index patient. No further cases have been identified.

Discussion
----------
Plague is a rare but life-threatening zoonosis caused by _Y. pestis_. A median of 8 cases of human plague are reported annually in the USA (3), primarily among residents of semirural areas in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and California. Normally a pathogen of rodents, _Y. pestis_ is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected rodent fleas or direct contact with the tissues or secretions of infected animals.

Bubonic plague, characterized by fever and painful regional lymphadenopathy, results from percutaneous exposure and accounts for approximately 85 percent of reported cases. Pneumonic plague occurs as either a complication of untreated bubonic plague (10-13 percent of all cases) or as a primary pneumonia following inhalation of infectious droplets (2 percent of all cases) (4). Untreated pneumonic plague has a fatality rate of 93 percent or more and can be spread from person to person through aerosols generated during coughing. A 3rd clinical form, septicemic plague, is characterized by fever and shock without localizing signs or symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis of plague is based on culture or polymerase chain reaction assays of blood, sputum, or lymph node aspirates, or on serology. Effective therapy includes aminoglycosides and doxycycline. In addition, the fluoroquinolones levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have been approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration based on animal studies. The advent of antimicrobial therapy has reduced overall plague mortality from more than 60 percent to approximately 16 percent (3,5,6).

In this outbreak, all 4 patients had laboratory-confirmed plague, including 3 patients (A, B, and D) with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. The 4th patient (C) had an atypical presentation with respiratory symptoms but no radiographic evidence of pneumonia, possibly as a result of partial treatment immediately after exposure. 3 patients (A, B and C) became ill shortly after exposure to an ill infected dog. The source of infection for patient D is less certain because she had exposure to both the dog on 25-26 Jun 2014 (an incubation period of 9-10 days) and to patient A on 29-30 Jun 2014 while he had hemoptysis (an incubation period of 5-6 days). The shorter incubation period is more typical of plague and therefore supports human-to-human transmission (6). Nevertheless, transmission from the dog cannot be excluded given the animal's role in the other 3 infections and because incubation periods of up to 10 days have been reported, although rarely (7). Primary pneumonic plague is rare in the USA with only 74 cases reported during 1900-2012, and this event represents the largest outbreak and the 1st instance of possible human-to-human transmission since an outbreak in Los Angeles in 1924 (3,5).

_Y. pestis_ infection in dogs generally is either asymptomatic or the cause of only a mild, self-limiting febrile illness (8). Dogs can play a role in human infection through transport of rodent fleas into the home (8,9). This outbreak began with illness in a pet dog, a previously unrecognized source of plague exposure in the USA. The only previously published case of direct transmission of plague from a dog to a human was reported from China in 2009 (10). Although symptomatic plague in dogs is rare, veterinarians should consider the possibility of _Y. pestis_ infection in ill dogs with wildlife exposure in areas where plague is endemic.

This outbreak is notable for the several factors that delayed its recognition. First, patient A's bacterial isolate initially was identified as _P. luteola_ by an automated blood culture system, and the correct identification of _Y. pestis_ was only made 7 days later. This delay resulted in the exposure of numerous medical personnel. Misidentification and a resulting delayed diagnosis have been previously reported, reinforcing the need for critical evaluation of results from automated systems and education of hospital microbiologists regarding this limitation (1,2). Among 12 _Y. pestis_ isolates obtained from patients in the USA during 2010-2013, at least 3 (25 percent) were originally misidentified by automated systems (Division of Vector-borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, CDC, unpublished data, 2015). Second, the spectrum of disease was broader than usual for pneumonic plague (7), with 2 of the 4 patients not requiring hospitalization. The clinical course of the milder cases might have been modified by self-administration of antimicrobials or medical prescription of azithromycin, an antibiotic not recommended for plague. Pneumonia is the only form of plague with the potential for human-to-human transmission. Delayed recognition because of inaccurate laboratory test results and atypical clinical presentations can lead to high numbers of potential exposures to health care workers, laboratory workers, and other close contacts.

Although human plague is rare in North America, it remains a public health concern in the western USA where _Y. pestis_ circulates among wild rodent populations. The risk for plague can be minimized by avoidance of possibly infected rodents (such as prairie dogs) and their fleas. All suspected or confirmed plague cases and rodent die-offs in areas where plague is endemic should be reported immediately to public health officials so that exposures can be minimized to prevent additional transmission. Once plague is suspected, appropriate precautions and treatment should be initiated immediately, and clinical specimens should be collected and tested as soon as possible. Early recognition of plague, especially the pneumonic form, is critical to effective clinical management and a timely public health response. Veterinarians should consider plague in the differential diagnosis of ill domestic animals, including dogs, in areas where plague is endemic.

This detailed description of the mid-2014 outbreak of pneumonic plague in Adams County, Colorado, just north and east of the Denver metropolitan area, was covered by ProMED when it was occurring. It is particularly important for several points:
- the number of cases that occurred
- the source being a canine
- the initial misidentification of the isolate using an automated diagnostic system, and
- the possibility of the 1st human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague in the USA since 1924.

To understand the pneumonic plague outbreak in Los Angeles in 1924, the reader is referred to a detailed description (Viseltear AJ: The pneumonic plague epidemic of 1924 in Los Angeles. Yale J Biol Med 1974; 1: 40-54; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2595158/pdf/yjbm00152-0044.pdf). The outbreak affected 28 Hispanics and 2 Caucasians during a 2 week period in the fall of 1924, during clearly the pre-antimicrobial era although plague anti-serum was used in the outbreak. The source of the outbreak, although initially blamed on flea-infected rats from the Los Angeles harbor, was thought to be 2 cases of bubonic plague, one of which was associated with secondary plague pneumonia, that occurred earlier in the month of October 1924 was probably of endemic origin like the Oakland, California cluster in 1919.

It is interesting that Viseeltear reports that "City health officers who released the story already had a confirmed diagnosis of pneumonic plague but chose for obvious reasons to refer to the disease, from 1 to 5 Nov 1924, as the "strange malady," "pneumonia," "virulent pneumonia," or "malignant pneumonia." Not until 6 Nov 1924, when the epidemic appeared to have run its course, did Los Angeles newspapers refer to the disease properly as pneumonic plague and even then justified this evasion by adding that pneumonic plague was the "technical term" for "malignant pneumonia."

"The New York Times and the Washington Post, however, were quick to headline that pneumonic plague had erupted in Los Angeles. Indeed, the news blackout was confined to Los Angeles as most major California newspapers reported the epidemic correctly." - Mod.LL]
