Some 200 people fell sick of food poisoning in Udaipur city and Vallabhnagar block on Monday [21 Jun 2021], reportedly after consuming sehgar (food eaten during fasting [not clear when the food is eaten likely after fasting, not during - Mod.LL]) made of Kangani flour [from Foxtail millet seeds - Mod.LL] on the occasion of Nirjala Ekadashi [an absolute fast day without partaking even water - Mod.LL].

Initially a few persons were admitted in the MB hospital on Monday [21 Jun 2021] late evening [the day of the fast]; gradually the number increased and reached 167 including 2 children by the next morning as more people began complaining of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Reports also came of over 2 dozen people fallen ill in Karanpur village of Vallabhnagar block.

"Of the total 167 people admitted, 23 have been discharged while 144 are still under treatment. Everyone is out of danger," Dr RL Suman, Superintendent of MB hospital said. He also said a large number of people observe fasting and rituals on Nirjala Ekadashi and eat snacks made of Kangani flour.

Perhaps the flour packets of a particular brand had crossed the expiration date and hence those who consumed it fell sick. Dr Dinesh Kharadi, the CMHO [Chief Medical and Health Officer], said teams are reaching out to households in rural areas to find out if there are people affected.

Teams of the medical department and district supply office held sudden inspections in the Dhanmandi area and checked edible stocks of retailers and wholesalers. Samples of edible items were collected from 3 retailers and one wholesaler, which have been sent to the laboratory.

"Majority of the people who suffered food poisoning hail from the walled city areas like Hathipole, Jagdish Chowk, and Ghantaghar. Their condition is stable now, and they are receiving good treatment. A detailed medical report would be submitted by the hospital administration" said the Deputy Minister (DM). The DM also said medical teams have started sample collections from shops of all the areas where the residents fell ill. On Tuesday [22 Jun 2021], the administration received reports of some 30 persons affected by food poisoning in Karanpur village of Vallabhnagar block.

[The timing between the ingestion of the suspected vehicle of transmission of the illness and the beginning of symptoms is not entirely clear. Whether this is a foodborne infection -- either bacterial, viral, or otherwise -- or if the cause was a chemical or toxic component is also not known. - Mod.LL
