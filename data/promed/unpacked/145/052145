80 die in Tajik typhoid epidemic, official says

ALMATY, March 26 (Reuter) - A senior Tajik health official
said on Wednesday the former Soviet republic has been unable to
stop the spread of a typhoid epidemic which had claimed the
lives of at least 80 people.
He said more than 80 people have died in Dushanbe hospitals
alone, and said there had been about 10 000 cases of typhoid
since the beginning of year.
"The total number of dead is probably much higher as many
cases have not been registered in rural areas," he said.
The epidemic started with contaminated drinking water which
in Dushanbe has not been chlorinated for four months.
Bob McKerrow, head of the International Federation of the
Red Cross's regional office in Central Asia, based in
Kazakhstan,.... said warmer weather in the remote, mountainous
republic bordering Afghanistan threatens to increase infection.

"The epidemic seems to have reached its peak and appears to
be levelling," said McKerrow, who added there were about 100
new cases a day. "But it's likely to rise again in May and
June," he said.
Tajikistan, emerging tentatively from a bitter four-year
civil war, closed schools in Dushanbe last month in an effort to
halt the spread of the disease.
