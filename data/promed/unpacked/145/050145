More cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever are being found statewide
this summer [2009] over the same period in 2008. The Tennessee
Department of Health reports 65 confirmed cases of the tick-borne
disease in the 1st half of 2009, up from 46 in 2008. WKRN-TV quoted
Dr. John Williams at Vanderbilt University's Monroe Carrell
Children's Hospital as saying 2 patients there have died from the
illness. Williams says while he has seen deaths in past years, having
2 in one year is unusual.

Williams also said the hospital is seeing more of the infections and
more serious infections this summer [2009]. Williams said parents
should check their children routinely for ticks and tell their doctor
if a child who had one develops a fever, headaches and, sometimes, a
rash.

[It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to
minimize morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in areas
such as the midwestern USA, where the disease is uncommon. The time
frame in this case is not clear.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing
human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from
grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After
crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site
(wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she
attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes as many as 24 hours to activate
and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or
twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease
transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or
beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick
exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is
generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the
headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in
day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles
before becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles
as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not
seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low
if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days
of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people
with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring
and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common
vector for this infection, can be seen at
