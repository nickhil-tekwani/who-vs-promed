In the largest outbreak ever reported in the USA of blastomycosis, a fungal infection with flulike symptoms, 55 people in central Wisconsin became sick in 2010.

The fungus that causes blastomycosis is commonly found in soil, but exactly what triggered the spike in cases in Marathon County remains a mystery, according to a new report from the CDC and Wisconsin health officials. Unlike a blastomycosis outbreak in a neighboring Wisconsin county in 2006, in which a pile of waste in a large yard was the likely source, the culprit in this episode remains elusive.

"We didn't find evidence for a single source in the environment that could explain all the cases," said Kaitlin Benedict, an epidemiologist with the CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch, who was involved in the research. "We think there were probably multiple 'hot spots' for the fungus in several different neighborhoods."

It's also unclear why infection rates among Asians, particularly those of Hmong descent, were about 12 times higher than non-Asians, the report said. Some 45 percent of people affected by the outbreak were of Hmong ethnicity. This group is originally from Southeast Asia, but many of those who became sick in the outbreak had been living in Wisconsin for more than a decade, according to the report.

The large number of cases among the Hmong was one of the most surprising things about this outbreak, Benedict said. "This is the 1st known report of Asians being disproportionately affected" by the fungal illness, she said, adding that previous studies have shown high blastomycosis rates among African-Americans in other USA states. The report was published online (3 Jun 2013) in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.

Benedict said the exact reasons why Hmong people were at higher risk for falling ill in this outbreak were unclear.

The fungus _Blastomyces dermatitidis_ lives in the soil typically in the Midwest and Southeast US. Its spores are found near decaying leaves and wood, where they can be inhaled and cause lung infections.

In the report, the CDC investigators explain they were called in to figure out why Marathon County residents were seeing a spike in the number of reported cases of blastomycosis. State health officials also noticed that cases seemed to be clustered together geographically, in specific neighborhoods and in certain households.

Investigators found that during the 10-month period between September 2009 and June 2010, 55 people in the county became infected with _Blastomyces dermatitidis_, most of whom were adults. 2 deaths occurred during the outbreak, and 30 people were hospitalized.

Slightly more males than females became ill, and nearly one-quarter of the people who had the fungal infection had pre-existing health conditions, such as lung disease, cancer or diabetes.

Still, "we could not identify any activities or exposures that put people at increased risk," Benedict said.

Other research had suggested that people who got sick from blastomycosis were probably exposed to the fungus while participating in outdoor recreational or work-related activities. But investigators did not find that Asians were not more likely to camp, fish, hike, hunt, or hold jobs that put them at increased risk compared with people unaffected by the outbreak.

It's possible that the Hmong fell victim to this fungal outbreak because of genetic differences that involve the immune response, Benedict said. She explained that previous studies have shown that people with these types of genetic differences are more susceptible to the severe forms of other fungal diseases that are similar to blastomycosis.

The Marathon County outbreak ended after July 2010, when the number of cases tapered off. Researchers suspect that weather-related changes, such as rainfall and temperature shifts, lessened the amount of fungal growth and brought about the end.

The Hmong are an Asian ethnic group from the mountainous regions of China, Viet Nam, Laos, and Thailand.

The abstract of the paper by Roy M, Benedict K, Deak E, et al: A large community outbreak of blastomycosis in Wisconsin with geographic and ethnic clustering. Clin Infect Dis 2013; doi: 10.1093/cid/cit366 is shown below
(http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/06/27/cid.cit366.abstract):

"Blastomycosis is a potentially life-threatening infection caused by the soil-based dimorphic fungus _Blastomyces dermatitidis_, which is endemic throughout much of the Midwestern USA. We investigated an increase in reported cases of blastomycosis that occurred during 2009-2010 in Marathon County, Wisconsin.

Case detection was conducted using the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS). WEDSS data were used to compare demographic, clinical, and exposure characteristics between outbreak-related and historical case patients, and to calculate blastomycosis incidence rates. Because initial mapping of outbreak case patients' homes and recreational sites demonstrated unusual neighborhood and household case clustering, we conducted a 1:3 matched case-control study to identify factors associated with being in a geographic cluster.

Among the 55 patients with outbreak-related cases, 33 (70 percent) were hospitalized, 2 (5 percent) died, 30 (55 percent) had cluster-related cases, and 20 (45 percent) were Hmong. The overall incidence increased significantly since 2005 (average 11 percent increase per year, p less than .001), and incidence during 2005-2010 was significantly higher among Asians than non-Asians (2010 incidence: 168 vs 13 per 100 000 population). 30 of the outbreak cases grouped into 5 residential clusters. Outdoor activities were not risk factors for blastomycosis among cluster case patients or when comparing outbreak cases to historical cases.

This outbreak of blastomycosis, the largest ever reported, was characterized by unique household and neighborhood clustering likely related to multifocal environmental sources. The reasons for the large number of Hmong affected are unclear, but may involve genetic predisposition."

_Blastomyces dermatitidis_ is a dimorphic fungus endemic in the USA.

Dimorphic fungi exist in the environment (at ambient temperature) as a mold and in its animate host (at body temperature) as a yeast. As with _Histoplasma capsulatum_ and _Coccidioides immitis_, _B. dermatitidis_ has endemic areas in the USA (or elsewhere) with primary infection in the lungs due to inhalation of spores, which is often subclinical. Each fungus can sometimes disseminate outside the lungs, especially in immunoincompetent hosts. The ethnic differential in cases among the Hmong people is somewhat reminiscent of the increased risk of serious disease with coccidioidomycosis in people of Filipino heritage as compared to Caucasians.

The endemic area of blastomycosis is less well defined as that of the other 2 dimorphic fungi but, based on sporadic cases or clusters of infection in humans and/or dogs, appears to primarily consist of the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys of the south central and Midwestern USA, as well as the area on both sides of the St Lawrence River involving both the USA and Canada. Of note, north central Wisconsin, the location of Marathon County, has been the source of a number of reported clusters of this infection.

The tissue form of this infection is a characteristic yeast with a refractile cell wall and single broad-based budding (see image at http://a.espncdn.com/winnercomm/outdoors/sportingdogs/i/P2_sd_col_Bartges_blastomy2.jpg). - Mod.LL]
