Date production falls in Khairpur
---------------------------------
Khairpur [district, Sindh province] that produces 700 000 tonnes of
dates is facing a downtrend in its local economy as the sowing of
date palm trees is increasing but the production is decreasing.
Khairpur produces 45 kinds of dates and 85 percent of Pakistani
dates. Production of dates is decreasing due to multiple diseases,
which are causing problems for the date growers.

Date research centres have failed to increase production of dates.
The cultivation of dates increased annually but the Date Research
Institute has done little to enhance production and exports and find
a solution for the date diseases. [A date growers representative]
lauded the efforts of the Date Research Institute of Shah Abdul Latif
University Khairpur for introducing tissue culture of dates.

Chief minister of Sindh, Syed Qaim Ali Shah, inaugurated the
international date exhibition in Khairpur and said this land is
fertile and has potential. Growers and exporters of Khairpur
reiterated upon the President and the prime minister of Pakistan to
establish a well equipped date research institute and date processing zone.

[The date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is a vital staple food for the
inhabitants of desert and arid lands. It originates in northern
Africa and southwest Asia where it is a traditional crop, but today
it is cultivated in most hot, dry regions throughout the world. Trees
can live for more than 100 years. A large number of fungi and a
number of other pathogens, as well as several diseases of unknown
etiology have been reported for this crop.

Date palm production is facing serious problems worldwide, including
lack of research, pests, and spread of diseases. Over the last
decade, productivity of the crop has declined in the traditional
growing areas. As much as 30 percent of production may potentially be
lost as a result of disease and pests. A Global Date Palm Network was
established by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United
Nations (FAO) to promote research and exchange of information.

In Pakistan, undiagnosed diseases were reported to affect date palm
yields in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20080730.2323). While these problems
still appear to be as serious as before, the establishment of a
tissue culture programme for date palm reported here will provide a
useful tool for crop improvement and could be used to produce disease
free planting material for the country in the future.
