Since an anthrax outbreak was reported in the Chobe area last week, 9 wild
animals have died. Department of Wildlife and National Parks officials told
a heads of department meeting in Kasane that samples taken from the
carcasses of 2 elephants for analysis proved positive. Principal Wildlife
Officer Lucas Rutina said elephants, zebras and buffaloes were found dead
last week. Rutina said the mortality rate was likely to rise as the disease
was expected to spread before the rainy season.
District Wildlife Coordinator Goitseone Lebonetse said his office was
taking steps such as proper disposal of carcasses found at Ihaha in the
Chobe National Park and Muchenje in the west of the Chobe enclave, to
control its spread. Lebonetse said the department had asked for a
helicopter to help them carry out further investigations in affected areas
and were embarking on public education campaigns. "We intend to intensify
our public awareness programme and warn people to desist from criminal
activities as some might be tempted to dig up elephant carcasses for their
tusks. It [is] an offence to be found in possession of ivory without
authority", he warned. Also as a means of containing the disease, vehicles
and people living in the affected areas would be disinfected.
He urged the community to assist by reporting all dead animals in the Chobe
region to the nearest wildlife office and advised them not to eat, touch or
collect any product from an animal found dead in the region.
The first outbreak was in September 2004 and by December, a total of 848
mortalities were recorded, with buffaloes at 85 per cent and 9 per cent for
elephants. A lion, warthog and a honey badger were also recorded in that
year's outbreak. Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by the sore-forming
_Bacillus anthracis_. It is primarily a disease of herbivores but humans
can be infected by anthrax if they come into contact with the infected
animal, carcass or material.

[With so many affected in 2004 it is not unlikely that there was some
residual soil contamination to hit the park animals once any immunity from
that epidemic had worn off. Cases in elephants, zebras and buffalo reflect
a variety of ecosystems. Background information has been requested from
Botswana. - Mod.MHJ.] [Chobe National Park is in the far northern corner of
