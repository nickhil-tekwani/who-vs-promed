First Report of a Leaf Blight of Onion Caused by _Xanthomonas_ spp. in Georgia.
FH Sanders, DB Langston Jr., JH Brock, and RD Gitaitis, Department of Plant
Pathology, University of Georgia, Coastal Plain Experiment Station, Tifton
31793; DE Curry, University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service, Lyons
30436; and RL Torrance, University of Georgia Cooperative Extension
Service, Reidsville 30453. Plant Dis. 87:749, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-0409-02N, 2003. Accepted for publication 16 March 2003.
In October of 2001 and 2002, a leaf blight was reported affecting Vidalia
onion (_Allium cepa_) cvs. Pegasus and Sweet Vidalia, respectively, in one
field each. Lesions on onion seedlings began as a water-soaked, tip dieback
that gradually blighted the entire leaf. Symptoms on onion transplants
appeared as elongated, water-soaked lesions that typically collapsed at the
point of initial infection.
In both cases, disease was very severe on seedlings, and disease incidence
was 50 percent or more in both fields. Warm temperatures combined with
overhead irrigation and above average rainfall likely enhanced the
severity and spread of disease. Disease was not detected on more mature
onions once cool, dry conditions occurred later in the season, and no
significant economic loss occurred.
Seed was tested from seed lots of the aforementioned cultivars and
_Xanthomonas_ spp. were not found. Diseased tissue was macerated in
sterile, phosphate-buffered saline, and 10 microliters of the resulting
suspension was streaked on nutrient agar plates. Yellow-pigmented,
gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria were isolated routinely from diseased
tissue. Bacteria were catalase-positive, cellulolytic, oxidase-negative,
amylolytic, proteolytic, and utilized glucose in an oxidative manner.
Analysis of whole cell, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) using the Microbial
Identification System (MIS, Sherlock version 3.1; MIDI, Inc., Newark, DE)
identified four representative strains of the bacterium as a pathovar of
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ (similarity indices 0.75 to 0.83). Known
_Xanthomonas_ spp. from onion from Colorado and Texas (1,2) had similar
FAME profiles when analyzed by the MIDI system.
Onion plants were grown under greenhouse conditions for 2 months and
inoculated by injecting the base of a quill with 1.0 ml of bacterial
suspensions (10 million CFU /ml) of the _Xanthomonas_ sp. isolated from
Georgia, and negative controls were inoculated with 1 ml of sterile water.
Disease symptoms developed on plants inoculated with bacterial suspensions
in 4 to 7 days and _Xanthomonas_ sp. was isolated from the lesions
produced. Disease symptoms occurred when the same suspension was sprayed on
onion foliage. No symptoms occurred on plants inoculated with 1 ml of
sterile water.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of _Xanthomonas_ spp. affecting
Vidalia onions.

[The identity of the pathovar associated with the current outbreak of onion
leaf blight remains to be determined. Do any of our readers have
information on this point? Please let me know.
According to plant pathologists at Colorado State University, Xanthomonas
leaf blight of onion caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ was first reported
in Hawaii in 1975 and was subsequently reported as a yield limiting disease
in Colorado in 2000. Annual yield losses due to the pathogen exceeded 17
percent in southern Colorado, and entire crop failures have occurred in
other production areas. Disease management involves use of bactericides. -
