An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in New York City's Bronx borough has left 1 dead and 18 sick, 8 of whom are currently hospitalized, the city's health department said [Wed 25 May 2022].

The cases are clustered in the Bronx's Highbridge neighborhood, and officials have identified 4 water cooling towers in the area that were positive for _Legionella pneumophila_, the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease. They are working to disinfect them now.

"We are saddened to hear about a death in a person who contracted Legionnaires," said Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan in a press release. "Health Department staff are working to ensure that buildings in the cluster area are treated and conditions remediated quickly."

Legionnaires' disease is a potentially deadly type of pneumonia that comes from the _Legionella_ bacteria. The germ does not spread from person to person -- rather, people contract legionnaires' [disease] from breathing in the bacteria, often from mist and the water dripping from air conditioning units.

Signs of Legionnaires' disease include flu-like symptoms, cough, fever and difficulty breathing. The disease is easily treated with antibiotics if caught early, but if left too long it could become fatal.

"While most people exposed to the bacteria do not get sick, Legionnaires' disease can cause severe illness or be fatal for those at higher risk, including people with pre-existing chronic health issues," Vasan said. "That's why it's crucial that you seek health care as soon as you experience flu-like symptoms."

There are around 200 to 700 cases of Legionnaires' disease reported in New York City each year, The New York Times reported, but clusters like this one are more infrequent. The last one was in 2018 when an outbreak in Upper Manhattan sickened 18 and left one dead. The city's largest outbreak occurred in 2015 when 138 people in the Bronx developed the disease and 16 died.

The city's health department said on [Wed 25 May 2022] that anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms or other signs of Legionnaires' should contact their physician "immediately."

[The news report above says that the number of cases of legionnaires' disease in the Highbridge neighborhood in the Bronx (New York City) has increased to 19, including 1 death.

Highbridge (pop., 37 727 residents in 2010) is a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of the Bronx, located between the Cross-Bronx Expressway (I-95) to the north, Jerome Avenue to the east, Macombs Dam Bridge to the south, and the Harlem River to the west (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highbridge,_Bronx). A map showing the location of Highbridge can be seen at https://goo.gl/maps/GqQZ2VZRSWsWbvQx8. Yankee Stadium is on its southeast boundary.

Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually through inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease has also been described by Correia et al. (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing systems by showerheads, sink faucets, misters, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, car-wash facilities, as well as a building's cooling towers (structures that contain water and a fan as part of centralized air cooling systems), and even wastewater treatment plants. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Genotyping the isolates from patients with legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates with that of clinical isolates (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). We will await further findings from the investigation.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L. pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems --usually done by culture-- would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249). - Mod.ML
