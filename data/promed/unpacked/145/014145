Epidemiological comments: Emergency vaccination against FMD was
started on 22 May 2010. The targets of the vaccination are all
domestic susceptible animals kept in unaffected farms in movement
control areas established within 10 km around each affected farm.
Vaccination against FMD has been prohibited outside the areas, as it
was before. As of 25 May 2010, the total number of vaccinated animals
is approximately 120 000, which is about 95 percent of the targets.
All the vaccinated animals are clearly identified and to be destroyed.

Control measures
Measures applied: Stamping out, Quarantine, Movement control inside
the country, Screening, Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s) Vaccination: prohibited [This prohibition
is related to preventive vaccination or vaccinated in response to
outbreak. The "vaccination to cull" currently applied in Japan, meant
to enable completion of stamping out while preventing virus spread,
is a unique, novel procedure which is not included among the control
measures described in OIE's International Animal Health Code. -
Mod.AS]. No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

[Compared to 7 outbreaks confirmed on 24 May 2010, 9 on 25 May 2010,
and 9 on 26 May 2010, it is hoped that today's [27 May 2010] apparent
decrease (3 new outbreaks), combined with ring vaccination almost
completed, may herald the epizootic to have peaked. - Mod.AS]
