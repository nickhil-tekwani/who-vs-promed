Babesiosis in California - comment.
-------------------------------------
An as yet still unnamed _Babesia_ parasite was isolated from big horn sheep
in California (Goff et al, 1993. J. of Eukaryotic Microbiology, 40:237-243)
and mule deer (Thomford et al, 1993. J. of Parasitology, 79:77-84). The
California human babesiosis cases are not identified (Moss, 1990, New
Jersey Medicine, 87:291-294) but have been investigated by Dr. Pat Conrad
at UC-Davis and others. Dr. Pat Holman at Texas A & M has been cooperating
with Dr. Conrad, and the DNA comparisons between the Texas _Babesia
odocoilei_ and the California parasite are very close. The main point was
to correct the statement about _Babesia microti_ in deer. Thank you for
your consideration.

The following background data on babesiosis in the United States were
extracted from GIDEON <http://www.cynifo.com>:
Babesiosis was first diagnosed in the United States in 1968. Most cases are
reported from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Wisconsin and
Connecticut. Occasional cases are reported from Maryland, Virginia, New
Jersey and Georgia.
_Babesia microti_ accounts for most cases, but _B. equi_ may cause human
disease in California, and _B. divergens_ in Missouri (implicated in single
fatal case).
- A genetically-distinct strain of _B. microti_ is enzootic to _Microtus
oeconomus_ and _Clethrionomys rutulis_ in coastal Alaska.
- Infection due to unnamed species has been reported in Washington State
(_Babesia_ WO1), California (_Babesia_ CA1) and Missouri (_Babesia_ MO1).
Most infections due to these new species have occurred among splenectomized
individuals; whereas 95% of _B. microti_ infections are reported in persons
with intact spleens.
The vector in the northeast is _Ixodes scapularis_ (_I. dammini_), and the
usual reservoir is the white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_).
21 cases of post-transfusion infection were reported during 1980 to 1997.
- 139 patients were hospitalized for babesiosis in New York State during
1982 to 1993 - 9 of these infections were fatal.
- 160 cases were reported in Nantucket during 1969 to 1998.
- Seroprevalence in blood donors on Shelter Island (Suffolk County, eastern
Long Island) was 4.3 percent in May 1998.
- Babesiosis was first identified in Rhode Island in 1994 - the state
average was ca. 2 cases per year during 1994 to 1999.

[Although rare, babesiosis is also in the differential diagnosis of
tick-borne infections acquired in California. _Babesia_ and _Borrelia
burgdorferi_, the cause of Lyme disease, are both transmitted by ticks and
an increase in the tick population is likely to result in an increase in
babesiosis as well as in Lyme disease. -Mod.EP
