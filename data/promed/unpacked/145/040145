Residents in a small rural Canterbury town have been struck down with gastroenteritis after drinking contaminated water. More than 110 cases have been recorded at Darfield Medical Centre, one week after Selwyn District Council issued a boil-water notice after _Escherichia coli_ was found in the Waimakariri River. 6 of the notifications have already been confirmed as _Campylobacter_, a food and waterborne disease that causes vomiting and diarrhea.

The council has since fixed its deep underground bore system, and water supplies were declared safe to drink on 21 Aug 2012.
Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, Dr Alistair Humphrey says gastroenteritis can easily spread from one person to another.
Dr Humphrey says people with gastroenteritis need to rest and keep well hydrated.

"It is helpful to have small sips often, every 5 to 10 minutes. Even if the patient is vomiting they are still likely to absorb some water. After 12-24 hours and if vomiting has stopped, patients should try eating small amounts of food." He advised people to be vigilant in washing their hands to avoid it spreading, and for patients to stay away from school or work.
