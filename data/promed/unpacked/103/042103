Viet Nam: 16th Death from Avian Influenza Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
A 12-year-old boy has died from avian influenza virus infection in
Viet Nam, taking this year's death toll [in East Asia] to 24. Viet
Nam has been the worst-hit country, with 16 deaths now reported,
whereas 8 people have died in Thailand. News of the latest death
[goes against the] hopes of Hanoi officials to declare Viet Nam free
of bird flu by the end of March 2004.
The disease has devastated the Asian poultry industry and, whereas
countries such as China say [they are] now clear, experts warn of
future outbreaks. Cases of avian influenza have also been detected
elsewhere. Singapore suspended imports of poultry from the
Netherlands on Saturday after the disease was found there. [The
current disease outbreak in the Netherlands appears to be caused a
low pathogenicity strain of avian influenza (H5) virus, in contrast
to the highly pathogenic strain present in East Asia - see
ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza - Netherlands (04) 20040319.0775. -

Health officials in Viet Nam said the boy who died was found to have
been infected with the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus that has proved
lethal to humans. The child died in Tay Ninh, about 100 km (60 miles)
northwest of Ho Chi Minh City. A team of health experts is to travel
to the area to investigate how he contracted the disease and whether
other members of his family are ill, officials said.

[It is not clear whether this child was a previous
laboratory-confirmed case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection
or is a new case only diagnosed at death. Prior to this report, the
number of confirmed cases was 34; 12 in Thailand and 22 in Viet Nam.
