EU condemns France for lax curbs on BSE
---------------------------------------
By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in Brussels
The European Commission has published a highly critical report on the
failure of the French authorities to control a growing epidemic of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), casting serious doubts on France's claim
to have the disease under control.
The report, which describes a series of lax procedures that would be
unthinkable in Britain, comes a week after the decision by the European
Commission to take France to the European Court of Justice for its refusal
to lift its illegal ban on British beef. France claims that its hands are
tied by the recommendations of its independent food safety agency.
The country has reported 82 cases of BSE so far and recently announced its
third case of new-variant Creutzfeld-Jakob disease in humans. There have
long been allegations of under-reporting of BSE by the French authorities,
but this is the first time that the European Commission has taken a stand
on the matter.
The report found that inspections of suspect animals before slaughter were
performed by technicians rather than vets and emergency slaughters were
"not carried out at all during weekends and at night". This contrasts with
a rigorous enforcement regime in Britain, where a vet must be present in
all cases of emergency slaughter. A number of farmers has been prosecuted
for failing to comply, facing fines of up to Â£20,000.
The report, carried out by four EU vets from May 31 to June 4 last year,
found that "a number of potential BSE cases have entered emergency
slaughter without suspicion and consequent sampling". There was lax
compliance with rules demanding special certificates for possible BSE cases
and basic information on clinical signs was not collected. "In one case,
there were no records at all."
Animals suffering from neurological disorders were instantly diagnosed as
victims of non-BSE diseases, even though it was impossible for an untrained
observer to reach such a conclusion without doing follow-up checks over a
period of at least two weeks. "In some cases, listeriosis was assumed for
the final diagnosis, due to the sudden onset of the signs. The animals were
sent for emergency slaughter without additional investigations."
One animal with clear neurological signs of BSE was treated as having a
brain tumour and was dispatched "without further observation, treatment or
traditional examinations". The report said that the meat in such cases was
not incinerated, but was sold for human consumption. In violation of French
regulations, "veterinarians do not always follow the course of the disease,
and often rely on data given by the owner". There was no systematic
compliance with requirements to take blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid
from each "legitimate suspect".
The 200,000 French head of cattle that die before slaughter each year,
known as "fallen stock", were not considered as suspect and were admitted
into the food chain without further notice to the authorities. This
contrasts sharply with British practice, where cases of fallen stock are
treated as a potential risk and must be inspected by a vet.
The report said that French farmers were not provided with systematic
information to help detect BSE, relying only on videotapes. In the rare
instances when BSE was diagnosed, farmers displayed "a certain hesitation"
in informing the authorities and there was no evidence that the French
government was taking action to ensure proper reporting. Samplings of
French cattle feed showed that 4.2 per cent contained traces of meat and
bone meal, despite the EU-wide ban on the use of animal protein in cattle
feed, thought to be the original cause of the BSE epidemic. The French
government says this is the result of cross-contamination of meat and bone
feed given to pigs and poultry. But the British Ministry of Agriculture has
blamed similar, or lower, trace levels for the unexpected continuation of
BSE in Britain long after the 1989 feed ban. To ensure that there is no
such cross-contamination in Britain, the Government maintains a ban on meat
and bone meal for pigs and poultry, putting British farmers at a disadvantage.

[While there is an obvious British bias to this article on the EU Report,
the facts appear to be damning. When I was a meat inspector in 1962-63 for
the Canadian government the veterinarians were expected to routinely
inspect all live stock in the yards for any that might be sick. Plus all
emergency cases had to be inspected by the veterinarian on duty -- who
frequently put them down himself. It was not left to the lay staff, even
for obvious conditions such as a broken leg. If the reported problems in
France are as widespread as it seems, it raises the possibility of a policy
decision, whether stated or unstated. MHJ
