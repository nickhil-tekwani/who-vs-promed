Viroids of fruit trees are plant pathogens distributed worldwide and can
cause severe losses and economic damage to crops. A survey of fruit trees
was carried out in 17 orchards in the northern and Sahel regions of
Tunisia. Samples were collected in field trees of peach (_Prunus persica_
L), pear (_Pyrus communis_ L), and almond (_Prunus dulcis_ Mill.) that
showed symptoms potentially caused by viroids (leaf mosaic in peach,
blister canker in pear, and necrotic leaves in almond).
The investigation was conducted during May, September, and December 2003 to
screen for the presence of Pear blister canker viroid (PBCVd) on pear,
Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) on peach, and Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) on
the 3 plant species in naturally infected field trees. The detection method
was based on one-tube reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assays using a Titan kit (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany).
DNA amplification was obtained by using previously reported primer pairs
for PLMVd and HSVd (1,4).
For PBCVd, forward primer 5(prime) GTCTGAAGCCTGGGCGCTGG 3(prime) and
reverse primer 5(prime) CCTTCGTCGACGACGAGCCGAG 3(prime) were designed using
an available sequence (3). Positive controls included isolate D168 of PLMVd
(obtained from Dr. B. Pradier, Station de Quarantaine des Ligneux, Lempdes,
France) and propagated in GF 305 rootstock and HSVd (provided by Dr. R.
Flores, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y cellular de Plantas, Valencia,
Spain) propagated in cucumber.
The method described by Grasseau et al. (2), with some modifications, was
used to prepare the samples for RT-PCR. RT-PCR analysis of nucleic acid
preparations from leaves and bark of peach, pear, and almond showed that
PLMVd occurred in the northern and Sahel regions of Tunisia.
Of 37 peach trees tested, 12 were found infected with PLMVd. 2 pear trees
among 73 tested were infected with PBCVd. HSVd was detected in 2 of 11
almond, 1 of 37 peach, and 7 of 72 pear trees tested. One pear tree
infected with HSVd was also infected with PBCVd. Symptoms observed in fruit
trees were not consistently associated with the presence of viroids.
Nucleotide sequence analyses of cloned amplification products obtained
using the PBCVd, PLMVd, and HSVd primers confirmed a size of 315, 330, and
300 nt, respectively, and revealed a sequence similar to sequence variants
from other isolates previously characterized for each viroid. PBCVd was 99
percent identical with the P47A isolate variant 9 (GenBank Accession No.
Y18043); PLMVd shared 85 to 96 percent identity with the PC-C32 Italian
isolate of PLMVd from peach (GenBank Accession No. AJ550905), and HSVd
shared 99-100 percent identity with the HSVd from dapple plum fruit
(GenBank Accession No. AY460202).
To our knowledge, our investigation reports for the 1st time the occurrence
of PLMVd, PBCVd, and HSVd infecting fruit trees in Tunisia, stressing the
need for a certification program to aid in prevention and spread of fruit
tree viroids in this country.

[Viroids are uncapsidated, single-stranded RNAs of relatively low molecular
weight. They are composed only of a circular, single-stranded RNA molecule
of 240-400 nucleotides, much smaller than the genome of the smallest virus.
They cause disease in many plants of economic importance worldwide. Disease
management is based on prevention of viroid transmission, especially in
nursery production of viroid-free planting material. Strict measures must
be in place to reduce infestation of cutting tools and implements by using
chemical compounds to inactivate viroids. Only viroid-free stock should be
planted. However, cold treatment can be effective, e.g. storage at 4 C for
6 months or more, followed by apical shoot-tip-culture grafting, can be
used to eliminate HLVd. Pre-inoculation with protective mild strains of
viroids has proved effective to control PSTVd.
