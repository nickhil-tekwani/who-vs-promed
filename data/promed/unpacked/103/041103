An Australian region has been put on alert after an alarming number of rare bacterial disease cases were detected. Queensland Health has told residents in the electoral division of Wide Bay -- which includes Noosa, Maryborough, and Gympie -- that they should get vaccinated against the mysterious Q fever.

Health officials said there have been 11 locals found to have the disease in 2022, almost double the average of 5 to 7 cases for this point in the year over the previous 5 years.

The disease is caused by _Coxiella burnetii_ bacteria which can be carried by cattle, goats, sheep, and kangaroos and can be transferred to humans by direct contact or breathing dust contaminated by birth fluids, urine, or faeces. Other animals like foxes and even pets such as dogs and cats can also carry the disease though it's less common. Person-to-person transmission is even rarer but can happen.

Symptoms include high fever, chills, sweats, headaches, muscle and joint soreness, and extreme fatigue. Some cases can go on to develop a long-term chronic fatigue-like illness. The symptoms can resemble the flu, leading to a risk of the disease being undiagnosed, Queensland Health warned.

Pregnant women who become infected are at risk of dangerous pregnancy complications. And untreated patients could develop more severe forms that can lead to hepatitis, pneumonia, and inflammation of the heart called endocarditis. In very rare cases people have died from Q fever.

Wide Bay Public Health Unit Public Health Physician Dr Josette Chor said for those working with farm animals there is a 'highly effective' vaccine available. She also encouraged people doing jobs outdoors in the region such as mowing the lawn to wear a P2 filter mask.

[Q fever was first described in Australia, where this posting originates. It was called "Query fever" because the causative agent was initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that is resistant to heat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. The Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent.

Further discussion of Q fever can be found in my moderator comments in ProMED post Q fever - Russia: (RO) RFI 20220715.8704444.

The P2 rating for face masks is the standard in Australia and New Zealand similar to the US N95 mask rating. N95 and P2 masks look almost identical, and they filter out nearly the same amount of particles: 95% versus 94%, respectively. A chart that highlights what is the same and what isn't between the N95 and P2 masks can be found at https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/difference-between-n95-and-p2-masks/.

Queensland is a state located in northeastern Australia, the 2nd-largest and 3rd-most populous Australian state (pop, over 5.2 million residents, concentrated along the southeast coast); its capital and largest city is Brisbane, Australia's 3rd-largest city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland). - Mod.ML
