Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China - update
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Since March 2013, when the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection was 1st detected in humans, a total of 1567 laboratory-confirmed human cases, including at least 615 deaths (1), have been reported to WHO (Figure 1) [see URL for figures] in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005). In the latest wave (the 6th wave since Oct 2017), only 3 human cases have been detected; meanwhile there have been generally fewer A(H7N9) virus detections in poultry and environment samples, according to various reports from mainland China and China, Hong Kong SAR.

Public health response
----------------------
WHO has been monitoring the situation, and conducting risk assessments (2) through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), which comprises more than 150 institutions in 114 countries. These institutions actively and routinely exchange information and materials, e.g. reference viruses (seasonal, zoonotic and pandemic viruses), serology panels and reagents for risk assessment and development of countermeasures.

To support the global efforts on surveillance and preparedness for H7N9, genetic sequencing data have been shared consistently via GISAID (3) - a publicly accessible database for development of vaccines, diagnostics and risk assessment - since soon after the detection of A(H7N9) in China. Meanwhile, virus materials have been shared with GISRS to enable the development of high-growth viruses for vaccine development and production. In addition, shortly after the emergence of another avian influenza virus, in April 2017 China CDC began sharing the newly emerged strain with WHO Collaborating Centres, Essential Regulatory Laboratories and other laboratories, in order to update laboratory detection protocols, reference reagents and high-growth vaccine viruses. China CDC has completed or is processing all requests made for the A(H7N9) virus. So far there are 12 A(H7N9) high-growth viruses available through the WHO GISRS.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Although reports of virus detection have declined in poultry and the environment, while the virus still circulates, even at low levels, further human cases can be expected. Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of the A(H7N) virus is low.

WHO advice
----------
The influenza virus is constantly evolving. While a future pandemic is a certainty, when and where it will start, and which virus strain it will be, are all unknown. As such, surveillance, preparedness and response must be global, collective efforts. Information and virus sharing is vital to develop a rapid and effective response. WHO has published practical guidance on sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic potential - including A(H7N9) - in order to promote timely sharing in the evolving global context.

In recent years, the landscape, procedures and regulations for import and export of pathogens, including influenza, have become increasingly complex, and involve national authorities other than those that oversee public health (e.g. ministry of agriculture). The complex rules and regulations that govern virus sharing have constrained and slowed the sharing of viruses for some countries.

WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses of public health importance. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential.

All human infections caused by a new subtype of influenza virus are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). States Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.

Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the WHO GISRS, where WHO Collaborating Centres and public health laboratories fully characterize the viruses in order to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and develop candidate vaccine viruses, which are, in turn, used by industry and other institutions to manufacture life-saving vaccines.
