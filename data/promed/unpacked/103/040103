There are 7 suspected cases of yellow fever reported in the health zone of Kamonia, more precisely in the cities of Kamako and Kandjaji, located on the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola, in the territory of Tshikapa (Kasai).

This is according to the head of the National Border Hygiene Program (PNHF), Christian Mabed:

"We have already counted 7 suspected cases of yellow fever in the health areas of Kamako and Kandjaji in the health zone of Kamonia. Most of the suspect cases are people from Angola," he noted.

Samples have been taken and sent to the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) to confirm or rule out the cases.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that is spread through the bites of infected mosquitoes.

Symptoms of yellow fever (fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches) develop 3-6 days after infection. About 12% of people infected with yellow fever virus will develop severe illness that can lead to liver disease, bleeding, shock, organ failure, yellowing skin (jaundice), and sometimes death. Among those who develop severe disease, 30-60% die.

There is no medicine to treat or cure infection. To prevent getting sick from yellow fever, use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and get vaccinated.

[Yellow fever (YF) is endemic in both the DR Congo and Angola. It is not clear if the Angolan individuals suspected to have yellow fever (YF) acquired their infections in the DR Congo or Angola and subsequently traveled to the DR Congo while in the YF virus incubation period. The other non-Angolan individuals suspected of having YF, if positive, must have acquired their infection in the DR Congo. In that case, it is likely that all of the suspected cases have become infected in the DR Congo. With the suspected individuals coming from 2 health areas, if these individuals do have YF, that would be of concern indicating that active YF virus transmission is occurring in more than one geographic area. - Mod.TY
