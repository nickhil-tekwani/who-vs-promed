[Switzerland had 4 cases of BSE in 2005 and 4 more again in 2006.
They have had no further cases of BSE since 2006 reported to the OIE
WAHID database. However, BSE has become an epidemiologically sporadic
disease, and thus it is well within the disease pattern to see a
single case occur at this time. - Mod.PC]
