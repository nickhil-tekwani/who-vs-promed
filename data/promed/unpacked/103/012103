Testing after white grains found
--------------------------------
The discovery of 'white grains' in test samples have resulted in some
wheat loads being rejected at grain receival sites this [2010] harvest.

Grains Plant Pathologist Frank Henry said tests in Victoria suggested
the cause was a fungus. White grain disorder causes shrivelled,
light-weight grains that have a white chalky appearance, he said. The
disease has been found to have a minimal effect on the nutritional
value or starch content of wheat and research found no known toxic
effects when white grain disorder-affected wheat was fed to pigs.

Wet conditions, combined with high humidity at flowering and early
grain fill favour this disease. Little is known about this disease in
Australia or internationally.

Grain handlers have tested wheat containing 'white grains' at
receival centres along the east coast of Australia.

Other instances of white grains can be caused by fusarium head blight
and can produce toxins potentially harmful to animals or human
consumers. Mr Henry said to date no fusarium head blight had been
detected in Victoria.

[In 2008, the fungus _Botryosphaeria zeae_ was shown to be associated
with white grain disease of wheat in Queensland (see link below). No
mycotoxins seem to be produced by this infection, and the disease
also affects durum wheat. Although nutritional value of the crop does
not seem to be affected, the symptoms of bleached, shrivelled, light
weight grains cause the harvest to be downgraded in quality leading
to loss of income.

Fusarium head blight (FHB) of small grain cereals is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_
(current species classification, see link below). It can, amongst
other symptoms, cause similar white grains which may also be covered
in fungal growth. Since it is not possible to determine visually
which of the 2 diseases is present, and since FHB may lead to
mycotoxin contamination of harvested grain, testing of white grain
affected crops is essential.

_B. zeae_ was originally reported as the cause of grey ear rot of
maize. Other species in the genus can cause fruit rots and/or cankers
in several woody hosts, for example apple, grapevine, and eucalypts.
