Recalling the unknown disease that broke out at Bishnupur district in 2008/2009 and which claimed a number of lives, a medical expert has sounded an alert that the disease is now stalking the populace of Ukhrul district.

Talking to The Sangai Express, the medical expert, a doctor who preferred to remain anonymous, said that the disease is known as scrub typhus and added that he has personally come across around 20 such cases from Ukhrul district. The patient can be cured easily, but the watchword is early detection, he said and added that the schoolgirl who recently passed away in Ukhrul is a case in point.

"Many patients undergo testing for malaria and typhoid, but seldom undergo the test to detect scrub typhus," said the doctor and added that since the tests for malaria and typhoid return negative, the patients are thought to be suffering from viral fever. The symptoms are similar to malaria, typhoid, and viral fever, he said but added that patients suffering from scrub typhus typically carry a scar. The scar is caused by the bite of an insect, he said and added that it is important for the patient to inform the doctor of the presence of such a scar.

Domestic animals are the host carrier of these insects whose bite causes scrub typhus, he added. The test for scrub typhus is a simple procedure, he said and added that suspected patients should undergo the rapid scrub antibody test. The result can be known in a matter of some minutes, he said and added that once this is confirmed, the treatment can start with doxycycline drugs, which is fairly cheap and affordable. With the right treatment and at the right time, recovery rate is as high as 98 per cent, said the doctor and added that recovery process can start within 48 hours of the right medication.

Around 50 such cases were also reported from Senapati this year [2012], he said and added that a medical awareness camp held at the said district went a long way in effectively treating the patients. Awareness programme on the disease may be held at Ukhrul district, he suggested.

[The following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (12): (MH) fatal 20121109.1402125:

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic.
