Stomach flu in Nepal kills up to 177, sickens more than 12 000 since April
--------------------------------------------------
A stomach flu in Nepal has killed up to 177 people and sickened more
than 12 000 since Apr 2004, mostly residents in remote villages with
no access to modern medicine, health officials said Tue, 27 Jul 2004.
Gastroenteritis has affected 22 districts across the Himalayan
kingdom, the Department of Epidemiology and Disease Control said.
Symptoms of the waterborne disease include fever, nausea, cramps,
abdominal pain and diarrhea. The department said most of those killed
by the disease lived in remote mountainous districts, where there is
no access to modern medicine and villagers often rely on traditional
faith healers. Villagers can spend days or even weeks walking to the
nearest town with a doctor or health clinic.
Heavy rainfall in recent weeks has also made it difficult for people
to travel. Roads and trails in many areas have been either washed
away or blocked by landslides.
The Health Ministry said doctors and medicines have been sent to most
districts affected by the disease.

[3] Cholera ex Philippines & Typhoid - Taiwan

Typhus [typhoid?], cholera pose `no danger'
----------------------------------
1 case of cholera and 3 cases of typhus [based on the description
below, this is probably abdominal typhus, also more commonly referred
to as typhoid - Mod.LL] uncovered on Mon, 26 Jul 2004, in the
nation's south are being monitored but pose no danger to public
health, the Center for Disease Control said on Tue, 27 Jul 2004.
The center confirmed that 3 workers at a factory manufacturing
soy-bean sauce and ketchup in Pingtung County have been infected with
[typhoid] since early this month, Jul 2004, but were recovering in
hospital. The source of the infection remained uncertain, though it
was reported that the 3 patients had not been overseas.
The 13 other employees at the factory and the 3 patients' families
have also been cleared of infection. Officials yesterday said that
quarantine measures would be imposed on all parties until 20 Aug
2004. Wu Ping-fuai, director of the center's Division of Quarantine
and Intervention Activities, told the Taipei Times that the situation
is under control. About 30 cases of [typhoid] occur in Taiwan every
year. "Due to the lengthy incubation period of [typhoid], which is
2-4 weeks, the sources are difficult to confirm," Wu said. After
obtaining 3 negative test results, the patients will be declared
disease-free.
Food products manufactured at the factory prior to 15 Jun 2004 have
been tested by the Department of Health. Officials said that results
would be released by the next few days. "The situation is under
control because the [typhoid] did not occur in local communities," Wu
said.
Meanwhile, the department announced that a Taiwanese man who
contracted cholera in Manila remains hospitalized in Kaohsiung. It
the 1st case of cholera contracted overseas this year. The man is
reported to have eaten grilled seafood on Mon, 19 Jul 2004. The next
day, he suffered from acute diarrhea. The man reported his symptoms
when he returned to the country 21 Jul 2004. A diagnosis of cholera
was confirmed after an examination.

[4] Diarrhea - Bangladesh

Hospitals fill with diarrhea patients
-------------------------------------
The diarrhea outbreak has taken a serious turn in flood-hit areas,
and experts fear the worst will come when the floodwaters recede.
Sources at the International Centre for Diarrhea Diseases Research,
Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), popularly known as Mohakhali Cholera Hospital,
said 475 patients, most of them children, were admitted to the center
yesterday, Tue, 27 Jul 2004. On the previous day, the number was 441.
They said the number of diarrhea patients are increasing every day.
"This is already serious, but the diarrhea outbreak will peak in the
form of an epidemic as floodwaters recede," said Dr PK Bardhan, a
scientist at the ICDDR,B. He also said that an adequate supply of
pure drinking water in the affected areas is now urgently needed to
arrest spread of the waterborne disease.
The ICDDR,B has taken all preparations to handle the expected
increase of patients in the coming days. "We handled more than 900
patients a day during the 1998 flood. We are now capable of handling
even more patients if need be" said Ramzan Ali, hospital manager of
the ICDDR,B.
Most patients coming to the ICDDR'B for treatment are from
Rayerbazar, Khilgaon, Bashabo, Badda Kuril, Demra, Beraid, Malibagh,
Shantibagh, Mohammadpur and Keranigonj. Shishu Hospital also reported
a 15-20 percent increase in diarrhoea patients this week compared to
last week.
The hospital authorities also said they have made every preparation
to face the post-flood attack of diarrhea and other related diseases.
The flood shelters are hit hard by the disease because of a dearth of
drinking water. Hospitals and clinics are flooding with an increased
number of diarrhea patients every day. The situation has turned even
worse as sewerage water has [become backed up] over almost 1/3 of the
city, escaping into water pipelines and reservoirs. Although Water and
[Though the] Sewerage Authority (Wasa) has been supplying drinking
water through its mobile teams at 14 points, the effort is inadequate
to serve the large number of people affected in 56 wards. As a result
many flood-hit people are compelled to drink contaminated water.

Cholera claims 4 lives in Nawab Shah
----------------------------------------
At least 4 children were killed by the cholera epidemic in various
areas of Nawab Shah.
Tehsil Daulatpur and Shahpur Jehanian are amongst the most affected
areas, where a 2-year-old, a 3-year-old, a 1-year-old and a
1-1/2-year-old infant became victims of the deadly disease.
[Residents] lamented that no medicine to cure the patients was
available at local hospitals and medical centres and that not a
single medical team was sent to the area to ascertain the damage
caused by the disease.

Cholera downs dozens in Chad
-------------------------------
An outbreak of cholera in Chad has killed 50 people and infected
almost 700 in the Central African state since the beginning of Jun
2004, a health ministry official said on Thu, 29 Jul 2004.
"To date we have registered 696 cases, including 50 deaths," the
official said. "The outbreak is in Ndjamena and the surrounding area
as well as in the Lake Chad and Kanem regions to the west of the
capital."
The previous cholera outbreak in Chad was in 2001, when more than
3500 cases were registered and 113 people died, according to the WHO.
"We're not panicking because we have taken all measures needed by
opening an equipped centre to take in all those sick with cholera,"
the health ministry's secretary general Hassan Mahamad Hassan told
reporters.
