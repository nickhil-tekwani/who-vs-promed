------------------------
Rates of scrub typhus [ST] in Thailand have been increasing dramatically since the 1970's. In fact, the reported incidence of ST [arrow] in this country is now higher than those of hepatitis A, leptospirosis, melioidosis, typhoid and even shigellosis (chart A, below).

Among Asian countries, only South Korea reports higher rates of ST (chart B), and the disease is currently more common in Thailand than are comparable rickettsial diseases in the United States and in my own country [Israel] (chart C).

In preparing these figures, I was also struck by the similarity in numbers of fatal ST cases reported in Thailand vs. fatal RMSF cases in the United States (chart D). [1-3] (See graphs at https://www.gideononline.com/2018/01/20/scrub-typhus-thailand/.)

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Steve Berger for providing this contribution.

Since 2010, cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) have been reported in the U.S. under a new category called spotted fever rickettsiosis (SFR), which includes RMSF and clinically less severe rickettsioses, including _Rickettsia parkeri_ rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, and rickettsialpox, because commonly available serologic tests are unable to differentiate between spotted fever group _Rickettsia_ species. As a result, it is unclear how many of the SFR cases are RMSF, and how many result from other, less severe spotted fevers. The U.S. CDC suggests that inclusion of less severe spotted fevers likely leads to the lower case fatality rates, which have been less than 1.0 percent since 2001 (https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/index.html). - Mod.ML
