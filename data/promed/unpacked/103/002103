DRC Ebola outbreak continues to show rising case numbers

The World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office reported 2 additional Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases on Saturday [29 Aug 2020] in in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, bringing the total to 109 cases (103 confirmed and 6 probable) including 47 deaths (case fatality ratio 43.1%).

To date, 34 health areas in 11 health zones have been affected.

A total of 264 new people were vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV-GP on 29 Aug 2020, in 7 rings, including 47 high risk contacts, 196 contacts of contacts, and 21 probable contacts. Since 5 Jun 2020, a total of 25 908 people have been vaccinated.

The EVD outbreak in Equateur Province continues to show rising case numbers and to spread to new geographical areas.

[The number of individuals vaccinated on 1 day [29 Aug 2020] 264, seems low considering that cases continue to increase, albeit slowly. In the past 3 months, almost 26 000 people have been vaccinated, which calculates to approximately 288 people per day, making 264 people right in line with the expected number. The cost of the vaccination campaign in terms of money and effort is high, and resources are being strained by the other endemic diseases in the region. It is not clear what level of vaccination would be needed to terminate Ebola virus transmission completely and whether that is even possible given that there is also HIV, malaria, TB, COVID-19 and more to address. - Mod.LK]

Ebola sickens 2 more in DRC outbreak, 109 total, with 47 deaths

Tests confirmed Ebola infections in 2 more people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, raising the total to 109 cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [31 Aug 2020] on Twitter.

No new deaths were reported, keeping the fatality count at 47.

The outbreak, the DRC's 11th involving Ebola, was 1st detected in early June 2020 in the same area where the country's 9th outbreak occurred in 2018.

Health officials are concerned about the latest outbreak, as responders grapple with COVID-19 and other health challenges and stretched resources. Also, the outbreak is occurring across a wide region, which includes both difficult-to-access areas and Mbandaka, the provincial capital.

[WHO African Region tweet (https://twitter.com/whoafro?lang=en) The latest Situation Report from the 11th Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in #Mbandaka, Equateur Province #DRC (reported 30 Aug 2020): 109 cases (103 confirmed, 6 probable), 47 deceased, 43 recovered.

#Ebola: "...This outbreak is now double the size of an outbreak in the same area in 2018."

It would be an improvement were the Situation Report itself posted for public view showing health zones, case numbers, and deaths on a daily basis. - Mod.LK]

[2] Research: Pseudotyped virus

- Mon 31 Aug 2020
Steeds K, Hall Y, Slack GS. Pseudotyping of VSV with Ebola virus glycoprotein is superior to HIV-1 for the assessment of neutralising antibodies. Scientific Reports volume 10, Article number: 14289 (2020). Published 31 Aug 2020.

Abstract
---------
Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that can cause Ebola virus disease (EVD). It is thought that EVD survivors are protected against subsequent infection with EBOV and that neutralising antibodies to the viral surface glycoprotein (GP) are potential correlates of protection. Serological studies are vital to assess neutralising antibodies targeted to EBOV GP; however, handling of EBOV is limited to containment level 4 laboratories. Pseudotyped viruses can be used as alternatives to live viruses, which require high levels of bio-containment, in serological and viral entry assays. However, neutralisation capacity can differ among pseudotyped virus platforms. We evaluated the suitability of EBOV GP pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to measure the neutralising ability of plasma from EVD survivors, when compared to results from a live EBOV neutralisation assay. The sensitivity, specificity and correlation with live EBOV neutralisation were greater for the VSV-based pseudotyped virus system, which is particularly important when evaluating EBOV vaccine responses and immuno-therapeutics. Therefore, the EBOV GP pseudotyped VSV neutralisation assay reported here could be used to provide a better understanding of the putative correlates of protection against EBOV.

[Chimeric viruses offer an advantage over the wildtype in terms of safety but must be evaluated in comparison to the wildtype virus in neutralization assays before being adopted. In this study, the EBOV GP pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) performed better than the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) based assay in relation to specificity, sensitivity, and correlation with the live EBOV neutralisation assay. This demonstrates that chimeric viruses with the same EBOV GP may still differ in neutralization ability, highlighting the importance of optimizing each pseudotyped virus developed with different platforms even if viral GP is the same. Neutralization assays with chimeric virus that is replication defective are safer than those using live infectious virus, and generally faster, since virus does not need to amplify in cell culture. - Mod.LK
