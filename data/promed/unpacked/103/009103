[As of 29 Jul 2015 there are no individuals being monitored following contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals related to the outbreak beginning with the imported case in May 2015. There have been 2 new suspected cases with a history of travel to the Middle East (not related to the outbreak that began in May 2015) that have been PCR negative (on 27 and 29 Jul 2015) that are now under monitoring in hospital, with an additional 7 contacts of theirs that are being monitored on home isolation. Of the 12 remaining patients (from the May 2015 outbreak) that are still under treatment, 11 have had 2 consecutive negative PCRs for MERS-CoV infection, leaving one remaining patient with laboratory evidence of possible continuing infectivity to others.

It is now 25 consecutive days since the last newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection was confirmed. Declaration of the end of the outbreak is made by WHO when 2 incubation periods (an incubation period is considered to be 14 days) have passed since the last case has tested negative for the virus twice. Hence, since there is still one individual who has not tested negative for the virus, the outbreak is still considered active.

[Cases are continuing to be confirmed in Saudi Arabia. While July has seasonally been a "slow month" for MERS-CoV transmission, since 1 Jul 2015 there have been 16 newly confirmed cases reported from Saudi Arabia, 10 of which were reported from Riyadh. Taking the contact information listed below in the WHO update, it appears as though now there may well be nosocomial transmission ongoing in Riyadh as well.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 29 Jul 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Between [16 and 25 Jul 2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 8 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.

Details of the cases are as follows:
1. A 30-year-old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [22 Jul 2015] and was admitted to the hospital on the same day. The patient, who has no co-morbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [24 Jul 2015]. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient is a contact of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (case no 7 -- see below). Investigation of history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing [reported as a newly confirmed case on 25 Jul 2015, at which time was noted to be in stable condition. - Mod.MPP]

2. A 28-year-old, non-national male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [22 Jul 2015] and was admitted to the hospital on [23 Jul 2015]. The patient, who has no co-morbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [24 Jul 2015]. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure room. The patient is a contact of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (case no 7 -- see below). He has no history of dealing with or consumption raw camel meat. Investigation of history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing [reported as a newly confirmed case on 24 Jul 2015, at which time was noted to be in stable condition. - Mod.MPP]

3. A 54-year-old, non-national male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [20 Jul 2015] while admitted to hospital since [20 Jul 2015], due to unrelated chronic medical conditions. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [22 Jul 2015]. Currently, the patient is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases who were hospitalized in the same hospital (case no 5 -- see below; case no 2 -- see DON published on [24 Jul 2015]) or with shared health care workers is ongoing [reported as a newly confirmed case on 23 Jul 2015 and as a fatality on 27 Jul 2015. At time of initial report was noted to be in critical condition. Case no 2 from the 24 Jul 2015 DON is a 77 year old Saudi male in Jeddah reported as a newly confirmed case on 13 Jul 2015 and a fatality on 17 Jul 2015, who had a history of contact with camels and consumption of raw camel milk. - Mod.MPP]

4. A 52-year-old female from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [17 Jul 2015] and was admitted to hospital on the same day. The patient, who had co-morbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [21 Jul 2015] and passed away on [22 Jul 2015]. She was a family member of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (case no 5 -- see below) [reported as a newly confirmed case and fatality on 23 Jul 2015. - Mod.MPP]

5. A 56-year-old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [13 Jul 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [15 Jul 2015]. The patient, who has co-morbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [19 Jul 2015]. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. The patient has a history of frequent contact with camels and consumption of their raw milk [reported as a newly confirmed case on 22 Jul 2015, at which time was noted to be in critical condition. - Mod.MPP]

6. A 60-year-old female from Raniah city developed symptoms on [12 Jul 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [19 Jul 2015]. The patient, who has co-morbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [21 Jul 2015]. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient lives in an area with several camel farms; however, she has no history of contact with camels or consumption of raw camel products. Investigation of history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing [reported as a newly confirmed case on 22 Jul 2015, at which time was noted to be in stable condition. - Mod.MPP]

7. A 32-year-old, non-national male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [15 Jul 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [19 Jul 2015]. The patient, who has no co-morbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [20 Jul 2015]. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing [reported as a newly confirmed case on 21 Jul 2015, at which time was noted to be in critical condition. - Mod.MPP]

8. A 93-year-old male from Hufof city developed symptoms on [12 Jul 2015] and was admitted to hospital on the same day. The patient, who has co-morbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 16 Jul 2015]. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient owns a camel farm; however, he has neither a history of contact with camels nor consumption of their raw milk. Investigation of history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing [reported as a newly confirmed case on 16 Jul 2015 and as a recovery on 22 Jul 2015. - Mod.MPP]

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 2 MERS-CoV cases that were reported in previous DONs on [2 Jul 2015] (case no 4) and on [23 Jun 2015] (case no 2).

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1382 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 493 related deaths.

[According to the WHO update above, there have now been a total of 1382 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported globally including at least 493 related deaths. The update provides additional information from the earlier confirmation reports, especially on possible histories of high risk exposure. It does appear as though there is some nosocomial transmission of the MERS-CoV occurring in Riyadh (see case no 3 in the report above).

It is not clear if the contact between some of the cases was hospital related or community based (see cases 1, 2, and 4 in the report above).

Known direct exposure to camels is still noted in probable contact cases, as well as close proximity to camels by means of living near camel farms (see case no 6 in the report above).

Case no 8 is curious, as a 93-year-old male with known co-morbidities would have been expected to have had a more severe clinical course than actually observed (patient was noted to be in stable condition at time of confirmation and appeared to have had a 10 day course of illness, with complete recovery. While the patient denied contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of symptoms, he was noted to own a camel far. One wonders if perhaps he had prior exposure to the MERS-CoV. It would be interesting to know if serologic evidence of infection with MERS-CoV was documented in earlier specimens taken from this individual. - Mod.MPP]

Abstract
--------
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a highly lethal pulmonary infection caused by a previously unidentified coronavirus (CoV), likely transmitted to humans by infected camels. There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral for MERS, therefore new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat human infections are needed. In this study, we describe, for the 1st time, to our knowledge, the isolation of a potent MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibody from memory B cells of an infected individual. The antibody, named LCA60, binds to a novel site on the spike protein and potently neutralizes infection of multiple MERS-CoV isolates by interfering with the binding to the cellular receptor CD26. Importantly, using mice transduced with adenovirus expressing human CD26 and infected with MERS-CoV, we show that LCA60 can effectively protect in both prophylactic and postexposure settings. This antibody can be used for prophylaxis, for postexposure prophylaxis of individuals at risk, or for the treatment of human cases of MERS-CoV infection. The fact that it took only 4 [months] from the initial screening of B cells derived from a convalescent patient for the development of a stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line producing neutralizing antibodies at more than 5 g/L provides an example of a rapid pathway toward the generation of effective antiviral therapies against emerging viruses.

Abstract
--------
The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as a cause of severe respiratory disease highlights the need for effective approaches to CoV vaccine development. Efforts focused solely on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein may not optimize neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Here we show that immunogens based on full-length S DNA and S1 subunit protein elicit robust serum-neutralizing activity against several MERS-CoV strains in mice and non-human primates. Serological analysis and isolation of murine monoclonal antibodies revealed that immunization elicits NAbs to RBD and, non-RBD portions of S1 and S2 subunit. Multiple neutralization mechanisms were demonstrated by solving the atomic structure of a NAb-RBD complex, through sequencing of neutralization escape viruses and by constructing MERS-CoV S variants for serological assays. Immunization of rhesus macaques confers protection against MERS-CoV-induced radiographic pneumonia, as assessed using computerized tomography, supporting this strategy as a promising approach for MERS-CoV vaccine development.
