About 9.6 million cocoa trees have been infected with the swollen
shoot disease in the Eastern Region, Mr Francis Antwi Agyei, Deputy
Eastern Regional Manager of the Cocoa Swollen Shoot Control Division,
announced.

Mr Agyei said out of this figure, the Boadua District had recorded 283
824 affected trees on its farmlands in the Eastern Region. He stated
that the Boadua farming community had proved difficult in allowing his
outreach team to control the virus irrespective of compensation
packages offered them. "Being a virus, the only control measure is the
total removal of the diseased and contact trees. This means the trees
are to be cut down," he said.

The Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD) Unit of the Ghana Cocoa
Board has handed over 25 treated and replanted cocoa farms to their
owners at Kyekyebiase in the Asante-Akim North District. The Unit is
engaged in a comprehensive rehabilitation and replanting exercise as
part of efforts to tackle the cocoa swollen-shoot disease in the
country.

Dr George Opoku, Ashanti Regional Manager of CSSVD noted that the
programme was aimed at assisting farmers to increase crop yield and
also protect non-infected cocoa trees from the virus. This way, they
would be helping to increase the income of cocoa farmers as well as
the foreign exchange earnings of the nation.

Dr Opoku advised farmers whose cocoa trees have been attacked by the
virus to co-operate with the unit to cut them down for replanting. Mr
Osei Wiafe-Akenten, Juaso District Cocoa Officer, said they were
determined to check the disease, which had been attacking cocoa farms
in the area over the years. The Board has started mass spraying of the
rehabilitated farms to prevent re-infection and had advised the
beneficiary farmers to take good care of the farms.

Nana Antwiwaa Agyapah, Queen of Kyekyebiase, appealed for an extension
of the exercise to include all identified swollen shoot prone areas in
the districts. Nana Opepem Ababio, Chief of Kwakoko near Kyekyebiase,
lauded government for the intervention and called for the provision of
adequate spraying machines at subsidized cost to enable the farmers to
spray their farms.

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa is caused by _Cacao swollen shoot
virus_ (CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_) which was first recorded in Ghana in
1938. CSSV is thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West
African forest trees and can lead to severe crop losses. Symptoms vary
with different viral strains from severe effects on shoots and roots
to no symptoms at all. The virus is spread by several species of
mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be transmitted by grafting
and mechanical inoculation. Seed transmission is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and replanting with clean
plant material. Most affected countries require the removal of all
infected trees and their neighbours. The mealybug vectors are
difficult to control, even with pesticides, and native forests serve
as pathogen reservoirs. Breeding programmes for virus- or
vector-resistant crop varieties have been initiated. Ghana, Togo,
Nigeria, and Cote d'Ivoire have signed an agreement to tackle the
disease. The items above illustrate the variable success rates in
implementing any control measures, and keeping replanted trees from
becoming reinfected may prove challenging under local conditions.

A westward spread of CSSV in Ghana led to a serious outbreak in 2008
(ProMED-mail post 20081030.3416) with the possibility of the
involvement of a new viral strain. It is not clear from item 1 above
whether this putative new strain is thought to be responsible also for
the current problems in the Eastern Region, or whether these are older
infections remaining from previous outbreaks.
