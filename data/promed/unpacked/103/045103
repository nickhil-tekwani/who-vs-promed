Rubella patients are increasing in Japan, mainly in the Kanto region (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama).

In 2018, 777 patients were reported by 26 Sep 2018, more than 8 times last year's [2017] reported number. Patients are frequently males in their 30s and 40s who are not inoculated with rubella vaccine as routine immunization, and the majority of patients have no or unknown history of rubella vaccination.

Rubella was epidemic in Japan in 2012-2013; more than 14 000 rubella patients and more than 40 congenital rubella syndrome patients were reported.

Rubella immunity should be confirmed before traveling to Japan.

The latest information about rubella in Japan is available from https://www.niid.go.jp/niid//images/idsc/disease/rubella/2018pdf/rube18-38.pdf.

Rubella is a mild, contagious disease caused by the rubella virus, genus _Rubivirus_, family Togaviridae.

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases warned that a potential rubella outbreak could affect the 2020 games and is urging people -- mainly men in their 30s to 50s -- to get vaccinations, as many have not been vaccinated fully against the disease. The vaccine is given as part of a combination vaccine, called the MMR vaccine, that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella.

Japan saw a major rubella outbreak in 2013, with over 10 000 people infected. Cases of infection have since declined, but there has been a resurgence since late July this year [2018], with many of the patients being men in their 30s and older. - Mod.LK
