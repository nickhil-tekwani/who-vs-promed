[During the 1st half of 2010, 3 limited FMD outbreaks were reported
from South Korea, 2 caused by FMD virus serotype O (both resolved in
June 2010) and one caused by serotype A (resolved in March 2010). All
3 were controlled by the application of stamping out without
vaccination, regaining South Korea's status as "FMD-free without
vaccination" within 3 months after outbreak's termination.

The last, still continuing epizootic, caused by the same FMD virus
serotype O strain, which infected Japan and other east Asian countries
in 2010, reportedly started on 26 Nov 2010. It was initially handled
by the application of the previous policy, namely "no vaccination,
stamping out with culling of contiguous animals." This led to the
culling of more than 2.5 million animals with losses estimated to
exceed USD 2.0 billion, while the disease continued its spread across
the nation except for North and South Jeolla and Jeju provinces.
Consequently, the authorities decided, in January 2011, to change the
control policy into vaccination of the whole susceptible animal
population, culling only unvaccinated animals in new outbreaks.
Subsequently the disease peaked towards the end of Feb 2011. The
locations of all recorded outbreaks can be seen on the map
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9993.

On 24 Mar 2011, encouraged by the fact that no new cases appeared
since 25 Feb 2011, Seoul assumed, reasonably, that the highly
contagious disease was largely contained and hence downgraded the
alert level "red" to "orange". On 12 Apr 2011, the alert level was
further lowered from "orange" to "yellow," the 2nd-lowest level in the
4-tiered alert system.

Unfortunately, after absence of the disease for almost 2 months, a
new case of FMD was diagnosed in a pig farm near Yeongcheon-city
(North Gyeongsang province) on 16 Apr 2011, confirmed by the
laboratory on 17 Apr 2011. Two additional outbreaks in pigs within the
same region are described in the OIE follow-up report above. While
showing an extremely low apparent morbidity rate (0.75 percent), these
new outbreaks may be indicative of a continuing circulation of the
virus in South Korea.

It will be interesting to note if the affected pigs in the 3 new foci
had been vaccinated and what percentage of all other farm animals,
including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and farmed deer or camelids,
have been vaccinated throughout Korea since January 2011. A complete,
efficacious vaccination should prevent the circulation in domestic
animal population.

On top of examining the potency and efficacy of the applied vaccine,
the source of the virus which has infected the 2 pig farms deserves to
be investigated. Surveillance should cover also wildlife, such as wild
boars and deer. The surveillance deserves to exclude a (hypothetical?)
possibility that the virus had been circulating in South Korea since
the beginning of 2010. - Mod.AS]
