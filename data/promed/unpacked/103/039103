The fungus that causes white-nose syndrome [WNS] in bats -- first detected in Texas last year [2017] along the Panhandle -- has now spread into Central Texas, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department [TPWD] said.

In a press advisory, officials said this is the 1st time the potentially lethal fungus has been detected in the area after being found at 2 sites in Blanco county, located southeast of Austin. The fungus also has been spotted in Foard county, twice in Kendall county, and once in Wheeler county.

The incursion of the fungus to the region is particularly alarming given the presence of the world's largest bat colony dwelling under the Ann W Richards Congress Avenue bridge downtown. While no Texas bat deaths have been blamed on the fungus in Texas, the syndrome it causes has killed millions of bats in the eastern part of the US, officials said.

Texas Parks & Wildlife officials said the fungus has been detected on cave bats, tri-colored bats, Townsend's big-eared bats, and on a Mexican free-tailed bat but no signs of white-nose syndrome have been reported. Officials are most worried about the chances of finding the fungus on Mexican free-tailed bats like those found along Congress Avenue as this species is migratory, flying in large numbers and thus potentially spreading the disease across greater distances.

In addition to putting on a nightly, spectacular display upon emerging en masse from under the downtown bridge as they search for food -- now representing a popular tourist attraction -- the Austin bats are a critical part of the Central Texas ecosystem as they prey on mosquitoes and crop-destroying insects. Recent studies have placed the value of bats' prolific insect control to agriculture at USD 1.4 billion annually in Texas alone. This value includes reduced crop loss to insect pests, reduced spread of crop diseases, and reduced need for pesticide application.

"While Mexican free-tailed bats are not expected to be susceptible to WNS, we are concerned because they migrate in large numbers and may help spread the disease further into the western United States or into Mexico," said Jonah Evans, a mammalogist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department who oversees the agency's bat program. "Kendall County is now the southernmost county with the fungus in the United States."

The difficulty in treating the syndrome further heightens scientists' concerns: "Treating white-nose syndrome is extremely difficult as bats can spread the fungus long distances, the fungus can persist for in the environment for long periods of time, and cave ecosystems are sensitive and frequently contain rare species that may be impacted by certain treatments," Evans explained. "TPWD is supporting treatment development and field trials when possible while working to ensure potential impacts to caves and non-target species are minimized."

White-nose syndrome is caused by the fungus _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ and has been rapidly spreading since its discovery in New York in 2007, officials noted. In some areas there have been declines in winter bat numbers of greater than 90 percent, parks department officials added. Because bats usually produce just one offspring per year, researchers are concerned it could take many decades for some populations to recover from a major decline, they added.
