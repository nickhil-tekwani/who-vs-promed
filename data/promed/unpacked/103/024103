Russia sanitary chief warns of anthrax epidemic [edited]
-----------------------------------------------
Russia's chief sanitary doctor Gennady Onishchenko is warning that floods as a result of ice melting could cause an epidemic of anthrax in Russia. This spring flood waters could inundate 38 cattle burial sites for animals that died from anthrax, which could threaten locals, the head of Rospotrebnadzor [Russia's Consumer Rights Protection Service] said.

Fourteen areas monitored

As a result of the risk Onishchenko ordered increased control over 14 federation subjects, Interfax reported. Rospotrebnadzor's regional divisions should pay closer attention to the condition of water supplies, drain systems, animal burial sites, warehouses with poisonous chemicals, pesticides, fuel, and oil bases in the areas of possible flooding.

Rospotrebnadzor announced that in the Central Federal Region there are eight burial sites for animals with anthrax, and they could be flooded, including two in Ivanovo region, two in Kursk region and four in Smolensk region. Moreover, the conditions of the potentially dangerous sites are not up to the norms of veterinary and sanitary controls. The situation is made worse by the fact that it is not clear who owns the sites. Thus, if they are destroyed by floodwaters, it is unclear who would be responsible for restoring them.

In order to prevent the situation, Gennady Onishchenko ordered his department to note all the places where animals with anthrax could have been buried that might fall in the flooded areas.

Water under control

The areas have to be provided with adequate resources for water purification if it becomes infected. Rospotrebnazdor also aims to tightly control the quality of drinking water and will prepare medicine for immunisation in case there is an epidemic.

The disease is known in Russia as "Siberian pox" because of its wide presence in Siberia, and is transmitted through earth and water infected through excrement of affected animals, and can be lethal.

One of the most famous anthrax epidemics was in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in 1979. Soviet authorities said it started after consumption of meat from infected animals. However, it is widely believed to have been caused by an accident at a military biological laboratory in the city.

[Flooding does present two risks in relation to livestock anthrax:

[1] It can float buried spores up to the surface where they can later be ingested by grazing animals. Also the flooding can erode a grave away so that the spores are washed downstream and have the potential to be deposited in a pasture and initiate outbreaks during the summer grazing. While the spatial probabilities of maintaining a high enough spore concentration or spores regrouping to be an infective risk would appear to be mathematically minimal such events do happen and have been recorded, e.g. the last epidemic in Victoria, Australia, some 10+ years ago.

[2] Flooding can invoke the Texas paradigm of encouraging a high Tabanid fly pupal hatch and the increased numbers of flies can magnify odd sporadic cases into significant numbers of outbreaks widely spread.

I would very much doubt whether this flood water would provide any risk for humans drinking this water; I have yet to hear of such an event. Nor is this disease transmitted via livestock urine or faeces. Also it would be impossible to treat an eroded grave and reconstruct it. When it is gone, it's gone.

In the Soviet past, every anthrax cattle grave site was documented, mapped, and routinely sampled for a significant number of years. Thus risky grave sites were known then. I suspect that this has not been maintained and the old records have been lost. Positive sites were fenced off, and sometimes concreted over. The most interesting aspect of this routine soil surveillance was the observation that after 5-7 years many recoveries would be found to be apathogenic thanks to plasmid losses, usually pX01.

It is always interesting to see the Sverdlovsk event quoted correctly in the Russian Press. This ebbs and flows. When a dear Moscow friend would fiercely deny that it was from spores going downwind from the military research institute there, I would know immediately that the Kremlin was in political denial and he had been so instructed. As over the years we had frequently discussed what had happened I would know that the temperature had changed for the moment. So at this time the they are in accord with the rest of he world. - Mod MHJ]
