Other instances of wound botulism associated with injecting drug use [IDU
(from
GIDEON http://www.cyinfo.com ):
Norway:
Of seven cases of botulism reported in 1997, three were associated with IDU
- these were the nation's first reported cases of wound botulism.
Switzerland:
Five cases of suspected wound botulism were reported during September 1998
to February 1999 - all male injecting drug users in the northeast.
United States:
30 of the 85 cases of botulism reported in 1994 occurred in California.
That year, 21% of all adult botulism in the State were cases of wound
botulism associated with heroin injection (notably, 'black tar' heroin).
