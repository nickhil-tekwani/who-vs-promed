An outbreak of malaria in northern Nigeria's Katsina state has taken
401 lives in the last 4 weeks, local health officials have said.

"In the last 28 days, 401 people have died of malaria, which has
become endemic in the state," said Halliru Idris, director of public
health in the state's health ministry.

He added that the death toll could be much higher because it only
includes those who died in hospitals, excluding those who might have
died at home.

He said 50 311 malaria cases were recorded in the state of 4.5
million people over the past 4 weeks, which he attributed to the high
rainfall recorded in this rainy season, which saw more mosquitoes
breed than usual.

Mosquitoes can transmit malaria. The government has deployed health
workers to the worst affected districts to fumigate mosquito breeding
areas and to distribute mosquito bed nets.

According to the 2008 World Health Organization's annual malaria
report, the disease struck between 35 million and 80 million Nigerians in 2006.

One million people died from malaria in 2006, most of them children under 5.

Malaria is an infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes. Symptoms
include sharp fluctuations in body temperature, weakness, body aches,
nausea and vomiting. It can be fatal if not treated in time.

[Malaria is endemic in Katsina State, and the WHO 2008 malaria report
<http://www.who.int/malaria/wmr2008/MAL2008-CountryProfiles/MAL2008-Nigeria-EN.pdf>
states that: "Nigeria accounts for a quarter of all malaria cases in
the WHO African Region. Transmission in the south occurs all year
round and is more seasonal in the north. Almost all cases are caused
by _P. falciparum_ but most are unconfirmed. There is no evidence of
a systematic decline in malaria burden; the upward trend in numbers
of cases and deaths is probably due to improvements in reporting.

IRS [indoor residual spraying] is not national policy. The NMCP
[National Malaria Control Program] delivered about 17 million ITN
[insecticide treated mosquito-nets] during 2005-2007 (6.6 million
LLIN [long lasting insecticide-treated nets]), enough to cover only
23 percent of the population at risk. The programme delivered 4.5
million courses of ACT [artemisinin-based combination therapy] in
2006 and 9 million in 2007, far below total requirements. Funding for
malaria control was reported to have increased from USD 17 million in
2005 to USD 60 million in 2007, provided by the government, the
Global Fund and the World Bank. This is unlikely to be sufficient to
reach national targets for prevention and cure."

Nigeria is notorious for manufacturing counterfeit drugs, and a high
number of malaria deaths in an highly endemic area could indicate
that the drugs used for treatment did not contain sufficient (if any)
active substance.
