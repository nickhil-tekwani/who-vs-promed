["Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterized by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a virus currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus Arterivirus. The primary target cells of the virus are differentiated macrophages of the pig, mainly alveolar but also present in other tissues. Two major antigenically different types of the virus exist: Type 1 (previously described as European - EU) and Type 2 (previously NorthAmerican - NA).

"Historically, Type 1 was restricted to Europe and Type 2 to North America; currently they are spread globally. The virus is primarily transmitted via direct contact but also by contact with faeces, urine, semen and fomites. The possibility of insect vectors (houseflies and mosquitos) and aerogenic spread for short distances have also been confirmed. PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world.

"The reproductive failure is characterized by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and 2ary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by 2ary infections. In 2006, a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain emerged in China (People's Rep. of) causing high fever (40-42Â°C) in all age groups, abortions in sows, and high mortality in suckling piglets, weaners and growers".

There is no evidence of human infection with PRRS virus. - Mod.CRD]
