Classical Swine fever in Spain - NEW OUTBREAK
---------------------------------------------
A new outbreak (no. 27) of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) at Bellmun, 50 km
north of the Catalan town of Lerida. The new outbreak is in the existing
movement ban zone, which covers about half of Lerida province. The area is
not a key Catalonian pig production region, so pig prices have not been
seriously affected.
Blood tests on the pigs slaughtered yesterday at Segarra have proven
negative for CSF.
Weaner [recently-weaned pig imports into Spain are still running at a high
level -- 27 000 last week. So far this year, the Netherlands exported
approximately 300 000 weaners to Spain out of a total export of 1.3
million. In 2000, the Dutch exported 1.03 million weaners to Spain out of a
total export of 3.14 million. Germany exported 1.28 million pigs to Spain.
Spain also imports a small number of pigs from Eastern Europe.
