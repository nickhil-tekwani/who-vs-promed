The number of cases reported in an _E. coli_ outbreak has increased to 9 confirmed cases and 8 probable, DuPage County health officials said Tue 18 Jun 2013. Six of the 9 confirmed cases left people hospitalized, but all have been released, said Jason Gerwig, a spokesperson for the DuPage County Health Department. As part of the investigation, a restaurant in Lombard, Los Burritos Mexicanos remained closed.

According to a statement from the county health department, some of the illnesses were caused by bacteria called Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, which cause diarrhea, often bloody. Although most healthy adults can recover completely within a week, some people can develop severe disease, including a form of kidney failure.

Although the restaurant has been closed, Gerwig said it doesn't mean the restaurant or its employees are at fault. "It could be a product they order to make one their meals that may be the culprit," he said.

Marco Arteaga, manager of the restaurant, said the restaurant is cooperating fully in the investigation. He said the cause of the outbreak is puzzling because none of his employees have been sick, and no problems have been reported at the restaurant's other locations in Villa Park and St. Charles. He said all the locations use the same food distributors.

The DuPage County Health Department receives about 10 reports of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ a year, according to department officials.
