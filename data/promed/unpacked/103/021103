Rabies outbreak leaves one dead
--------------------------------
54 people have been infected with rabies [rather: "have been exposed to
rabid animals". - Mod.AS] in Ende regency, East Nusa Tenggara, over the
past several weeks, with one death.
To stop the spread of the virus, government officials are vaccinating
thousands of dogs and monkeys, and killing those animals suspected of
carrying the virus, said M. Littik, the head of the provincial animal
husbandry office.
There was an outbreak of rabies in Lembata regency in January that also
killed one person, M. Littik said on Thursday [17 Mar 2005].
Rabies has killed 128 people in the past 8 years in 8 regencies in the
province, including Manggarai, Sikka, Ngada and Ende.

[The rabies situation in Indonesia is defined as "urban", characterised by
the virus reservoir being found mainly within the (unvaccinated and
uncontrolled) stray dog population.
"An outbreak of rabies which killed one person" usually means that a single
human victim, exposed to a rabid animal, was not (properly) treated within
the prescribed time frame following the exposure, probably because the
exposure (bite?) remained unreported. Besides the activities related to the
animal reservoir, such as a significant reduction of the feral dog
population and vaccination of domestic dogs, public education is an
essential component of rabies control. Obviously, this might be effective
only if backed by adequate public-health infrastructure, especially in
remote areas. - Mod.AS]
