Symptoms of lettuce fusarium wilt have been identified at the existing outbreak sites [ProMED-mail post 20171030.5412370] in Lancashire [England] in May and June this year [2018]. No outbreaks apart from these sites have been reported so far in the UK.

As the season progresses, it is important to monitor for suspected symptoms. Growers should first check for possible infection by cutting a few plants with suspect symptoms from top to bottom and looking for vascular browning. If this symptom is confirmed, then it is recommended that a sample is sent promptly for diagnosis of fusarium wilt at the University of Warwick [England]. Researchers will provide individual growers with _Fusarium_ species and race found. Anonymised results, if positive, will also be used to alert industry via AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board] to new disease outbreaks by county.

[Fusarium wilt of lettuce caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _lactucae_ (synonym _lactucum_) can affect plants of any age. Symptoms include leaf yellowing, tip burn, and necrosis, as well as browning of vascular tissues and rotting of the tap root. Plants may be stunted and fail to form heads, infected seedlings wilt and may die. Disease incidence can range from a few plants up to large areas within a field.

The pathogen occurs in soils worldwide and is commonly found on roots of healthy plants. Most strains cause no damage to their hosts, but severe strains can block the water conducting xylem and lead to wilting. 3 races are known to cause disease in lettuce, with up to 70 per cent crop losses reported. Lettuce cultivars have been reported to differ significantly in susceptibility, with some leaf and romaine types highly resistant. Disease severity may also depend on fungal populations in the soil, inoculum levels, and temperatures. Once introduced to an area, the fungi may survive indefinitely on the roots of asymptomatic reservoir hosts. Thus, resistant lettuce varieties and rotation crops can contribute to an increase in soil inoculum.

Spread occurs mainly on contaminated seed, with soil, infected crop debris, irrigation water, and human activities (for example on farm machinery and tools). Disease management requires an integrated approach including crop rotation and phytosanitary measures (including steam treatment of soil) to avoid spread to new fields. For related fusarium pathogens, flooding of fields has been reported to reduce fungal survival in the soil.

In the UK, fusarium wilt of lettuce was reported for the 1st time only recently, in late 2017 (ProMED-mail post 20171030.5412370). It was identified as race 4 which is particularly aggressive; no chemical treatments or resistant varieties are known for it so far.

Different strains of the fungus cause wilting diseases with serious losses in other crops, such as banana (Panama disease), guava, vanilla, date palm, and a range of cucurbits. Each of the pathovars is highly specialised attacking only a single crop species.
