Please find hereafter a short communication that we would like to post
on ProMED to the special attention of the Veterinary Microbiologists'
audience.

False-positive glanders serological reactions in ponies infected by
_Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A herd of 18 Shetland ponies raised in the Netherlands and transiting
through Belgium (Province of Limburg) were found infected by
_Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus_, a bacterium associated with
upper airway diseases in equines and to be differentiated from the
agent of strangles, _S. equi subsp. equi_, as confirmed by
bacteriological analysis of nasal swabs.

Interestingly, one of the infected animals had been testing strongly
positive for glanders by the Complement Fixation Test and 2 ponies
from the same herd tested weakly positive during a routine serological
control for export performed on 6 Jul 2011 at the Belgian National
Reference Laboratory (NRL). Upon blood resampling performed 14 days
later, nasal discharge and enlarged submaxillary lymph nodes were
found on the strongly reactive animal. CFT reaction remained positive
in the latter animal but had subsided in the weakly reactive ones. The
whole herd was put under quarantine by the national authorities.

Positive glanders CFT reactions were confirmed for the 3 suspect
animals by the OIE reference lab in Jena (Germany) on both sample
sets. However, positive serological status could not be confirmed by
Western blot in any of the CFT-positive ponies. Western blot is a
highly specific serological method used by the OIE reference lab to
confirm glanders suspicions in CFT-positive animals. One month after
the 2nd control, a 3rd herd sampling was conducted which yielded 4
animals testing positive in the glanders CFT (OIE ref lab). 2 of these
showed mild nasal discharge and swollen submaxillary lymph nodes.
Bacteriological analysis of the nasal discharge revealed massive
contamination by _S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus_. Identification was
achieved by using both biochemical identification gallery (API 20
STREP, API 20 STREP, BioMrieux) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
(Bruker Daltonics BioTyper). Quarantine was released at this point.

According to the national authorities, the ponies were born and raised
in the Netherlands, had no at risk travel history and had no contact
with animals originating from countries where glanders is endemic.
They were transiting through Belgium for export outside of the
European Union. Bacteriological and molecular analysis (PCR) performed
on nasal swabs repeatedly failed to demonstrate the presence of the
causative agent of glanders (_Burkholderia mallei_).

False-positive glanders serology has occasionally been reported in
animals infected by _Streptococcus equi subsp. equi_ (see for instance
Dahmen H., Lehrbuch der Veterin√§r-Mikrobiologie, 4th edition, Paul
Parey Ed., Berlin 1949). However, the molecular basis of the
cross-reactivity with members of the _Streptococcus equi complex_ in
equids, if any, remains to be elucidated.

Inter-laboratory variations in glanders CFT titers originate from the
absence of an international standard serum and the use of antigens of
different strain blends in individual laboratories.

[Earlier this year, a positive CF glanders test in Switzerland was
similarly found to be, eventually, false by the additionally performed
Western blot, carried out by the (single) OIE reference lab, in Jena
(see 20110729.2282).

It will be of interest to revisit other cases reported as glanders in
recent years, if they were not confirmed by the reference laboratory.

These cases underline the urgent need for improved international
standardisation of glanders diagnostic biologicals, as rightly
indicated by Dr Wattiau. According to OIE's Manual (chapter 2.5.11
Glanders), at present 2 tests are prescribed for international trade
in equines, namely the mallein test and CF. - Mod.AS]

[As Dr. Wattiau indicates, immunologic cross-reactivity in both CFTs
and with the hypersensitivity skin (Mallein) test between
_Burkholderia mallei_ and other bacterial species has been described,
particularly with the closely related agent of melioidosis, _B.
pseudomallei_, but also with the taxonomically unrelated
_Streptococcus equi_ (the zoonotic agent that causes equine
strangles). The Western blot allows specific bacterial antigens that
react with the host antibodies to be identified and thus can more
accurately identify the infecting species. Nucleic acid amplification
tests have been used as well. Isolation of the causative agent in
culture can definitively identify the pathogen. - Mod.LM]
