Marin County health officials have increased to 6 an estimate of the number of Marin residents suspected to be sickened by an unidentified exposure to _E. coli_.

Marin County Public Health Officer Dr. Matt Willis said Friday afternoon [27 Sep 2013] that 5 confirmed and one presumptive case of the often food-borne _E. coli_ O157 infection have been reported to Marin County health officials since 22 Sep 2013. Four of the patients are children.

Of the 4 patients hospitalized, 2 have been discharged; 2 other patients were not hospitalized. All 6 patients are stable and recovering or fully recovered. The infected individuals are residents of Tiburon, San Anselmo, Inverness, and San Rafael.

"We're seeing cases from all over," Willis said. He declined to say whether any of those sickened are members of the same family. On Wed 25 Sep 2013, Willis reported that the bacterial infection had been detected in 3 children and was suspected in an adult. The bacterium's incubation period is approximately 3 to 4 days after exposure, but it can be as long as 10 days.

Willis said that Marin County Department of Health and Human Services and Environmental Health Services are working with the California Department of Public Health to gather information from clinicians, patients and food vendors to determine whether the cases might share a common source or be linked to cases outside of Marin.

The ongoing investigation has not identified any single food source of the infections. Environmental Health inspections of establishments where food may have been purchased or consumed by victims has not revealed any contaminated products or evidence for ongoing risk to the public. Marin's regional public health laboratory is collaborating with a state lab to perform DNA fingerprinting on the bacteria, which will help determine whether people were infected with the same strain.

Willis said this new technique also will allow him to determine whether the strain is related to an _E. coli_ outbreak that occurred in San Francisco in mid August 2013. The San Francisco Department of Public Health reported that 10 of the 12 people who were sickened dined at the Burma Superstar restaurant. Of those diners, 5 were hospitalized and one developed a life-threatening kidney disease that can be associated with _E. coli_ O157 infections: hemolytic uremic syndrome.

"It's my understanding that no source within the restaurant was identified," Willis said. "In a majority of small outbreaks, the source is never identified."

[The EHEC cases are scattered across the county. ProMED awaits more information regarding whether the strains of these cases, clustered in time, can be linked genetically and epidemiologically. - Mod.LL
