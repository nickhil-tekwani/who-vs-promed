New outbreak of red tide on the Salvadorian coast
------------------------------------
On Monday the government said that a new outbreak of red tide was
reported in beaches of the southeast of El Salvador, where
approximately 10 persons were ill from its toxic effects.
The Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Salvador Urrutia,
told the television [reporter that the outbreak was detected in various
"points" of the beaches in the department of La Libertad to the
southeast of San Salvador.
The red tide consists of the accelerated reproduction of micro-algae,
which produce toxins that accumulate in shellfish [which are then
eaten. A heavy intoxication can lead to respiratory difficulties and
death.
Urrutia affirmed that the zone continued "with the presence of this type
of toxin" and that the levels [of toxin from laboratory specimens are
"way too elevated." The chief of the Epidemiology Department of the
Ministry of Health, Rolando Hernandez, added that in La Libertad,
where the principal seafood market of the country is located, the levels
of the micro-algal toxin are above 1200 units [compared to normal
levels of toxin of less than 200 units.
