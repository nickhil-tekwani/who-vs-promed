India (Gujarat): More Cases of Jaundice Reported in Ahmedabad
-------------------------------------------------------------
Despite the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) taking all precautionary
measures to prevent the spread of jaundice, 4 more cases were reported in
the city on Wed 5 May 2004. 3 of them were in areas where no cases had been
reported till now, while the 4th case was in Amraiwadi. Official estimates
put the number of jaundice-affected patients in Amraiwadi, Bhaipura, New
Bhavaninagar at 120. AMC officials also suspect that many cases in the
eastern part of the city may be going unreported, as those afflicted may be
going to private practitioners.

AMC Health Officer Dr P K Makwana said, "The problem is getting serious
with each passing day, and efforts are on in full swing to contain the
disease." However, that does not seem to have helped with the disease
spreading to newer areas, something that AMC officials refused to comment
on. "We are making efforts to replace damaged pipelines in affected eastern
areas, where it was discovered that residents had made holes in the supply
pipeline. Besides, we are supplying drinking water to these areas by tankers."

AMC officials are also reported to have contacted NGOs working in these
areas to create awareness about personal hygiene among residents.
