3000 take ill after meal near Bhopal
------------------------------------
Three thousand people were hospitalised near Bhopal on Wednesday after they
complained of dizziness, blurred vision and diarrhoea after eating a meal
of rice, police said.
The people taken ill had purchased the rice from 3 traders in Bairagarh, a
suburb of Bhopal, and eaten it after a religious ceremony, said Balbir
Singh, assistant superintendent of police in Bhopal.
Almost 80 per cent of those who fell ill were women and children, he said.
The traders have been arrested and police have sealed their shops. No
deaths have been reported so far, police said.

More than 500 people became sick in the central Indian state of Madhya
Pradesh after eating food which authorities believe was adulterated.
District Collector S.K. Vashishtha told Reuters on Thursday about 550
people, mostly Hindu devotees, became sick in Bairagarh in Bhopal district,
after they ate a dish made from flour. "They took ill after consuming food
prepared from a flour that was adulterated. We will know in a day or 2 what
exactly went wrong," Vashishtha said. "Currently no one is hospitalised and
all those who had been taken ill yesterday have been discharged after
initial treatment," he said. A hospital official said the sick were
overcome with pain. "People were writhing in pain when they came to the
hospital yesterday," said Mahesh Dayaramani, trustee of the Seva Sadan Eye
Hospital.
