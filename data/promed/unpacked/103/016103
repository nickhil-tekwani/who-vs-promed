[Our 13 Nov 2014 post archive no 20141113.2953243 "Avian influenza (80): Germany (MV) poultry, HPAI H5N8", included the following comment: "On 11 Nov 2014, a media source informed that "German researchers said on Monday [10 Nov 2014] that according to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI), the virus found in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern appeared related to a H5N8 strain discovered in South Korea" ... "So far, we have not been able to detect a confirmation of the said information -- in particular, a mention of genotyping -- elsewhere".

The said comment was erroneous: a report addressing the genotyping of the current H5N8 in Germany was submitted by FLI to ProMED-mail on Fri 7 Nov 2014, but unfortunately got lost during the process. We apologise for the inconvenience and herewith present the said report. - Mod.AS]

Outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in a turkey holding in Germany - Information on the virus
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in a single turkey holding in the German Federal State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on 5 Nov 2014. A steep increase of mortality among one out of 5 stable units (ca. 3000 heads of poultry) of a total of 31 000 birds kept at the holding prompted specific diagnostic tests. An H5N8 virus has been detected by molecular means. The cleavage site revealed polybasic properties: RNSPLRERRRKR*GLFGAIA. Based on sequence information and a phylogenetic analysis of the full length HA and NA gene segments, H5N8 viruses of clade 2.3.4.6 were identified being the closest relatives.

These viruses have extensively circulated in poultry and wild birds in South Korea in 2014 but have, as yet, not been detected outside Asia. Currently, full genome sequencing and virus isolation procedures are in progress. RT-qPCR [quantitative reverse transcription PCR] methods recommended in the EU Diagnostic AI Manual (2006/437/EC) which target the M and the H5 gene produced reliable results with the turkey samples. Cq values below 20 can be expected when analyzing oropharyngeal swabs of moribund birds. Nucleotide sequence analysis for diagnostic purposes of the hemagglutinin cleavage site and a neuraminidase gene fragment was based on RT PCR according to the PanHA and PanNA protocols published by Gall et al (2009).
