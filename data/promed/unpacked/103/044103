Australian breeders will be required to have their broodmares vaccinated against the potentially deadly Hendra virus (HeV) after the Hunter Valley's [New South Wales] biggest stallion farms introduced a change of policy aimed at protecting humans and livestock during the 2019 season.

Arrowfield, Aquis Farm, Coolmore, Darley, Kingstar Farm, Kitchwin Hills, Newgate, Vinery, and Yarraman Park released a joint statement 1 Jul 2019 outlining the change, which is to remain in place indefinitely.

The move comes in the wake of a confirmed case of Hendra virus in a 25-year-old broodmare near Scone in early June [2019], the 1st time the disease has been detected in the Hunter Valley.

"Our motivation is to safeguard the health of our people and the horses in the thoroughbred industry," said Hunter Thoroughbred Breeders Association president Dr. Cameron Collins. "Your veterinarian will be best placed to assist and advise on the implementation of vaccination."

Leading broodmare farms from across New South Wales are supporting the policy and have already vaccinated their stock or are in the process of doing so.

They include Amarina Farm, Bhima Thoroughbreds, Cressfield, Edinburgh Park, Kia-Ora, Gooree Park, Glastonbury Farms, Lime Country Thoroughbreds, Luskin Park, Milburn Creek, Riversdale, Toolooganvale, Tyreel, Valiant, and Willow Park.

The New South Wales government describes the Hendra virus as a virus mainly infecting large fruit bats (flying foxes) and which can be passed on to horses. The infection has occasionally been passed onto people who have been in close contact with an infected horse.

Three veterinary clinics--Scone Equine Hospital, Dartbrook Equine Veterinary Clinic, and Hunter Equine Centre -- also issued a statement backing the studs' decision to vaccinate their entire horse population and demand walk-on mares have also been treated.

"The veterinary clinics have a legal responsibility with a zero-tolerance level for exposure of our staff, horse staff or the public to any horse with an identified risk of HeV infection," read a statement from the three clinics.

"This responsibility applies both within the veterinary clinics and on clients' properties. The veterinary clinics have operated in this way since the emergence of HeV, but the recent confirmed case in the Hunter Valley means there is now an elevated level of vigilance for this uncommon, but potentially fatal, disease."

The statement also warned breeders that some equine insurance policies contained exclusion provisions for HeV.

"Horse owners and managers should be aware of the wording in their policies," it read. "Unvaccinated horses which are waiting for HeV exclusion results will not be admitted to veterinary clinics, regardless of their insurance status."

[This sounds like a positive move to protect the equine breeding stock and the individuals handling the horses.

However, it seems the enforcement is simply not to breed the mare, which may push folks wanting a foal from a particular stud, to definitely vaccinate. - Mod.TG
