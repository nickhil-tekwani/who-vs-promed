Fatal West Nile Virus Infection After Probable Transfusion-Associated Transmission -- Colorado, 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted to humans primarily by infected mosquitoes. However, WNV also can be transmitted through infected blood products or solid organs. Since 2003, the US blood supply has been routinely screened for WNV RNA. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that blood collection agencies perform WNV nucleic acid testing (NAT) year-round on all blood donations, either in minipools of 6 or 16 donations (MP-NAT) or as individual donations (ID-NAT). Since implementation of screening, 12 transfusion-associated transmissions of WNV have been documented. This report describes a case of fatal WNV encephalitis in an immunosuppressed patient after probable transfusion-associated transmission. The implicated donation was reactive by MP-NAT but nonreactive by ID-NAT on routine screening and was released for transfusion. During the subsequent investigation, retrospective testing of the donated unit showed discrepant ID-NAT results and evidence of WNV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and neutralizing antibodies. Although WNV is rarely transmitted through screened blood products, clinicians should consider WNV disease in patients with compatible symptoms who were recently transfused. Further evaluation is required to determine the relative risks and benefits of different strategies to manage MP-NAT-reactive minipools when all constituent donations are nonreactive by subsequent ID-NAT.

The patient was hospitalized continuously for 4 weeks before illness onset without known outdoor exposure; therefore, mosquito-borne WNV transmission was unlikely. A public health investigation was conducted to determine the source of his WNV infection and prevent further transmission by removal of any contaminated blood products. The patient had received allogenic [genetically different but from another human], leukoreduced [with white blood cells removed], irradiated blood products during hospital days 13-30, including 6 units of red blood cells, 2 units of platelets, and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma. He received 2 additional units each of red blood cells and platelets on day 44.

Editorial Note:
This report describes a fatal case of WNV disease after probable transfusion-associated transmission via platelets collected from an asymptomatic infected blood donor. Although transfusion-transmitted WNV has been reported after initial screening was nonreactive by MP-NAT, it has not been documented after screening was nonreactive by ID-NAT. This case demonstrates the potential for transmission of WNV through transfusion of blood products that screen nonreactive by ID-NAT, despite having detectable WNV-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies.

It is likely that this transfusion-associated transmission occurred because the donor had a waning viremia [presence of viruses in the bloodstream] that was sufficiently low to be inconsistently identified by either MP-NAT or ID-NAT. NATs performed during initial screening and during retrospective testing of the plasma co-component from the implicated donation yielded discrepant results. The Cobas TaqScreen West Nile Virus Test and Procleix WNV NAT assays typically detect lower levels of WNV RNA than conventional RT-PCR. However, at very low levels of viremia, NAT assays performed on minipools or individual units can exhibit test-to-test variability and might require replicate testing to detect viral RNA. In addition, the nonreactive Procleix NAT might reflect lower WNV RNA concentration in the sample because of viral degradation during prolonged storage at 39.2 F (4.0 C).

[This case illustrates the difficulty that can result from discordant screening results. In this case, in the initial screening the donation was reactive by MP-NAT. ID-NAT was performed subsequently to identify the infected donation(s) in the minipool but none of the constituent donations was reactive. The decision of the blood collection and testing agencies to discard all constituent units of reactive WNV minipools when an ID-NAT reactive donation cannot be identified is prudent when the donation is made during the WNV transmission season. - Mod.TY
