Cutaneous leishmaniasis outbreak
--------------------------------
Peshawar: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Health Department has sought help from the World Health Organization (WHO) to contain an outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), an official said.

WHO is to spend USD 9.6m to help residents of KP, FATA KP to set up 700 community health centres. "During the last three months, about 889 cases of CL have been recorded from 14 districts," Dr Muhammad Iqbal of the Health Department told Central Asia Online on 25 April. "We have requested the WHO to intervene." Nowshera District had the most cases, 214, he said.

KP is requesting injectable medicines and help with insecticide spraying, he said, adding that patients cannot afford the 3500 Pak rupees (USD 39) cost of CL treatment. CL is a skin infection, transmitted by sand flies.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Pakistan, where cutaneous leishmaniasis, CL, is either caused by _Leishmania major_ (zoonotic reservoir) or _L. tropica_ (human reservoir). A review of clinical presentation of leishmaniasis in Pakistan can be found here: Bari AU. Clinical spectrum of cutaneous leishmaniasis: an overview from Pakistan. Dermatol Online J. 2012;18:4 (http://dermatology.cdlib.org/1802/02_rev/04_11-00146/article.html). Another recent paper discusses the distribution of leishmaniasis in Pakistan: Afghan AK, et al. Clinical manifestations and distribution of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Pakistan. J Trop Med. 2011;2011:359145. (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3235881/?tool=pubmed).

It should be noted that leishmaniasis is also highly prevalent in Afghanistan and cross border traffic of infected humans could contribute to the outbreak in the Khyber province, bordering Afghanistan.
