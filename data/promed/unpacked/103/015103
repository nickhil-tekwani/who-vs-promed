Foot and mouth disease in Israel
-------------------------------------
Follow-up report No. 2 (final report)

Information received on 29 Apr 2004 from Dr. Moshe Chaimovitz, Director of
Veterinary and Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, Beit-Dagan:

End of previous report period: 3 Feb 2004 (see Disease Information, 17 [6],
33, dated 6 Feb 2004).

End of this report period: 29 Apr 2004.

A total of 8 infected farms in 5 outbreaks were reported during the period
from 23 Jan to 17 Mar 2004 (see summary tables below). The only animals
infected were young fattening cattle and sheep that had been vaccinated
only once against foot and mouth disease (FMD), 6 months before, with a
polyvalent vaccine that included FMD virus strain type O.

In Ein-Hashofet, Yizreel district, wild animals were infected from a
neighboring infected farm.

No new cases of FMD have been reported since 17 Mar 2004. The epizootic is
thus seen as closed 30 days after the completion of the favorable evolution
of the epidemiological situation and after the results of the
epidemiological surveillance activities (screening, inspection, serological
testing, and additional studies), which indicated that the infection had
not spread.

Movement restrictions on susceptible animals have been relaxed, but control
measures in the outbreak settlements are still in force. Animals in the
outbreak settlements are permitted to leave only on the condition that
serological surveillance, based on the detection of antibodies to
nonstructural proteins of FMD virus, demonstrates the absence of infection.

Movement restrictions on susceptible animals in outbreak settlements will
be lifted, in 6 months time, on the condition that no new clinical signs
have been observed.

Additional information extracted from the monthly reports of Israel for Jan
to Apr 2004 received from Dr. Moshe Chaimovitz, Director of Veterinary and
Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development,
Beit-Dagan:

[An overview of the FMD situation in Israel and the Middle East, with some
interesting maps, is available at
<http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/agriculture/>. Another very interesting
summary [Foot & mouth disease - Kuwait & Israel 19980722.1384] has the
comments of our own Mod. AS, submitted before he joined ProMED-mail on a
regular basis. I have always contended that ProMED-mail archives, available
on the website, are not only a valuable historic record but also
interesting reading. You never know whose ideas you might come across. -
