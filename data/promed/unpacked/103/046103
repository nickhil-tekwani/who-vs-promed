From: Dr. James Chin, CDPC-mail
Source: From WHO's Outbreak page

The outbreak which began at the end of January 1997 has continued
throughout the year and a cumulative total of 35,591 cases and 2,025
deaths had been reported up to the end of December (including 1,065 cases
and 123 deaths which occurred in Zanzibar since the beginning of December).
The WHO office in the United Republic of Tanzania is working closely with
the national authorities to control the outbreak and has made supplies
available to the Ministries of Health in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. A team
of WHO staff is currently in Zanzibar where the incidence of the disease
appears to be decreasing.
Travellers visiting the United Republic of Tanzania (including Zanzibar)
should take the normal precautions regarding food, water and hygiene
recommended for all countries where cholera may occur, as well as other
water-borne diseases.
