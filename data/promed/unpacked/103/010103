A new study has found that nearly half of camels in parts of Kenya have been infected by the virus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and calls for further research into the role they might play in the transmission of this emerging disease to humans.

MERS was initially identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment available. To date, it has infected 1595 people in more than 20 countries and caused 571 deaths. Although the majority of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections, camels are likely to be a major reservoir host for the virus and an animal source of MERS infection in humans.

A team of scientists from the University of Liverpool and institutions in the USA, Kenya and Europe, surveyed 335 dromedary -- single-humped -- camels from 9 herds in Laikipia County, Kenya and found that 47 percent tested positive for MERS antibodies, showing they had been exposed to the virus.

Professor Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at the University's Institute of Infection and Global Health says, "Although Laikipia County camel density is low relative to more northern regions of Kenya, our study suggests the population is sufficient to maintain high rates of viral transmission and that camels may be constantly re-infected and serve as long-term carriers of the virus. MERS in camels, it seems, is much like being infected by the common cold. The significance of this is not yet clear, because we don't know if the virus is universally zoonotic. While the risk of these camels spreading MERS to humans cannot yet be discounted, it appears to be, for now, very low as there have been no human cases diagnosed in Kenya. It might be that the mutations required to make this virus zoonotic have only evolved recently in the Middle East, where the human outbreaks have so far been concentrated."

Lead author Dr. Sharon Deem, director of the Saint Louis Zoo Institute for Conservation Medicine, says, "Demand for livestock products, such as meat and milk, is rising across the globe and could offer poor farmers a route out of poverty as markets expand, but zoonotic disease remains a major obstacle to this goal. Further research to determine whether the MERS virus is dangerous to humans in Kenya and other sub-Saharan countries is critical."

"Abstract
-----------
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a recently identified virus causing severe viral respiratory illness in people. Little is known about the reservoir in the Horn of Africa. In Kenya, where no human MERS cases have been reported, our survey of 335 dromedary camels, representing nine herds in Laikipia County, showed a high seroprevalence (46.9 percent) to MERS-CoV antibodies. Between-herd differences were present (14.3-82.9 percent), but were not related to management type or herd isolation. Further research should focus on identifying similarity between MERS-CoV viral isolates in Kenya and clinical isolates from the Middle East and elsewhere."

"Discussion
--------------
Our study demonstrates high levels (46.9 percent) of seroconversion to MERS-CoV in Laikipia County camels. There was no difference in seropositivity levels between herds based on herd management or isolation type, and antibodies were found in all age cohorts. The seroprevalence across ages in combination with herds categorized as having no or little contact with external herds (e.g., high isolation type), suggests that Laikipia camels continue to be exposed to MERS-CoV or a closely related virus. If exposure was dependent on transmission of virus from outside Laikipia, one would expect a lack of seroconversion in the juvenile cohort (i.e., after maternal antibodies wane).

"The trend towards a higher seroprevalence in smaller herds was not correlated with herd management or isolation type and differs from a previous study in Kenya in which the authors suggest camels in more mobile, nomadic herds had higher rates of exposure due to increased horizontal contact. Differences between our study and Corman et al. (2014) may be due to Laikipia camels residing further from international borders, and thus having less contact with camels from countries with known high seroprevalence. Corman et al. (2014) demonstrated a 10 percent (7.2-13.5) seroprevalence from archived samples from Laikipia camels collected from 1992-2013, with a 2.5 percent (0.06-13.2) prevalence from the 2013 samples . (See item '[2] Antibodies in camels, Kenya, 1992-2013' in archived posting 20140524.2496602). Although the diagnostic tests differed between our study and the Corman et al. (2014), it is unlikely that this would account for the extreme difference in prevalence. The seroprevalence of 46.9 percent in the current study is either comparable or lower than other African countries were MERS-CoV exposure has been studied.

"A limitation to this study is the convenience sampling scheme, which may have led to bias associated with owners allowing samples to be collected from more tractable individuals (e.g., older). However, we sampled across a range of ages and sexes in each herd.

"Although Laikipia County camel density is low relative to more northern regions of Kenya, our study suggests the population is sufficient to maintain high rates of viral transmission and that camels may be constantly re-infected and serve as long-term carriers of the virus. With recent debate on the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV to humans, studies such as ours, which demonstrate high MERS-CoV exposure in camels, provide support for the need of further research on the role of camels in the epidemiology of this emerging zoonotic disease.

"Several researchers have proposed that MERS-CoV, and similar viruses, are likely to have been circulating in camel populations across the Middle East and Horn of Africa for many years, but may not have yet acquired zoonotic potential across their range. Therefore, placing virus diversity in a regional context is an important next step. Determining whether MERS-CoV of Laikipia camels is genetically similar to MERS-CoV in other parts of the Horn of Africa, as well as to the known human pathogenic strain in the Middle East, will help to elucidate if the camel population, along with its respiratory viruses is 1 metapopulation. Studies should also focus on MERS-CoV exposure in humans with (e.g., herders, consumers) and without camel contact, together with an attempt to isolate and characterize the virus. Lastly, the absence of known human MERS-CoV cases in the Horn of Africa may be due to a lack of studies and thus warrants further investigation, including syndromic surveillance in humans."

Indeed syndromic surveillance in humans, as well as a serosurvey in the relevant human populations, are needed to evaluate the factual role of camels in the epidemiology of the disease in Kenya and the infectivity of the virus for humans, with or without clinical outcome.

A nationwide population-based seroepidemiologic study of MERS-CoV was carried out in 2013-2014 in Saudi Arabia. For details on the said project and its results, see item '[4] Saudi Arabia - serosurvey' in archived posting 20150416.3291924. Using a cross-sectional study design, the researchers tested blood samples from 10 009 people in Saudi Arabia whose age and sex profile are similar to the country's general population. The team also obtained samples from 87 camel shepherds who participated in a health ministry surveillance study in the 1st half of 2014 and from 140 foreign slaughterhouse employees working in Mecca in August 2013. 2 shepherds and 5 slaughterhouse workers had MERS-CoV antibodies, for rates of 2.3 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. The team concluded that middle-aged men who have regular contact with camels may sporadically transmit the virus to the general population, and the subclinical or mild infections -- especially in younger people -- might be the source of unknown sources of exposure reported.

It seems that final, clear conclusions on camels' role in the epidemiology of MERS, in the Middle East and elsewhere, are still pending. - Mod.AS
