Laos: 2nd case of human bird flu suspected (update 1)
-----------------------------------------------------
A 2nd case of human bird flu is suspected in Laos, only a week after
confirmation of the South East Asian country's 1st case, according to the
World Health Organization and government authorities.
A 42 year old woman from Vientiane province has been hospitalized with
avian influenza symptoms since 28 Feb 2007, the Geneva-based WHO and Laos
Ministry of Health said in a news release. She remains isolated and in
stable condition and is being treated. "It seems likely it is another case
of H5N1," said Dida Connor, a World Health Organization spokeswoman, in a
telephone interview today [4 Feb 2007] in Laos. On 2 Mar 2007, clinical
samples taken from the patient tested positive for H5, according to
established WHO case definition, the statement said. Authorities are
awaiting further verification of the strain from a WHO reference laboratory.
The lethal H5N1 strain of avian influenza infected a 15 year old girl in
Laos, WHO and the Health Ministry confirmed on 27 Feb 2007. The teenager,
who is in the hospital, is from a suburb of the capital, Vientiane, where
an outbreak of the H5N1 virus in fowl was confirmed on 7 Feb 2007, the
agencies said. "There is no direct link to the 1st case," Connor said.
"They are not from the same area."
At least 167 of the 277 people known to be infected with bird flu since
2003 have died, according to WHO data as of 2 Mar 2007.

World Health Organization said. "The patient passed away at about 14:30

health ministry.
Tests had showed the woman had H5 bird flu, but the authorities were still
waiting for further results to determine whether it was the H5N1 strain.
