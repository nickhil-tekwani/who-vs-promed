[1] WHO alert
Date: Thu 28 Aug 2014

http://online.wsj.com/articles/who-warns-ebola-outbreak-could-hit-20-000-within-nine-months-1409226146


The World Health Organization (WHO) warned [Thu 28 Aug 2014] that the number of people affected by Ebola virus [disease; EVD] could rise to 20 000 within the next 9 months and a projected half a billion dollars would be needed to fund efforts aimed at stopping the spread of the disease. In a document released Thu [28 Aug 2014], the UN health body said the outbreak of the disease "continues to accelerate." More than 40 percent of reported cases have occurred within the last 3 weeks, the report said.

As of [26 Aug 2014 -- see WHO update of 28 Aug 2014], health authorities in the 4 affected nations -- Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone -- have reported 3069 cases of the disease since the outbreak started in December [2013]. The disease, a virus that causes a fever so high it punctures blood vessels to cause internal bleeding, has already killed 1552 people.

WHO Assistant Director General Bruce Aylward was at a press briefing on WHO's strategy to combat EVD at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva on Thu [28 Aug 2014].

The Geneva-based WHO said in its report, which it dubbed a road map for responding to EVD, strengthening laboratory facilities and adding staff with more expertise in the disease were necessary to containing the outbreak. Public health infrastructure needed to be improved to cope with future threats. The road map assumes "that in many areas of intense transmission the actual number of cases may be 4-fold higher than currently reported." The road map called for the establishment of EVD isolation centers and burials of victims which are supervised by health care experts, among other specific responses to the disease.

The WHO said getting health experts to regions affected by the EVD outbreak was an urgent priority. That has been made difficult because international airlines, including Air France, British Airways and Emirates Airline, have suspended flights to some of the 4 affected countries. Air traffic into the affected areas was likely to be addressed in the next 2 weeks, the WHO said. By the end of September [2014], a United Nations-led plan will be launched to improve air access to the area, it added.

The WHO program will likely cost around USD 490 million and require contributions from national governments, some UN and non-governmental agencies, as well as humanitarian organizations, it said. Funding for the budget hasn't yet been completed, according to a WHO spokeswoman, who wasn't able to provide details of the amount of money still needed. [more]

[2] Nigeria: new case(s)
Date: Thu 28 Aug 2014

A doctor in Nigeria's oil industry hub of Port Harcourt has died from Ebola [virus disease], after he was infected by a man linked to the 1st case in Africa's most populous country, the Health Ministry said on Thu [28 Aug 2014]. Heath Ministry spokesman Dan Nwomeh said on his Twitter feed that the doctor had treated a primary contact of Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian who brought EVD to Lagos. His death brings the number of EVD fatalities in Nigeria to 6. The total number of recorded cases had risen by 2 to 15, Nwomeh said, the other one being the wife of the doctor who is showing EVD symptoms and whose test results are awaited.

Port Harcourt lies at the heart of Nigeria's 2 million barrels per day oil industry, Africa's biggest, and is a hub for expatriate workers in major international oil companies. Nwomeh said 70 contacts of the doctor were now under surveillance in Port Harcourt. It was not immediately clear what impact the arrival of EVD would have on oil operations. The major [companies] operating in Nigeria have historically been comfortable with a fair degree of risk in the-oil producing Niger Delta, including attacks on oil installations and rampant kidnapping of expatriates.

The news came 2 days after Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said authorities had "thus far contained" the EVD outbreak in Africa's largest economy, with only one case left being treated in an isolation ward in Lagos. All Nigerian cases have been direct or indirect contacts of Sawyer, who collapsed on arrival at Lagos airport from Liberia on [22 Jul 2014] and later died, but was treated before anyone knew what he had.

[By an unfortunate coincidence, the Centre for Gas, Refining and Petrochemicals (CGRP) ... is holding an international conference and exhibition from 27-28 Aug 2014 [today] in Port Harcourt. http://businessdayonline.com/2014/08/cgrp-world-bank-hold-conference-on-petroleum-gas-refining/#.U_81tjK3OTI. I hope the 650 participants, many from overseas, will watch their temperatures for 21 days after they return home, bearing in mind that although they may not have touched a sick person, they could have touched a surface contaminated by a case in the conference hall or hotel. Remember the Hong Kong hotel where a SARS super-spreader contaminated several men on the same floor? - Mod.JW]

[3] WHO update
Date: Thu 28 Aug 2014

http://who.int/csr/don/2014_08_28_ebola/en


[As of 26 Aug 2014 -- see table at end], the total number of probable and confirmed cases in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the 4 affected countries as reported by the respective Ministries of Health of Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone is 3069, with 1552 deaths. [Now plus 1 more confirmed and 1 more suspected in Nigeria -- see [1] above. - Mod.JW]

The outbreak continues to accelerate. More than 40 percent of the total number of cases have occurred within the past 21 days. However, most cases are concentrated in only a few localities. The overall case fatality rate is 52 percent, ranging from 42 percent in Sierra Leone to 66 percent in Guinea.

A separate outbreak of Ebola virus disease, which is not related to the outbreak in West Africa, was laboratory-confirmed on 26 Aug 2014 by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is detailed in a separate edition of the Disease Outbreak News (http://who.int/csr/don/2014_08_27_ebola/en).

A full understanding of the outbreak that will lead to improved response requires detailed analysis of exactly where transmission is occurring (by district level) and of time trends. This analysis is ongoing. Preliminary results show that cases are still concentrated (62 percent of all reported cases since the beginning of the outbreak) in the epicentre of the outbreak in [the contiguous] Gueckedou (Guinea); Lofa (Liberia), where cases continue to rise; and Kenema and Kailahun (Sierra Leone) areas. Capital cities are of particular concern, owing to their population density and repercussions for travel and trade.

WHO and its partners are on the ground establishing EVD treatment centres and strengthening capacity for laboratory testing, contact tracing, social mobilization, safe burials, and non-EVD health care. WHO continues to monitor for reports of rumoured or suspected cases from countries around the world and systematic verification of these cases is ongoing [more].

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.)

Temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at http://who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en.

[Table: Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone]

Note: cases are classified as
- confirmed (any suspected or probable cases with a positive laboratory result);
- probable (any suspected case evaluated by a clinician, or any deceased suspected case having an epidemiological link with a confirmed case where it has not been possible to collect specimens for laboratory confirmation); or
- suspected (any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: a suspected, probable or confirmed EVD case, or a dead or sick animal; or any person with sudden onset of high fever and at least 3 of the following symptoms: headache, vomiting, anorexia/loss of appetite, diarrhoea, lethargy, stomach pain, aching muscles or joints, difficulty swallowing, breathing difficulties, or hiccup; or any person with unexplained bleeding; or any sudden, unexplained death).

The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health.

[4] Germany: case recovering
Date: Thu 28 Aug 2014

http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/hamburg/Hamburger-UKE-behandelt-Ebola-Patienten,ebola150.html [in German, summary submitted by contributor]


The medical doctor from Senegal who has acquired an ebolavirus infection in Sierra Leone was transported to Germany yesterday [27 Aug 2014] where he is currently being treated at the University Hospital in Hamburg. According to media reports and the treating physicians, he is in stable condition at the moment. On the website, there is also a video showing the patient walking on his own out of the airplane at Hamburg airport.

[The WHO forecast evokes scenes from the 1919 'Spanish' flu, with warehouses crammed with beds full of patients. They coped then in Europe -- can they cope now in Africa? See photo at http://www.megaartigos.com.br/blog/wp-content/gallery/a-gripe-espanhola-1/a-gripe-espanhola-2.jpg.

I'll get into hot water for saying this, but I suppose oil workers, like all migrant workers, move around the world a lot to other oil ports and rigs, and when on shore have contact with people in the sex trade, posing a risk of spreading EVD. And the same applies to delegates who attend international conferences. - Mod.JW
