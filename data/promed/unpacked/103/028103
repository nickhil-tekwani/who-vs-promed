CHOLERA - THAILAND (03): REQUEST FOR INFO

According to the WHO International Health Regulations, all suspected cases of
cholera (and plague and yellow fever) are to be reported by the fastest means
to WHO Geneva, and the confirmation of the diagnosis also, as soon as it can
be obtained.
There appears to be a possible problem with cholera recognition in Thailand.
Thailand was not on the List of Infected Areas for cholera published in the
WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record of Dec.1995 or Dec.1996, nor on the latest
list of 20 Jun.1997 (see: http://www.who.ch/wer/pdf/wer7225.pdf). Yet ProMED-
mail has been sent information in the posts referenced above (below the
title), showing that a case of cholera O139 was imported from Thailand into
the UK in 1996, and that in 1997:
>In Thailand we are ... experiencing an outbreak of V. cholerae Ogawa that is
>resistant not only to tetracycline but also to bactrim, streptomycin and
>sulfasoxazole<
and
>There are clusters of cases (Ogawa) in refugee camps along the Burmese
border<
indicating that someone (possibly refugee organizations?) is doing lab
diagnosis.
We agree that:
>[there is no need to panic or to start tourists on cholera vaccine when
traveling to Thailand<
but we do think that countries should fulfil their reporting obligations
under the International Health Regulations. Is Thailand concerned that its
regional neighbors will ban Thai food exports if they declare an infected
area? I doubt that much of Thailand's food exports are produced in the
Burmese border region. And since no tourists travel there, the declaration
of the border as an infected area should not affect the tourist trade.
We also think that it is important to track the spread of the new epidemic
strain O139, and that all reports of its diagnosis should go to WHO as soon
as possible.
We realise that WHO relies on official notification for its reports but
surely the publication by a government agency of a report of a cholera case
imported from Thailand into another country, in this case the UK, should
count as an official report, and lead to the declaration by WHO of an
infected area?
If anyone can shed any further light on the current situation of cholera in
Thailand, we would like to hear from them.
