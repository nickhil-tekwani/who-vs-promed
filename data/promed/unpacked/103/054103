[Note: It took 3 weeks to get a result from the laboratory [13 Jun - 5
Jul 2008, then 3 months to report it officially], and the village
livestock are yet to be vaccinated [October 2008].

Anthrax is sporadically reported in Laos and then usually in cattle
and buffalo. OIE has received no reports either way from Laos in 2006
or 2007; in 2005, it was merely "positive" or known to be present.
This is the 1st detailed report since 2002. In 2001, there were 46
human cases, and 14 in 2002. - Mod MHJ]

There are no prior ProMED reports of anthrax in Laos. - Mod.MHJ
