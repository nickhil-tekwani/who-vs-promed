Hong Kong SAR: third locally acquired dengue fever case confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Yesterday, 2 more local cases of dengue fever were confirmed, as the
government launched an all-out publicity campaign to try to stem the spread
of the potentially fatal disease. The 2 workers, aged 28 and 38, from a Ma
Wan construction site, contracted the disease earlier this month,
laboratory tests revealed. They have since recovered. The pair work on the
same construction site as a third man in whom dengue fever was confirmed on
Sat 22 Sep 2002.
To guard against the widening outbreak, the Department of Health will ask
all 10 000 public and private doctors in Hong Kong to be alert for symptoms
of the disease. It will also step up health education programmes in all
1300 primary and secondary schools -- organising talks for teachers,
students, and school staff on how to reduce the risk of the disease
spreading. The moves came after a special joint meeting by 16 government
departments yesterday to discuss strategy in combatting the outbreak.
Deputy Director of Health Dr Leung Pak-yin, who chaired the meeting, said
the department was issuing letters to all doctors, keeping them informed of
the latest developments and reminding them to notify the department of any
new outbreak. Blood samples were taken yesterday from about 100 workers at
the Ma Wan construction site where the 3 confirmed cases were discovered.
Dr Leung said the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department would complete
its inspections on all 500 construction sites across the territory today to
ensure that the builders followed preventive measures. So far, 43
prosecutions and 20 warnings have been issued against site owners for
failing to keep their sites clean.
University of Hong Kong Professor of Microbiology Yuen Kwok-yung said that
the news of locally acquired cases of dengue fever should sound an alarm.
"It means there are infected mosquitoes in Hong Kong," he said. It is now
imperative to take risk reduction measures "to reduce the number of
mosquitoes in high-risk areas such as construction sites and for people to
prevent mosquito bites," Professor Yuen said.
The World Health Organization's regional adviser, Dr Allan Schapira, said:
"The fundamental measure is very simple: elimination of open stagnant water
in containers, including cans, jars, tires, gutters, vases, bottles. This
requires an active effort by the health and environment authorities and by
each family." He said dengue fever has been endemic in South East Asia for
centuries and Hong Kong was on the northern fringe of the high risk area.
Because of its location, Hong Kong had reported small outbreaks of imported
dengue cases in recent years. Dr Schapira said the role of travellers was
important in the spread of dengue. "An infected traveller can trigger a new
epidemic." The risk of death could be "close to zero" with proper timely
treatment.

Hong Kong: dengue fever spreading
---------------------------------
The BBC Monitoring service reports that the local dengue fever outbreak in
Hong Kong has spread beyond Ma Wan Island. Health officials have just
confirmed that a case has been found in Cheung Sha Wan. (Information
obtained from Radio TV Hong Kong audio website on Sun 29 Sep 2002)

Taiwan: dengue fever continues to spread
----------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) under the executive Yuan reported on Tue 24
Sep 2002 that the number of reported dengue fever cases in Taiwan had
reached 2505 as of that day. DOH officials said that Kaohsiung County and
Kaohsiung City together comprise the worst-affected area, with 2410 cases.
Because the epidemic is mostly concentrated in the greater Kaohsiung area,
the risk of an outbreak of the more serious dengue hemorrhagic fever has
also heightened there, the officials said, adding that at present, 38 such
cases have been reported, all in the greater Kaohsiung area.
Officials have urged the public to help eradicate the disease by getting
rid of standing water in their neighborhoods, where the mosquitoes that
carry the disease breed. They also warned that violators of related hygiene
regulations will be subject to fines.

DengueNet ­ WHOs internet based system for global surveillance of dengue
and DHF
---------------------------------------
Globally, 2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue viruses are
transmitted. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in
Africa, the Americas, the eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and the
Western Pacific. South East Asia and the western Pacific are most seriously
affected (1).
It is estimated that 50 million dengue infections occur each year, with 500
000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and at least 12 000 deaths,
mainly among children. Only a small proportion of these cases are reported
to the World Health Organization (WHO). Current reporting of dengue/DHF is
not standardised. Many different epidemiological institutions and
laboratories collect data and present and report it in different formats;
this makes interpretation and comparability at regional and international
levels difficult.
In order to address these problems, WHO has created DengueNet
<http://www.who.int/denguenet> in response to the WHO resolution on dengue
fever/DHF prevention and control adopted at the 55th World Health Assembly
in May 2002, which asked member states to "build and strengthen the
capacity of health systems for surveillance, prevention, control and
management of dengue and DHF." It also emphasised the importance of
strengthening laboratory diagnosis in affected countries (2).
DengueNet has been developed in collaboration with the WHO collaborating
centre for electronic disease surveillance at the Institut National de la
Sante et de la Recherche medicale (INSERM), Paris, France and is an
internet-based surveillance tool managed as a central database to collect
and analyze standardized epidemiological and virological data. It has been
developed in line with the principles devised by the Pan American Health
Organisation (PAHO) for epidemiological and laboratory surveillance of
dengue/DHF in the Americas. It is designed to collate the data in a timely
manner and to display realtime important indicators such as incidence data,
case fatality rates (CFR), frequency and distribution of dengue and DHF
cases, numbers of deaths, and distribution of circulating dengue virus
serotypes, as well as to provide historical data. These data will be
available from all the participating countries. At present, DengueNet
provides global dengue statistics from 1955 to 2001, which can be accessed
on the internet and may be useful to public health researchers and for
national and international agencies for advocacy purposes. Implementation
of the full realtime use of the system will undergo pilot testing soon.
The first meeting on DengueNet implementation was held from 9 to 11 Jul
2002 in Puerto Rico to discuss how the pilot testing will work and which
countries will participate. All 15 countries from the Americas represented
at the meeting agreed to take part in the pilot test. The next stage is for
the participants to approach their national authorities to obtain official
authorisation to take part in DengueNet and these approaches will be
assisted by WHO country representatives. The pilot testing is expected to
take 3 to 6 months after which, if successful, lessons learnt from this
exercise will be incorporated into an implementation framework for South
East Asian and Western Pacific regions in 2003. Countries in these areas
have indicated a keen interest in this project as the burden of morbidity
and mortality caused by dengue in these regions is considerable.
DengueNet will be a useful tool for finding out where dengue fever is
occurring globally, and may help clinicians to consider dengue as a
differential diagnosis for patients presenting with fever after time spent
in a dengue endemic country. Health professionals advising travellers from
Europe will be able to use this information to formulate the correct advice
for those going to countries/areas endemic for dengue or experiencing
dengue epidemics. Information about circulating serotypes may be a valuable
resource for advising travellers who have already been infected with dengue
about the increased risk of DHF if they become reinfected with a different
serotype.
