More cases of flu in Egypt and Lebanon
--------------------------------------
Five new cases of foreigners infected with swine flu were discovered
at a Cairo university dormitory yesterday [9 Jun 2009], Egypt's
health ministry said, bringing the total number of cases there to 7.

Lebanon also discovered 5 new cases of swine flu but they were under
control, the health ministry said, bringing the total number of cases
there to 8.

"The cases were isolated and treated and preventive measures were
taken for all those they came into contact with, none of whom are
showing any symptoms," the ministry said in a statement.

The 5 arrived in Lebanon last month [May 2009] from the United States
via Turkey and from Australia via the United Arab Emirates, according
to the health ministry.

The 1st 3 cases of the A (H1N1) virus, a Lebanese returning from
Spain and 2 visiting Canadians, were diagnosed late in May [2009].

Swine flu has now spread to 73 countries with over 25 200 people
known to have been infected and 139 to have died since the disease
was uncovered in April [2009], the WHO said on Monday [8 Jun 2009].

The American University of Cairo (AUC) residence in the upscale
neighbourhood of Zamalek was quarantined on Monday after 2 American
students were found to be infected with the A (H1N1) virus.

The dormitory's 110 students from 10 nationalities, as well as 124
workers and lecturers who use the building, were tested following the
outbreak and the university announced it would suspend classes until
[Sun 14 Jun 2009].

The new cases are Americans -- a woman and 4 men aged 20-26 -- who
had been in contact with the original 2 infections, Nasser Al Sayyed,
assistant minister for preventive medicine, told journalists.

"The dormitory will remain under quarantine for a week until no more
cases are detected. We will provide all facilities they need
including food and communication around the clock," Sayyed said. A
ministry official has taken up residence in the dorm to monitor
possible infections around the clock. The 1st 2 AUC cases were a
woman who arrived from New Jersey via New York and London, and a man
from Florida who came via New York.

[Unfortunately, there is not as much detail to the Lebanese cases
here as is included in the Cairo cases. In Lebanon, cases seemed to
be associated with international travel. It is observed that all the
cases of influenza A (H1N1) detected so far in the American
University of Cairo involve visitors coming from different parts of
the USA. One hopes the social distancing tactic involving the closure
of an American University of Cairo dormitory will be successful and
appropriately aggressive measures will be undertaken to prevent a
large number of H1N1 cases in people in Cairo. This is important, as
mentioned in a previous posting (see Influenza A (H1N1) - worldwide
(60): Egypt (Cairo) 20090608.2117), because of the concomitant
transmission of H5N1 in Cairo among both people and poultry. Egypt
has recently experienced its 79th and 80th cases of H5N1 in humans.
In 2008, there were 119 outbreaks of the H5N1 virus in poultry flocks
but we unfortunately don't have any official data since March 2009
for Egyptian poultry outbreaks. - Mods.FE/PC]
