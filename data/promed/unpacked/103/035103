CORRECTION: The outbreak of undiagnosed gastrointestinal illness described
in the ProMED-mail post of Fri 25 Aug 2006 (entitled Undiagnosed GI illness
- Dominican Republic: RFI 20060825.2400), was incorrectly located in the
Dominican Republic. In fact the outbreak has been reported from the island
of Dominica, a Caribbean island between the Caribbean Sea and the North
Atlantic Ocean, about one-half of the way from Puerto Rico to Trinidad and
Tobago (15-25 N, 61-20 W). ProMED-mail regrets this error and apologizes to
the 2 countries involved.
The corrected report reads:
Dominica: Outbreak of Undiagnosed Gastrointestinal Illness
----------------------------------------------------
Dominica's Ministry of Health and Social Security has denied a report in
yesterday's news of an outbreak of dengue fever across the island. Ministry
officials instead say there has been an outbreak of diarrhea and vomiting
that continues to increase. A total of 232 cases have been so far reported
between Sun 13 Aug and Sat 19 Aug 2006. Forty-six of the affected are
children under 5 years. The Ministry said 3 children and 9 adults were
admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital.
Officials are warning all residents to take extra precautions to ensure
their drinking water is safe by boiling it for at least 3 minutes after it
begins to bubble or by using bottled water.
They also advise everyone to always practice good hygiene including washing
hands before eating and to dispose of garbage by using the collection
services provided by the Dominica Solid Waste Cooperation, or by burying,
or burning.

[Further information on this outbreak of undiagnosed gastrointestinal
illness would be appreciated. A water-borne route of infection is
implicated, but the report does not contain sufficient specific information
to identify a particular etiologic agent. - Mod.CP]
