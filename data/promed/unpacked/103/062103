The Bacolod City Health Office (CHO) declared a "food and waterborne diseases outbreak" in Barangay Handumanan after 145 pupils of Handumanan Elementary School-I were brought to different hospitals in the city since Fri 14 Oct 2016, due to suspected food poisoning.

Dr. Grace Tan, head of the CHO Environmental Sanitation Division, said the situation is considered to be an outbreak because of the large number of cases. Of the 145 patients confined in various hospitals from 14 to 16 Oct 2016, 11 were already discharged as of press time.

An initial report said the pupils drank fruit juice and ate halo-halo, ice candy, and fried chicken. The schoolchildren were brought to Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH), Bacolod Adventist Medical Center (BAMC), The Doctors' Hospital, and South Bacolod General Hospital.

A Handumanan resident told Sun Star Bacolod Sunday [16 Oct 2016] that his 2 children suffered diarrhea and nausea on Saturday [15 Oct 2016] morning, prompting him to bring them to The Doctors' Hospital. His 9-year-old son was first to be confined, but has already been discharged while his 6-year-old daughter is still at the hospital due to high fever. Further tests, including stool examination, will also be conducted to determine the cause his daughter's illness.

According to a report from the City Mayor's Office, water sampling from 4 sources in Handumanan, including the source of ice used in fruit juices that were sold to the pupils, were subjected to bacteriological examination. The CHO-Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit also got samples of fruit juices and food sold by ambulant vendors for sampling. Tan said they are still awaiting the results of the stool examinations to specifically determine the causes of the schoolchildren's illnesses.

Meanwhile, Mayor Evelio Leonardia called for an emergency meeting with city officials, department heads, and executive assistants Sun 16 Oct 2016, to initiate efforts to immediately contain the outbreak. The mayor met with, among others, City Health Officer Ma. Carmela Gensoli, Dr. Rodolfo Dumayas Jr. of the Department of Health-Development Management Office in Bacolod, City Schools Division Superintendent Cynthia Demavivas, and several department heads of CLMMRH led by Dr. Mary Johnson Cabaluna.

Moreover, Cabaluna reported that a patient admitted at BAMC and another at CLMMRH tested positive for cholera. They recommended that all the children admitted, including those already discharged, will be treated as if they have cholera.

[Although 2 patients were found to have _V. cholerae_ and it is possible that cholera is behind this outbreak, the illness caused by the cholera toxin is generally not associated with high fever which has been implicated to be part of the symptom complex. - Mod.LL
