The Florida Department of Health is investigating an outbreak of blood
infections, including 2 suspected cases in Polk County, associated with
syringes containing the blood anticoagulant heparin.
Some Sierra pre-filled heparin flushes from lot No. 070926H are
contaminated with the bacteria _Serratia marcescens_, which can result in
fever and other signs of infection. People use those syringes at home to
flush out and prevent clotting in IV lines and catheters (tubes used to
remove or add fluids).
Florida received contaminated syringes, and cases have been reported in
several counties, the department said. In addition to Polk County, cases
are being examined in Escambia, Duval, Volusia, Hillsborough and Palm Beach
counties.
"We have alerted all the local hospitals to be on the lookout for that
microorganism," said Dr Daniel Haight, director of the Polk County Health
Department. "They have been alerted to notify us so we can see if (the
patients) received heparin flushes."

the 3rd state to report cases in this cluster. Colorado and Pennsylvania
also received syringes from the contaminated batch but, so far, no cases
have yet been reported. - Mod.LL]
