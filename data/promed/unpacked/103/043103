Abstract

Background: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease. SFTS is caused by the SFTS virus, a novel phlebovirus, and is spread by ticks.

Methods: A 50-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of fever and was diagnosed with confirmed SFTS. An epidemiological investigation was conducted, and immunofluorescent antibody assays (IFAs) were performed to determine the role of the patient's 3 dogs in the transmission. PCR assays were performed using ticks that were collected with the dragging and flagging method from the patient's dogs and home.

Results: PCR results were positive, and IFA confirmed an increased antibody titer. Although the reverse transcription PCR results of the 3 dogs were negative for SFTS virus, one dog had an elevated SFTS IFA immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of 1:1024. Moreover, a number of ticks were observed in the area surrounding the dog cages. Based on the findings of the patient interview, the patient was likely to have acquired SFTS by blood splash because he removed or burst ticks from the dogs with his bare hands. Although no tick bites were reported, tick transmission could not be ruled out. Studies have shown that only one in 3 individuals with a diagnosis of SFTS recalls a tick bite; thus, a definite exclusion of tick transmission in this case was not possible.

Conclusions: The epidemiological findings of our case suggest a possible relationship between tick infestation in domestic dogs and SFTS virus transmission to humans. However, there is no direct evidence supporting this viral transmission route. Future studies are needed to further investigate a potential route of SFTS transmission by exposure to engorged tick blood or pet dogs.

[Bursting an engorged tick with one's bare hands is not advisable and might have been the source of SFTS virus infection of the dog's owner had the tick's blood been viremic. Although the species of ticks mentioned in the above report is not stated, the scrub or bush tick _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ is the vector of the virus in Asia, including South Korea. A study proposed that _Amblyomma. testudinarium_ and _Ixodes nipponensis_ ticks, in which SFTS virus (SFTSV) was detected, might serve as potential vectors of this virus in South Korea. The role of dogs as possible reservoirs or amplifying hosts of SFTS virus in South Korea merits exploration.

SFTS has been occurring sporadically in South Korea since 2013 and is endemic there. SFTSV can cause a serious disease and is of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well. There is also some previous evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, and a previous report provides more objective evidence that aerosol transmission could occur (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - South Korea: poss. aerosol transmission 20190108.6248997).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
