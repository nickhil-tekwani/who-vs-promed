An 8 year old girl from Karawang, West Java died after catching the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus, the Health Ministry said on Thursday [5 Jul 2012]. The girl lived near the Karawang market. She often walked past the market's livestock and bird pens on her way to school.

On 12 Jun 2012, she carried a clutch of freshly killed chickens home from the market with her father, said Tjandra Yoga Aditama, director general of disease control and environmental health at the Health Ministry. She became ill 6 days later on a trip to Singapore. A doctor there diagnosed the girl with laryngitis, Tjandra said.

But by 24 Jun 2012, the sickness intensified, and the girl was admitted to a Jakarta hospital with a high fever, a persistent cough, and nausea. Doctors there said the girl showed signs of pneumonia. She was transferred 2 other times and placed on a ventilator in intensive care before she tested positive for H5N1 virus infection on 29 Jun 2012, Tjandra stated. The girl's condition continued to deteriorate, and, according to Tjandra, "her condition got worse, and on Tue 3 Jul 2012, she died."

The Health Ministry said that the girl likely contracted avian influenza during her trip to the Karawang market. "She was in contact with [live] poultry," Tjandra said. "She went to the market with her father and sibling and bought 5 live animals. She chose to hold the chickens after they have been killed."

Indonesia was hit hard by the Asian bird flu epidemic in the mid-2000s. Since 2005, 158 people have died after catching the H5N1 virus.

[If the diagnosis is confirmed by the World Health Organisation, this case will become, as of 7 Jun 2012, the 190th in Indonesia since 2005 and the 158th fatality. Like the majority of previous cases of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection in Indonesia and elsewhere, only a solitary person has become infected in each incident despite wide exposure to infected livestock.
