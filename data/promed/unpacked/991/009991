The chicken jerky treats made in China have been associated with kidney disease for a few years. Ever since the association between these products and illness was made in 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cautioned consumers to not give these treats to their pets.

While the treats are typically referred to as jerky, they may also be labeled tenders or strips.

Signs may occur within hours or days after a dog eats the treat. Signs include decreased appetite, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), and increased thirst and urination. Contact your veterinarian if the signs last for more than 24 hours or if they seem severe.

If your dog is vomiting, lethargic, or does not want to eat and has recently eaten these jerky treats, it does not automatically mean your dog has kidney disease from them.

Test results on affected dogs have shown kidney problems. The kidney problems are often similar to Fanconi disease (Fanconi disease is an inherited disease in which electrolytes and nutrients are lost in urine). Although many affected dogs can be treated and get well, some jerky treat-related deaths have been reported.

In 2007, affected dogs were seen in Australia and the United States. That original outbreak ended in 2009 after all the affected treats had been pulled from the market. However, similar cases have been seen since then in the United States and Canada. Unfortunately, the definitive cause of the problem is still unknown. The FDA has prepared a "Caution" statement.

In June 2011, the Canadian government sent out notices about the jerky treats causing Fanconi-like signs in Canadian dogs; in March 2012, the American Veterinary Medical Association sent out a new alert about Canadian cases. In May 2012, the FDA updated their public information on their concerns about chicken jerky.

The FDA continues to investigate complaints and test products eaten by affected dogs. No specific brands have been recalled as of this time because there are only complaints, not evidence. However, there are a number of dogs with some level of kidney illness who have eaten the China-produced chicken jerky treats, so pet owners should be cautious about giving those.

Anecdotal reports from veterinarians indicate similar concerns about sweet potato pet treats made in China. Although no evidence is available that these sweet potato treats cause kidney issues similar to those related to chicken jerky treats, pet owners should be aware of the possibility.

If your pet has the signs listed above and has eaten chicken jerky or sweet potato treats made in China, contact your veterinarian. Save the treats and packaging so that they can be tested by the FDA if they are suspected to cause the illness.

[I used this brief 2012 report to awaken readers' interest. A more complete report on the present situation in Australia can be found at: http://news.vin.com/VINNews.aspx?articleId=29411. This is based on an article published in the September 2013 issue of the Australian Veterinary Journal (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23980829) or Aust Vet J. 2013 Sep;91(9):368-373. doi: 10.1111/avj.12100, providing the largest case report to date [108 cases] of an international puzzle involving potentially and sporadically poisonous pet treats.

The only other published case report, which appeared in the Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association in 2011, described jerky-associated illnesses in 4 dogs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22058368, or J Am Anim Hosp Assoc. 2011 Nov-Dec;47(6):e178-87. doi: 10.5326/JAAHA-MS-5602).

As toxic contaminations of various food products out of China have been steady background news, I would recommend both our veterinary and medical subscribers to read all of these reports. These reports refer to dogs. There have also been human cases linked to pet food and treats -- see

11 Sep 2013 Salmonellosis - USA (15): (NH) humans ex pet treats 20130911.1937698
14 Jun 2012 Salmonellosis, serotype Infantis (02) - N America: human, dog food 20120614.1168060
The 2012 report above stated that:

"...the Missouri-based maker of Diamond, Premium Edge, Kirkland Signature, and other pet food brands has not called special attention to the expansion of the recall to cat food beyond amending a statement on the company's Internet recall site: "Diamond Pet Foods has voluntarily recalled some brands of dry dog and cat food that it manufactured in its Gaston, SC facility between 9 Dec 2011 and 7 Apr 2012 due to potential Salmonella contamination."

Kirkland Signature is the brand implicated in the latest roast chicken recall -- see 16 Oct 2013 Salmonellosis, serotype Heidelberg - USA (04): roasted chicken, alert, recall 20131016.2002725
We wonder whether the human and pet foods are processed sequentially on the same assembly lines?
