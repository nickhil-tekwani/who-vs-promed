Mysterious outbreak kills dozens of ringed seals in Alaska
----------------------------------------------------------
A mysterious and potentially widespread disease is thought to have
contributed to the deaths of dozens of ringed seals along Alaska's
Arctic coast. Scores more are sickened, some so ill that skin lesions
bleed when touched.

The animals are an important subsistence food, and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has proposed listing them as
threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

In July [2011], biologists with the North Slope Borough's Department
of Wildlife Management began receiving reports of ringed seals hauled
out on beaches, an unusual behavior since the animals usually prefer
the water or ice. Since then, they've found at least 100 seals with
telltale mangy hair and skin lesions, mostly while traveling by
4-wheeler along 30 miles of Beaufort and Chukchi sea coastline outside
Barrow.

At least 46 of those seals have been found dead, and experts aren't
sure if the disease is killing them or if other infections and polar
bears are proving fatal once the seals become feeble.

"Right now we're leaning toward it being a virus, and that could
weaken their immune system," said Jason Herreman, a borough wildlife
biologist studying seals and polar bears.

The Department of Wildlife Management has never documented a similar
outbreak in the North Slope region, Herreman said. Scientists don't
know the scope of the problem because since ringed seals are difficult
to track and haven't been counted for decades. Hundreds of thousands
are thought to live in the region.

[Last month ProMED-mail posted about Q-fever in seals. The description
of the lesions in these animals and the high mortality does not sound
like Q-fever. Hopefully some of them were submitted to a diagnostic
lab for appropriate testing.

More information on the results of investigations into the cause of
death would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.TG]
