The Pennsylvania Department of Health is currently investigating a report
of a case of _P. falciparum_ malaria in a Pittsburgh resident who recently
traveled to Cancun, Mexico. The patient is in critical condition with ARDS,
renal failure, hemolysis, and hepatic dysfunction. He was in Cancun 20-23
Jan 2000, and reportedly traveled to neighboring rural areas but returned
to the resort area each evening. He became ill with fever and chills on
February 4, 2000, and was admitted to the hospital on 10 Feb 2000.
Falciparum malaria was diagnosed by the hospital laboratory on the
peripheral blood smear (taken for a complete blood count, not a malaria
prep). We are awaiting confirmation of the diagnosis from our state public
health laboratory.
In conversations with CDC, we discovered that Health Canada is NOT
recommending choloroquine prophylaxis for travelers to Cancun. The official
statement from Health Canada states that "While Health Canada currently
does not recommend malaria prophylaxis at this time for travellers to
Cancun, personal protection measures can be used to reduce the risk of
being bitten by evening and nighttime mosquitoes."
CDC is currently re-evaluating the recommendations for US travelers to
Cancun, but has not made any changes as of now. (The current
recommendations are that travelers who remain in the resort area do not
need to take any special anti-malarial precautions.)
