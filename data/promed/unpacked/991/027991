Death Toll now At 28 in a Possible Outbreak of Ebola in Congo D.R.
--------------------------------------
A total of 28 people has now died in an outbreak of suspected hemorrhagic
fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo that doctors say might be the
dreaded Ebola fever, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Fri
7 Dec 2001. An expert medical team is still trying to reach the seat of the
outbreak. Reports from the area stated that the number of cases of
suspected infection was now 55, almost double the figure cited in the
Health Ministry's first announcement on Thu 6 Dec 2001. That initial report
had said 30 cases of the fever had been detected at the village of
Misangandu in Western Kasai province in 3 weeks. The ministry had said
there had been 17 deaths.

"The investigation team has yet to arrive at the site and these new numbers
are still to be confirmed," Florimond Tshioko, a WHO doctor and expert on
hemorrhagic fever, told Reuters in the capital, Kinshasa. "We must not
create panic and say this is Ebola fever because we won't know that until
we have conducted clinical examinations and performed a lab test in South
Africa."

The emergency medical team had reached the town of Ilebo, some 300 miles
east of Kinshasa, by Friday night and still had a further 50 miles or so to
cover, on foot and by boat, before it would reach the stricken village.

It was the second feared outbreak of the virulent Ebola virus this week,
after 10 people died of a mystery illness in another central African
country, Gabon. A member of a medical team said that a nurse was among the
victims at Mekambo village in northeastern Gabon. A WHO official said it
[sic was testing blood samples for traces of the Ebola virus.

Ebola virus is named after the river where it was first identified in 1976
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, then known as Zaire. Health care in
Africa's third-largest country, which has a population of about 54 million,
has long been poor and has now been devastated by 3 years of civil war.
Ebola fever, which is passed on through contact with body fluids and begins
with aches and fever similar to flu symptoms, killed at least 245 people in
the Congolese town of Kikwit in 1995. The biggest recent outbreak killed
more than 170 people in Uganda last year.
