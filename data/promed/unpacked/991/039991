- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been reported in the country since the one detected from Borno state with a date of onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 isolated in the country was in Magaria district, Zinder province, with an onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018].
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018 through 5 Dec 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures, such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals, are being expanded.

Central Africa
- 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in Kamonia, Kasai state.

- The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province, with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- The Papua New Guinea Polio Outbreak Response Report 2018 is online. The report summarizes the accomplishments of the government of Papua New Guinea, with support from the World Health Organization, UNICEF, Rotary, the government of Australia and New Zealand, and other partners and donors in responding to the polio outbreak.
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].

[Clearly, last week's quiet report on the polio surveillance front was the calm before the storm, with extended activity now of both the WPV and the cVDPVs. Of significance in this week's report is not only that there are 5 newly confirmed cases of WPV1 infection involving Afghanistan and Pakistan (with the Pakistan reports classified as "advanced noticed" but confirmed on the Pakistan official "Stop Polio Pakistan" website; see <Poliomyelitis update (28): Pakistan (KP) new cases, violence 20190425.6436992> for details), but also 4 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Africa involving cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria (including a new outbreak), and Somalia. But all of the locations of identification of polioviruses (wild and circulating vaccine-derived) involved countries with ongoing civil unrest. Unfortunately, there are other countries in the world with ongoing civil unrest. Although these have not recently reported polio cases, one can't help but wonder how good the polio vaccination efforts are permitted to be in the conflict zones, and how good the AFP surveillance may be in these conflict zones.

[2] Afghanistan (Uruzgan)

A fresh positive polio case affecting a 10-month girl has been detected in southern Afghan province of Uruzgan, causing concerns among the parents across the country, a local health official said Tuesday [23 Apr 2019].

"The case was discovered and registered in a remote village of Chora district, east of provincial capital Tirin Kot city, within the past week," Dr. Sayifuddin, in charge of the provincial polio-elimination program, told Xinhua.

The latest confirmed polio cases have risen to 3 so far this year [2019], while 20 polio cases were registered in the country last year [2018], according to health officials.

The ongoing insurgency and conflicts have been hindering the efforts to stamp out the infectious disease in the mountainous country.

[3] Pakistan, another violence episode

https://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/gunman-kills-anti-polio-vaccinator-in-sw-pakistan-3479797


A female anti-polio vaccinator was gunned down and another injured on Thursday [25 Apr 2019] in southwestern Pakistan, local media reported.

The incident -- the latest in a series of similar attacks -- took place in a remote town of Chaman near the Afghanistan border when the immunization team were vaccinating the children against the infectious polio disease, the local broadcaster Geo News said. The recent attack forced the authorities to suspend the ongoing vaccination effort in the region, it added.

It was the 3rd incident of targeting polio workers or the personnel providing security to the vaccinators in less than a week. The previous 2 incidents -- which left 2 police in charge of the security of the vaccinators dead -- were reported in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack; however, suspicion is focusing on the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, which have been involved in similar attacks during a decade.

The latest attack came days after 2 new cases of polio virus were reported in Pakistan.

With the new cases, reported in the Bannu and North Waziristan districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the total number of polio cases reported in the country has risen to 8 since the beginning of this year [2019].

Six polio cases were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and tribal districts, while one case was reported in each of the Punjab and Sindh provinces.

Pakistan is among 3 countries in the world, including Afghanistan and Nigeria, where polio virus still exists, and the country remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2014, the WHO made it mandatory for all people traveling from Pakistan to carry a polio vaccination certificate.

Armed assailants targeting vaccinators see the anti-polio campaigns as part of an elaborate anti-Muslim and Western conspiracy, and often issue death threats to vaccinators, many of whom are women, for administrating the vital vaccines to children.

According to Pakistani officials, around 88 people associated with the drive have been killed across Pakistan since December 2012.

[4] Afghanistan, (WHO/ICRC banned)
Date: Sat 13 Apr 2019
Source: TOLO News [edited]
https://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/icrc-who%C2%A0halt%C2%A0activities-due%C2%A0-taliban%E2%80%99s-threat


The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have stopped their activities in Afghanistan as they have been threatened by the Taliban, officials of the 2 organizations confirmed.

Taliban in a statement on Friday [12 Apr 2019] announced that the ICRC and WHO cannot operate in the areas under their influence until further notice. The group said the 2 organizations have not put into practice the commitments they made to the group.

WHO warns that the Taliban's move will put negative impacts on healthcare services of the organization to vulnerable people in Afghanistan.

Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman of WHO said they are worried about the banning of their activities, insisting that they want all the warring parties to maintain security of healthcare personnel.

"Obviously, we are concerned that this will negatively impact delivery of health services to the affected population. We know that unhindered access to all areas is necessary to provide health services to those in need," said Jasarevic.

Officials from the ICRC, meanwhile, said they are in talks with the Taliban to resolve the problem and resume activities.

Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior said the Afghan security forces are committed to ensuring the safety of the ICRC and WHO staff members.

"The ICRC is a charity and impartial organization, but the enemy of the Afghan people once again proved that they ban all the humanitarian and charity activities. We will always cooperate with them in maintaining their security," the Interior Ministry spokesman Nusrat Rahimi said.

The ICRC has operated in Afghanistan over the past 30 years, and the committees' activities are mostly focused on providing assistance to war prisoners and war victims.

The WHO provides polio vaccination services to children as well as other healthcare services to Afghans around the country.

[In searching for another article on the Taliban being against polio vaccination in Afghanistan, I found the above article reviewing the recent WHO and ICRC ban by the Taliban. In another article, there is a discussion that says more than 1 million children were deprived of vaccinations during 2018 as a result of Taliban and Islamic State [IS] militants interfering with and barring polio vaccination activities in some regions in the country (see https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/official-taliban-deprive-afghan-kids-polio-vaccine for more detail).

Given the challenges confronting countries with political unrest and the inability to find rational individuals who will permit sound public health actions to protect the populations, one can't help but wonder if a goal of disease eradication is feasible under these conditions. Add to this (and I am very much risking condemnation from some colleagues working in the polio eradication initiative) the recurrent appearance of cVDPVs in multiple countries around the world -- in the past 12 months, cVDPV-associated polio cases and positive environmental samples have been reported from 7 countries (see section [1] for more details) -- I can't help but wonder if the time has come for total cessation of use of the oral poliovirus vaccines (mOPV, bOPV, and tOPV), or we will continue to chase after cVDPVs trying to interrupt transmission of all polioviruses worldwide. - Mod.MPP]
