Nigeria - African horse sickness
-------------------------------
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 23 Dec 2022
Confirmed: 20 Dec 2022
Reported: 23 Dec 2022
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 25 May 2007
Causal agent: African horse sickness virus
Serotype: untyped or partially typed
Nature of diagnosis: necropsy, clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Ikoyi, Epe, Lagos
Started: 23 Dec 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered/killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Equidae / 44 / 10 / 6 / 0 / 0 / 33
Affected population: horses were affected. Though local species of horses were present with clinical signs observed, mortality was recorded solely among the Argentine species.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: airborne spread, unknown or inconclusive, fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc), contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering points.
Epidemiological comments: the reason for reporting was selected because there was no other relevant reason for reporting found in the list. The event has been reported in the country before, with no indication of eradication, as active surveillance has not been done. It qualified for immediate notification because of the absence of detection of the disease for a long while and its fatality, high infectiousness, and ability to spread rapidly.

Control measures applied in domestic: movement control; disinfestation; control of vectors; ante and post-mortem inspections.
Control measures to be applied in domestic: traceability; surveillance within the restricted zone; surveillance outside the restricted zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom / Equidae / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 20 Dec 2022 / positive

["African horse sickness (AHS) is an infectious but non-contagious arthropod-borne viral disease affecting all species of equidae caused by an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae and characterised by alterations in the respiratory and circulatory functions. AHS is transmitted by at least 2 species of _Culicoides_. 9 different serotypes have been described. There are 4 classical clinical forms of AHS: pulmonary, cardiac, mixed, and horse sickness fever. The peracute, pulmonary form occurs in fully susceptible animals and has a short course and a high mortality rate. The cardiac, oedematous form has a more subacute course with mortality reaching 50%. The mixed, acute form is most commonly seen and has features of both the cardiac and pulmonary forms. Mortality can reach 70%. Horse sickness fever is an often overlooked, mild form of the disease and is seen in resistant equidae such as zebra and donkeys. Attenuated (monovalent and polyvalent) live vaccines for use in horses, mules, and donkeys, are currently commercially available. There is no evidence that humans can become infected with any field strain of AHSV, either through contact with naturally or experimentally infected animals or by virus manipulation in laboratories."
