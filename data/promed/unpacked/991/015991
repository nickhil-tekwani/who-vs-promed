An outbreak of Rift Valley fever disease has been reported in South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria and Upper Nile states, a government official has announced. Rift Valley fever is a viral disease spread primarily by mosquitoes, which can affect both humans and animals. This was revealed by Dr. Aluma Araba, the Director of Vector and Disease Control in the national Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Tourism.

Dr. Araba said the disease can also be transmitted by taking unpasteurized milk or by eating not-well-cooked meat of an infected animal. "This is the 1st time we are reporting an outbreak of Rift Valley fever disease. We are preparing with emergency response but it would require decision makers to allocate more resources to fight this serious disease", said Dr. Araba.

South Sudan reportedly has the biggest animal resources in Africa, and such an outbreak could have serious consequences for the country's livestock if no quick measures are taken to mitigate the outbreak. Rift Valley fever disease was 1st discovered in Kenya in 1931. It's largely believed to have made its way into the new country through the movement and trade of livestock across the borders.

A workshop [has been established] to develop a contingency plan to map and identify the high-risk areas so that emergency responses can be directed [there], explained Dr. Bernard Betty, the head of ILRI [International Livestock Research Institute] team. She said it would take the collective efforts of government, stakeholders, and NGOs, among others, to bring the outbreak under control. The director for research and development in the Ministry of Agriculture, Professor Erneo B.Och, described the workshop as "tangible" [?] and said the taskforce will be formulated together with [relevant] Ministries and other key stakeholders to stop "losing this important sector and human life". He said South Sudan will stop at nothing less than food security and human protection.

[This government press release conveys no more information than the notification of an outbreak of Rift Valley fever [presumably in livestock] in the Eastern Equatoria and Upper Nile states of South Sudan. Further precise information is requested.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that typically occurs in various areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where virus activity varies from a low-level enzootic cycle to explosive outbreaks covering large areas. Periodically, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) spreads to other areas, including northward into Egypt in 1977 and eastward across the Red Sea into Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 2000. How RVFV travels is unclear but probably involves movement of infected livestock or mosquitoes.

The 1st reported outbreak of RVF in Sudan occurred in 1973 in sheep and cattle in White Nile state; shortly thereafter, RVFV was isolated from a herd of cattle in northern Khartoum. Serologic surveys have detected RVFV antibodies in domestic livestock and in humans from different Sudanese states, including Nile, Khartoum, Kassala, El Gezira, Sennar, and White Nile. A recent seroepidemiologic survey reported a high prevalence of RVFV IgG (immunoglobulin G) among febrile patients admitted to New Halfa Hospital in Kassala state. New Halfa is an extensively irrigated agricultural area about 500 km (310 miles) east of Khartoum. Although the presence of IgG does not indicate recent infection, it does suggest considerable circulation of RVFV in the area at some time in the past. [For further information see: Imadeldin E.

[N.B. with respect to the above, South Sudan became an independent state on 9 Jul 2011, following a referendum that passed with 98.83 percent of the vote. It is a United Nations member state and a member state of the African Union.]
