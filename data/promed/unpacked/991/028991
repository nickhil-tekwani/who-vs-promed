From: Norman MacDonald <nmacdona@scieh.tcom.co.uk>

The increasing incidence of Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA) particularly in
fish-farms around the Scottish coastline has raised some worries here
concerning ISA's potential as a zoonosis.
On the basis of the literature we have so far been able to see, it would
seem very unlikely that ISA is transmissible to humans. We would however be
very glad to hear from anyone who can point us to anything more conclusive.

[Obviously the Scots suspect more than they are revealing, so if anyone has
any information, it would be appreciated if it could be shared with
ProMED-mail, as well as sent directly to Norman - Mod.MHJ
