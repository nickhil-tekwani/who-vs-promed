Sydney dental clinics may have exposed 11 000 patients to HIV
-------------------------------------------------------------
New South Wales (NSW) Health is urging any of the 11 000 patients who visited any of 4 Sydney dental clinics in the last 10 years to visit their GP and be tested for HIV and viral hepatitis after revelation of poor sterilisation practises may have left people at risk. Patients at Gentle Dentist and Dr Starkenburg's clinics may have been exposed to HIV and [viral] hepatitis.

Six dentists have been suspended over hygiene breaches. The SiA DENTIST clinic has been suspended for potentially exposing thousands of people to HIV and viral hepatitis, and has admitted it was "behind the times" in hygiene standards. NSW Health has suspended 6 Sydney dentists and cautioned another 6 over poor sterilisation practices that may have exposed more than 11 000 dental patients to HIV and hepatitis during the past 10 years.

Dr Robert Starkenburg's practices in Surry Hills and Bondi, as well as The Gentle Dentist, owned by Dr Samson Chan, in Campsie and Sussex St, are believed to have potentially exposed some patients to serious diseases -- including hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV -- due to poorly cleaned equipment.

Dr Robert Starkenburg -- who practices in Bondi Junction and Surry Hills -- has been suspended over alleged poor hygiene standards. Dr Starkenburg, 75, is one of 6 dentists suspended over poor hygiene control and is listed by ACON as providing "HIV-friendly" bulk-billed dental work. He said he had been rated an "old duffer" when it came to sterilisation standards. But since being investigated by NSW Health he said he had spent AUD 3000 [about USD 2300] on education courses. "I fully agree I have to step up to 2015 standards and take on the new protocol," he told the Daily Telegraph. "I don't infect my patients but I didn't have a spick and span office like the new guys. But I'm spicko now."

But he said the risk of transmission was low and that no cases had been reported thus far. "It's believed there is a low risk of transmission of infectious diseases in these circumstances," he said. "We have no evidence of infection at this point or if any transmission has occurred. We are hopeful that there will be no transmissions but there will be a risk." Dr McAnulty said the main concern was for patients who had undergone invasive procedures.

Problems uncovered at the practices involved: "the cleaning of instruments, the knowledge of the practitioners and the recording of the results of the sterilising equipment," he said. Patients who have had an invasive procedure at either of The Gentle Dentist practices during the last 10 years or any procedure at Dr Robert Starkenburg's practices are recommended to have testing for blood borne virus infections. Your doctor can organise blood tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infection and results should be available within 7 to 10 days. For further information call the NSW Health information line on 1800 610 344. NSW Health is also trying to contact patients from the clinics to inform them of the potential risk of exposure.

Dr Starkenburg has been suspended from practising, along with 4 dentists from The Gentle Dentist clinic. Another 3 dentists from that clinic have had conditions placed on their registrations.

NSW Health is also trying to contact patients from the clinics to inform them of the potential risk of exposure.

[This alert is an exposure of inadequacies in infection control procedures in several dental practices in New South Wales. There has been no confirmation of actual transmission onwards of HIV and hepatitis viruses from any of these clinics, but the risk is present and all procedures should be revised. It is incumbent on the dental practitioner to protect their patients from the transmission of blood-borne disease. It is unclear from this account whether any of the patients were at risk of infection from the dentist, or as a consequence of inadequate sterility of instruments. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
