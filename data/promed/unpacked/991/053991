----------------------------------------------------------------
On 20 Aug 2021, a human plague case (55 year old woman) who suffered bubonic plague with secondary septicemic plague was reported from the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University (GHNMU) in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia), China. Effective patient treatment, together with enhanced rodent plague surveillance and control, was performed in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Inner Mongolia). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was used in source tracing based on phylogenetic relationship of _Yersinia pestis_ (_Y. pestis_) strains in this event. The _Y. pestis_ strain isolated from the patient in Ningxia and the strain from local _Meriones unguiculatus_ (_ M. unguiculatus_) that were found near the patients' residences were clustered into the same lineage (2.MED3q). Such observations indicated that human plague cases originated from local reservoirs.

Investigation and results
-------------------------
On 20 Aug 2021, a human plague case suffering from bubonic plague with secondary septicemic plague was reported from GHNMU in Ningxia. The patient was a 55 year old female herdsman who lived in Wulan Village, Otog Qi (County), Erdos City, in Inner Mongolia. On 14 and 15 Aug 2021, the patient presented with the onset of nausea and vomiting with low blood pressure and sought treatment in a village clinic, but her condition deteriorated further. On 16 Aug 2021, the patient was admitted to the local county hospital in Pingluo County of Ningxia for high fever (40 deg C / [104 deg F]) with weakness and vomiting. Subsequently, on 17 Aug 2021, she was transferred to GHNMU in Yinchuan City and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock symptoms and left inguinal lymphadenitis. During this period, no coughing, chest pain, or breathlessness was observed. Thereafter, a bacteria culture was conducted on the blood of the patient, and it was examined through a biochemical analyzer in GHNMU; the results of the biochemical analyzer reported that the bacteria in the patient's blood was _Yersinia_ genus. Such results led the clinical doctors in GHNMU to suspect that the patient might have plague and reported this to the Ningxia CDC on 20 Aug 2021.

This human plague case was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with positive results in lymph node aspirates and blood by the Ningxia CDC within 4 hours, targeting the caf1, pla, and YPO0392 genes of _Y. pestis_ (1), as well as the positive results of the colloidal gold-immunochromatography assay and reverse indirect hemagglutination assay (RIHA) test targeting the F1 antigen in lymph node aspirates and blood. The titer of RIHA for the lymph node aspirates and blood were 1:64 and 1:128, respectively. In addition, the bacteria isolated from blood were identified as _Y. pestis_ by Gram staining, microscopy, and a phage lysis test, while the PCR assays were negative in the sputum and throat specimens of the patient.

Based on clinical manifestations and laboratory test results, the patient was diagnosed with bubonic plague with secondary septicemic plague, and she was treated with antibacterials (streptomycin and ciprofloxacin) and recovered.

A _Y. pestis_ (Ningxia 2021) isolated from the 55 year old patient was sequenced by Ningxia CDC. Meanwhile, another strain (Neimeng 2021) isolated from _M. unguiculatus_ 80 m [262 ft] away from the house of the patient was isolated and sequenced by Inner Mongolia CDC. Under the source-tracing mechanism of the Chinese Pathogen Identification Net (CPIN), the patient-related (Ningxia 2021), the strain from _M. unguiculatus_ in Inner Mongolia (Neimeng 2021), _Y. pestis_ strains isolated from Inner Mongolia in 2019, together with _Y. pestis_ genomes in CPIN were compared by the genome-wide SNPs (2). As shown in Figure 1A [for figures and tables, see the original URL], the strain isolated from the patient and the strain isolated from _M. unguiculatus_ 80 m [262 ft] away from the houses of patient were clustered as 2.MED3q lineage, a lineage inherently belonging to the _Y. pestis_ in the Erdos Plateaus _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia in 2019 (2).

In this _Y. pestis_ infection event, the patient was a shepherd, and the family of the patient lived in a comparatively independent house that was located on the Ordos Plateaus _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia. There were a total of 6 families together with the patient's family within a 3 km [1.9 mi] radius of the patient's house. According to reports of local [residents], in the past 2 months, several dead _M. unguiculatus_ had been found in the region before the case of human plague occurred. Because 4 and 3 human plague cases occurred in Inner Mongolia in 2019 and 2020, respectively, with 1 and 2 deaths in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and 2 _Y. pestis_ strains were isolated from _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Otog Qi in 2019, regulations were [in place] in Inner Mongolia so that the local residents should be alerted to dead reservoirs and reports should be made to local CDCs once the affected areas were found. The family of the patient just had moved from Ningxia and been employed by a local inhabitant for only one year, so they did not know of the regulations and neglected to report the dead rat phenomenon. The other 5 families' residents reported the abnormal dead rat phenomenon, and local professional staff conducted rodenticides in residential surrounding areas, but the areas the patient lived in were [not treated].

After the human plague was confirmed, an enhanced rodent surveillance campaign was performed. A total of 2 recently dead _M. unguiculatus_ were found, and the _Y. pestis_ strain was isolated from each dead rat, with one just 80 m [262 ft] away from the house of patient; in addition, over 70 fleas were found on the rat. In addition, there were a large number of fleas inhabiting those reported reservoirs. Such an observation indicated that serious _M. unguiculatus_ plague epizootics with plenty of fleas existed in the patient's living areas and that the patient might have been infected from a flea bite.

Public health response
--------------------
Firstly, before the 55 year old patient was diagnosed with plague, she sought treatment in 4 clinics or hospitals in Inner Mongolia and Ningxia. Therefore, it is critical to strengthen professional training for local clinicians in order to recognize and identify the disease earlier and be alert to various forms of plague. In addition, the patient suffered from bubonic plague with secondary septicemic plague; unlike the pneumonic plague, the bubonic and the septicemic plague has a limited ability for person-to-person transmission (3). Therefore, more reasonable public health measures should be recommended in affected areas.

Secondly, since the human plague cases occurred in 2019 and 2020, the local CDCs had offered the local farmers or shepherds a health box [which included insect repellent (DEET), thermometer, and report card, etc]. Corresponding educational efforts should be enhanced to promote behaviors such as wearing long pants and applying DEET to anyone engaged in outdoor activities in plague focus area; reporting rodent die-offs; avoiding direct contact with sick or dead wild animals (for example, foxes or rabbits); using insecticides and rodenticides to eliminate the fleas and the host animals simultaneously; or [making] insecticide a priority for animal plague control.

Thirdly, the Ordos Plateaus _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia is also adjacent to Ningxia and Shanxi provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) in China (Figure 1B). There are no obvious geographic barriers between the _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia and its counterpart area in adjacent PLADs, so the joint prevention and control, including early together warning and risk communication, are necessary.

In addition, in the process of responding to human plague events in China, the clinics are commonly responsible for finding and treating patients, while the various level CDCs confirm the diagnosis according to evidence based on laboratory assays. In this event, since the biochemical analyzer in GHNMU reported that bacteria in the patient's blood were of the _Yersinia_ genus, even though it did not definitively say that the sample was _Y. pestis_ (due to lacking a corresponding database of bacteria), the clinicians began to suspect that the patient might have plague. It was the 2nd time that such situation had occurred in China, as the 1st occurred in Yunnan Province in 2016 (1). In fact, with the gains in technical competence in hospitals, there are many techniques such as the genome sequencing, biochemical analyzers, and mass-spectrometric techniques that could firstly give the clinicians the clues to plague.

Discussion
---------
The _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia can be divided into 2 parts: the Ordos Plateaus and the desert steppe of the Ulanqab plateaus. Previous studies provided insight into the relationship between plague intensity and the level of precipitation in the semi-arid grasslands of Inner Mongolia (4) -- that is, plague epizootics depend on changes in the density and distribution of local _M. unguiculatus _ (3), while elevated rainfall facilitates increasing population levels of _M. unguiculatus_ (4). A great increase in the local rodent population was an obvious feature in Inner Mongolia _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in 2019 (2). In 2019, a comparatively higher density (3.1/hm2) of the major host in this focus than the historical average level (2/hm2) on the Inner Mongolia Plateau (5) was observed. In 2021, drought was the main feature in Ordos Plateaus. The density of the main host reached to 4.46/hm2, and high flea density is a major feature of Otog Qi in August, such as the percentage of host infested flea was 52.63% with host-flea index of 3.93 in Otog Qi in August 2021. Similar situations could be observed in the adjacent Pingluo county: in August, the percentage index and host-flea index were 59.26% and 2.15, respectively (local plague surveillance data). Such ecological factors -- that is, higher flea density, also aroused a more potent animal plague epidemic with more risk of human infection.

Epizootics of plague in 2018 to 2021 in Inner Mongolia
-----------------------------------------------
Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. Animal-to-animal transmission is mediated by flea bites, while human infection is often an accidental event, including being infected by the bites of escaped bacterium-bearing fleas. Continuous animal plague had occurred in previous years (in 2018, 2019, and 2020) in the _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia, and corresponding surveillance results indicated that animal plague epizootics were still active in the _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia (National Plague Surveillance report).

The _Y. pestis_ strains inhabiting Inner Mongolia belong to 2.MED3 population, while _Y. pestis_ strains in 2.MED3 population were further divided into various lineages (2.MED3a-p) in Inner Mongolia or adjacent PLADs such as Shanxi, Hebei, and Ningxia in China (6) (Figure 1). The _Y. pestis_ strains isolated in 2018 and 2019 in Inner Mongolia could be divided into 3 lineages (2.MED3m, 2.MED3q, 2.MED3r) (2). Previous research found lineage 2.MED3m was a major lineage generally and affected most of the geographical area in Inner Mongolia _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in 2018 and 2019 (2). However, the patient-related stain was 2.MED3q lineage, which was mainly located in the Ordos Plateaus _M. unguiculatus_ plague focus in Inner Mongolia (2).

Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated or sometimes without having a preceding bubo, plague bacteria can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

"The Mongolian gerbil, or Mongolian jird (_Meriones unguiculatus_), is a small rodent belonging to the subfamily Gerbillinae. Their body size is typically [11.0-13.5 cm], with a [9.5-12.0 cm] tail, and body weight 60-130 g, with adult males larger than females. The animal is used in science and kept as a small house pet. Their use in science dates back to the latter half of the 19th century, but they only started to be kept as pets in the English-speaking world after 1954, when they were brought to the United States."
