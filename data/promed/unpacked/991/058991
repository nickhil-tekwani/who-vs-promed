A measles patient visited several sites in Washington, DC, and Fairfax Health officials have confirmed a case of measles in Fairfax County. The infected child may have exposed others to the measles virus. The child was treated at Inova Fairfax Medical Campus and is no longer contagious. The Fairfax County Health Department says the child visited several locations in the county.

Health officials say the child was vaccinated with one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, but it takes 2 doses of the MMR vaccine to provide full protection.

There's a health alert in Northern Virginia. A measles case was confirmed in Fairfax County, and health officials say the child got the virus even after getting a vaccination. News4's Mark Segraves reports on the case.

Measles is spread through coughing, sneezing and contact with secretions from the nose, mouth and throat of an infected person. However, people who have been vaccinated are at very low risk of the disease.

Symptoms of measles can include fever greater than 101 F [38 C], runny nose, watery red eyes and cough, followed by a blotchy rash that appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Symptoms usually appear within 7 to 21 days after exposure.

If you or a member of your family believes you have been exposed, are not vaccinated, and have symptoms of the disease, contact your health care provider. Please call ahead before going to the doctor's office or emergency room and tell them that you may have been exposed to measles.

Here is where and when the infected person was and may have exposed others.

[3] Cambodia (Kratie)
Date: Fri 9 Oct 2015

Months after the country was declared measles free, a case of the highly contagious disease has been confirmed in Kratie province, according to a statement released Thursday [8 Oct 2015] by the Ministry of Health, World Health Organization (WHO), and UNICEF.

"One case of measles was confirmed in Kratie Province on 4 Oct 2015 according to laboratory tests conducted at the National Institute of Public Health ... of a suspected case which was reported on 15 Sep [2015]," the statement said.

In March 2015, the WHO's Regional Verification Commission for Measles declared that Cambodia had eliminated measles, having found no new cases since November 2011.

Thursday's [8 Oct 2015] statement said another possible case had been reported in Kompong Thom province but that further laboratory testing was required for confirmation.

It added that the ministry had sent teams to the 2 provinces for "further detailed investigations" and would launch an emergency immunization campaign in affected areas beginning on 20 Oct 2015.

Shafiqul Hossain, a WHO immunization program technical officer, said on Thursday [8 Oct 2015] that a 13-year-old boy had been infected in Kratie. "We are thinking this is maybe an imported case from another country; we are not sure," Dr. Hossain said, adding that it would likely take another week to know the source of the disease.
