OceanaGold (Philippines) Inc. has warned of the spread of a citrus
disease in this province of Nueva Vizcaya (NV), which is threatening
farm productivity in the country's citrus capital. The spread of the
disease, called the "huanglongbing," is slowly eating up on the
revenue of citrus farms in Kasibu, Nueva Vizcaya. The disease can
destroy harvestable fruits by more than 50 percent.
"Huanglongbing," also called the citrus greening disease, is one of
the most destructive citrus diseases. It is manifested by the
yellowing of the leaf, which then results in poor yield. Almost all
of the citrus areas in Kasibu -- covering more than 1200 hectares
(2965 acres) -- are affected by the disease at different levels of
severity, authorities said.
OceanaGold has been planning to expand its technology-demonstration
farms in Nueva Vizcaya (where its mining project is located) as part
of its Social Development and Management Program (SDMP). But the
spread of the disease may stop the company from planting citrus.
"We're planning to go on a community-wide farming program, but when I
visited our site, I found out citrus has fungal infection. They said
it's so prevalent in the province that agriculturists discouraged us
from doing it," said Lucy Esconde, OceanaGold environment manager.
Dr. Elena Sana, assistant professor at the Nueva Vizcaya State
University (NVSU), said citrus farms in the province are planning to
expand citrus planting up to 2000 hectares (4942 acres). But the
eradication of the disease has to be given priority.
Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), carried by an aphid species, mainly the
black citrus aphid, is also infecting the province's citrus farms.
CTV, also a highly destructive pest, caused in 1981 the death of 50
million citrus trees worldwide. The Nueva Vizcaya Citrus Task Force
has been formed to implement a plan to control the disease, but the
task force needs financing to implement a disease eradication plan.
"We also need funds for the task force. We need to have a legal
entity to be able to raise funds for it," said Sana.
The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has donated disease
detection laboratories for the task force, which will be operational
by year's [2007] end. The task force was formed by the NVSU, the
Kasibu municipality, the Malabing Valley Multi-Purpose Cooperative,
and the Kasibu Citrus farmers' cooperative.
OceanaGold is also collaborating with the Department of Agriculture
and the provincial agricultural office in Nueva Vizcaya and Quirino
on the eradication of citrus diseases.

[Huanglongbing (Chinese for 'yellow dragon disease') in Asia is
caused by the fastidious bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter
asiaticus, which occurs throughout much of Asia and in parts of the
Americas. Its vector is the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina
citri_), but it is also often spread by grafting and possibly seed
transmitted. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close
relatives because of the narrow host range of the vector. It is one
of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and
fruits and leading to stunting and death of trees.
Two other strains of the pathogen -- _Ca._ L. africanus and _Ca._ L.
americanus -- and their vectors exist in the respective areas. Citrus
greening has not been reported from the Mediterranean region or
Australia.
Citrus tristeza virus (genus _Closterovirus_, family
_Closteroviridae_) causes severe leaf and bark symptoms as well as
stunting on a number of citrus species. It is spread by several aphid
species and can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical means.
Different strains of CTV may vary in the symptom severity and
introduction of more severe strains is a constant risk even in
CTV-affected areas. The virus is found in citrus worldwide killing
millions of trees every year.
Disease management for both huanglongbing and CTV includes clean
planting stock, elimination of inoculum, and vector control.
It is not clear if the 'fungal infection' mentioned in the story
refers to a 3rd pathogen (a large number of fungi can affect citrus)
or has resulted from a confusion of names.
