The Johnson County Health Department and KDHE [Kansas Department of Health & Environment] are confirming 2 cases of measles in Johnson County. KDHE spokeswoman Aimee Rosenow says an unvaccinated child and an adult came down with the disease, but it is still unclear how they contracted it. Measles is highly contagious and is spread through the air by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. It usually takes about a week or two for symptoms to appear.

The Buckeye State measles outbreak, which began in April [2014], has topped 200 cases standing at 206 cases and 7 hospitalizations. Knox County, the epicenter of the outbreak, accounts for 128 of the cases (62 percent).

Last week [week of 26 May 2014], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported receiving reports of 288 cases nationally, the most seen in the US in 20 years. Both the Ohio outbreak and several measles clusters reported nationally got their origins in travelers returning from the Philippines. This southeast Asian country has reported in excess of 40 000 cases during the 1st quarter of 2014. The CDC has issued several travel notices for people traveling to the Philippines, the latest one last week.

Coshocton County has had its 1st hospitalization because of measles virus infection. Confirmed measles cases in Coshocton County have risen to 13 people. This is part of the largest outbreak of the highly contagious respiratory disease in Ohio since 1996.

The Coshocton County Health Department said all of the cases have been confined to the Amish community in White Eyes, Perry, and Crawford townships. None had been vaccinated before the start of the outbreak. The last suspected case can be traced back to 23 May 2014. There were 6 confirmed cases on 22 May 2014. The single hospitalization was a woman who has since been discharged and is expected to make a full recovery.

The Ohio Department of Health said there are 206 measles cases in 6 counties, with 7 people having been hospitalized. The largest number is 128 cases in Knox County. It's believed the outbreak can be traced to 4 Amish people in Knox County who had recently returned from a trip to the Philippines.

The 5 cases this year [2014] appear to have been imported from abroad, said Paul Cieslak, who oversees the Oregon Public Health Division's Acute and Communicable Disease Prevention Section. 4 were in Marion County and one in Multnomah County. There were 6 measles cases in Oregon for all of last year [2013]. The numbers typically are in the 0 to 3 range.

Local public health officials have confirmed a measles infection in a King County child who was at [Seattle] Sea-Tac Airport during the contagious period. The person was likely exposed to the measles while overseas.

Most people in our area will have immunity to the measles through vaccination, so the risk to the general public is low. However, all persons who were in the airport around the same time as the individual with measles should find out if they have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously; and call a health care provider promptly if they develop an illness with fever or illness with an unexplained rash between [1 and 16 Jun 2014]. To avoid possibly spreading measles to other patients, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling first to tell them you want to be evaluated for measles.

Delhi has witnessed a spike in measles cases over the last 3 months, the 1st such jump in a decade. The spike has prompted the Delhi Health department and civic agencies to conduct the 1st ground survey in slum areas to test both children and adults. With another 10 days to go for the survey, over 4500 suspected measles cases have been found. So far, 450 people have been admitted to the Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Diseases Hospital (MVID) under the North Municipal Corporation in the last 3 weeks.

A total of 800 cases of measles has been reported this year [2014], with 363 being reported from MVID hospital between January and March, an official said. Authorities at Delhi's Department of Family Welfare said a preliminary report of the survey has been sent to WHO India experts. From [5 to 21 May 2014], 90 lakh [9 million] people have been screened for measles, mostly in congested areas and slums. Dr Dewan said that 90 per cent of high-risk areas -- Sangam Vihar, Mandawali, Mukundpur, Mustafabad, and Karawal Nagar -- have been covered. According to Health department figures, the capital has recorded 202, 217, and 173 diagnosed cases of measles from January to March in the last 3 years.

What is worrying health experts is the "significant number" of children who were detected with measles despite having been vaccinated.

[8] Pakistan (Charsadda District, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) vaccine related

Two more children died on Sunday [1 Jun 2014] after being injected with anti-measles vaccine, taking the death toll from related incidents to 4. A few days ago 2 4-year-old children from the Shabra and Amirabad areas of Charsadda district were injected with the vaccine during an anti-measles campaign. Both expired on Sun 1 Jun 2014. The deaths of 2 more children due to the administration of anti-measles vaccine during the recent campaign has raised the death toll to 4, creating panic locally.

The parents have questioned the quality of the vaccine being used in the anti-measles campaign and condemned the provincial government for continuing the campaign despite the adverse effects of the vaccine on children. Official sources were of the opinion that the major cause of the deaths is untrained staff members providing services in the campaign but the victims' relatives questioned the government's viewpoint and asked why untrained staff was allowed to play with lives of their children.
