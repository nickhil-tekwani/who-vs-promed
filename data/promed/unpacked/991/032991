Mongolian gazelle deaths, suspected anthrax, Sukhbaatar, Mongolia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
According to Mongolian news reports, over 200 Mongolian gazelles
recently died of unknown causes near Nuoluobushan (transliteration)
in Erdenetsagaan Sum [district, near the Sino-Mongolian border of]
Sukhbaatar province. The Mongolian Emergency Situations Agency
preliminarily suspects that the gazelles died due to anthrax infection.

Experts from Mongolian infectious disease prevention and control
agencies have run tests on samples taken from the dead gazelles, and
buried and carried out disinfection of the carcasses. On orders of
the Sukhbaatar provincial governor and the Emergency Situations
Committee, the above-mentioned area has been quarantined and
effective measures taken to prevent the spread of the unknown illness
to neighboring Dornod and Khentii provinces.

the steppe wildlife would also be afflicted.
