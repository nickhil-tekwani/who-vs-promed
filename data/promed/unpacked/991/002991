With the death toll due to Japanese encephalitis shooting up to 149 on
Wednesday, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu has asked
the collectors of the affected districts to "swing into action on a
war-footing" to check the spread of the epidemic. The chief minister
reviewed the serious situation in several districts, particularly Guntur,
Prakasam, Nellore, Nalgonda, Karimnagar and Warangal, in a video conference
with the district collectors. So far this year, 742 cases of Japanese
encephalitis have been reported in the state as of Wednesday.
Naidu spoke to the district collectors and medical and health officers and
other officials. He asked them to take up measures to ensure that "the
epidemic is eradicated completely without further delay". The chief
minister said he would start his district tours from today and personally
inspect the steps being taken in various districts to contain the spread of
the disease. Since pigs are said to be the reservoirs for the virus that
causes the disease, he told the collectors to rehabilitate the pig-rearers
and owners of the piggery units in other occupations. Naidu wanted the
collectors to coordinate with all officials concerned and medical
authorities on a day-to-day basis to take preventive and curative measures.
He asked the collectors to make the village executive officers responsible
for the distribution of Belladona -- the homeo medicine which is effective
for the prevention of the disease.
He also wanted the authorities to give wide publicity on the preventive
measures through newspapers, advertisements, television channels, cinema
slides and distribution of pamphlets, etc. He said as on Wednesday, 742
cases have been reported with 149 deaths. While most of the cases have
been reported from Kurnool, Anantapur, Prakasam and Warangal districts, a
few cases have also been reported from Guntur and Cuddapah.
The district collectors of Prakasam, Anantapur, Kurnool, Nellore, Chittoor,
Cuddapah, Guntur, West Godavari, Warangal, Nalgonda, who participated in
the online video conference, explained to the chief minister about the
various steps taken by them like rehabilitating piggery units, driving away
of stray pigs, distribution of Belladona tablets, cleaning of drains and
surroundings, fogging and spraying operations.
The chief minister took the collectors to task and wondered as to why, in
spite of the steps taken by them, fresh cases are being reported. He wanted
them to take immediate steps to contain the spread of the disease. After
the video conference, answering questions from the media, the chief
minister said that he would initiate all steps to see that Japanese
encephalitis is completely eradicated. The government, he said, would
prepare a master plan for underground drainage in all municipalities and
towns.
Meanwhile, in a health bulletin issued on Wednesday night, Director of
Health K S V Prasada Rao said that 21 fresh cases of Japanese encephalitis
were reported on Wednesday, taking the tally of cases to 742 so far this
year. Four children succumbed to the disease on Wednesday, pushing up the
toll to 149 this year.

[Belladonna, huh? The last report we posted indicated that local
authorities had said "The worst is over" and the outbreak has been
controlled. Between Tuesday and Friday ("today" in Colorado), the reported
number of cases has increased from 660 to 742 (an increase of 82, not 21,
as mentioned above; 12.4%) and the number of fatalities has increased from
138 to 149 (an increase of 11; 8%).
W.H.O. has been involved in assisting in the investigations and malathion
is being used for thermal fogging to kill mosquitoes.
The situation appears to be quite awful with the State preparing plans for
long-term treatment of many children with sequelae. Pigs, the amplifying
host of JEV, are being killed and piggery workers careers being redirected.
As yet, we have had no confirmation that laboratory-based diagnoses of JEV
infection are available, not that there is much doubt that that JEV is the
etiologic agent. Still, in with so many dead or ill children, vaccine
being administered, pigs being slaughtered, and belladonna being given for
treatment, the "worst being over" and the outbreak being "controlled" may
be a bit of a preliminary statement. If they think they can kill pigs and
"eradicate" JEV from that part of India they have another think coming. -
