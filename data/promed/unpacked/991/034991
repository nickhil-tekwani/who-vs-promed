Somali officials have announced that measles outbreak has killed several children in Middle Shabelle region in southern Somalia, Garowe Online reports.

Mandheere district was reported to be among areas where measles has spread affecting many young children, according to district official Salah Mohamed Ali.

In the last 3 days, several children have fallen ill due to the disease amid lack of proper health services and centers to treat the affected children in the district, added Ali.

The official said the sick children couldn't be transferred to the nearest hospitals in Jowhar town, as rains in the past days have blocked main roads leading to Jowhar town.

Ali urged Hirshabelle state administration, Somali Federal government and international organizations to provide immediate health response to the victims of the measles outbreak in the region.

There were almost 100 cases of measles recorded in the South West [of England] last year [2016] - the highest total since the last outbreak in 2013.

The region recorded just 13 measles cases in 2015, but that figure rocketed to 96 in 2016 - making it the 2nd highest region outside London.

Last year's total was not as high as in 2013, when there were 163 which was the 2nd-highest on record in data going back to 1996.

Measles causes fever, a rash, conjunctivitis and can cause serious complications and even death.

Only 7 of the 96 measles cases last year [2016] were in Gloucestershire according to county council stats.

But parents have still been warned to make sure their children are vaccinated from the illness. Across the South West, 92.9 percent of children in 2015/16 were given their 1st dose of the vaccine against measles by their 2nd birthday.

Health Minister Hermann Gröhe said it was necessary to tighten the law because of a measles epidemic.

A mother of 3 died of measles in the city of Essen [Germany] this week [week of Sun 21 May 2017].

The government wants kindergartens to report any parents who cannot prove they have had a medical consultation.

However, Germany is not yet making it an offence to refuse vaccinations - unlike Italy.

Speaking to the popular daily Bild, Mr Gröhe said: "Continuing deaths from measles cannot leave anyone indifferent."

Under the plan, the children of parents who fail to seek vaccination advice could be expelled from their daycare center. The law is expected to be adopted next month [June 2017].

The upper house of the German parliament, the Bundesrat, said forcing kindergartens to report some parents to the health authorities might breach data protection laws.

Italy has recorded nearly 3 times more measles cases so far this year [2017] than for all of 2016.

Last week [week of Sun 14 May 2017] the Italian government ruled that parents must vaccinate their children against 12 common illnesses before enrolling them at state-run schools. The list includes measles, polio, whooping cough and hepatitis B.

By mid-April this year [2017], Germany had 410 measles cases, compared with 325 for the whole of 2016, the Robert Koch Institute reported.

The institute said that besides children, all adults born since 1970 should get immunized against measles, if they had not had the measles jab or had had it only once.

Last week [week of Sun 14 May 2017] a German court ruled that a father could insist on having his child vaccinated, over the objections of the mother. The case concerned a separated couple, and the child was living with the mother.

Italian officials have attacked what they call "anti-scientific" theories which have led to vaccination rates falling well below levels deemed safe to prevent outbreaks.

Those theories include a long discredited link between autism and the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.

A 2010 survey of vaccinations EU-wide and in Iceland and Norway found much variation in policy. The Venice project survey reported that 15 countries had no mandatory vaccinations, and the rest had at least one mandatory vaccination.

The level of compliance was high, including in countries where vaccinations were recommended, not mandatory.

The report concluded that "the label 'mandatory' is not the only driver behind achieving a high vaccination coverage, and many other factors can play a role, such as the use of combined vaccines, prices for the recipient, kind of offer, information and promotional campaigns".

The World Health Organization (WHO) says that since the introduction of 2 doses of anti-measles vaccine across Europe the number of cases has dropped sharply. The total in 2016 -- about 5000 -- was the lowest ever recorded.

But 14 European countries are described as "endemic" for measles, and most cases this year [2017] were reported in 7 of them: France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Switzerland and Ukraine. The largest outbreaks are in Italy and Romania, the WHO says.

The 2nd measles jab needs to be administered to at least 95 percent of the population, the WHO says - a level not reached in the endemic countries.

Children should be screened for their measles vaccination history when they start school, and those lacking evidence of receipt of 2 doses should be vaccinated, the WHO says.

Measles case confirmed in Wellington as officials warn disease could spread unless people get checked.

Regional Public Health in Wellington has warned a single case of measles identified in the region could lead to more unless people get checked.

One person has come down with the disease and Medical Officer of Health Annette Nesdale says anyone who visited the locations [listed in the URL] at the relevant times, and is not immunized, should see their GP.

Ms Nesdale explained ..."We are contacting people who have been in contact with the unwell person because measles is an airborne disease anyone who was at the above listed locations at the times specified, should remain vigilant," she said.

It's easy to opt out of vaccination in Minnesota. All you need do is provide a notarized statement saying you don't want your child immunized. That's how the clear majority of kindergartners who skipped the measles vaccine this year [2017] were able to avoid the shot.

Only 95 current Minnesota kindergartners didn't get the vaccine because of an allergy or other diagnosed medical problem, according to the state Department of Health.

But 1968 kindergartners weren't immunized against measles just because their parents didn't want them vaccinated.

When vaccination rates rise, the likelihood of a measles outbreak decreases and the highly contagious disease can be at bay. That said, some parents want the state to make vaccine exemptions more difficult to get.

Despite pushes to tighten state vaccine policy, Minnesota lawmakers have shown little inclination to change anything.

Rep. Mike Freiberg, DFL-Golden Valley, has a vaccine bill that's repeatedly failed to gain traction in the Legislature. His proposal would require parents to hear a doctor detail vaccine safety information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before opting out. He thinks that would go a long way toward increasing immunization rates.

"If you make it at least as inconvenient, frankly, for them to not get vaccinated as it is to get vaccinated and in the process provide them with medically accurate information, then I think it's very likely that they will actually get their children vaccinated," Freiberg said.

Freiberg hopes the ongoing measles outbreak will persuade lawmakers his bill would improve public health in Minnesota. He said Republicans who control the Legislature have shown a willingness to take a closer look at his proposal next year [2018].

Vaccine opponents in Minnesota promise to fight any steps to make vaccination mandatory. There's a relatively small, but vocal, cadre of groups linking measles vaccination with health problems and autism -- despite widely accepted science to the contrary.
Leo Cashman, who heads the Minnesota Natural Health Legal Reform Project, said requiring vaccination tramples on parental rights. "We are opposed to any attempt to weaken the parental right to choose on the question of the child's vaccinations," he said.

"If you make it at least as inconvenient, frankly, for them to not get vaccinated as it is to get vaccinated and in the process provide them with medically accurate information, then I think it's very likely that they will actually get their children vaccinated."

[There are currently 68 cases of measles reported in Minnesota, almost exclusively in Hennepin County. See ProMED-mail Measles update (27) http://promedmail.org/post/20170516.5039511 for earlier update on the outbreak in Minnesota prior to this jump to 68 cases. The cases are almost exclusively in U.S.-born children of Somali descent.

The Washington Post reported on 5 May that MMR vaccination rates among U.S.-born children of Somali descent used to be higher than among other children in Minnesota. But the rates plummeted from 92 percent in 2004 to 42 percent in 2014, state health department data shows, well below the threshold of 92 to 94 percent needed to protect a community against measles.

[It is concerning] that Wakefield, a British activist who now lives in Texas, visited Minneapolis at least 3 times in 2010 and 2011 to meet privately with Somali parents of autistic children, according to local anti-vaccine activists. Wakefield's prominence stems from a 1998 study he authored that claimed to show a link between the vaccine and autism. The study was later identified as fraudulent and was retracted by the medical journal that published it, and his medical license was revoked.

Read the full article from 5 May and see a figure of the plummeting vaccine rate in Minnesota (http://wapo.st/2r7JbZe).
