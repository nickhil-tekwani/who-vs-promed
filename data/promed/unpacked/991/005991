On Mon 8 Aug 2011, the local service of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal
Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] registered one more
case of poisoning from wild mushrooms in Voronezh. A 1 year 4
month-old girl picked and ate a mushroom in the forest, which caused
poisoning. The girl is currently in the hematology unit of regional
children's clinical hospital No 1.

Since the beginning of the year [2011] there have been 27 mushroom
poisoning cases in the region. 6 of the cases were children and 2 of
them have died. The regional administration has issued a ban for wild
mushroom trading because of the high number of cases.

[The short article indicates there is clearly a problem with
identification of mushrooms. These wild delicacies can be quite good
but can also be deadly when misidentified. - Mod.TG
