Measles warning issued
----------------------
Patients at a Wellington medical centre and passengers on several
international and domestic flights may have been exposed to highly
infectious English [in contradistinction to German] measles.
Wellington Regional Medical Officer of Health Annette Nesdale issued
a warning today [7 Feb 2009] after a child who returned from Viet Nam
on 29 Jan 2009 was diagnosed with the disease. Dr Nesdale said people
who came in contact with the child needed to watch for symptoms
including fever, tiredness, runny nose, coughing, and sore red eyes.

"Measles is a highly infectious disease that makes children, and
sometimes adults, quite unwell for a week to 10 days," she said.
Measles was rare in New Zealand due to immunisation but the disease
could spread rapidly among unimmunised groups, she said. "We are
really wanting to get this information out to people over the long
weekend as if they develop symptoms it is important they get medical
advice to ensure they don't inadvertently spread measles further."

The child flew from Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, to Singapore via
Singapore Airlines on 29 Jan 2009. That evening the child left
Singapore for Auckland then boarded a connecting Air New Zealand
flight to Wellington on 30 Jan 2009. The child was also seen at the
Wellington Hospital Emergency Department on the afternoon of 1 Feb
2009 and the morning of 3 Feb 2009 and at the Karori Medical Centre
on 2, 3 and 4 Feb 2009.

Those waiting for blood tests at the medical centre may also have
been exposed. Dr Nesdale said anyone with symptoms should seek
immediate medical advice but should also call ahead to warn doctors
about the possibility of measles.

People born before 1969 were considered protected as the infection
was common prior to that date. People born after 1989 [?1969] would
be protected if they were vaccinated [According to the Immunisation
Advisory Centre of New Zealand website "Immunisation is recommended
one time for all persons born after 1960 who lack evidence of
immunity to measles (receipt of live vaccine on or after the 1st
birthday, laboratory evidence of immunity, or a history of
physician-documented measles)".

A [highly infectious virus (measles)] has prompted a public health
alert. People on some international and domestic flights might have
been exposed to measles virus infection, which has been diagnosed in
a child who has returned to New Zealand from Viet Nam. The child flew
Singapore to Auckland on 29 Jan 2009, and boarded a flight to
Wellington the following day.

People at Wellington Hospital's Emergency Department on 1 Feb or 3
Feb 2009 might have crossed the child's path. The child was also seen

Anyone with symptoms of a fever, tiredness, runny nose, coughing, and
sore red eyes is being urged to seek immediate medical help.

[Because of its geographical location New Zealand is vulnerable to
importation of infectious disease. Currently Viet Nam is experiencing
an extensive outbreak of measles, mainly affecting young people and
adults aged between 18 and 40 years of age, who presumably have not
been protected by childhood vaccination. The National Hospital for
Tropical and Infectious in Hanoi began to receive patients in late
November 2008, increasing to 250 by late January 2009. Patients came
from various northern provinces, including Hanoi, BacGiang, Hung Yen.
However, up to 90 percent were living in the Hanoi region. [For
additional information see PRO/MBDS> Measles - Viet Nam: adults 20090204.0488].

Travellers to Viet Nam should ensure that they have been vaccinated
against measles virus infection for their own protection and to
prevent as indicated by this alert importation of the infection into
other communities. - Mod.CP]
