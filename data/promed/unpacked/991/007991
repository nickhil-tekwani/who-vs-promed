INFLUENZAVIRUSES, REASSORTMENT POTENTIAL

[Influenza viruses have been placed (International Committee for Taxonomy
of Viruses) in the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenzavirus A is in the
genus _Influenzavirus_ A,B. All viruses of this family have multi segmented
RNA genomes, influenzavirus A having 8 segments. Differences in
hemagglutinins (H) and neuraminidases (N) are used to characterize and
describe isolates. Thus, there is considerable potential for reassortment
of RNA segments in hosts simultaneously infected with more than one virus
of the genus. - Mod.CHC]
Medical experts said on Thursday that Hong Kong must stamp out a deadly new
"bird flu" virus before the peak influenza season [is reached] in March.
[Under optimum transmission conditions it is increasingly likely] that it
could mutate into a more easily transmitted human strain. "The potential
exists for influenza viruses to mix with one another to exchange their
genes," said Malik Peiris, Associate Professor of microbiology at the
University of Hong Kong. "There is a possibility that the genes of this
avian H5 virus might mix with one of the existing human viruses, like the
H3 virus, and you might have a virus that is more efficiently transmitted
person to person," he said in a radio interview. John Tam, a virology
professor at the Chinese University, said the strain needed to be
eradicated before March. "If the H5 virus hangs around until March, there
is a chance that a person will be infected by the human flu virus and the
H5 virus," he said in the South China Morning Post. With such a
combination, Tam said: "You'd have a new virus which would have the ability
to spread among humans easily."
CDPC Note: The potential for dual infections in humans of H3N2 and H5N1 is
present in southern China and in other areas of the world where there are
large numbers of birds, including chickens. But how predictable and what
the probability may be that such mixing of influenza viruses will result in
the next human pandemic strain is the $64 question. Such episodes [might]
have occurred periodically in southern China and in other parts of the
world. The finding of human cases of H5N1 infections in Hong Kong is one of
the first solid documentation of the transmission of an animal flu virus to
humans. However, it seems likely that the swine flu virus was also
transmitted from swine to human and then minimally from person to person in
1976. For influenza "experts" to predict that the current situation in Hong
Kong will almost certainly lead to the next human influenza pandemic strain
is like predicting the next major earthquake in San Francisco based on a
few minor tremors detected in Berkeley. The big public health question is
whether identification of animal flu outbreaks and then mass slaughter of
the implicated animal(s) can prevent the next major human pandemic.
Outbreaks of fowl influenza virus have been well documented in many parts
of the world over the past decades and control programs have been directed
at eliminating the virus because of it's devastating impact on the
economics of chicken farming, not because of concerns and hysteria
regarding the development of the next human pandemic influenza virus.
