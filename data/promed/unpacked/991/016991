[1] China, several provinces, spread, control in poultry

China has banned live fowl trading in some areas after more human H7N9 infections and deaths have been reported in several provinces.

According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the bird flu has killed 19 in China this year [2014], and the total number of human infections has reached 96.

Live poultry trading was halted in Hangzhou, Ningbo and Jinhua cities in eastern Zhejiang Province, which has reported 49 human H7N9 infections, including 12 deaths this year [2014]. The province has launched emergency surveillance of poultry farms, haunts of migrant birds and parks, in addition to halting the flying of domestic pigeons.

Shanghai, which neighbors Zhejiang, will halt live poultry trading from 31 Jan to 30 Apr 2014 and strengthen surveillance of poultry and industry staff. The city has reported 8 human H7N9 infections in January 2014, 4 of whom died, including one doctor. The city's health authority will make use of media to publicize prevention information about H7N9.

Guangdong Province in south China reported 26 new H7N9 cases and 4 deaths so far in January 2014.

Hong Kong's health authority on Mon [27 Jan 2014] evening confirmed an H7N9 case at a local agricultural market and will cull about 20 000 birds in the market on Tuesday [28 Jan 2014] morning.

Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of the Beijing Disease Prevention and Control Center, said Monday [27 Jan 2014] that the capital had enough test reagents for suspected H7N9 infection cases. The center will strengthen training and check-ups on infection control in medical institutions, according to Pang.

Other provinces, such as Jiangsu, Fujian and Hunan also reported new H7N9 cases.

Improved surveillance methods and networks have increased the possibility of confirming new cases, but this does not mean a more rapid transmission of the virus, said Zhong Nanshan, director of the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Guangdong Province.

"It deserves high attention when the infection cases increase by dozens or hundreds of times. Currently, public panic is unnecessary given the slow transmission speed," he added.

Zhong suggested adjustments to epidemic control tactics, including the early and longer use of the antiflu drug Tamiflu for H7N9 patients.

The government should explore the poultry consumption model of mass slaughter and frozen products, suggested Zhang Yonghui, director of the Guangdong Center for Disease Prevention and Control.

Hangzhou is planning to close live poultry trading markets permanently and promote the supply chains of frozen poultry products instead, Zhang Hongming, acting mayor of the provincial capital of Zhejiang, told Xinhua.

China has also made progress in vaccine research for H7N9.

Hualan Biological Engineering Inc. said in early January 2014 that the H7N9 vaccine developed by its subsidiary Hualan Biological Bacterin Co., Ltd. had passed an initial examination and was being handled by the food and drug watchdog in central Henan Province, but it will be a long time before the production of H7N9 vaccines.

With the epidemic developing in some areas, the Chinese government has been on high alert. The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine intensified H7N9 bird flu virus monitoring at borders to prevent cross-border transmission.

Staff at customs will measure body temperature, conduct medical inspections and report on the health of passengers.

The National Health and Family Planning Commission said Monday [27 Jan 2014] that sporadic H7N9 cases will continue in some cities. The commission urged local health departments to strengthen prevention and control measures and ensure the implementation of them during the Spring Festival.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong on Sunday [26 Jan 2014] called for coordinated efforts to prevent and control H7N9 avian flu, urging local departments to keep on high alert and cooperate in prevention and control of the disease.

Experts said on Monday [27 Jan 2014] that a large-scale H7N9 epidemic is unlikely during the Spring Festival holiday, as no H7N9 virus mutation that could affect public health has been identified.

"There is no evidence of regular inter-human transmission, and the risk assessment of an H7N9 epidemic outbreak is unchanged," said Shu Yuelong, director of the Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC).

According to a plan for human H7N9 infection diagnosis and treatment issued on Sunday [26 Jan 2014], the majority of human H7N9 infections are sporadic cases, and there has been no evidence for consistent human-to-human infection, but limited, single human-to-human transmission cases cannot be ruled out.

On top of the increased incidence of human H7N9 infections and the control measures implemented, several points deserve added attention:

1. The information from Shanghai about "8 human H7N9 infections in January 2014, 4 of whom died, including one doctor;" for details and commentaries, see 20140120.2219204 and 20140122.2223976.
2. The information that Zhejiang Province, which has reported 49 human H7N9 infections including 12 deaths this year [2014] has launched "surveillance of poultry farms, haunts of migrant birds and parks, in addition to halting the flying of domestic pigeons." These are severe and, in fact, highly unusual measures; how will the flights of pigeons be halted?
3. The 1st H7N9 positive case in poultry in Hong Kong (see item 2 further);
4. It is encouraging to note that the development of an H7N9 vaccine has been initiated and is under (early stages) of testing. It may be assumed that this is a human vaccine, and it will be interesting to note whether an animal vaccine is contemplated as well. Since H7N9 does not seem to cause clinical disease in poultry, vaccine has not been demanded by farmers. - Mod.AS]

[2] Hong Kong, imported

Hong Kong will cull approximately 20 000 chickens after discovering the H7N9 avian influenza virus in a batch of poultry imported from mainland China, authorities said on Monday [27 Jan 2014].

The positive reading came just days after the southern Chinese city introduced widespread testing of imported live poultry following growing public concern over the safety of imports, particularly from the mainland.

Two people have died from the human form of the virus in Hong Kong since the 1st infection was publicly reported in December [2013].

On Friday [24 Jan 2014], the city introduced a serological test for H7 avian influenza in live poultry and soon discovered a batch that tested positive for the virus.

"A government department has confirmed that the sample from the chicken imported from the mainland tested positive for H7N9 avian influenza virus," Hong Kong health minister Ko Wing-man told reporters late Monday [27 Jan 2014]. "All the poultry in the wholesale market will be destroyed tomorrow morning [Tue 28 Jan 2014]. The total number of chickens concerned amounts to 20 000," Ko said, declaring the market to be an "infected place."

The government's decision comes less than a week before Lunar New Year, which starts on Friday [31 Jan 2014], when chicken is a popular dish at banquets and family gatherings.

"Because we have to close the wholesale poultry market ... for the next 21 days, there will be no supply of live chicken," Ko said, suggesting that residents eat frozen chicken instead.

The market in the Cheung Sha Wan region of the city, which holds imported poultry for the city until cleared of infection, will be closed for disinfection.

Hong Kong culled 17 000 chickens in December of 2011 and suspended live poultry imports for 21 days after 3 birds tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu virus.

A 65-year-old Hong Kong man with H7N9 died on 14 Jan 2014, less than a week after he was infected with the deadly virus. He was found to have travelled to the neighbouring mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen a week before he was infected.

An 80-year old man died on Boxing Day last year [2013] after he was infected with the virus.

Hong Kong is particularly alert to the spread of viruses after an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) swept through the city in 2003, killing 299 people and infecting around 1800.

The H7N9 outbreak began in China in February 2013 and reignited fears that a virus could mutate to become easily transmissible, potentially triggering a pandemic.
