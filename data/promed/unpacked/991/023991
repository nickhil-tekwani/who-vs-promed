- From 1 Jan - 6 May 2018, a total of 1894 suspected cases have been reported from 21 states. Of these, 423 were confirmed positive, 10 are probable, 1460 are negative (not a case) and 1 is awaiting laboratory result (pending).
- Since the onset of the 2018 outbreak, there have been 106 deaths in confirmed cases, 10 in probable cases. Case Fatality Rate in confirmed cases is 25.1 percent.
- 21 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 70 Local Government Areas (Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Anambra, Benue, Kogi, Imo, Plateau, Lagos, Taraba, Delta, Osun, Rivers, FCT, Gombe, Ekiti, Kaduna, Abia and Adamawa); 18 states have exited the active phase of the outbreak while 3 states remain active - Figure 1.
- In the reporting week 18, no new healthcare worker was infected [see recent suspected case below]. Thus far, 37 health care workers have been affected since the onset of the outbreak in 8 states: Ebonyi (16), Edo (12), Ondo (3), Kogi (2), Benue (1), Nasarawa (1), Taraba (1), and Abia (1) with 8 deaths in Ebonyi (6), Kogi (1) and Abia (1).
- 81 percent of all confirmed cases are from: Edo (42 percent) Ondo (23 percent) and Ebonyi (16 percent) states.
- Currently, 7 cases are being managed in 4 treatment centres across the country.
- A total of 5012 contacts have been identified from 21 states. Of these 106 (2.1 percent) are currently being followed up, 4895 (97.7 percent) have completed 21 days follow up while 11 (0.2 percent) were lost follow up. A total of 81 symptomatic contacts have been identified, of which 28 (36 percent) have tested positive from 5 states (Edo-13, Ondo-8, Ebonyi-3, Kogi -3 and Bauchi-1).
- National RRT team (NCDC, WHO and NFELTP residents) batch D continues to support response in Plateau, Kogi, and Adamawa states.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner multi-agency Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels, however response has been de-escalated due to continual decline of cases over the past 11 weeks.

[The incidence of Lassa fever cases appears to be slowing. The Lassa fever virus transmission season usually lasts into June, so more cases can be expected. The new cases reported over the past week with the graphs of the epidemic curves, continue to indicate that the peak number of cases nationally has passed. New cases have occurred over the past few days in 3 states. The follow-up of thousands of contacts with so few uncontacted is remarkable. As noted in previous comments, providing adequate surveillance and timely treatment over such a large geographic area is challenging. Fortunately, there is international help participating in treatment and surveillance. No additional health care people have been confirmed as infected during this week, but a suspected case in a laboratory worker is reported below.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the source URL above.

[2] Laboratory worker case suspected
Date: Tue 8 May 2018

A laboratory attendant working with the Kidney Care Center, Medical Village, Ondo town, has been reportedly killed by Lassa fever. It was learnt that the deceased died last [Sat 28 Apr 2018] after being diagnosed of the deadly disease.

The death of the health officer came a few months after Lassa Fever was said to have been contained in Ondo state.

"One of her relatives in Port Harcourt had earlier been infected with Lassa Fever. She went there to visit that relative who has also died. So, it was in Port Harcourt she was infected with the disease," a source said.

The incident was said to have caused panic among workers in the hospital.

A source told Independent on [Tue 1 May 2018] that workers at the health facility were currently working in fear. She said: "We don't know what to do. One of us has been killed by Lassa fever. We have appealed to the management to conduct medical test for us. But the CMD [Chief Medical Director] did not want us to cry out because of the image of the hospital and the state. Our lives are at risk now. We expect the hospital to have taken our blood sample to Irrua Specialists Hospital to check whether any one of us has been infected or not but they have done nothing about it."

Another source accused the Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Akinwumi Akinbodewa, of playing politics with the issue. He alleged that the hospital management was aware of the suspected case of Lassa fever in the hospital but refused to take action.

The state Commissioner for Health, Wahab Adegbenro, said there were no more cases of Lassa fever in the state. Adegbenro confirmed the death of the medical worker in the hospital but said she died of a complication of a liver problem and not of Lassa fever.

"It is not correct. We have not gotten any new cases in Ondo State. It is true that somebody, who was a member of staff of the hospital, died of a liver problem that led to some complications.

"Her blood sample has been taken to Lagos. But the clinical evidence did not support Lassa fever. We are expecting the result on [Wed 9 May 2018]," the commissioner said.

The CMD declined to react to the allegation, saying he could not grant an interview on the telephone.

[This situation is confusing. It is not certain that the laboratory worker died of Lassa fever. That will become clearer when the laboratory results are reported. If it does turn out to be a Lassa fever case, the situation under which the laboratory worker might have been exposed is not mentioned. Laboratory infections have occurred and transmission can occur if blood or tissues are handled without adequate isolation facilities and use of personal protective equipment. However, if this is a Lassa fever case, the exposure to the virus may have occurred when the worker visited a Lassa fever virus infected relative. - Mod.TY]
