Lumpy skin disease, Israel

Report date: 7 Sep 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 7 Sep 2013
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: November 2007

Causal agent: Lumpy skin disease virus
Nature of diagnosis: suspicion, clinical, laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced), necropsy

[The report includes details of 137 outbreaks recorded since the previous follow-up report no 10, submitted on 20 Mar 2013. For the details of each outbreak please refer to the source URL above. - Mod.AS]

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 138
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 20 372** / 1206 ** / 116 / 33 / 0
** Incomplete information

Epidemiological comments: the disease continues to spread towards the south and west of the index outbreak. Lately, many dairy herds have been affected (in most of the farms small number of diseased animals). Modified stamping out [measures] have been practiced in these herds (euthanasia of the animals with clinical signs). It seems that in the winter the vectors prefer warmer stables (dairy) then open-air, cooler, and windy areas (beef). On 11 Mar 2013 the disease appeared for the 1st time during this event outside the northern part of the country. Following a vaccination campaign, there is a drop in the number of seriously diseased animals.

Measures applied: control of arthropods, quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), dipping/spraying, modified stamping out, no treatment of affected animals.

[The current (continuing) lumpy skin disease outbreak in Israel started in July 2012. According to OIE's summary, the accumulated data, as of 7 Sep 2013, are the following:

Total outbreaks: 232 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 54 462** / 5701** / 618 / 353 / 0

The initial, immediate notification, all 11 follow-up reports, and a map of all outbreaks are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014029_20130909_171915.pdf.

Follow-up report no 11 does not provide information on the updated number of vaccinations performed, probably because a significant portion of the vaccinations are not performed anymore by State employees (Field Veterinary Services) but, in line with revised IVSAH's [Israeli Veterinary Services Animal Health] policy, also by (authorised) private practitioners. General, countrywide vaccination of cattle has become operational in Israel since March 2013 and the incidence of disease has dropped abruptly, though sporadic cases are still being seen, as apparent from the follow-up report no 11 (3 of the outbreaks started in August 2013). 2 live attenuated vaccines have been applied, namely the (fortified) sheep pox vaccine "POX-10," manufactured by JOVAC and the Neethling lumpy skin vaccine, manufactured by OBP. Investigations into the safety and efficacy of both vaccines under field conditions have been undertaken cooperatively by the State Veterinary Services, the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, and the "Hachaklait" Clinical Veterinary Services. Preliminary results are expected. An update of total vaccinations performed might be expected to be included in Israel's annual report for 2013.

LSD in cattle has been reported also from Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and Jordan. The disease is known to be endemic in Egypt. An unofficial report has been received from Turkey but so far it has not been notified to the OIE; a TV report, showing typical clinical cases, can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8CHUR4p9ho&feature=youtube (thanks to Sabine Zentis). The disease has also been suspected in Iraq and the Arab peninsula. LSD is believed to have been circulating in Syria at least since the 1st semester of 2012, so far remaining undiagnosed or not reported.- Mod.AS
