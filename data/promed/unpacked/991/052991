2000/165 Outbreak of _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ in
the Netherlands [edited
---------------------------------------------------------------
During the 2000 growing season in the Netherlands _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest - causal
agent of potato ring rot) was found in ware potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_
cv. Premiere) on a farm.
An earlier isolated finding was reported in 1999 (see EPPO RS 99/056). The
infection was discovered following the finding of suspect symptoms in the
field in mid-July 2000 and was confirmed by the end of September by
laboratory testing using the official EU method (EU Council Directive
93/85/EEC).
Seed potatoes had been planted in 2 fields cv. Premiere originating from
the same lot. Both crops were found to be infected with ring rot. All
other lots [from this farm were tested for ring rot and found
free. Additionally, 3 sister lots of the infected lot were grown on other
farms in the Netherlands. One is confirmed to be infected and the 2 other
lots are under investigation, and are suspected to be infected with ring
rot. The origin of the infection is still under investigation.
All necessary measures have been imposed on crops, fields and farms [in
order to prevent any further spread and to eradicate the disease,
according to the EU Council Directive on the control of potato ring rot
(93/85/EEC).
The ware potato crops in which ring rot was found were grown from the same
source of seed potatoes in the Netherlands. This is the first time that a
clonal relationship has been identified in the occurrence of ring rot in
the Netherlands. Surveys for ring rot have been conducted in the
Netherlands since 1962. The results of these surveys and the risk of
introduction were evaluated yearly and served as a basis for adjusting the
intensity of the survey.
This has resulted in a gradual increase in survey intensity, which was
increased even more for the 2000 harvest [because of the outbreak. The
situation of _C. michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ in the Netherlands can
be described as: Present: only at a few locations, under eradication.
