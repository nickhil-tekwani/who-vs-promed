Public health officials investigating an _Escherichia coli_ outbreak in Dorset have informed parents of a possible further case involving a child at Blandford Children's Centre. The children's centre only recently reopened after several children that attended there fell ill with the O55 strain of _E. coli_.

Tests on all nursery users and staff then revealed a further 8 people who have not suffered any symptoms but who have been found to be carrying the bacteria. The nursery was thoroughly cleaned, and only children and staff that had tested negative for _E. coli_ were allowed to return.

However, Public Health England (PHE) said that a child who originally tested negative for _E. coli_ has now displayed symptoms of the infection and could be a possible further case. PHE also confirmed it had not yet found any common link between the 13 people who have been ill with the _E. coli since July 2014.

[There are several aspects of this continuing cluster of cases, some of which developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, that are peculiar.

The organism itself is rare and had not been described in the UK since 1994. _E. coli_ O55:H7, interestingly, is thought to be a direct ancestor of _E. coli_ O157:H7 (Zhou Z, Li X, Liu B, et al. Derivation of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 from its O55:H7 precursor. PLoS One 2010, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008700).

The cluster has been smoldering on since July 2014, and, except for the nursery school cases, there has been no link found between the other cases.

A new case appears to have been found in a child who had previously tested negative. It is possible that the child was infected outside the nursery school. - Mod.LL
