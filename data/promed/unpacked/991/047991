Epidemic alert sounded as bacterial disease fells 6 elephants in
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
----------------------------------------------------------
The death of 6 elephants in 15 days due to bacterial disease has
shocked forest officials and experts as they fear it may become an
epidemic affecting about 5630 elephants residing in a 9751-sq km area.
3 elephants in Byilore range of Biligiri Rangawildlife sanctuary and 3
in Satyamanagala range in Tamil Nadu succumbed to the disease
haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) or Pasturellosis. Principal chief
conservator of forests (wildlife) BK Singh said the postmortem report
confirmed the disease.

After contracting the disease, the pachyderm gets high fever and vital
organs fail and the animal dies within 3 to 36 hours. The carcasses of
the elephants were found rotting inside the forest. The disease
spreads through cattle. To prevent its spread, health authorities have
intensified a vaccination drive for cattle in and around the forest
areas.

"Though there have been such sporadic deaths in the past, it has not
occurred in the recent past. I will visit the place again and examine
the situation," said Singh.

But experts say this is not enough. There is an urgent need to stop
cattle from entering forest areas by strengthening patrolling as other
animals such as deer, lion and bison also face HS threat.

Noted elephant expert and director of Centre for Ecological Sciences,
IISc [Indian Institute of Science], Prof R Sukumar said this bacterial
disease spreads through direct contact, contaminated feed and water.
Though it spreads mostly through water bodies, inhalation (air-borne)
is another route.

Further, since elephants stay in herds, HS will spread if one of them
is infected. Young ones are likely to be infected 1st. Also if water
is contaminated and herds drink from the same waterhole, they could
all be infected. Vigil should be maintained in all forest areas as
elephants are migratory in nature. In case of captive elephants, they
are camping in K Gudi. Cattle stray into the eastern side (where
Byilore is).

It is impossible to collect and test samples of water from all water
holes and tissue samples of all elephants. Hence forest officials
should ensure that tissue samples of any ailing or deceased animal
they come across should be immediately tested so that the spread of
disease is curtailed, Sukumar said.

Recent research found that though HS mainly affects cattle, elephants,
gaurs and wild dogs also get infected. The organism which causes the
disease is Pasterella of the species 'multocida'. This disease is
usually endemic in nature.

Sukumar said utmost care is needed to tackle the disease. Elephants
need to develop immunity against HS. But since there is a large
elephant population in Karnataka forests, weaker ones may die if one
among the herd is infected with HS.
