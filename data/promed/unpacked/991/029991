Western Australia's (WA) fruit growers are counting the costs and
considering management options following the state's loss of its area
apple scab free status. Apple scab is a fungal disease that infects
leaves and fruit, making fruit unsaleable.

The area free status was lost after an outbreak in Mount Barker
earlier this year [2008] and industry difficulties in meeting
associated costs. Orchardist Ben Darbyshire of WA Fruit Growers
Association (WAFGA) said WAFGA was currently costing area freedom
re-establishment. It was also preparing for the future without area
freedom status -- instead establishing "high health" protocols for growers.

WA produces 30 000 tonnes [of apples], which is 11 percent of the
national total. "Until 3 Apr 2009, WA was the only state in Australia
free from the disease," Mr Darbyshire said. "WAFGA's preferred
position is to maintain area freedom." If responsibility for managing
apple scab moved from WA Agriculture Department to growers, a cost
imposition would be involved. "Unchecked, it will destroy crops and
trees," he said.

[Apple scab, also called black spot, is caused by the fungus
_Venturia inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically
important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often
unmarketable and losses can be more than 70 percent. The pathogen
infects only species of _Malus_, while other fungi in the same genus
are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops. Symptoms
may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall, and fruit lesions.
Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit
and are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are
spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing
rain and carried long distances in air currents. Disease management
is expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays a year in areas
where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their
susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of
them are currently suitable for commercial production.

Apple scab is currently present in eastern Australian states. In WA,
several outbreaks of the disease have occurred, including in 2008
(ProMED-mail post 20080514.1621). An eradication and surveillance
plan was carried out successfully following each detection. WA's
geographical isolation with about 2100 km (1305 miles) to the nearest
infected orchards in South Australia was, until now, considered to
justify the eradication efforts. For WA to be the only commercial
apple-growing area in the world without established apple scab
represents significant savings and trade advantages to the regional
apple industry, but this status seems now in jeopardy due to funding
difficulties.
