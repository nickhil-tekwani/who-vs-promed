Japan: Transmission of Hepatitis B Virus Via Blood Transfusion
-------------------------------------------------
The Japanese Red Cross Society revealed on Sat 19 Jul 2003 that a man had
become infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) after receiving a donation of
HBV-tainted blood that had passed through its safety checks undetected. The
case involves a 75-year-old man who became infected with HBV after
receiving a blood transfusion in 2000 at a hospital in Nagasaki Prefecture.
After the man developed the symptoms of HBV infection, the Red Cross
initiated an investigation into the case.
The inquiries revealed that the blood used in the transfusion had come from
8 donors, one of whom was later found to have HBV, but with a viral load so
low it slipped through the improved Nucleic Acid Test blood-testing system
introduced in autumn 1999. The revelation raises concerns that HBV-infected
blood donated by carriers with a low viral load can slip through current
safety tests, opening the way for the spread of the disease. Medical
experts said the Red Cross will have to review its testing system and
improve its accuracy, as the donor's blood passed all of the society's tests.
The donor had donated blood several times over the past 5 years and has not
developed the symptoms of HBV infection, the Red Cross said. Detailed
analyses that the society conducted on samples of blood newly drawn from
the donor showed that the viral count was one-third the minimum level that
could be detected by the current testing system. Red Cross researchers also
found minute amounts of the virus in blood samples from the donor held for
reference at the time of donation. According to the society, the Nagasaki
man is the only person to have contracted HBV infection from blood donated
from the donor. However, it admitted that the follow-up investigations
could not cover all recipients of blood from the HBV carrier, as some of
them are dead.
The Red Cross has so far believed that HBV-infected blood that could slip
undetected through the current testing system would be limited to blood
from persons who are in the early stages of infection called the "window
period." The risk of low-viral-count HBV blood donors spreading the disease
is considered to be higher than that involving window-period carriers,
since blood donated by them can be remain undetected irrespective of how
many times they have donated blood, the medical experts said.
