This [southern] summer [2015], 3 new Ross River virus diagnoses have been made in the capital, prompting calls for Canberrans to protect themselves against mosquito bites.

ACT [Australian Capital Territory] Health figures show this summer [2015] has already brought more cases than in each of the past 2 years; however, it is unclear where the infections occurred.

"Of the 3 cases of Ross River virus diagnosed, all 3 reported interstate travel during the incubation period, and it is possible it was acquired [out of state]," a Health spokeswoman said. There were 5 cases for 2014 as a whole, an average year, with 3 of those acquired [out of state].

Ross River infections in NSW [New South Wales state] have doubled from last year [2014]; 322 diagnoses were made since September [2014]. There was one case of Barmah Forest virus -- also commonly passed by mosquitoes -- in the ACT last year [2014], but no new cases this summer.

Australian National University biologist Alex Maier said people should not be complacent about getting bitten by mossies. "Mossie bites are underappreciated in what they can actually do; everyone's annoyed [by them], and they get itchy, but the actual risk of being infected is not appreciated," he said. "Every single bite is potentially infectious."

The parasitologist, an expert in malaria, said the insects were critical for the ecological balance and could breed anywhere with water, from a puddle in a tire, a can, or the drainage in homes. An ACT Health spokeswoman said the numbers of mosquito-borne disease cases increased during summer, with people advised to cover up when outside, wear a mosquito repellent, and empty water out of outdoor containers.

Experts have attributed increased NSW mosquito numbers to a wetter and warmer spring and summer and have warned of a potential Australia Day mosquito surge due to a king tide on the NSW coast [A king tide is a local term for spring tide, or an especially high tide during the month. - CopyED.MSP]. The spokeswoman said mosquitoes' limited flight range meant the king tide would have no direct effect on the capital's mosquito population but said travellers to coastal areas should take precautions to avoid being bitten. [A 'king tide' is an especially high tide event occurring twice a year, when there is alignment of the gravitational pull between sun and moon. - Mod.JW]

Dr Maier admitted he had been caught without protection recently. "I was working in the garden on the weekend, and by the end of day I had 35 bites," he said. Ross River virus [disease] can present with rash and flu-like symptoms and lead to joint pain, fatigue and muscle aches.

[With 322 cases of Ross River virus (RRV) infection already diagnosed, NSW is off to a significant number of cases this transmission season. RRV transmission to humans, although sporadic in Australia, occurs during the wet season, when vector mosquitoes are abundant. RRV is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. Although not fatal, it causes acute polyarthritis [pains in the joints] in humans that may persist long after the acute phase of the infection is over. The recommendations to avoid mosquito bites are prudent.
