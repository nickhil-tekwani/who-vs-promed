A 25 kg (55 lb) Spanish mackerel caught off the mid north coast over the weekend [1-2 Mar 2014] sent 9 people to hospital with ciguatera poisoning. The fish was caught near Scotts Head, south of Macksville mid morning on Sunday, 2 Mar 2014.

One of the fishermen Peter Joyce said he and the boy who caught the mackerel cleaned it and divided it up. He said the fish was shared with family and friends, and those who ate it were then rushed to hospital early yesterday [3 Mar 2014] morning.

Joyce added, "About 6 hours after eating the fish they nearly all landed in hospital. The people that are in hospital suffered from like tingling all across the body, cold water feeling giving them a hot sensation, vomiting, diarrhea, and extreme lethargy. They were as 'weak as kittens' as one of the patients put it.

Meanwhile recent outbreaks of ciguatera poisoning have forced a rethink of the rules regarding the sale of large pelagic fish on the north coast. It comes after the weekend incident at Scotts Heads, and the poisoning of 4 others at Evans Head in February 2014.

The general manager of the Ballina Fishermen's Co-op, Phil Hellard, said it appears affected fish are being caught further south. "We do have a risk management strategy in place that says anything that was caught north of Byron Bay that weighed more than 10 kilos [22 lb] couldn't be taken for human consumption, and that's worked for us, he said.

"With these new cases we've now instituted a ban on all fish over 10 kilos in the mackerel species."

[Pelagic fish (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagic_fish) live in the pelagic zone of ocean or lake waters -- being neither close to the bottom nor near the shore -- in contrast with demersal fish, which do live on or near the bottom, and reef fish, which are associated with coral reefs.

The following is taken from CDC: Cluster of ciguatera fish poisoning -- North Carolina, 2007. MMWR 2009; 58(11): 283-5 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5811a3.htm; edited; original citation numbering retained):

"Ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble cyclic polyether compounds and are the most potent sodium channel toxins known (3). Carnivorous tropical and semitropical fish, such as barracuda, amberjack, red snapper, and grouper, become contaminated with ciguatoxins by feeding on plant-eating fish that have ingested _Gambierdiscus toxicus_ or another member of the _Gambierdiscus_ genus, a group of large dinoflagellates commonly found in coral reef waters (4). Gambiertoxins from _Gambierdiscus_ spp. are converted into more potent lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. Spoilage of fish that have been caught is not a factor in toxin development, and cooking does not deactivate the toxin. Humans who eat contaminated predatory fish are exposed to variable concentrations of ciguatoxin, depending on the fish size, age, and part consumed (toxins concentrate more in the viscera, especially liver, spleen, gonads, and roe). The attack rate can be as high as 80 to 90 per cent in persons who eat affected fish, depending on the amount of toxin in the fish.

"Persistence or recurrence of neurologic symptoms are hallmarks of CFP [ciguatera fish poisoning]. 3 of the 9 patients in this cluster had recurrences of one or more symptoms for more than 6 months after their initial illness. If these patients are again exposed to fish (either ciguatoxin-contaminated or even non-contaminated fish), their symptoms likely will be more severe than those experienced with their initial episodes of CFP (3).

"Variations in the geographic distribution of the various ciguatoxins might explain regional differences in symptom patterns. CFP symptoms associated with eating fish from the Pacific Ocean are primarily neurologic, and symptoms associated with eating fish from the Caribbean Sea are more commonly gastrointestinal (4). Amberjack often is linked to CFP cases in the Caribbean. Although the amberjack fish responsible for this cluster of CFP cases tested positive for C-CTX-1, it was not tested for the presence of other ciguatoxins, which also might have been present and could have altered disease presentation (7).

"CFP has been associated almost exclusively with eating fish caught in tropical or semitropical waters, but increased global marketing of these species has increased the possibility that persons in temperate zones might become ill with CFP (4). Moreover, warming seawaters might expand the ranges of ciguatoxin-contaminated fish (8). In the USA, such fish have been found as far north as the coastal waters of North Carolina. Despite underreporting, CFP now is considered one of the most common illnesses related to fish consumption in the USA (9).

"Any level of Caribbean ciguatoxin 0.1 ppb [parts per billion] or more of fish tissue is thought to pose a health risk (3). As this illness becomes more common in nontropical areas of the world, clinicians need to be aware of its manifestations and how to manage it. Although opinions vary on the most effective course of treatment, intravenous mannitol has been a mainstay of management of neurologic symptoms for more than 20 years. Early mannitol treatment is considered more effective, but anecdotal evidence suggests that even delayed therapy benefits some patients. Amitriptyline also has been useful in relieving some of the neurologic symptoms of CFP (10). If evaluating a possible case, clinicians should consult their local poison control center for the latest treatment guidelines.
