Mississippi: Four More Human Cases of West Nile Fever; Total Now Eight
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mississippi State Department of Health today announced confirmation of 4
more human cases of West Nile virus (WNV), 2 from Hinds and one each from
Jackson and Yazoo counties. Additionally, 3 probable cases were reported
from Forest, Rankin and Pearl River counties. "With the inclusion of the
first confirmed case, this brings the total number of confirmed and probable
human cases to 8," said State Health Officer Dr. Ed Thompson, "Additionally,
there are 3 more persons being evaluated and are regarded as suspect for
West Nile virus."
WNV has now been identified in numerous regions around the state. Testing
completed through the State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has revealed a
total of 21 birds and 7 horses that are positive for WNV and are located in
the following counties: Benton, Bolivar, Coahoma, Hinds, Humphreys, Hancock,
Harrison, Jackson, Leflore, Panola, Pike, Pearl River, Scott, Wilkinson, and
Washington.
"WNV is neither new nor unique to us," emphasized State Health Officer Dr.
Ed Thompson. "We identified WNV in animals in Mississippi in the summer of
2001, and we're quite familiar with 3 other mosquito-borne viral diseases
seen in Mississippi, including St Louis encephalitis, eastern equine
encephalitis, and LaCrosse encephalitis. These arboviruses are about equally
dangerous to humans. In 2001, Mississippi confirmed WNV in 25 horses and 3
dead blue jays from 4 Northeastern Counties and Coahoma County.
