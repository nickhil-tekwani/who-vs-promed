The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) reports 33 new cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) have been found following the testing of 24 486 free-ranging Missouri deer through its 2017-2018 sampling and testing efforts. The new cases were from the following counties: Adair (3), Cedar (1), Franklin (4), Jefferson (1), Linn (7), Macon (3), Perry (1), Polk (3), St. Clair (4), and Ste. Genevieve (6).

Of the 33 new cases, 16 were from hunter-harvested deer, one was from a road-killed deer, and 16 were from MDC's post-season targeted culling efforts in the immediate areas around where previous cases have been found. This year's findings bring the total number of free-ranging deer in Missouri confirmed to have CWD to 75.

"For a 3rd year in a row, we found no CWD-positive deer in central Missouri, where a single case was confirmed in early 2015," said MDC Wildlife Disease Coordinator Jasmine Batten. "Additionally, we found no cases of CWD on the Missouri-Arkansas border, despite the high level of CWD in northwest Arkansas." Batten added that where CWD has been found in Missouri, the numbers of positives remain relatively low.

"It is encouraging that cases of CWD are still pretty low overall, and MDC remains committed to monitoring the disease and taking actions to limit its spread," she said. "We encourage hunters and landowners to continue participating in our CWD monitoring and management efforts." Batten added that these efforts are vital in limiting the spread of the disease. "If we do nothing, areas affected by CWD will increase in size and many more deer will become infected by the disease," she explained. "Over time, this would lead to significant long-term population declines."

MDC will continue CWD sampling this fall and winter.

[So far, so good. The testing for the 2017-2018 hunting season is done and a total of CWD affected deer was 75 and not increasing over previous years. Good news in a hard situation. - Mod.MHJ
