Blood tests designed to detect active tuberculosis (TB) are
inaccurate and should be banned, the World Health Organization has
said. More than 2 million such tests are carried out annually, but the
WHO says they are unethical and lead to misdiagnosis and the
mistreatment of patients. The organisation's review of these
tuberculosis test kits says they give wrong results in around 50
percent of cases. The kits are mainly sold in the developing world.
However, most of the 18 kits on the market are produced in Europe and
North America.

The tests work by detecting antibodies or antigens in the blood that
are produced in response to the bacterium. But some of these
commercial tests have what's called "low sensitivity" which leads to
large numbers of patients being told they do not have TB when they do.
Dr Karen Weyer, who is also from the WHO Stop TB department, added:
"The evidence we reviewed over the past couple of months shows that
one in 2 patients will be wrongly diagnosed, either [as] false
negative or false positive. If it's a false negative, patients get the
all clear when they in fact have TB, the disease continues to spread,
and the patients may die. If, on the other hand, it's false positive,
patients are put on treatments unnecessarily while the true cause of
their disease remains undiagnosed. We would describe this as unethical
-- and we are making a very strong urge to governments to consider
that TB is a threat and the use of these ineffective tests is also a
threat."

The WHO says that the tests, which are manufactured in Europe and
North America, are prevented from going on sale where they are made
due to regulations that call for extensive evidence of accuracy. But
this is not the case in the developing world -- including in India and
China. Dr Weyer added: "One of the major problems is that these
developing countries often have little or very weak regulatory
mechanisms to make sure that tests are registered before they are used
at country level. Another problem is that these tests are often used
in the private sector, which is a difficult sector to regulate and as
a result there is a wide misuse, I would say, of these inaccurate
tests in the private sector in at least 17 countries that we are aware
of."

She said there was a need for a TB test that could be used "at the
bedside". But she added: "We don't have a blood test for TB that can
be used at the point of care level."

The WHO says this call for a ban is a highly unusual move -- it's the
1st time the organisation has issued an explicitly negative policy
recommendation against a practice that is widely used in tuberculosis
care.

TB kills 1.7m people every year, and is the biggest cause of death of
people living with HIV.

[An estimated 9 million new cases of tuberculosis occur worldwide
each year. The World Health Organization's goal for tuberculosis (TB)
control is to detect 70 percent of new, smear-positive TB cases.
However, many cases go undetected
(http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.TBS.DTEC.ZS), with a global
case detection rate of just 61 percent.
(http://www.tbevidence.org/documents/news/dtbd.pdf). The problem is
particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa where less than half of
incident cases are detected. Untreated smear-positive pulmonary
disease clearly is detrimental as these patients act as a reservoir
for continued transmission.

Active, symptomatic pulmonary tuberculosis is currently diagnosed on
the basis of sputum smear microscopy and culture. Sputum microscopy is
relatively rapid, but confirmatory culture may take more than 4 weeks.
In addition, determination of drug resistance may take an additional 4
or more weeks. In December 2010, WHO endorsed the Xpert MTB/RIF, a
fully automated NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) for the
diagnosis of both TB and rifampin resistance. Rifampin resistance is a
marker for multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Xpert MTB/RIF
provides an accurate diagnosis in about 100 minutes compared to
current tests that can take up to a total of 3 months to have
results.

A recently published study (Boehme CC, et al: Rapid Molecular
Detection of Tuberculosis and Rifampin Resistance. N Engl J Med. 2010;
363(11): 1005-15. Available at
http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0907847) found that Xpert
MTB/RIF was 98.2 percent sensitive in patients with sputum
smear-positive, culture-positive TB, 99.2 percent specific in patients
without TB, and 97.6 percent sensitive in patients with rifampin
resistance. Further, among patients with smear-negative,
culture-positive tuberculosis, a single Xpert MTB/RIF, was 72.5
percent positive, but the addition of a 2nd MTB/RIF test increased
sensitivity by 12.6 percentage points, and a 3rd by 5.1 percentage
points, to a total of 90.2 percent.

The commercial blood tests that the news release above refers to are
said to "detect antibodies or antigens in the blood that are produced
in response to the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_." These blood tests
are thus different from US FDA-approved blood tests called
interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs that can aid in diagnosing
TB, including both latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and
tuberculosis (TB) disease. IGRAs (QuantiFERON(R)-TB Gold and
T-SPOT(R).TB test) are whole-blood tests that measure release of
interferon-gamma (IFN-g) from white blood cells when mixed in vitro
with antigens derived from _M. tuberculosis_. Test results are
generally available in 24-48 hours.

People with LTBI are asymptomatic and the only sign of TB infection
is a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test or a positive IGRA.
However, if _M. tuberculosis_ are multiplying in the body, the person
will get sick with TB disease and may have positive sputum smears and
culture and an abnormal chest radiograph. IGRAs, as with the
tuberculin skin test, cannot differentiate infection associated with
TB disease from LTBI. A diagnosis of LTBI requires that TB disease be
excluded by medical evaluation, which should include checking for
suggestive symptoms and signs, a chest radiograph, and, when
indicated, examination of sputum or other clinical samples for the
presence of _M. tuberculosis_
(http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/testing/IGRA.htm).

For further discussion of these blood tests, see an article published
in The New Yorker magazine in the 15 Nov 2010 issue, "Letter From
India. A Deadly Misdiagnosis" by Michael Spector
(http://www.tbevidence.org/documents/news/Specter_NewYorker_2010.pdf)
and a Lancet article also in November 2010 on point-of-care diagnosis
for TB by Kelly Morris
(http://www.tbevidence.org/documents/news/Morris_TLID_2010.pdf). -
