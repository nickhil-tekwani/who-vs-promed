Ebola-like virus to hit Lake Erie fish again
--------------------------------------------
VHS [Viral hemorrhagic septicemia] causes fish in Lake Erie to
hemorrhage. The state tries to protect the hatcheries. A virulent
virus that causes fish to bleed to death is expected to strike Lake
Erie again this summer [2007], fouling shores and endangering
hatcheries. An outbreak killed hundreds of perch and sheepshead last
spring [2006] and, with no known cure, wildlife experts predict even
more deaths this spring as the Ebola-like virus spreads to more areas
of the lake.

"Our biggest concern is keeping it out of the fish hatcheries," said
Elmer Heyob, the state's fish hatchery administrator.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia, or VHS, has infected at least 37 fish
species throughout the Great Lakes. The virus can cause fish to bloat
and hemorrhage before dying. But it poses no threat to humans even if
they eat infected fish. The virus was detected in the Great Lakes in
2005, but researchers tested an archived fish from 2003 and found the
virus. It showed up in Lake Erie last spring [2006], after water
temperatures rose.

The optimal temperature for the virus is 40 to 60 deg F. Lake Erie
water temperatures currently range from the upper 30s to low 50s.
Outbreaks have been greatest in the St. Lawrence Seaway and lakes
Erie, Ontario and St. Clair, and are a top priority at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS), said spokeswoman Karen Eggert.

"We do see this as a possible threat to fish in the United States,"
Eggert said.

The agency held public meetings on the virus in January [2007] and is
drafting an interim rule regulating the interstate movement of
affected species. Fish experts say the biggest worry is stopping the
virus before it spreads out of the Great Lakes into hatcheries and
inland waterways. In Ohio, researchers are trying to kill the virus
in walleye eggs so the eggs can be used in hatcheries. Fairport
Harbor biologists plan a fishing trip in mid-May to test for the virus.

"We hope the fish develop an immunity," said Roger Knight, Lake Erie
fisheries administrator. "Some fish got it, but did not die."

Knight and others in the state's wildlife office in Sandusky [OH]
fielded many calls last May and June [2006] from lakefront property
owners upset by the sight and smell of dead fish. In Port Clinton,
city workers had to use a dump truck to haul away the sheepshead.
Fishing boat captains, however, say they are more worried about bad
weather than the nasty virus.

"I haven't had anybody say a word about being worried about the
virus," said Capt. John Welch, who operates Lake Erie Fishin' Edition
Charter in the Western Basin.

Thumper Charter Capt. Ron Johnson, just back from a successful day of
fishing for walleye on Monday [30 Apr 2007], said he's not a bit
worried. He ran into a large patch of dead sheepshead last summer
[2006] in the Central Basin, but the smell didn't run him out on the water.

There are many types of perches. The sand perch can be seen at:

Viral hemorrhagic disease affects freshwater and saltwater fish. The
causative virus is in the family _Rhabdoviridae_ and is a
_Novirhabdovirus_. The disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic
carriers, or by clinically ill fish. It can be transmitted through
the water or through direct contact. The virus is also carried in
sexual fluids, urine and feces. When the water has an overall
temperature of 20 deg C [68 deg F], the infectivity of the virus is
lost in approximately 24 hours. Conversely, the infectivity is
maintained for several days when the water temperature is a constant
4 deg C [39.2 deg F]. Therefore, it stands to reason that the
incubation time is related to water temperature and ranges from
between 7 and 15 days.

There are 3 different syndromes associated with the virus outbreak.
Those 3 symptoms include nervous, chronic and acute. They may overlap
to the point that all of these may be seen at one time during an
outbreak. Some fish may hemorrhage, some may be seen to have
neurological signs, such as swimming in circles. It is considered a
reportable disease in many states in the USA. - Mod.TG]
