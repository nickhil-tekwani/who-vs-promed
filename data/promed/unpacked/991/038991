Sharpshooters kill hundreds of elk to contain dangerous wasting disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal sharpshooters have begun destroying a herd of about 700 elk
on a farm in southeastern Minnesota where chronic wasting disease
(CWD) was discovered this year [2009].

Sharpshooters with the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Wildlife
Services shot elk Friday [18 Sep 2009] and Monday [21 Sep 2009] on
the farm near Pine Island, after the federal agency reached an
agreement with the herd's owners concerning compensation and cleanup.
A cow elk at Elk Farm LLC -- the largest such farm in the state --
was found to have the disease in January [2009], and the herd has
been quarantined since.

The 1300-acre [526 ha] farm was purchased in 2006 by Tower
Investments of Woodland, California, and is part of 2300 acres [931
ha] the firm plans to develop north of Rochester for a bioscience
research and manufacturing center called Elk Run. It would include 15
to 25 bioscience companies, as well as offices, shops and homes,
officials say.

"This is very sad situation for all of us at Tower Investments,"
project manager Geoff Griffin said. "But it's totally out of our
control. The good thing is, it does not affect our development."

All of the elk will be killed over the next 10 days or so and tested
for the fatal brain disease, then will be disposed of, said Paul
Anderson, assistant director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.
None of the meat can be salvaged for human consumption.

"There's no evidence that it causes disease in people," Anderson
said, "but with a known infected herd, we just would not take any
risks with humans."

Tower Investments will be compensated for the animals by the
Agriculture Department. Federal officials said Monday [21 Sep 2009]
that they're unsure what the total cost will be.

To prevent the spread of CWD to wild deer, the top couple of inches
of topsoil on the farm will be removed and stored behind a fenced
area for 5 years, Anderson said. Tower Investments will pay for that,
he said. "Normally, we'd require that fences stay up (on a farm) for
5 years," Anderson said, "but because of the need to develop that
land, they will remove the soil and pile it up behind a fence for 5
years."

The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) also plans to test 3000
deer for CWD that are expected to be killed by hunters this fall in
southeastern Minnesota. The testing, which will cost more than USD
200 000, was prompted by the presence of CWD at the Pine Island elk
farm and by the proximity of deer in the region to Wisconsin, where
wild deer have been infected with CWD, said Ed Boggess, DNR policy
section chief. The US Department of Agriculture will pay about USD 70
000 of the cost, he said.

Though no elk have escaped from the Pine Island farm, Anderson said 2
wild deer somehow managed to get inside the fenced farm and were
destroyed. Since the disease was first found in the state in a
captive elk herd in 2002, DNR officials have been concerned that it
could spread to Minnesota's approximately 1 million wild deer. There
are about 20 000 captive deer and elk in the state, and the disease
can be spread through nose-to-nose contact. The infected elk at Pine
Island was the 6th captive deer or elk in the state found to have CWD.

The DNR has tested more than 30 000 wild deer, and none has tested positive.

[Chronic wasting disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy
disease; the same family of diseases as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease, and scrapie affecting sheep.
While the family of diseases generally produces wasting of the
affected animal and often neurological signs such as stumbling, CWD
has never shown to transmit to humans and has been around since at
least the 1950s, most especially in the western mountain region of
the US. - Mod.TG]
