Major carp die-off at Calamus
-----------------------------
A major die-off of carp has occurred in the lake at Calamus State
Recreation Area near Burwell, Nebraska. There will be limited
clean-up of the dead fish from the shoreline, according to the
Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.

Dead carp were 1st reported Sunday [22 Aug 2010]. The cause of the
die-off is unknown. Game and Parks biologists have taken samples of
live carp to test for Koi herpesvirus, which only impacts carp.

[If no other fish are affected, meaning only carp are affected, then
this is suspicious of Koi Herpesvirus. Carp are a type of Koi.

Koi herpesvirus (KHV), also known as cyprinid herpesvirus-3 or
CyHV-3, is a highly contagious viral disease capable of causing
significant morbidity and mortality in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_). In many countries, the common carp is a foodfish and also
has been selectively bred for the ornamental fish industry, where it
is known as Koi. Almost all countries have reported KHV, which was
1st recognized in 1996 in England. However, publications (Pokorova et
al.) in 2005 report that Australia does not have the disease.

The most significant sign of KHV is the sudden appearance of mass
mortality within 1-2 days of initial infection. Aside from mass
mortality, the other common signs are white patches or necrosis of
the gills. Other clinical signs are sunken eyes, bleeding gills, and
secondary bacterial infection or parasite infestation.

There is no treatment for KHV. Prevention is the key. For cultured
fish, inquiring about any mortalities may give a buyer a clue that
some fish may be carriers.

[2] Fish - New York: suspect stress or VHS

DEC investigating Cazenovia Lake fish kill
------------------------------------------
State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) officials are
investigating a fish kill on Cazenovia Lake that has affected mostly
largemouth bass and a few panfish.

Daniel Bishop, the DEC's regional fisheries manager, said reports of
bass being caught on the lake with lesions (red sores) were brought
to his attention a couple of weeks ago. 4 live bass were collected
and sent to Cornell University for analysis. Since that time, an
undisclosed number of dead bass and a few assorted panfish have been
spotted floating on the water by anglers. A DEC staff is on the lake
today [26 Aug 2010] trying to collect additional live samples for
Cornell, Bishop said.

Bishop and Paul Bowser, professor of aquatic animal medicine at
Cornell University's school of veterinary medicine, both said there's
no reason at this point to get overly concerned. There's no evidence
that the fish in the lake are infected with VHS (viral hemorrhagic
septicemia), a fish-killing disease that in recent years has resulted
in restrictions on the transportation of baitfish from one body of
water to another. Also, Bowser added, it doesn't appear that the fish
were affected by milfoil defoliant chemicals that have been added to
the lake this year and last to get rid of weeds. He said he'd
probably have final test results completed by next week.

"Unless something has changed, this is not going to be alarming," he
said. "It's probably a stress-induced thing from the incredibly hot
summer we've had."

[While the DEC does not suspect viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS),
the red lesions on the fish do not seem like a stress response from
the hot temperatures that have blanketed most of the US until this
past week when some coolness began to infiltrate some places such as
New York. While this may not be VHS, it is suspicious of something
more than stress. - Mod.TG]
