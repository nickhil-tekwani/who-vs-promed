EFSA [European Food Safety Authority] has published its 1st EU summary report on the monitoring of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) in cattle, sheep and goats. Previously, the annual reports on TSEs were compiled by the European Commission. [The report, which addresses 2 TSEs (BSE [Bovine spongiform encephalopathy] and scrapie), provides 2015 results on data collected by all EU Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. - Mod.AS]

EFSA reports that in 2015, 1.4 million bovine animals were tested and 5 cases were detected in 4 member states (MS) (Ireland: 1 case; Slovenia: 1 case; Spain: 1 case; and the United Kingdom: 2 cases) and 1 case was detected in Norway.

A total of 2 cases (in Ireland and the United Kingdom) were affected by classical BSE and both cases were born after the EU-wide feed ban enforced in 2001. The remaining 4 cases were atypical BSE cases (3 H-BSE type and 1 L-BSE type).

Since 2002, approximately 8.4 million small ruminants have been tested [within] the EU-wide surveillance for scrapie [annual mean of nearly 650 000 sheep and goats]. In 2015, 319 638 sheep and 135 857 goats were tested. In total, 641 scrapie cases in sheep were detected in 18 MS while 1052 scrapie cases in goats were detected in 9 MS, respectively. In 2 non-MS (Iceland and Norway), 40 scrapie cases in sheep were detected.

Although in a number of MS the decrease in classical scrapie is clear, at the EU level there is no clear decreasing trend in the occurrence of scrapie in small ruminants. Results obtained from genotyping in sheep confirm that cases of classical scrapie are clustered among certain genotypes, and animals with these genotypes seem to account for less than 20 percent of the European randomly sampled sheep population. In total, 580 samples from species other than domestic ruminants were tested for TSE in 3 MS, all with negative results.

Processed animal protein (PAP) produced from ruminant carcasses, some of which were infected, are assumed to be the transmission route of BSE in feed for farmed animals. This led to a [PAP] feed ban in 1994, which prohibits the feeding of mammalian processed animal protein to cattle, sheep and goats.

The ban was expanded in January 2001 with the feeding of all processed animal proteins to all farmed animals being prohibited, with certain limited exceptions. This is to ensure that there is no cross-contamination between feed containing PAP intended for species other than ruminants and feed intended for ruminants. Only certain animal proteins considered to be safe (such as fishmeal) can be used, and even then under very strict conditions.

There are 2 forms of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), a TSE disease:
1. Classical BSE, which is transmitted via the feed and was the cause of the BSE epidemics in the 80s, 90s and 2000s; and
2. Atypical BSE (with 2 types of Atypical BSE: the L-type and the H-type), which is considered to be a spontaneous and sporadic disease, not linked to the feed given to the animals, occurring at a very low prevalence rate in old bovine animals.[The entire EFSA report can be visited at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4643/full. - Mod.AS]

[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal neurological disease of adult cattle that was 1st recognised in Great Britain and that has been identified in classical (C-type BSE) and atypical forms. Both C-type BSE and atypical forms have been detected in cattle indigenous to most European countries, the Americas, and Asia and the Pacific. BSE is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease. The C-type BSE epizootic resulted from oral exposure to prions in the ruminant-derived protein of meat-and-bone meal and milk replacers included in animal feedstuffs. As a result of control measures, C-type BSE epizootics are in decline. The C-type BSE agent is also believed to be the common source, via dietary routes, of TSEs in other ruminant species and felidae. There is evidence of a causal link between the C-type BSE agent and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. Recommendations for handling BSE-infected material assume that BSE is a zoonosis and manipulations with potentially contaminated material must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis. The archetype for the TSE group of diseases is scrapie of sheep and goats.

Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats, known since several millennia, characterised by the typical spongiform encephalopathy changes which have been observed since 1986 also in cattle TSE, namely BSE. The 'classic' scrapie is contagious among sheep and goats but, contrary to classic BSE, not known to infect humans. The more recently identified condition known as atypical scrapie has some clinical and pathological features similar to classical scrapie but it is not considered to be transmitted in field situations.

Variant CJD (vCJD), the human TSE attributed to infection from consumed prion-contaminated bovine tissues (primary cases) but sporadically also by an iatrogenic route (secondary cases) is recognised since 1993. As of 5 Dec 2016, the total number of primary vCJD cases in humans, worldwide, is reportedly 228, of which 175 in the UK and 53 in 11 other countries as follows: France (27), Spain (5), Rep of Ireland & USA (4 each), Italy & Netherlands (3 each), Canada and Portugal (2 each), Saudi Arabia, Japan & Taiwan (1 each). The accumulated number of secondary vCJD cases, worldwide, as of 6 Dec 2016, is 3 (all in the UK) (additional details at http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/documents/worldfigs.pdf).

Subscribers are referred to a paper published in Jun 2016 (Ref 1), according to which 3 of the investigated vCJD non-European cases of which the site of infection was pending, are shown - based upon diagnostic and epidemiological findings - to have been infected in Saudi Arabia.
