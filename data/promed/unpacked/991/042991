Health officials are asking visitors to stay away from Talarico Place [extended care home in Castlegar, British Columbia] as they are trying to contain a respiratory infection outbreak at the facility.

Interior Health declared the outbreak at the extended care home on [27 Dec 2019] and expects it to be a bit longer before the status changes. 2 incubation periods of 4 to 14 days (depending on the infection's cause) must pass with no new cases before the outbreak can be declared over.

Interior Health says the virus causing the trouble is parainfluenza. It causes symptoms of cough, runny nose, and fever. In elderly and immune compromised people, it can lead to severe infections.

During the outbreak, people are asked to limit visits to essential needs only and wear a mask and wash hands frequently if they have to visit the facility.

Interior Health also says that staff at the facility have done a great job limiting the spread of the virus and no recent cases have been reported.

[Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) commonly cause upper and lower respiratory illnesses in infants, young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, but anyone can get infected. After a person becomes infected, it takes about 2 to 7 days for symptoms to develop.

Symptoms of upper respiratory illness may include fever, runny nose, and cough.
Symptoms of lower respiratory illness may include:
- croup (infection of the vocal cords (larynx), windpipe (trachea), and bronchial tubes (bronchi);
- bronchitis (infection of the main air passages that connect the windpipe to the lungs);
- bronchiolitis (infection in the smallest air passages in the lungs);
- pneumonia (an infection of the lungs).
Other symptoms of HPIV illness may include sore throat, sneezing, wheezing, ear pain, irritability, and decreased appetite.

A person can have multiple HPIV illnesses in their lifetime. Types of HPIVs:
- HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 both cause croup, with HPIV-1 most often identified as the cause in children. Both can also cause upper and lower respiratory illness, and cold-like symptoms;
- HPIV-3 is more often associated with bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia;
- HPIV-4 is recognized less often but may cause mild to severe respiratory illnesses (https://www.cdc.gov/parainfluenza/about/symptoms.html). - Mod.UBA
