The Provincial Veterinary Office (PVET) here has started to investigate the deaths of 14 carabaos that were feared to have been due to anthrax.

The 14 carabaos were from anthrax zone in Sto. Niño, specifically in barangay Abariongan Ruar, Balagan and Cabayo; Liwan and Enrile; Logung and Calintaan, Amulung; and in Tamban, Alcala. The Cagayan Provincial Information Office said provincial veterinarian Dr. Noli Buen had alerted the public on buying meat due to reported anthrax. He said a blood sample will also be conducted to check if the cause of death of the carabaos was due to anthrax disease.

Last December [2022], PVET had confirmed the presence of a case of anthrax in Sto. Niño. Some of the carabaos tested positive for anthrax disease, which may have been the cause of death of 4 carabaos in Barangay Calassitan, Sto. Niño in December [2022]. The 4 dead carabaos showed symptoms of anthrax, such as sudden death, lack of appetite, difficulty in moving, and the presence of blood in their urine. Based on the result of the test, the 4 carabaos were confirmed to be infected with anthrax.

There were 73 people in Brgy. Calassitan, Sto. Niño who were exposed and 22 had skin wounds and needed to go to isolation for thorough observation in December [2022].

[The initial report had 12 dead carabao as of 3 Jan 2023. There are now 14, meaning that 2 have died since or the PVET Dr. Buen went out and counted the carcasses. Taking further blood samples is wise and normal when investigating livestock deaths from anthrax to confirm any diagnoses. In due course, there should be a further report spelling out what Dr. Buen found.
