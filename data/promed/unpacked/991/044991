Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Salto, Arenitas Blancas, Salto
Date of start of the outbreak: 7 Feb 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Dogs / - / 13 / 0 / 2 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comment: On 3 Feb 2015, a leishmaniasis research team of the Veterinary Faculty was informed by private veterinarians of a suspicion in a dog. A blood sample was requested to perform immunochromatographic tests available in the hospital to diagnose this parasitosis. The test was conducted and it was positive both in the screening test, Bio-Manguinhos TR DPP, and in the confirmatory test, Virbac Speed Leish K. In order to get parasitological confirmation, on 7 Feb 2015, a team of teachers participating in the project went to Salto to perform fine needle aspiration and puncture of bone marrow and lymph node in the index case, in addition to inspecting the place and set traps to catch sandflies. During the inspection, a dog with cachexia from the same area (Arenitas Blancas) was detected and the immunochromatographic test was made and resulted positive. Given the very bad condition of the animal and following owners' decision, the animal was euthanized and a postmortem exam and sampling for parasitological study were performed. On 11 Feb 2015, smears of the various materials obtained (aspiration and puncture of lymph node, bone marrow, spleen, and liver) were performed, using May-Grunwald Giemsa staining, and amastigotes forms typical of _Leishmania_ sp were observed. Competent authorities from Zoonosis Committee and Public Health Ministry were informed and, on 12 Feb 2015, collected and submitted material in order to confirm the diagnosis in a reference laboratory, where the outbreak was confirmed. 49 dogs were tested by the veterinary faculty in the area, of which 9 were positive both in the screening test and in the specific test (Bio-Manguinhos TR DPP and Virbac Speed Leish). The Zoonosis Committee is sampling dogs in the area. To date, 38 other dogs have been tested, of which 2 positive in the rapid immunochromatographic test Kalazar Detect Canine Rapid Test (Inbios).

Control measures
Measures applied: control of arthropods; screening; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results

[The following information was obtained from The Merck Veterinary Manual, Overview of Leishmaniasis, available at, http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/generalized_conditions/leishmaniasis/overview_of_leishmaniasis.html: "Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus _Leishmania_ and transmitted through the bites of female phlebotomine sand flies. More than 23 species of _Leishmania_ have been described, most of which are zoonotic. The most important leishmania parasite to affect domestic animals is _L. infantum_, also known as _L. chagasi_ in Latin America.

"Dogs are the main reservoir host for human visceral leishmaniasis caused by _L. infantum_, and the disease is potentially fatal in dogs and people. Because the internal organs and skin of the dog are affected, the canine disease is termed viscerocutaneous or canine leishmaniasis. Cats, horses, and other mammals can be infected by _L. infantum_ or other _Leishmania_ species. The disease in cats is rarer than in dogs and may manifest in cutaneous or visceral organs. _L. braziliensis_, the cause of tegumentary canine leishmaniasis, is widespread in regions of South America and may geographically overlap with _L. chagasi_.

"Canine leishmaniasis is a major zoonosis endemic in more than 70 countries. It is prevalent in southern Europe, Africa, Asia, South and Central America, and sporadically in the USA. It is also of concern in non-endemic countries where imported disease constitutes a veterinary and public health problem.

"Human visceral leishmaniasis caused by _L. infantum_ is a serious public health problem in areas where canine leishmaniasis is endemic and dogs are the main reservoir of infection. It is mostly a disease of young children. Malnutrition has been recognized as a risk factor and may explain why this disease is more prevalent among children in poor countries than among those in affluent ones, despite high prevalence rates in the canine populations. Human disease is also prevalent in immunosuppressed individuals; HIV patients are the predominant risk group for human leishmaniasis in southern Europe. HIV and leishmaniasis coinfection has been reported from more than 33 countries worldwide and does not respond well to therapy. Efforts to control canine leishmaniasis and the human disease in endemic areas focus on disrupting the transmission of infection and preventing canine infection at the population level."

Humans can get leishmaniasis, but not directly from animals. Transmission occurs from the bite of an infected sandfly (vector). Animals serve as a reservoir (or source of the protozoan for the sandflies). http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/leishmaniasis_F.pdf
