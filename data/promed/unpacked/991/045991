Dead birds on Malaysian oil platforms tested for bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Amid fears of an avian flu outbreak, Malaysian authorities are
investigating the deaths of birds at several oil platforms located
off northeast Terengganu state, officials said on Tuesday [13 Oct
2004].
Veterinary officers are taking samples from the dead birds to test
for the deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu, which has killed at least 30
people in Viet Nam and Thailand this year [2004], veterinary services
department director-general Hawari Hussein told AFP.
The Terengganu veterinary services department was alerted to the
deaths of a large number of birds at the oil platforms by one of the
workers there, department director Azizol Mohamad Sharom told the
Bernama news agency.
Malaysia's 1st case of the H5N1 strain of bird flu was detected in
August 2004 in a village in Kelantan, Terengganu's neighboring state,
which also borders Thailand. It quickly spread to other areas in
Kelantan -- despite intensive efforts by veterinary and health
authorities to contain the virus -- prompting the government to
impose a quarantine on the state, effectively banning the movement of
poultry in and out of the state.
Terengganu, which so far has not seen any cases of bird flu, has been
on the alert for a possible outbreak there. Authorities have screened
hundreds of villagers and isolated several with flu-like symptoms in
the hospital, but all have tested negative for the deadly virus.
There had been no new cases of bird flu in birds and poultry since
late September 2004, but Hawari said the ban on Kelantan would remain
in effect. "We are continuing controls at the border areas. We are
watching what's happening on the other side," he said, in a reference
to Thailand.
Officials say the disease was 1st brought into Malaysia by fighting
cocks that had been exposed to the virus in Thailand, and, that
further outbreaks were caused by the continued smuggling of chicken
meat.
The World Health Organization has warned that the lethal H5N1 virus
is endemic in the region and fears it could mutate into a highly
contagious form that triggers a global human flu pandemic.
