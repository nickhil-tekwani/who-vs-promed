Since [1 Jul 2013], 44 people have been diagnosed with Ross River virus [infections] in the Kimberley and 66 in the Pilbara [regions in the state of Western Australia].

While that is on track with the average yearly figures, there has been an unusually high number of cases in February and March [2014], with 43 cases recorded in the past 4 weeks alone.

However, Health Department medical entomologist Peter Neville says the numbers are expected to drop off as the wet season rains dry up.

"We would be expecting that, as we come to the end of the wet season, any standing water is going to evaporate and dry up, and then the number of actual cases will decline for last 3 months," he said.

[Ross River virus (RRV) transmission to humans, although sporadic in Australia, occurs during the wet season, when vector mosquitoes are abundant. RRV is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species, and although not fatal, causes acute polyarthritis in humans.
