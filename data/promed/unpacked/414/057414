The 1st human case of Jamestown Canyon virus infection detected in
Montana suggests the infection spread more widely than previously
thought, officials say. The study, published in the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, says increased Jamestown Canyon virus surveillance is needed
to determine whether mosquito-borne viruses other than West Nile virus
pose a risk to humans in the region.

"The recent detection of a human Jamestown Canyon virus infection in
Montana with illness onset in May [2011] means that mosquito borne
virus transmission and disease begins in spring and lasts until the
1st freeze and indicates a much longer mosquito-borne disease risk
than previously indicated by West Nile virus alone," the report says.
"Jamestown Canyon virus is a mosquito borne pathogen that circulates
widely in North America primarily between deer and a variety of
mosquito species, but it can also infect humans, but reports of human
Jamestown Canyon virus infections in the United States have been rare
and confined to the Midwestern and northeastern states."

Most reported illnesses caused by Jamestown Canyon virus have been
mild, but moderate-to-severe central nervous system involvement
including meningoencephalitis has been documented, federal health
officials say.

[The occurrence of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) in Montana is not
surprising. JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_
mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado in 1961 and later
shown to be widely distributed in eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal
_Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with
the other California serogroup Orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus
transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already
infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit the virus.
White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_ are the principal
amplification hosts.

As Drs. Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail
archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an
etiological agent of human disease, and provided the following
