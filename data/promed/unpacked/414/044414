Officials: Lepto cases traced to Sigua Falls
--------------------------------------------
Medical staff at the Naval Hospital have determined that the 3 Air Force
members who came down with symptoms of leptospirosis in Mar 2004 are likely
to have gotten the disease near Sigua Falls.
In early Apr 2004, it was reported that military officials were cautioning
their personnel about hiking and swimming in the Sigua Falls and Lost Pond
areas after potential leptospirosis cases arose. Further investigation
seems to have determined that the hikers may have come down with the
bacterial illness at Sigua Falls, said Lt Karen S Corson, the department
head of preventative medicine at Naval Hospital.
In a written response to an inquiry from Dave Lotz, president of the Guam
Boonie Stompers, Corson stated that the hospital has had 1 confirmed case
and 2 suspected cases of leptospirosis. 2 of the cases had been hiking in
the Sigua Falls area and were caught in a rainstorm, wading in the river
and had noted large amounts of run-off water from the land to the river,
Corson wrote, and the other case went swimming in the falls area.
All 3 had cuts on their hands or legs from hiking, Dr Corson wrote. She
stated that only 1 of the cases had been to Lost Pond, but that was 6
months before, so that area had been ruled out in these particular cases.
However, in an interview later, Corson said that the 1 case the Naval
Hospital had seen during 2003 had evidently originated in the Lost Pond
area. She said the hospital had not issued any formal warnings about the
areas, but does caution hikers from swimming if they have cuts or open
sores, as leptospirosis is known on the island.
Dr Robert Haddock, Guam's territorial epidemiologist, has said that
leptospirosis is found in water affected by waste from wild animals that
carry the bacteria. He has said that an average of about 2 cases are
reported each year, and because its symptoms are similar to that of
influenza, mild cases of leptospirosis are often mistaken for the other
illness.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of
leptospirosis can include fever, severe headaches, chills, muscle aches,
vomiting, stomach pain, jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), red eye, diarrhea
or a rash. Untreated, a leptospirosis patient can develop kidney damage,
meningitis, liver failure, respiratory problems and, in rare cases, may die.
