The NPPO of Switzerland recently informed EPPO that for the 1st time, grapevine flavescence dor√©e phytoplasma (EPPO A2 List) was found in a nursery on the northern side of the Alps on a single grafted young _Vitis_ plant. The nursery is located in the Canton of Geneva. Tracing-back studies are ongoing to determine the possible origin of this infection. Official phytosanitary measures are being taken to eradicate the pathogen.

[Flavescence doree (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was 1st reported in 1954 in southern France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the United States, the home of its vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group.

Symptoms can vary on different grape varieties and usually appear in late spring. They may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins, as well as drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop; yield is severely reduced and some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue by molecular methods is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with hot water (heat therapy).

In Europe, a northward spread of the disease is being observed. The vector was reported to have overcome the Alps in 1996 (see link below). The 1st report of FD north of the Alps was from Germany in 2014 (ProMED-mail post 20141217.3038025). Recently, it was detected in eastern Switzerland (ProMED-mail post 20170320.4914128), despite strict quarantine measures in that country. Until FD was reported from Austria both in grapevines and also in ornamental _Clematis_ species (see link below), the only known natural hosts were _Vitis vinifera_ and hybrids, as well as some wild _Vitis_ species as asymptomatic infections. The pathogen was included in the EPPO A2 quarantine list.

The presence of FD in central Europe now may pose a risk of the disease and/or possibly the vector spreading in the region as another example of "warm climate diseases" getting established in cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED-mail post 20141024.2895414).
