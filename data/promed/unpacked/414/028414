Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome during the first half of 2009
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There were 675 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)
during the 1st half of 2009, including 5 children younger than 14
years old. The republican Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for
Consumer Affairs and Human Welfare] reported that there were also 4
fatalities.

2.4 million rubles [approx. USD 76 000] were disbursed from the
republican budget for rodent control measures. 8500 hectares [21 000
acres] of the Republic has been treated to eradicate rodents. RUB 2.5
million [approx. USD 79 000] have been spent from the budget of the
Capital, which was enough for the treatment of more than 10 000
hectares [14 700 acres] of land, including 3817 hectares [9400 acres]
of private gardens.
