Pseudotuberculosis in the Russian Republic of Khakassia
-----------------------------------------------
13 cases of infection due to _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ have been
found in 13 inhabitants of the capital city of Abakan. 10 of them are children.
Galina Velichko, the chief of an epidemiological department of a
republican public health service, has said that the infection is
transferred by rodents. In the summer, vegetables are not stored for
a long time but are eaten from kitchen gardens, therefore, the level
of morbidity is lower than in autumn and winter. It is important to
store vegetables safely and, at the time of use, to carefully wash them.

[Infection with _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis with reservoirs
in many animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer and a variety of
birds. Most individuals affected are children or young adults. The
most common presentation of this infection is mesenteric
lymphadenitis presenting with fever and right lower quadrant
abdominal pain, which can be confused with acute appendicitis. A
febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which was described as Izumi
syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a reactive arthritis or
erythema nodosum.
_Y. pseudotuberculosis_ is genetically quite close to _Y. pestis_,
which may have evolved from it. Indeed, Achtman and colleagues (1)
proposed that the plague bacillus was derived from a
pseudotuberculosis organism only within the last 20 000 years.
Although many associations had been previously made, one of the
strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and
food was published in 2004 from Finland (2). The editorial commentary
(3) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of
fresh produce-associated infections.
The diagnosis of infection with this bacterium can be made by
isolation of the organism from lymph node or stool. Serological tests
can be helpful, but cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and
other enteric organisms, including some salmonellae. The
manifestations of illness and mode of diagnosis in these outbreaks
are not stated.
