7 patients have been admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital from 19 to 21
Jan 2005 with acute gastroenteritis during the recent suspected food-borne
outbreak in Melbourne. All reported eating at the same local restaurant.
All had developed symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
nausea, and for most, vomiting. The patients ranged from 16 to 52 years of
age, 5 women and 2 men. One woman was on a proton pump inhibitor [which
decreases the acid concentration in gastric secretions - Mod.LL], whereas
the remaining 6 patients had no specific risk factors identified for
increased susceptibility. In addition to basic blood tests, feces and blood
has been collected from all patients for microbiological analysis.
Incubation periods ranged from 12 to 48 hours. All patients received
intravenous rehydration and symptomatic treatment, and one patient received
antimicrobial agent therapy (ciprofloxacin orally). All are recovering, and
the last of the 7 patients has now been discharged.
A _Salmonella sp._ has been isolated from the feces of the 1st 3 patients,
with cultures in progress on samples from the other patients. Further
identification of the isolate is pending. To date, blood cultures from all
patients show no growth.
