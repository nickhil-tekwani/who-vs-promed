[Re: Plague - Mozambique (Tete, Zambesia) 980929153005
I wonder if the International Health Regulations that require the
reporting of a *suspected* case of plague, cholera or yellow fever
aren't antiquated.
While we don't want to see one of these agents becoming established
in a region currently considered free of these pathogens, nor would
we want to see an epidemic go unaddressed, it does seem somewhat
outmoded to apply such regulations to only 3 diseases -- especially
when one considers that many countries have endemic plague, cholera
cases can be found in numerous nations each year, and yellow fever
(endemic in many African and South American countries) can be
effectively reduced through vaccination.
What of other diseases that can be transmitted as easily, or more so,
and could have a similar or greater public health impact, especially
in countries that have never seen them before? (such as dengue, VEE,
or Rift Valley Fever).
Maybe we should report diseases that are fatal nearly 100% of the
time (rabies, HIV 1 and 2 - certainly these are just as important and
have incubation periods much longer than plague, yellow fever, and
cholera and can have costly public health implications)?
Or what about reporting diseases that reflect the highest causes of
mortality around the world, such as TB, malaria, HIV, even measles.
Perhaps I don't understand WHOs reasoning for the regulations, but
they seem obtuse and off-the-mark in today's world. Please feel free
to educate me if I am mistaken.

[WHO is currently in the process of revising the IHR to require
syndrome-based reporting, which will cover some of the concerns
expressed above -- see 4 refs. at top.
For instance, dengue, VEE & RVF -- Ebola & Lassa also -- will be
reportable under the syndrome "Hemorrhagic fever". HIV/AIDS
already is reportable to WHO under a separate system - Mod.JW
