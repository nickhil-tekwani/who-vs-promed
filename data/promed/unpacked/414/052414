The recent cases of toxic poisoning in New Zealand have resulted from individuals ignoring public health warnings and continuing to undertake recreational gathering of shellfish from affected areas. The Ministry for Primary Industries [MPI] manages a monitoring programme, which includes weekly testing of shellfish and seawater from around New Zealand to ensure they are not contaminated with biotoxins from algae blooms. When biotoxins rise to unsafe levels, public warnings are issued for recreational shellfish harvesting areas including warning signs on beaches and boat ramps, public health unit websites, and through media statements. Warnings have been in place since this event was first detected. The continuing incidence of cases arising from people ignoring such warnings caused authorities to react with additional targeted publicity, and the recent media reports that ProMED-mail has carried are the result of media outlets picking up on these messages.

The Ministry for Primary Industries has information targeting recreational seafood gatherers, including maps of areas affected by marine biotoxin alerts, at http://www.foodsmart.govt.nz/food-safety/hunting-collecting-fishing/seafood-gatherers/.

MPI's website has information for recreational seafood gatherers on how to keep their seafood safe at http://www.foodsmart.govt.nz/elibrary/food_safety_seafood.pdf.

New Zealand's commercially harvested shellfish remains safe to eat, primarily because commercial growing areas are not affected by the current events. Operators adhere to strict guidelines regarding monitoring and harvesting controls. Information on regulatory controls for commercial shellfish in New Zealand is also available at http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/industry/sectors/seafood/bms/index.htm.

[ProMED-mail appreciates the "insider's view" of the situation. Public education is always a huge undertaking for any agency. Glad the messages are getting out to people. Hopefully they will take notice and behave in a safe manner.
