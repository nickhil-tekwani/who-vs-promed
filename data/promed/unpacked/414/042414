Abstract
---------
We conducted a SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence study among more than 2000 domestic cats from 4 countries during the 1st coronavirus disease wave in Europe. We found 4.4% seroprevalence using a virus neutralization test and 4.3% using a receptor-binding domain ELISA, demonstrating probable human-to-cat transmission.

The paper's conclusions chapter follows (references omitted; available in the source URL):

"During the 1st COVID-19 pandemic wave, reported seroprevalence levels in domestic cats ranged from 0.4% in the Netherlands to 23% among cats in COVID-19-positive households in France. Similar seroprevalence levels in cats and humans in the same areas found by us and others suggest that in the absence of another known source (Appendix Table), SARS-CoV-2 infections in cats are most likely due to human-to-cat contact transmission.

"Most natural SARS-CoV-2 infections of cats appear to run a mild or subclinical course, with respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical signs reported in confirmed natural infections. Evidence from experimental studies suggests that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can maintain the virus within a cat population and spill the infection backward or forward to other species. However, no evidence of cat-to-human transmission, nor of cat-specific mutations or variants of SARS-CoV-2, has been detected thus far. This finding contrasts reports on minks kept in farms, where mink-to-human spillback infections and mink-specific mutations have been reported. Although no evidence currently suggests that domestic cats play a role in the epidemiology of human SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinicians and veterinary practitioners should recommend that SARS-CoV-2-infected persons avoid close contact with their domestic cats and practice the same nonpharmaceutical prevention measures toward cats as they do to prevent human-to-human infection."

Notably, the study addressed serum samples collected for diagnostic purposes unrelated to suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were from 1136 cats in Germany, 331 in the UK, 333 in Italy, and 360 in Spain. Among 1799 samples with demographic data, cats ranged from 0.1-23 years of age (median and mean age 11 years).

Subscribers are referred to the table "Seroprevalence in humans and cats by selected country during the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, 2020" (for the table, please go to the source URL/Downloads/appendix (pdf)). The table also includes data from France and the Netherlands.

It would be interesting to note if the collected demographic data (up to 1799 cats) include details of their respective households/ownerships, which may allow a search for correlation between seropositivity in domestic cats and other elements (e.g., respective family structure, age, accommodation/occupancy, cohabiting cats/other domestic animals, etc.). - Mod.AS
