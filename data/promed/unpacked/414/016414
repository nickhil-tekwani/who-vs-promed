About 200 cattle in Toro Local Government Area of Bauchi State have been infected with foot and mouth disease [FMD]. The Veterinary Officer of the local government, Malam Adamu Abdu Jibrin, who stated this on Thursday [26 Feb 2015] while speaking to journalists in Toro, described the disease as highly contagious among cattle, especially where they access water.

He said: "Foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious viral infectious disease of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. It can also affect wild animals, especially buffalo, which act as significant hosts and in which the disease is generally much milder than in cattle. The virus can be harboured for periods in the nasopharynx of wild fauna (respiratory system of the body). The importance of the disease in small stock such as sheep and goats is largely as carriers of disease to cattle. The disease is mainly transmitted through inhalation or ingestion of the virus from contaminated feeds and direct contact with infected animals. Humans can also transfer infection to other animals through movement of people and vehicles from an infected premises to susceptible areas."

The veterinary officer said the incubation period is on average 3 to 8 days after the animals are infected with virus, adding that infected animals would the discharge the virus through the saliva, rupture of vesicles and blisters on the tongue and feet.

Adamu, who advised the people of the area to be vigilant, said the disease can also affect human beings who might come in close contact with infected animals [see comment]. He, therefore, called on the state government to urgently take the necessary measures to avert the spread of the disease.

[According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD, Pirbright), FMD is endemic in Nigeria, the recently circulating serotypes (in brackets, last year recorded) being FMDV-O (2014), FMDV-A (2013), and FMDV-SAT 2 (2012). Serotype FMDV-SAT 1 was last recorded in 1981. Further details including genotyping results are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/nig.htm. According to Nigeria's reports to the OIE, vaccination is not applied.

Official confirmation of the recent outbreak in Bauchi state and information on the serotype(s) involved are anticipated.

In view of the warning in the above report concerning potential human infection, it is appropriate to include the following relevant authoritative information from a CFSPH review, updated 2014:

"Foot and mouth disease is not considered to be a public health problem, as infections seem to be very rare and their consequences mild. In the past, many people who worked with FMDV in vaccine laboratories or other locations developed antibodies to this virus, but there were few clinical cases. One laboratory reported only 2 cases in more than 50 years, and a large FMD vaccine manufacturer documented 3 cases among its workers. It may be that exposure to extremely large amounts of virus or a predisposing condition is necessary for infection.

"Between 1921 and 1969, reports of more than 40 laboratory-confirmed cases of FMD in humans were published. The symptoms included vesicular lesions and influenza-like symptoms, and the disease was generally mild, short-lived, and self-limiting. Broken skin was a recognized route of entry for some human cases, with the initial lesions developing at the inoculation site. There is also a report that 3 veterinarians deliberately infected themselves in 1934 by drinking virus-contaminated, unpasteurized milk for 3 days. Person-to-person transmission has never been reported; however, vesicles from affected people do contain virus".
