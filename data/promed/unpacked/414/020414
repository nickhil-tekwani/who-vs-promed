A strange disease has hit Kitgum, Abim, and Agago districts, killing 8
people and infecting a dozen others since Mon 8 Nov 2010. A Health
Situation Report of Fri 26 Nov 2010 puts the cumulative number of cases of
the disease [at] 32.

The disease, which some sources suspect to be the deadly Ebola [hemorrhagic
fever], was reported in Balang Village in Agago District early this month
[November 2010]. Other cases were found in Odiyo Village, while other cases
were reported in Patongo, in the same district.

The national professional officer of the World Health Organization based in
Gulu District, Dr Emmanuel Tenywa, said 19 people are currently admitted in
an isolation ward at Kalongo Hospital. He said those admitted experience
acute diarrhea, vomiting, and severe headache.

Dr Tenywa said in the report that a health worker at Kolongo Hospital
contracted the disease after a suspected patient vomited on her.

[The districts of Kitgum, Abim and Agago in the Northern Region of Uganda
can be located in the map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda>. This region of Uganda
is populated mainly by people of the Achol ethnic group and has suffered
frequent incursions of refugees from Sudan in the north.

In 2008, the region suffered an extensive outbreak of hepatitis E virus
infection causing some fatalities (see the ProMED-mail archived reports
below). The characteristics of the disease described in the current report
are poorly defined but not dissimilar from those experienced by patients in
the hepatitis E outbreak. Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been suggested as a
possible cause of the outbreak. While not implausible, hemorrhage as a
feature of the disease is not mentioned in the press report. Precise
information from the region would be welcomed.
