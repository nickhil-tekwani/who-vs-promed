INFLUENZA - USA (12): (NORTH DAKOTA) A(H3N2) CORRECTION

The title of ProMED-mail posting "Influenza - USA (11): (ND) A(H3N2)V, alert", is not accurate due to the inclusion of the "V" in the naming of the virus subtype. To date, public health investigations have not identified variant influenza virus infection, that is, H3N2v, in people who report a recent history of North Dakota State Fair and/or swine exposure. Only human infections with influenza A viruses normally found in swine are referred to as "variant" viruses and denoted with a "v". Influenza viruses identified in swine are referred to as influenza A virus infections in swine. Currently, most of the influenza viruses in North American swine populations belong to subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2.

For further information on variant virus infections, including H3N2v, see the CDC website http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-cases.htm.

We believe this information may be of interest and assistance to your readers as they read this and other influenza postings. Thank you for your attention, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you wish more information.
