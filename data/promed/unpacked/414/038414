With regards to comments on the recent epidemic paralysis by Dr.John Marr,
I beg to disagree that lathyrism is "of historical interest". The Nepalese
epidemic strikes one as having dietary origins and might have elements of
nutritional deficiency. Certainly it bears some similarities with lathyrism.
Legumes of Lathyrus sativa, called "khesari dhal" are eaten among South
Asian populations either as a stable food or supplementary food item. I
remember editing an article for a magazine 15 years ago in which a Bangla
Deshi correspondent described the problem of lathyrism as existing in
endemic pockets. The toxic component of the legume was isolated as an
anutrient-amino acid (beta-N-oxalylamino-alanine). The toxin causes
demyelination of the lateral columns of the spinal cord, giving rise to a
clinical picture of spastic paraplegia and 'scissors gait' of upper motor
neuron involvement. Not being an expert myself in these fields I stand to
be corrected.
Especially in diseases in which culture and local dietary habits are
prominent, ProMED-mail may do well to learn from local scientists of the
region. More recent reference or authorities can be sought outside of that
below:

Subtropics and Tropics', 4th Ed., Edward Arnold, Kent (1991).

[As always, we value the contributions of scientists of all cultures and
localities. Indeed, we would not be able to operate ProMED-mail as an
international list without their help. I have submitted Dr. Yap's comment
to Dr. John Marr for his response, and it appears below. - Mod.ES

In response to Tuan-Gee YAP, MBBS, Ph.D.'s comment on lathyrism:
He is certainly correct that lathyrism is not an historical disease -- it
continues to cause illness and death in many parts of the world. The
citation I used came from the book, "Poisonous Plants of the United States
and Canada", Kingsbury, JM, Prentice-Hall, 1964, and was in the context of
poisonous plants in these two countries. It is a somewhat dated text, and
I wish it would be updated. But, it is still accurate for North America
toxic flora.
Of interest, another once toxic plant -- white snakeroot or richweed,
(Eupatorium rugosum) -- was a common plant intoxicant dating to the
American Revolution. It caused a disease in animals and humans known as
"trembles' or "milk sickness", respectively. The latter term was used
since the toxin could be transmitted via a sick cow's milk to humans.
Kingsbury states, "...It is often stated that this disease was responsible
for the death of Abraham Lincoln's mother." (p. 339)
In another book, "Poisonous Plants of the United States", Muenscher, WC,
Colliers Books, 1975, the author states, "This annual herb ( sic. Lathyrus
savitus) is grown as a forage plant mainly in southern Europe and parts of
India where it seeds are used at times of scarcity for human food." (p.
134).
A quick review of the literature on PubMED reveals 642 articles published
on lathyrism in the last 20 years. In particular, two recent papers:
"Evidence of osteolathyrism among patients suffering from neurolathyrism in
Bangladesh." Haque, A. et al., Nat Toxins 1997;5 (1): 43-46; & " Toxic
models of upper motor neuron disease." Ludolph, AC, Spencer, PS. J Neurol
Sci. 1996; Aug; 139 Suppl: 53-59.
I certainly appreciate the citation to Suresh Roa Aror -- it is recent and
deals with lathyrism outside the U.S/Canada. In search in amazon.com, I
found a few recent books on poisonous plants, but they also dealt with
either a small number of intoxications/poisonings and/or were limited to
the U.S.
I wish to thank Dr. Tuan-Gee for the correction. I also believe that
naturally occurring toxins from plants and animals seem to fall between the
cracks when one thinks of causes for outbreaks which appear to be
infectious in nature or cause by chemicals.
