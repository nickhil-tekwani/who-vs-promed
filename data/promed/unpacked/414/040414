The most recent issue of Archives of Virology (144:135-145, 1999) contains
an article that should be of interest to those of us who having been
following the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV, family Caliciviridae)
story in Australia and New Zealand.
Asgari, Hardy, and Cooke have PCR-sequenced capsid protein gene (VP60) of
RHDV from dead rabbits collected in five states in Australia. Genetic
differences between these recent isolates and the original (released)
strain were 0 to 1.8%.
These studies indicate that few if any genetic adaptations or mutations
have occurred in the two years since the release of that virus for purposes
of rabbit control.
