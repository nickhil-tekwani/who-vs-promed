Authorities on [Mon 30 Jul 2018] confirmed that 12 people died from an unknown disease with symptoms similar to Ebola in north-eastern Congo.

"The deaths began in early July [2018] in the village of Mangina, near the town of Beni [northeastern Congo DR],'' local administrator Donat Kibwana told newsmen.

Meanwhile, a local civil society group in Beni, said it had counted 15 deaths caused by the disease, which similar to Ebola, manifests itself through fever, diarrhea, vomiting and nose bleeds.

"A nearby laboratory was currently analysing blood samples,'' said Kibwana.

According to the provincial health ministry, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had deployed a team of experts to the area.

On [Tue 24 Jul 2018], Congo officially declared a recent Ebola outbreak over.
The outbreak, which began in May, saw a total of 54 cases, of which 33 people died.

Ebola, a highly infectious disease that causes a fever, often leads to massive internal bleeding and fatalities.

During the last major Ebola outbreak in 2014, 11 000 died when the virus spread across the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

[There are many possible causes of fever, diarrhea, vomiting and nose bleeds. Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of illnesses caused by 4 families of viruses. These include the Ebola and Marburg, lassa fever, and yellow fever viruses. VHFs have common features: they affect many organs, they damage the blood vessels, and they affect the body's ability to regulate itself. Some VHFs cause mild disease, but some, like Ebola or Marburg, cause severe disease and death. Lassa fever is limited to rural areas of West Africa where rats and mice carry the virus. (https://medlineplus.gov/hemorrhagicfevers.html)

Another possibility is Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) in the family Bunyaviridae. The disease is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, throughout the Mediterranean, in northwestern China, central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. This virus is currently the cause of an outbreak in Iran (https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2018/07/30/1789928/crimean-congo-fever-outbreak-kills-7-in-iran-health-official).

Lab test are being conducted and we look forward to the results and request and further knowledgeable information.

These cases are also interesting in light of the Denver missionary who just returned to the US from Eastern Congo. The location is not clear since Ebola was not in eastern Congo; what may have been intended was "Western Congo" (DRC, Equateur province?), with undescribed but sudden symptoms.

[2] US: Suspected patient tests negative

Colorado health officials scrambled to determine whether a man who recently worked with sick people in eastern Congo and became ill [Sun 29 Jul 2018] in Denver had contracted the deadly Ebola virus -- and doctors also isolated an ambulance crew for testing and were looking for another person in metro Denver who may have had contact with the man.

Denver Health and Hospitals officials [Sun 29 Jul 2018] night were waiting for test results from a state health lab but said that, based on an initial test in a special isolated unit; they do not believe the man has Ebola. A Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) bulletin late [Sun 29 Jul 2018] said testing "is negative for Ebola."

The man had been working with sick and dead people in an area of eastern Congo where a recent outbreak of Ebola had largely dissipated with no new Ebola cases reported over the past 45 days. On [Sun 29 Jul 2018] morning, he reported sudden severe symptoms at his residence in Denver, Denver Health chief medical officer Connie Price said.

"We felt that, if he had Ebola, then he could be very communicable ... We had no wiggle room to be wrong," Price said.

The man "became ill very suddenly this morning," she said, declining to specify his exact symptoms but saying they could mimic illnesses including flu and appendicitis. "He is getting better, so that is good."

A total of 3 members of the ambulance crew that picked up the man -- 2 of them paramedics, one a student -- also were being held in isolation, and Denver public health officials were looking for a "significant other" who may have had contact with the man warranting testing as a precaution.

Denver public health officials were "working through" how to handle the man's residence before confirmatory testing for Ebola was complete, Price said [Sun 29 Jul 2018] afternoon outside the hospital. "We don't think we're going to have to do anything with his house because we don't think he is going to be confirmed."

Denver Health officials temporarily diverted ambulances away from the city's main public health hospital but said they resumed normal operations by noon.

Denver officials were coordinating with federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and CDPHE officials in assessing risks.

The man told health officials he felt ill [Sun 29 Jul 2018] morning, reported having worked recently as medical missionary in eastern Congo, and arrived at the hospital at about 8:30 a.m. by ambulance. Doctors set up a special isolation unit and were assessing his condition.

"The patient's symptoms could represent a variety of common illnesses," Denver Health spokeswoman Jennifer Hillmann said. "The patient in question had reported being in an area of the Congo on a medical missionary trip, but he was in a location where the Ebola outbreak had been officially declared over, with no cases reported for 45 days, according to the CDC."

He was listed in fair condition [Sun 29 Jul 2018] night.

Hospital officials said they were "on normal operations" and that "there is no threat or concern for patient, staff or visitor safety." Denver Department of Public Health and Environment officials couldn't be reached late [Sun 29 Jul 2018].

Denver Health staffers are trained and equipped to deal with situations involving infectious diseases. And the CDC has designated Denver's hospital as one of 10 around the nation prepared to treat patients with Ebola.

At the hospital [Sun 29 Jul 2018] afternoon, staffers called the situation "under control."

Ebola is a rare but serious viral disease that often causes fevers, headaches, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, weakness, muscle pain and unexplained bleeding or bruising. There have been no outbreaks of Ebola in the United States.

The viruses that cause Ebola are located mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the CDC. People can get Ebola through direct contact with an infected animal or a sick or dead person infected with the virus. ...-more

[The patient being tested is negative for Ebola, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. It was also stated that the symptoms were not compatible with Ebola.

The release also said Denver Health is operating normally and there are no dangers to patients, staff or visitors.
(https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/07/30/ebola-scare-denver-hospital-after-patient-exhibits-symptoms/862551002/)

Because the patient had been working with sick individuals in Africa, either eastern Congo or Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (location not clear since Ebola was not active in eastern Congo, but was recently declared over in Equateur province DRC, both having been mentioned in the article), sensitivity to Ebola was high when the patient became suddenly ill upon return to the US and suspicions were aroused. The rapid response was appropriate to protect the public and care for the patient. This highlights the importance of a rapid test to rule in/out Ebola as the etiologic agent in such cases. But with new Ebola virus variants being recognized through increased surveillance and deep sequencing (see ProMED Ebola update (55): Sierra Leone Ebola virus variant, Congo DR cases, WHO 20180727.5931686), it isn't going too far out on a limb to be concerned that the assay is broad enough to detect such variants.

Regarding the confusion over location: If this man was in the eastern DR Congo, it's highly unlikely he was anywhere near Ebola. If he was in Bukavu, for example, he was 1823 km [1132.76 mi approx.] by road from Mbandaka, near the epicenter of the recent outbreak. Now, if he had been in the eastern Republic of the Congo he might just conceivably have been exposed to someone who'd popped across the Congo River from Mbandaka in the northwestern Democratic Republic of Congo. But they're 2 different countries with annoyingly similar names, and to the best of my knowledge the Republic of the Congo has never reported an Ebola case. The DR Congo health authorities seem to have monitored river traffic very effectively. This fuss is more likely due to ignorance of central African geography than to a genuine case of Ebola.
