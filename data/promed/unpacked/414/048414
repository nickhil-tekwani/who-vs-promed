A dead Cooper's hawk found in Lakeside has tested positive for West Nile virus [WNV], making it the 1st sign this year [2019] of the potentially deadly disease in San Diego County.

County Vector Control officials said people should remember to follow the County's "Prevent, Protect, Report" guidelines -- particularly to dump out standing water and to wear insect repellent -- to protect themselves from mosquitoes that can transmit WNV and other diseases, such as chikungunya, dengue and Zika.

Officials said the dead hawk had relatively low levels of WNV in its tissues, suggesting that it was an old infection. However, they said it was a good reminder that WNV, which 1st arrived in San Diego County in 2003, is established here and that people need to protect themselves from mosquitoes.

Last year [2018] was a relatively mild one for WNV in San Diego County. One county resident tested positive for the disease and survived. However, as recently as 2015, 44 County residents tested positive and 6 people died. Across California in 2018, 215 people became infected with West Nile virus and 10 people died.

WNV is mainly a bird disease, but it can be transmitted to humans by a number of species of mosquitoes -- including _Culex_ mosquitoes native to San Diego and, less effectively, by invasive _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes -- if they feed off an infected animal, mainly birds, and then bite people.

If people who become infected suffer symptoms, they are typically mild, including headache, fever, nausea, fatigue, skin rash or swollen glands. But in rare cases, WNV can make people extremely ill and even kill them.

[After the introduction of WNV into the Americas in New York, in 1999, it propagated westwards and southwards, reaching California in July 2003. American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and other corvid species [ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, magpies, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers] are highly susceptible to WNV infections and serve as amplifying hosts, and also as sentinels. WNV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but infection can also occur through direct contact or uptake of WNV-infected tissue.

Cases of WNV in birds of prey are commonly reported. Cooper's hawks (_Accipiter cooperii_) is a medium-sized hawk of the woodlands. It feeds mostly on birds and small mammals. Of the 3 bird-eating Accipiter hawks of North America, Cooper's is the mid-sized species and the most widespread as a nesting bird south of Canada (for a picture see https://cdn.audubon.org/cdn/farfuture/7Gj5j24h-1jCsric_Ur4foGamWdCUtPLfZqFUKPXOSI/mtime:1548755867/sites/default/files/styles/grid_gallery_lightbox/public/Cooper%2527s_Hawk_l07-53-038_l.jpg?itok=FS9k-K68). - Mod.PMB]

[This is a case of WNV infection that is relatively early in the usual transmission season. Southern California and San Diego County in particular, has experienced repeated rain events in over the past 3 months, creating many potential mosquito breeding sites (https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/does-more-rain-mean-more-mosquitoes-no-but-things-may-get-buggy-this-spring). This case may be a harbinger of a very active WNV transmission season in the coming weeks. It would be wise for all horse owners to vaccinate their animals now. - Mod.TY
