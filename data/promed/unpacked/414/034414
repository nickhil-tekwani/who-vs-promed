An animal in the United States tested positive in a preliminary screening
test for mad cow disease, US Department of Agriculture officials said Friday.
John Clifford, deputy administrator of USDA veterinary services, said
officials learned of the "inconclusive" test result at 5:30 p.m. Friday.
The carcass is being sent to USDA National Veterinary Laboratory in Ames,
Iowa, for additional tests. Results are expected in 4 to 7 days.[More
likely it is just a brain tissue sample that is being sent to the NVSL. -

Clifford declined to identify the animal or its location until testing is
complete, noting that it's "very likely" final testing could turn up negative.
"The animal in question didn't enter the food chain," he said. "If
positive, we'll provide additional information on the animal and origins."
If the animal tests positive, it would be the second case of mad cow
discovered in the United States. In December 2003, a single Holstein on a
Washington state farm was found to have the disease, prompting more than 50
countries to ban imports of U.S. beef. Japan and South Korea, 2 of the
biggest export markets for U.S. beef, still have their bans in effect
despite the efforts of American officials to get them lifted.
The Agriculture Department this month expanded national testing for the
disease in response to that mad cow scare, leading to Friday's 1st
"inconclusive" reading in the preliminary test, officials said. More than
7000 animals so far have been tested under the program, which seeks to
check about 220 000 animals over the next year to 18 months.
The announcement came late Friday and officials sought to downplay the
potential gravity of the preliminary result, which they said wasn't
unexpected given the test's sensitivity. The United States' beef trading
partners had been notified and the company was given earlier notice,
Clifford said.
"The inconclusive result does not mean we have found another case of BSE in
this country," Clifford said. "Inconclusive results are a normal component
of most screening tests, which are designed to be extremely sensitive so
they will detect any sample that could possibly be positive. The USDA
remains confident in the safety of the food supply," Clifford said.
Representatives from the U.S. beef industry also sought to emphasize there
was no reason to worry at this initial stage.
"We hope that the U.S. consumers will recognize that the United States has
among the most stringent BSE safeguards in place," said Bill Bullard, chief
executive officer of R-CALF USA, a cattlemen's group. "We are encouraging
the public to recognize that this is an inconclusive test result."
Mad cow disease -- known also as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE
-- eats holes in the brains of cattle. It sprang up in Britain in 1986 and
spread through countries in Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction
of herds and decimating the European beef industry.
A form of mad cow disease can be contracted by humans if they eat infected
beef or nerve tissue, and possibly through blood transfusions. Variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad cow disease, so far has
killed 100 people in Britain and elsewhere, including a Florida woman this
week who was believed to have contracted the disease in England.
The government conducted mad cow tests in 2003 on tissues from 20 543
animals, virtually all of them cattle that could not stand or walk and had
to be dragged to slaughter. After the nation's 1st case in December 2003,
the USDA initially doubled the number of animals to be tested this year to
40 000.
With many foreign governments still reluctant to ease bans on U.S. beef,
the testing program was expanded at a cost of $70 million to include as
many as 220 000 slaughtered animals, following recommendations from an
international scientific review panel. About 35 million head of cattle are
slaughtered each year in the United States.

[More information from authoritative sources would be appreciated. At
present, information on the background of the bovine involved, whether it
was a downer, what its age was, and whether there were identified risk
factors is not known. This information could be given without identifying
information to preserve the confidentiality of origins in the event the
reference laboratory testing is negative for BSE. - Mods.TG/MPP]
