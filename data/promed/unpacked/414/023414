A team of medical experts has suggested that _Escherichia coli_ bacteria
caused a mystery illness that claimed 10 lives in an Indonesian village of
densely populated Java island, a local media report said on Mon 6 Aug 2007.

The experts from Gajah Mada University said they believed the illnesses
were mainly due to poor sanitation, which resulted in an _E. coli_
contamination, rather than from _Pseudomonas [now _Burkholderia_ - Mod.LL]
cocovenenans_ bacteria as previously believed, The Jakarta Post reported.

Health minister Siti Fadilah Supari announced last week [30 Jul - 3 Aug
2007] that initial investigations into the mystery illness that killed 10
people in the Central Java village had suggested that food poisoning was
the cause rather than a contagious disease. Supari said before becoming
ill, the victims ate "tempeh gembus", a locally made fermented soy bean
dish commonly sold door to door.

In addition to 10 people who died in a village in Magelang district, 20
other victims have been brought to 3 hospitals in the province after
complaining of stomach pain, nausea, and headaches.

But Mary Astuti, an expert in tempeh from the Gajah Mada University, said
she believed dirty living conditions were the main cause for the outbreak.
"It's the dirty surroundings that are the main cause of the deaths," she
was quoted as saying.

[Almost certainly the environment where these cases occurred was
suboptimal. The illness, however, as described in the first post is much
more consistent with _B. cocovenenans_ toxemia than with _E. coli_
infection as now claimed. In addition, there is neither information that
any _E. coli_ was isolated nor is the case fatality rate of 30 per cent (10
of 30 cases) typical of _E. coli_ disease, even _E. coli_ O157.

Fermented foods are used throughout the world and provide numerous benefits
particularly to people in developing countries. The foods play an important
role in providing food security, enhancing livelihoods and improving the
nutrition and social well being of much of the world's population,
especially the those who are marginalized and vulnerable.

Battcock M and Azam-Ali S are the authors of a treatise concentrated on
aspects of fermented food (Fermented fruits and vegetables. A global
perspective. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
Bulletin No. 134, Rome, 1998:
<http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0560e/x0560e06.htm>. The following information
has been extracted from this publication illustrating the importance of
this process:

"Fermentation is a cheap and energy efficient means of preserving
perishable raw materials. When harvested, fruit and vegetables undergo
rapid deterioration, especially in the humid tropics where the prevailing
environmental conditions accelerate the process of decomposition. There are
several options for preserving fresh fruit and vegetables including drying,
freezing, canning and pickling. However many of these are inappropriate for
use on the small-scale in developing countries. For instance the canning of
vegetables at the small scale has serious food safety implications and
contamination with botulism is a possibility. Freezing of fruits and
vegetables is not economically viable at the small scale. Fermentation
requires very little sophisticated equipment, either to carry out the
fermentation or for subsequent storage of the fermented product. It is a
technique that has been employed for generations to preserve food for
consumption at a later date and to improve food security. There are
examples from around the world of the role fermented foods have played in
preserving food to enhance food security.

"Use of waste products in Indonesia
----------------------------------
"In Indonesia, a variety of waste products are fermented to produce
nutritious food products. Tempe bongrek is a protein rich food made in
Indonesia by fermenting peanut and coconut press-cake, remaining after oil
extraction. The product is similar to traditional tempeh produced from the
fermentation of soy beans. The production of tempeh bongrek is a mold
fermentation, initiated by inoculation of the soaked, acidified press-cake
with _Rhizopus_ species. The inoculated cakes are placed on banana leaves
or plastic sheets in a dark room for about 2 days. An incubation
temperature of 37 degrees C [98.6 deg F] is optimal for the mold and
prevents the growth of _P. cocovenenans_, which produces bongkrek toxin. A
pH of less than 6.0 also prevents the development of bongkrek toxin. Ontjom
is produced from waste groundnut press cake, tapioca waste and the solid
waste of tahu. Ontjom is prepared using a mixed culture of micro-organisms
with _Rhizopus_ or _Neurospora_ species predominating. Ontjom is mainly
produced in west Java where it is consumed as a side dish in the form of
deep fried slices. It forms an important daily food item for the west
Javanese, particularly those from the lower income groups. Fresh coconut
residue, left over from the production of coconut cream or milk, can be
fermented by _Bacillus subtilis_, in an alkaline fermentation, to produce
semayi, which is widely consumed in Indonesia.

"Fermented foods for survival in Sudan
--------------------------------------
"About 60 per cent of the fermented foods of Sudan are famine or survival
foods. Many of the fermented foods have been developed in Western Sudan in
the Kordofan and Darfur regions, which are traditional famine areas. The
strong link between fermented foods and food shortages is revealed by the
fact that when a family becomes rich a number of fermented foods are no
longer prepared. The techniques used are very effective methods of food
preservation. The products can be preserved for years through the double
action of fermentation itself (which produces antimicrobial acids) and sun
drying. Sudan is probably the hottest and driest country in Africa. Through
the years women have made full use of this free solar energy. Shade
temperatures in the summer reach 45-50 degrees C [113-122 deg F] and the
hot sands outside the shade reach more than 70 degrees C [158 deg F]. Dried
and fermented foods together with the seeds and fruits that can be gathered
from the wild have saved lives especially those of children in the past and
in the present in times of shortage. During the 1983-1985 famine, relief
workers found that people had survived by producing specific traditional
fermented food products, especially Kawal.

"A wide range of "waste" products are fermented to produce edible food
products in Sudan. These includes bones, hides and locusts. Fresh bones are
fermented into a variety of products. "Dodery" is produced by chopping
bones into small pieces and placing them into fermenting vats. They are
subsequently covered in water, left for 3 days, removed, crushed into a
paste and mixed with the ash from burnt sorghum stalks. The mixture is
returned to the fermenting vat for a further 2 to 5 days. The final product
is rolled into balls and has a shelf life of up to 2 months. Another
product "Kaidu digla" is made from the vertebrae of the backbone. These are
chopped into smaller pieces and then sun-dried. After drying they are
pounded with stones; mixed with water and salt; molded into balls and
allowed to ferment.

"Gundruk: an important fermented product in Nepal
-------------------------------------------------
"Gundruk is a fermented and dried vegetable product. It is produced by
shredding the leaves of mustard, radish and cauliflower leaves and placing
them in an earthenware pot to ferment. After 5 to 7 days, the leaves are
removed and dried in the sun. Gundruk is a very important food product in
Nepal ensuring food security for many Nepali communities especially in
remote areas. It is served as a side dish with the main meal and is also
used as an appetizer in the bland, starchy diet. The annual production of
gundruk in Nepal is estimated at 2000 tons and most of the production is
carried out at the household level. Gundruk is also an important source of
minerals particularly during the off-season when the diet consists of
mostly starchy tubers and maize which tend to be low in minerals." - Mod.LL]
