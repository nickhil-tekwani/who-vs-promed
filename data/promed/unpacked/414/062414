Another 2 Aucklanders have contracted measles, bringing the total number in the region to 119. Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) announced 2 new cases on Friday [21 Jun 2019] afternoon.

The Auckland region is experiencing an outbreak of the highly infectious and potentially life-threatening viral illness. ESR data showed there had been 215 confirmed cases of measles across the country so far this year [2019].

Auckland -- particularly West Auckland -- has been hit hardest by the outbreak, but South Auckland has seen a spike in cases in the past 2 weeks. So far this year [2019], 139 of the 215 confirmed cases (43%) were in people who were not vaccinated.

[3] Reunion Island

Since the beginning of 2019, measles has been actively circulating in the Indian Ocean zone and in metropolitan France. In Reunion Island, 77 cases have been reported since 1 Jan 2019. The circulation of the virus is particularly in the north and south of the island. Given the extreme contagiousness of this disease, it is feared that new cases will appear in the coming weeks. In just one month, 29 new cases have been confirmed.

After a period of calm (between February and April), a resumption of the circulation of the measles virus was observed, with 34 cases reported to the ARS since the beginning of April [2019].

The only way to protect oneself is to get vaccinated (immunization coverage in Reunion Island is insufficient to prevent viral circulation). Also, the ARS Indian Ocean recommends vaccination for the population but also for health professionals.

As of 14 May [2019], according to the ARS, there were a total of 48 cases of measles. In one month, 29 new cases were confirmed.

Reunion Island is one of the most affected departments in France. In May [2019], Imaz Press Reunion learned from the LRA that 2 doctors who were not vaccinated against measles had contaminated 6 people at the University Hospital Center CHU Bellepierre.

A complicated situation to manage: the ARS had to carry out an investigation on a case-by-case basis over the weekend to understand who the health workers were who were not protected from this disease. Another emergency is to protect other patients in the hospital. A hundred people were vaccinated in 2 days.

In Madagascar, measles is wreaking havoc. Between September 2018 and early March 2019, the disease killed 1141 people, mostly children, according to figures from the Ministry of Public Health. Just under 100 000 cases have been recorded by the authorities, and 104 of 114 districts are in the epidemic phase. Between malnutrition, refusal to seek treatment in a hospital and reluctance of vaccination, the big island struggles to fight against the disease.

The resurgence of measles is gaining the world over. A state of emergency in a suburb of New York, an outbreak of cases in Ukraine, and increased cases in France ... a preventable but potentially fatal disease, measles resurfaces all over the world because of a mistrust toward vaccines or poor access to care.

Measles cases worldwide have jumped about 300% in one year. The disease spreads like wildfire, and during that time the anti-vaccine supporters continue to resist. In the face of countries suffering from a real problem of access to care, others, even developed countries, are showing increasing mistrust of the vaccine. At the expense of others.

Traveling to Europe? Make sure your measles vaccination is up to date.

The measles outbreak in Europe has been extensive. From January 2018 to June 2018, European countries saw 37 deaths, a record high since the 1990s, among 41 000 reported cases. Low vaccination rates are to blame, the new warning says. In the first 2 months of this year [2019], there were 34 300 reported measles cases in the European region, including 13 measles-related deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

The highest concentration of cases is in Ukraine, but the disease has also been reported in destinations such as France, Greece and Italy. Georgia, Serbia and Russia have also reported high case counts.
