Update on avian influenza in the Netherlands and Belgium
--------------------------------------------------------
The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health met today to
discuss again the avian influenza situation in the Netherlands and Belgium.
In general the existing restrictive measures adopted to prevent the
spreading of the disease and to eradicate it have been extended until 12
May 2003. The Committee also had an exchange of information with regard to
the public health aspects of the current epidemic.
The Netherlands
---------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in the
Netherlands on 28 Feb 2003, 233 infected holdings have been confirmed and
another 23 are seriously suspected to be contaminated. In total, about 18
million birds in about 1000 holdings have been culled.
The Committee today voted in favour of a Commission proposal to extend
until 12 May 2003 the existing measures to prevent the spreading of the
disease and to eradicate it. No live poultry, hatching eggs, or fresh,
unprocessed poultry manure or litter may be exported to other member states
or third countries and, with some exceptions, no live poultry or hatching
eggs may be transported within the Netherlands. The Netherlands shall also
ensure that in the buffer zones created around infected areas, all poultry
will be culled as soon as possible.
In addition to these existing measures, tests will be done on pigs kept on
infected holdings, and movement restrictions will apply to pigs in case of
positive findings. The Netherlands may also decide to apply vaccination
against AI of susceptible birds in zoos.
Belgium
-------
On 15 Apr 2003, avian influenza also spread to Belgium, in the province of
Limburg. To date 3 outbreaks have been confirmed and 2 strongly suspected
outbreaks are under examination.
The Committee extended until 12 May 2003 the measures already adopted by
the Commission on 16 Apr 2003 (see IP/03/552), which are similar to those
taken in the Netherlands. Furthermore, Belgium shall ensure the preventive
depopulation of poultry holdings in the surveillance zone as soon as
possible to create a buffer zone. Tests will also be carried out on pigs in
infected holdings. Belgium may also decide to apply vaccination against AI
of susceptible birds in zoos.
Public health aspects
---------------------
Influenza viruses of avian origin may rarely affect other animals or
humans. Usually, the sickness induced in humans by virus strains of avian
origin is not serious (conjunctivitis, some respiratory signs). Therefore,
Dutch and Belgian authorities advised that veterinarians and other workers
or farmers and their families having direct contact with affected poultry
take protective measures. Those at risk shall use protective clothes and
glasses, receive vaccination against human influenza, and undergo
prophylactic treatment with antiviral drugs.
A total of 82 human cases of conjunctivitis due to avian influenza have
been reported in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. A Dutch veterinarian
died on 17 Apr 2003 of influenza-like illness and bilateral pneumonia.
Following the postmortem examination, the Dutch authorities have arrived at
the conclusion that his death was linked directly to avian influenza virus.
It appears, however, that the veterinarian did not take the antiviral drugs.
At present avian influenza does not represent a risk to the general public.
Furthermore, it must be distinguished from the current outbreaks of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by a different virus
(most likely a coronavirus).
The Commission and the member states urged the Dutch and Belgian
authorities to take all protective measures to prevent influenza infections
of the workers and other persons at risk. Again, these measures may include
the use of protective clothing, gloves, and glasses, as well as vaccination
and prophylactic antiviral treatment.

[The EU's decision to allow both countries the use of an HPAI (highly
pathogenic avian influenza) vaccine in zoos may indicate the availability
of a H7N7 vaccine. More information will be appreciated. Animal protection
organizations in Germany have recently demanded preventive vaccination of
poultry there, to avoid the need for mass slaughter should HPAI be spread
from the 2 infected neighboring countries. This issue might be become the
subject of public debate.
2 additional outbreaks, highly suspected as HPAI, have been reported
yesterday, 24 Apr 2003, in Belgium -- namely, in the municipalities Meer
and Bree. This brings the total current number of outbreaks in Belgium to 7.
The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture reported as of 25 Apr 2003 a cumulative
total of 238 confirmed HPAI-infected farms and an additional 24 outbreaks
currently regarded as "highly suspected". - Mod.AS]
