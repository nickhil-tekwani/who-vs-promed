Saudi Arabia's agriculture ministry has ordered 13 500 ostriches to
be destroyed following a new outbreak of bird flu in the kingdom, the
Al-Watan newspaper reported on Saturday [15 Dec 2007].

The outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the disease that is dangerous to
humans was reported on Thursday [13 Dec 2007] evening at a farm in
the Al-Kharj region, 80 km (50 mi) south of Riyadh, the Arabic
language daily said.

Last month [November 2007], the Saudi authorities ordered nearly 4
million birds culled in the face of at least 14 separate outbreaks of
avian influenza.

There have been no reports of the disease spreading to humans in the
oil-rich desert kingdom.

Saudi Arabia is deploying 49 000 security personnel in its holy
cities to maintain safety and security during the Hajj, the annual
pilgrimage to Mecca. More than 1.6 million Muslims have arrived in
the kingdom to take part in the event, which begins on Monday [17 Dec
2007]. Some 11 000 medical staff are also being stationed in the area.

[In addition to problems related to congestion and stampedes, seen
over the past few years], there are also issues of communicable
diseases, which need to be dealt with, most recently bird flu.

Saudi Arabia's Agriculture Ministry has ordered 13 500 ostriches to
be culled, following an outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu on a
poultry farm about 150 km (93 mi) from the capital, Riyadh. Since the
outbreak of the disease in November [2007] 4.5 million birds have
been culled in the kingdom.

Every Muslim who is physically able and has the financial means is
obligated to carry out the Hajj at least once in a lifetime.

[In addition to avian influenza, another zoonotic disease, which has
to be taken into consideration during these days in Saudi Arabia, is
Rift Valley fever. Though not reported recently within the Kingdom,
this arthropod-borne disease, which since 1990 has been detected
several times in the Arab peninsula, has recently been spreading in
the Horn of Africa and Sudan, traditionally exporters of slaughter
animals. The Saudi authorities are said to have banned imports of
live ruminants from the affected countries. - Mod.AS]

Municipal officials in Riyadh have instructed poultry sellers and
restaurants not to sell ostrich meat following the discovery of bird
flu among ostriches a couple of days ago.

"Municipal inspectors are currently conducting raids on shops and
dining outlets in Riyadh that sell ostrich birds and ostrich meat,"
said Suliman Hamad Al-Buthi, chief of the Environmental Health
Department at the municipality.

"We've already managed to withdraw ostriches and ostrich dishes from
12 restaurants and 6 shops in the city," said Al-Buthi, adding that
the Agriculture Ministry culled 13 500 ostriches following a new
outbreak of bird flu, which was discovered on Thursday evening [13
Dec 2007] at a farm in Al-Kharj region, 80 km (50 mi) south of
Riyadh. So far 4 million birds have been culled following 14 separate
outbreaks of bird flu.

"The situation is, however, under control and there have been no
reports of the disease spreading to humans in the Kingdom," said
Al-Buthi. "We're still receiving emergency calls from Saudis and
residents asking us to visit them and find cases of the deadly
virus," he added.

Meanwhile, the 5 locations designated by Riyadh Municipality for the
dumping of poultry have so far received over 5000 live birds, which
have been culled and incinerated.

"Although, the situation is quickly returning to normalcy, we'll have
to wait for at least 60 days after the last detected case of bird flu
to declare the city, or for that matter the Kingdom, bird flu free,"
he said.

With bird flu typically flaring during the winter months, the virus
has also resurfaced in other parts of Asia. Human deaths have been
reported in Indonesia and China. Indonesia, the nation hardest hit by
the H5N1 virus, announced its 93rd death on Friday [14 Dec 2007]. The
WHO (World Health Organization) report also confirmed Myanmar's 1st
human case and said that 208 people have so far died worldwide.

Bird flu has also been discovered in birds in Brandenburg, Germany,
which was the scene of a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006. A
total of 11 birds, which were kept in a coop, were killed and a 3 km
(2 mi) security zone was put in place [see item 4].

[On top of the officially notified outbreaks in Saudi poultry and
ostriches, there have been media-derived reports on H5N1 in recently
imported falcons (see ProMED-mail 20071212.3997). ProMED-mail
published a request for information on these cases, which could have
been the source of infection in the Kingdom, but no response has been
forthcoming so far; our request is hereby repeated. - Mod.AS

[4] Germany: (Brandenburg), backyard poultry

HPAIV (highly pathogenic avian influenza virus) H5N1-infection in a
backyard flock in North-Eastern Germany
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new case of HPAIV H5N1 infection in poultry was confirmed on 14 Dec
2007 in the Federal State of Brandenburg in North-Eastern Germany.

In a backyard flock of 11 layer chickens, 5 animals suddenly died.
Samples of 2 of the dead chickens were investigated at the regional
laboratory in Frankfurt-Oder showing highly positive results for H5
and N1 in real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction) analyses.

The samples were immediately transferred to the OIE (World
Organization for Animal Health) and National Reference Laboratory for
Avian Influenza at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut. Real-time RT-PCR
specific for Qinghai-like strains of HPAIV (Hoffmann et al., 2007)
confirmed the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in these samples. Preliminary
results of the sequencing analysis of the HA-gene showed a close
relationship to HPAIV H5N1 isolates detected earlier in 2007 in
Germany (HPAIV H5N1 subclade 2.2.3; Starick et al., 2007). Further
molecular analyses are ongoing.
