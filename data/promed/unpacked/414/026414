Highlights of the week
----------------------
In the Syrian Arab Republic, 7 new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 were reported in the past week [week up to 28 Jan 2014]. The reporting of new cases is a sign that surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis is improving in the country, as expected in an outbreak. The response continues country-wide and across the entire Middle East region, to reach more than 22 million children under the age of 5 years with oral polio vaccine (OPV).

Afghanistan
-----------
- 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week, bringing the total WPV1 cases for 2013 to 14, and one case reported in 2014 to date, with onset of paralysis on [14 Jan 2014]. The 1st 2014 case was reported from Alingar, Laghman province, Eastern Region.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) using bivalent OPV [bOPV] were conducted [23-25 Nov 2013] and [15-17 Dec 2013]. In 2014, bOPV SNIDs were completed on [21-23 and 26-28 Jan 2014] in selected eastern and southern districts. Further SNIDs are planned to cover larger areas in the eastern and southern parts of the country in mid and late February [2014].

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV cases were reported this week. The total number of WPV cases for Nigeria 2013 remains 53 (all WPV1). The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [15 Dec 2013] from Damboa, Borno.
- No new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV case had onset of paralysis on [6 Nov 2013] (from Konduga, Borno).
- SNIDs were conducted in south-eastern states of Nigeria on [7-9 and 14-17 Dec 2013]. Further SNIDs were conducted on [25-28 Jan 2014]. National immunization days (NIDs) are planned for March [2014].

Pakistan
--------
- 2 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, one from Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with onset of paralysis on[ 31 Dec 2013] and one from North Waziristan, FATA with onset of paralysis on [4 Jan 2014]. The total number of WPV1 cases for Pakistan in 2013 is now 92. The total number for WPV1 cases for Pakistan in 2014 is now 5. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [5 Jan 2014] (from North Waziristan, FATA).
- 2 new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week, both from North Waziristan. The total number of cVDPV2 cases is now 45 for 2013 and one for 2014. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [3 Jan 2014] (from North Waziristan).
- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in the world. Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in all areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.

Central Africa
--------------
- In Cameroon, no new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case in Cameroon had onset of paralysis on [30 Oct 2013] (WPV1 from Ouest).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week in Cameroon. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Aug 2013] (from Kolfata, Extreme-Nord).
- NIDs were conducted in Cameroon [6-8 Dec 2013] and again [16-19 Jan 2014]. Further campaigns are planned for end February [2014].
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
-NIDs were conducted in Chad from [22-24 Nov 2013]. Further NIDs are planned for late February 2014.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- In Ethiopia, no new WPV1 case was reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [5 Nov 2013] and was reported from Warder district, Somali region.
- In Somalia, one new WPV1 cases was reported in the past week. Onset of paralysis was in June 2013. This case was reported late due to a laboratory processing backlog.
- The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is now 213 (190 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 9 from Ethiopia). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2013] (from Bossaso district, Bari region in Somalia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is on-going. All efforts continue to be made to reach all children across the region.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance in Israel and West Bank and Gaza since February 2013 and continue to be detected in 2014.
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has recently decided to re-introduce OPV into the national immunization schedule.
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
-----------
- In Syria, 7 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases is now 23. The cases were reported from Aleppo, Deir-Al-Zour, Edleb, and Hasakeh governorates, all with onset of paralysis in November and December 2013. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [17 Dec 2013] and was reported from Mara, Edleb governorate. Before the outbreak wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. A 3rd large-scale supplementary immunization activity commenced on [5 Jan 2014]. Initial reporting indicates that over 2 million children were reached during this 3rd SIA.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccinating all Syrian children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.
- The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation. The objective is to stop the outbreak in Syria by the end of March 2014 and prevent any further international spread.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad, and Nigeria (Borno).
- National campaigns were conducted in West Africa [22-25 Nov 2013]. Further national campaigns are planned for March and April [2014].

[As of 29 Jan 2014, there have been 6 WPV1 associated polio cases confirmed. All 6 of these cases were identified in endemic countries, 5 in Pakistan and one in Afghanistan.

As countries are still confirming cases with dates of onset in 2013, it is still premature to "close the books" on the final count of confirmed cases of polio globally.

That qualification being said, comparing the 2012 data with the 2013 preliminary data, 2013 saw a significant increase in the number of WPV cases reported. The global total of cases in 2012 was 223, whereas to date there have been 399 confirmed cases reported in 2013, representing a 79 per cent increase in confirmed cases of polio globally. The positive note was that the number of confirmed cases identified in endemic countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan) decreased by 27 per cent from 217 in 2012 to 159 in 2013. Unfortunately the majority of cases in 2013 were seen in non-endemic countries associated with outbreaks caused by viruses genetically similar to those circulating in endemic countries. Major outbreaks were seen in the Horn of Africa (a total of 213 cases confirmed to date, with 190 in Somalia, 14 in Kenya, and 9 in Ethiopia) and Syria (23 cases confirmed to date). In Central Africa there were 4 cases confirmed in Cameroon.

Another significant event during 2013 (and continuing into January 2014) was the identification of WPV1 circulating in Israel. While there have not been paralytic cases associated with this circulation, the continued presence of WPV1 in sewage samples throughout the country has led Israel to change its vaccination schedules from a pure IPV, to a combined IPV/OPV schedule in order to interrupt the transmission of the WPV1.

In 2013 there were several episodes of violence directed at polio vaccination workers and these have continued through December 2013 and in January 2014 in Pakistan (see http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25823154). These episodes of violence are significant barriers to the achievement of the goal of polio eradication. It is noteworthy that the WPV's associated with circulation in Israel, Egypt (December 2012), and in Syria have been identified as genetically similar to viruses circulating in Pakistan.
