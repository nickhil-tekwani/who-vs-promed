[1] Paraguay (new case)

The yellow fever (YF) outbreak claimed another victim in Paraguay.
According to information from sources in the Tropical Medicine
Institute in the capital, a 49-year-old man died last Monday [18 Feb
2008] with symptoms characteristic of YF [apparently not yet
laboratory confirmed. - Mod.TY].

This apparently new fatal case shook the population during the day
yesterday [19 Feb 2008], which mobilized, demanding to be vaccinated
against YF and did not permit trucks with the vaccine to leave, while
in other hospitals there have been demonstrations making similar demands.

The Paraguay Vice Minister of Health, Antonio Barrios, asked that
people in hospitals and health centers without vaccine be calm "this
[situation] is because people have resorted in mass to the Ministry
of Health and are blocking the departure of vehicles that are
distributing the vaccine."

With this same sense [of urgency], the Argentine Ministry of Health
has increased the dispatch of [YF] vaccine to border points, in order
to avoid the transmission of the disease in [Argentine] national
territory. Up until the present, there have been no confirmed YF
cases [in humans] on Argentine soil, although there are ongoing
studies of monkeys that died some days ago in the border province of
Misiones, apparently due to sylvatic [forest or jungle] YF.

[This is an example of how the emergence of a serious disease can
cause panic in the population, complicating the logistical job of
public health workers, and illustrates the challenge of and need for
effective communication with the public in times of perceived disease
outbreak crisis. A map of Paraguay can be accessed at

As of 20 Feb 2008, The Ministry of Health (MoH), Paraguay has
notified the confirmation of 7 cases of jungle yellow fever from San
Pedro Department. Another cluster with 4 clinically compatible cases
occurred in the urban area of San Lorenzo municipality, 20 km from
Asuncion [the country's capital]. Final confirmation of these 4 cases
is pending.

The Ministry of Health has strengthened public health containment
measures in the affected areas. Integrated control measures involving
mass vaccination for people living in, or traveling to, the affected
area; vector control; and heightened surveillance are underway to
prevent serious public health consequences given the current low
level of immunization among the people living in the affected area.

A PAHO team of experts including an epidemiologist,
clinician/virologist, risk communicator, immunization advisers and
emergency management experts was deployed to Paraguay on 15 Feb
[2008]. A laboratory scientist from IEC Instituto Evandro Chagas
(Brazil) will join the national public health laboratory shortly.

The yellow fever vaccines shortage has been addressed by mobilizing
vaccines available in countries of the region. In addition, the MoH
has requested 2 million doses of vaccine from the WHO ICG
(International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision).

[It is reassuring to see an international team of experts dispatched
to help the Paraguay Ministry of Health's efforts to contain and
control the YF outbreak, especially given the apparent urban cluster.
We wish them success in their efforts and await further news with
interest and concern. - Mod.TY]

The deaths of 7 monkeys in the Nova Guarita municipality
(approximately 700 km north of Cuiaba) in January of this year [2008]
is being analyzed as having been caused by the yellow fever (YF)
virus. This situation was reported in the Epidemiological Bulletin of
the Ministry of Health as a YF epizootic, but it still has not been
laboratory confirmed. According to Ministry of Health data, this is
the 1st monkey death [event] in Mato Grosso suspected to be caused by
this virus since January 2007.

As of yesterday [18 Feb 2008], 12 deaths of monkeys in Mato Grosso
had been reported to the Ministry of Health, but without suspicion of
YF virus infection. Of these monkey deaths, only the New Guarita
[monkeys] have been suspected [as dying of] this disease. In 2007,
only one case of [YF] monkey death was recorded in the state. In the
beginning of this week [18 Feb 2008], the Epidemiologic Bulletin of
the Ministry of Health registered the 1st [human] case of sylvan YF
in Mato Grosso.
