County is in the grip of deadly bug
-----------------------------------
It was revealed today [Thu 15 Jul 2004] that Shropshire is in the grip of a
new hospital killer bug, which may have claimed up 28 lives. The alarm has
been raised by Telford & Wrekin coroner, Michael Gwynne, who is now
demanding tough action to control what is known as ESBL -- Extended
Spectrum Beta Lactamose -- a highly resistant strain of E. coli.
Most of the deaths involve patients from the Telford area, and Mr. Gwynne
is calling on the Princess Royal Hospital to ensure that staff follow
procedures to fight the bug, such as regular washing of hands.
The coroner also revealed today [Thu 15 Jul 2004] that he, and coroner
colleagues, had not been told of the outbreak until a year after the 1st
case was reported.
He said: "In March of this year [2004], I, and my fellow coroners for the
county of Shropshire, received a letter from the Shrewsbury and Telford
Hospital NHS Trust seeking our advice on the matter of referral of deaths
of patients who had died from ESBL."
"We were told the outbreak had been identified in Shropshire in March of
2003, and that, up to March 2004, there had been more than 200 clinical
infections. In the 1st 105 cases, there had been 28 deaths."
He said he was planning to reopen an inquest into the death of a Telford
woman who died on 29 May 2004 at the Princess Royal Hospital. He has been
told that her death was attributable to ESBL.

[Extended-spectrum beta lacatamases (ESBLs) are enzymes elaborated by
bacteria, most often _Klebsiella_ spp., but other _Enterobacteriaceae_ as
well. These enzymes cleave, and, thereby, inactivate most penicillins and
cephalosporins. These have become common nosocomial pathogens in many
regions, and nosocomial outbreaks may occur. Treatment can be difficult,
but most isolates remain susceptible to the carbapenem antibiotics, such as
imipenem. - Mod.LM]
