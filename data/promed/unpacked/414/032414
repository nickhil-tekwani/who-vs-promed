Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 30 Sep 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 18 Oct 2017
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 26 Feb 2009
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Espaillat, Guanabano, Moca, Espaillat
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Sep 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of /Slaughtered
Birds / 48 877 / 1953 / 1953 / 0 / 0 /
Affected population: Population kept in a farm composed of eight layer units.
Outbreak statistics: [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 4 / 4 / 100 / 4

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: abnormal mortality and drop of production were detected in a farm composed of 8 layer units, in a community of the province of Espaillat. The national reference laboratory (central veterinary laboratory) confirmed the presence of avian influenza virus. Samples were sent to the national veterinary services laboratory, USA, and H5N2 presence was confirmed. Surveillance and control measures were taken in the focal area (1 km/[about 0.6 mi) and surveillance measures, in the perifocal area (3-5 km/[about 2-3 mi]), including surveys, sampling and epidemiological investigation. Disposal of the eggs kept under quarantine has started. Stamping out of the whole susceptible population will be carried out. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be carried out following fallowing. Intensive surveillance of the bird farms around the outbreak (3 km/[about 2 mi]) will be maintained for 3 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, quarantine, official destruction of animal products, ante and post-mortem inspections, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, disinfection, process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central veterinary laboratory (national laboratory) / Birds / agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) / 11 Oct 2017 / Positive
Central veterinary laboratory (National laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 18 Oct 2017 / Positive
National veterinary services laboratory, USA (OIE reference laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 18 Oct 2017 / Positive
National veterinary services laboratory, USA (OIE reference laboratory) / Birds / virus sequencing / 24 Oct 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity -- the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic chickens.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to domestic poultry, and can spread rapidly from flock-to-flock.

Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl and shorebirds without causing illness." (https://goo.gl/nzis8z)

"Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection, the area must be clear of organic material."
