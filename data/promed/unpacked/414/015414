Experts from the Agricultural Research Council, organised agriculture and
the National Department of Agriculture will work together to assess the
outbreak of Karnal Bunt, a wheat disease that has been recently identified
at a farm in the Northern Cape. This is the first time that the disease has
been identified in South Africa.
The National Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Council
in association with organised agriculture will [collaborate to contain [the
disease by means of drafting and enforcing quarantine measures regarding
the contaminated farm. They will [also conduct a survey to establish the
extent of the infected area and of infected seed stocks, establish future
control measures and provide information regarding Karnal Bunt.
The Department [has requested that under no circumstances should any
suspect seed or plant material be removed or distributed from its place of
origin.
Karnal Bunt is a seed and soil borne fungal disease that is caused by the
fungus _Tilletia indica_. The disease causes only limited yield loss, has
little effect on grain quality, [and is not toxic to humans and animals.
The pathogen survives in the soil for up to 5 years, infecting the plant in
the flowering stage and causing deformation of the seed as well as an
unpleasant fishy odour. Even though it causes only limited yield losses,
Karnal Bunt reduces seed quality should more than 3% of the seed become
contaminated. It attacks bread wheat, durum wheat (from which pasta is
made) and Korog (a hybrid between wheat and rye).
Seed, soil, tractors, harvesters and other implements as well [as water and
wind spread Karnal Bunt over limited distances.

[According to Dr. S. H. Koch, a plant pathologist in South Africa, the
disease was discovered on a farm near Douglas which is about 550 Km
southwest of Johannesburg. The disease was first reported in 1931 near
Karnal, Punjab, India. It has since been reported in Pakistan, Iraq,
Afghanistan, Mexico, and the USA. - Mod.DH
