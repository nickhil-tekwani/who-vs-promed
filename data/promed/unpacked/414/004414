Uh, oh -- I think you're going to be deluged with responses after this one!
What you had was the standard old relapsing vivax malaria, in which hepatic
hypnozoites (unknown in 1956, and always insensitive to chloroquine) simply
woke up and caused a relapse -- not the same as true chloroquine-resistance.

I don't have time to "research" this, but we never expected chloroquine to
protect against infection against _P. vivax_. The liver phase infection
still occurs; the clinical" course would normally be suppressed while the
patient was taking chloroquine (which should be continued for four weeks
after departing the area). The case described here (at least the "way" it
is described) does seem to confirm chloroquine-resistant vivax. No mention
is made about his "terminal prophylaxis" with primaquine when he departed
the malarious area. In vitro confirmatory studies are far more important,
of course.

[One lives & learns. My understanding at the time was that as long as I
took chloroquine for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area, I would not
get an infected liver. But I had my first attack the day after I left
Borneo. I was staying with 2 expatriate physicians in Singapore, and their
first thought was malaria, but when I assured them I had conscientiously
taken chloroqine both before & during my stay in Borneo, they changed their
diagnosis to scrub typhus (& told me there was no treatment - IÂ´d either
live or die). I recovered without any medication, then relapsed back in
England 4 weeks later. My cure there was a course of primaquin. - Mod.JW
