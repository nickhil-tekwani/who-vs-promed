FASCIOLA HEPATICA, HOST RANGE: REQUEST FOR INFO
===============================================
Date: Wed, 21 May 1997 22:00:34 -0300
From: Hawkins Chris <chawkins@infotech.agric.wa.gov.au>

An incidental finding of patent infections of _Fasciola hepatica_ in emus
in Australia was made some time back. Clinical disease was not evident,
and the fluke were found during autopsies following death due to trauma.
Have any of you observed _F. hepatica_ in emus, ostriches, or other
ratites? The concern is the possible spread of fluke from one state to
another in ostriches etc. because there are no fluke control regimes in
place for them, as there are for the more traditional hosts of _F. hepatica_.
