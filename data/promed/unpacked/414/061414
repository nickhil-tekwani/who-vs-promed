The Detroit Free Press reported today an outbreak of salmonella among
songbirds in Michigan (USA). The paper quotes Kimberli Miller of the US
Geological Survey's national Wildlife Health Center in Madison, "We really
have not seen a die-off over such a wide geographic area in the 25 years
that this center has been here."
Common redpolls, goldfinches, evening grosbeaks,and other songbirds are
getting sick and dropping dead across Michigan and at least 14 other Midwest
and Northeast states, the Grand Rapids Press reported Tuesday.
The Free press quotes Miller as saying "Although a few Western states
experience songbird deaths from salmonella every few years, the last major
outbreak was reported in New York and some New England states in 1988.
It is not known why the outbreak is so intense this year.
