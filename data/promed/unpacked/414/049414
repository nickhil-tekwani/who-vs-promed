Piroplasmosis, equine - Hong Kong
Re: Interim Report dated 12 May 2000 to the International Collating Centre
(Information Exchange on Equine Infectious Diseases), Animal Health Trust,
Newmarket, UK - copy attached
I am somewhat concerned about the information that is being reported on
your site as detailed in the two captioned references and which was
obtained from a daily newspaper produced in Hong Kong. I therefore include
here the facts of the cases as they are currently known.
A. Equine Piroplasmosis.
Since my last report to ProMED on 19 Apr 2000 the following information has
become available.
Blood Test Results:
Agricultural Research Council, Veterinary Research Institute,
Onderstepoort, Republic of South Africa
Report ID - OP124112, 20 Apr 2000
* A total of 1330 samples, all tested by IFAT:
* - B. equi: 1330 NEGATIVE and 0 POSITIVE
* - B. caballi: 1329 NEGATIVE and 1 POSITIVE @ 160
The single POSITIVE B. caballi occurred in a 6 year old (foaled 20 Sep
1993), thoroughbred racehorse (entire male), imported into Hong Kong
directly from Australia on 14 Nov 1995. A total of 16 stored serum samples,
collected from this horse between 13 Dec 1995 and 18 Apr 2000 will be
tested by both CFT and IFAT to further investigate this case. Stored serum
samples collected from the other horses imported in the same batch will
also be tested.
Interim IFAT Summary:
B. equi: 1340 NEGATIVE (85.79%) of the total equine population (1562) of
Hong Kong
B. caballi: 1331 NEGATIVE (85.21%) of the total equine population (1562) of
Hong Kong
All the remaining horses have NEGATIVE CFT and these are currently being
re-tested by IFAT so that the total equine population of Hong Kong will
have been tested by IFAT
Tick Survey:
* No ticks have been found on any equine in Hong Kong.
* One tick was found on 25 Apr 2000 in the surrounding vegetation of the Lo
Wu Saddle Club, a riding school in the northern New Territories of Hong
Kong. This tick has been identified as _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ (the
brown dog tick). This is the only tick found so far during the ongoing
routine surveys of all equine premises and facilities in Hong Kong.
It is evident therefore that equine piroplasmosis is NOT circulating in the
equine population of Hong Kong.
B. Equine herpesvirus-1
The Animal Health Trust (AHT) at Newmarket, UK is currently performing
serological analysis of all affected cases in which a 10 day interval has
elapsed making them suitable for paired sera analysis. The AHT will also be
undertaking further examinations of the virus isolate.

Dear Sirs,
Re: Interim Report
Re: Equine Herpesvirus - 1
Re: Reporting Form - attached
Since around 17 Apr 2000, 22 of the 25 flat-racing thoroughbred training
stables at Sha Tin Racecourse and training complex have reported that 132
horses have been off their feed and 31 horses have exhibited a mild to
moderately raised body temperature. These numbers represent 13% and 3%
respectively of the total population of 1033 thoroughbreds in training.
During the same period, 6 of the territory's 9 riding schools reported 54
horses off their feed and 18 with mild to moderately raised body
temperatures. These numbers represent 11% and 4% respectively of the total
population of 483 retired racehorses, hacks and ponies.
Clinical signs have been very mild with only inappetence and pyrexia
reported and observed and affected horses have usually regained their
normal appetite and temperature within a day or two.
During the last few days of April, the number of cases peaked and none have
been reported in the riding schools or racing stables since 9 and 10 May
respectively. There has been a minimal effect on the racing programme in
Hong Kong.
Movement restrictions have been temporarily placed on equines within Hong
Kong. No horse can enter the local population from overseas without
undergoing a minimum 21 days pre-import quarantine and a minimum 14 days
post-arrival quarantine. However the local racehorse population lives in a
very densely populated situation where rapid spread of air-borne pathogens
is unfortunately unavoidable.
The Department of Microbiology of the University of Hong Kong has isolated
an alphaherpesvirus, equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), from 6 of the
nasopharyngeal (nose and throat) swabs taken from affected horses. The
viral isolate was grown in an equine cell line and identified by the
indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), using monoclonal antibodies.
In the most recent previous outbreak during February and March 1997, both
EHV-1 and EHV-4 were identified and are often referred to as "equine viral
abortion" and "equine rhinopneumonitis" respectively. Agent isolation and
serology studies are ongoing to determine whether or not both viruses (or
any others) are involved in the current outbreak. Directigen Flu-A rapid
diagnostic tests and attempts at equine influenza virus isolation, have all
proven negative.
The isolated strain of the equine herpesvirus is contained in the vaccine
(Duvaxyn EHV 1,4) that has been administered to all equines in Hong Kong on
a biannual basis since it became available after the last equine
herpesvirus outbreak in the territory, when 228 racehorses at the Sha Tin
racecourse training stables were reported as pyrexic. During the latter
outbreak the clinical signs were more severe with more horses affected.
This illustrates the value of the vaccination programme which has worked so
far to reduce the extent and severity of the current outbreak of this
equine viral disease which is ubiquitous in horses worldwide due to its
latent nature in the glands of a very high percentage of horses (surveys
have shown up to 70%) and becoming activated, usually at times of stress.
It is acknowledged that vaccination provides variable protection and will
not clear latent infections. However based upon the objective signs of
pyrexia (raised temperature) and comparing the number of reported cases in
the racehorses stabled at the Sha Tin Racecourse training stables in both
the 1997 (228 pyrexic horses or 21% of the population) and the current
outbreak to date (31 pyrexic horses or 3% of the population), then it would
appear that the vaccination programme has reduced the number of horses with
reported fevers by around 86%.
Yours sincerely

N.B.: EHV-1 can cause four clinical syndromes:
* respiratory disease
* abortion
* perinatal disease
* myeloencephalitis
Following primary infection the incubation period ranges from 2 days to 2
weeks. Clinical signs may include fever, conjunctivitis, coughing and mild
inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, and usually resolve within 2-5
days although nasal discharge and cough may last 1-3 weeks. Inapparent
infection is common. Transmission is by inhalation of infected droplets and
requires close contact, as herpesviruses tend not to survive well outside
the animal body. Following primary infection, virus is shed from the
nasopharynx for 7-14 days. Virus shedding following re-infection or
re-activation of latent infections is usually transient (2 to 4 days).
Virus is also shed in saliva, ocular discharge and faeces.
C. Le Cadre Noir de Saumur
With reference to the temporary importation into Hong Kong from France of
27 equitation performance horses of the Le Cadre Noir de Saumur, this has
been done whilst fully complying with the official import/export government
health protocols of both France and Hong Kong and appropriate quarantine
and management practices have been implemented as officially required.

[We appreciate Keith Watkins bringing us up to date on this problem. From
the evidence to date it would seem that the piroplasmosis problem may have
originated in Australia and was recycled back. It is valuable to see how
their vaccination programme is coping. - Mod.MHJ
