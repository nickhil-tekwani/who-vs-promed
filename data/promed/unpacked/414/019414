Red locust outbreaks and allergies in the Sudan
-----------------------------------------------
Three locust species, namely the migratory locust (_Locusta migratoria_),
the desert locust (_Schistocerca gregaria_), and the red locust
(_Nomadacris septemfasciata_) occur in Africa, all of which have been
reported from the Sudan. I imagine that the so-called dark-red locust
referred to in the initial report of respiratory illness caused by locusts
is the red locust.
Nearly all books on entomology and medical entomology that comment on
allergies caused by contact with arthropods include reports that locusts
can cause rhinitis, shortness of breath, congestion and bronchial asthma
and in severe cases anaphylactic shock (a potentially life-threatening
condition of respiratory distress and collapse of circulation), all caused
mainly by inhalation of microscopic locust particles or their feces
(commonly called frass).
Some people who work habitually in insectaries colonizing a range of
insects, including moths, cockroaches and locusts may become allergic to
airborne particles. M LeClercq (1) reported that workers rearing locusts
suffered rhinitis, itching skin, bronchitis, and ultimately asthma, and
generally in that sequence, while RA Wirtz (2) described a study in which
all those working with locusts suffered dyspnea. Because of these problems
there should be good air circulation and extraction fans in insectaries,
and sometimes workers may need to wear protective masks or even
respirators. A useful bibliography of insects causing inhalant allergies is
given by TE Bellas (1982) ).
Concerning the original report linking illness in Sudan to a hormone that
is released by locusts during the mating season, this could be true.
Studies on the desert and migratory locusts have shown that in response to
crowding they become darker due to production of a neurohormone consisting
of 11 amino acids (3) So it is possible that locusts with this hormone are
more allergenic than those that have not produced it.
Although allergies arising from locusts are usually reported in insectary
workers who are in great physical contact with locusts, because of the
incredible numbers (1000 million or more!) of locusts in locust plagues or
swarms it is not surprising that other people, especially those with asthma
or a predisposition to asthma develop series allergies. It would
nevertheless be interesting to have more details of the degree of exposure
to locusts that people had, who suffered serious allergies in the Sudan
during the locust invasion.
