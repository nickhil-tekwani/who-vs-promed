As wet and windy weather puts an abrupt stop to fieldwork, FWI's
agronomists report increasing disease pressure in the run-up to the
T0 [coleoptile tiller stage] fungicide timing.

"Cereal diseases have started to manifest themselves quite well and
we are starting to see differences depending on variety and drilling
date," Neil Potts said. Most wheat varieties in his part of Devon
were showing good levels of septoria, with early drilled fields
"going quite yellow with the disease". The only variety showing
significantly less septoria was Gatsby, he noted.

Essex-based Andrew Blazey said there were increasing reports of brown
and yellow rust and some forward wheats were carrying low levels of
[powdery] mildew that would need treating at T0.

[Cereal diseases of the septoria complex can be caused by the fungi
_Mycosphaerella graminicola_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) and
_Phaeosphaeria nodorum_. These pathogens cause blotches on both
leaves and glumes. Leaf rust, also called brown rust, on wheat is
caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_, and stripe (yellow) rust
is caused by _P. striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. Both these rusts
affect leaves reducing the photosynthetic potential of the plant.
Powdery mildew of wheat is caused by _Blumeria graminis_ and affects
all aerial parts of the host.

These fungal pathogens have been reported from most cereal growing
areas worldwide causing yield losses. New pathogen strains with
increased virulence have been reported in several cases. Generally,
fungi or their spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind
and/or water, and mechanical means. Disease management for cereal
hosts includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and removal of inoculum sources.

Cereal disease management can be applied at key decision times (T0,
T1, T2 and T3) to reflect the changing risk as the season unfolds. T
reflects the growth stages referring to tillers present at a
particular time: T0 refers to the coleoptile tiller, T1 to the tiller
developing from the first leaf, etc. Early discovery of infection at
any stage of the crop cycle is important so action can be taken to
limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum.
