State of Connecticut Mosquito Management Program

On 25 Sep 2000, The State Mosquito Management Program has temporarily
suspended ground-level spraying for the control of mosquitoes in the state.
The DEP, DPH, and CAES have consulted and agreed to postpone ground
application to control mosquitoes which was scheduled for Tuesday, September
26 in Stamford and parts of Darien due to concerns about adverse weather
conditions. Spraying scheduled in Meriden for 25 Sep 2000 has been postponed
at the request of city officials. The State has not withdrawn its
recommendation to spray these affected communities. When temperatures are
below 50 degrees mosquito activity decreases, making ground level spraying
less effective. Current weather forecasts for the remainder of the week
present unfavorable conditions; wind, rain and cooler evenings, which will
effectively reduce current mosquito populations.
On 25 Sep 2000, the state announced the finding of a crow positive for West
Nile Virus in the town of Manchester. No spraying is currently planned in
the town of Manchester.

New York City Dept. of Health Press Release
<http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/html/public/press00/pres2000.html> [edited
On Sat 23 Sep 2000, New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D.,
announced today that a 52 year-old Staten Island man has tested positive for
West Nile virus (WNV). The individual, who lives in Greenridge, Staten
Island, was admitted to the hospital on September 19 with encephalitis,
after having experienced flu-like symptoms for several weeks. He is
currently hospitalized in stable condition, and is improving. The laboratory
results were obtained by tests performed at the New York City Department of
Health's (NYCDOH) laboratories, and specimens have been sent to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further confirmation. A
total of 12 people have been diagnosed with West Nile virus in New York City
in 2000. "While the peak of the mosquito season in New York City has passed,
and we will see fewer mosquitoes as temperatures drop, we are still finding
evidence of West Nile virus through our ongoing surveillance activities, and
an additional human illness at this time of year is not surprising," Dr.
Cohen said.
Bird and Mosquito Findings
The positive WNV findings announced today include: in Queens, one bird, a
veery (a member of the thrush family) collected in Forest Hills on 10 Sep
2000. In Brooklyn, one mosquito pool collected from Dyker eights on 9 Sep
2000. On Staten Island, 4 mosquito pools: one collected from Richmond
Valley on 12 Sep 2000; one collected from the Silver Lake area on 12 Sep
2000; one collected from Tottenville on 12 Sep 2000; and one collected from
Westerleigh on 6 Sep 2000.

Surveillance data
------------------
I implore ProMED-mail to require that postings of West Nile "positives"
include the diagnostic test used. ProMED-mail has continued to spread
reports of the presence of West Nile virus based on reports that are
probably based on PCR and/or serologic diagnostics. Is this so? Where have
there been virus isolations? Have there been attempts at virus isolations
that failed? Where? What diagnostic is the basis for determining the
presence of West Nile virus in a specific region? We are being deluged by
imprecise reports of "positives."
One would have thought this information would be forthcoming to allow
readers to interpret the meaning of the numerous West Nile virus reports.
The absence of this information has caused considerable confusion. The
finding of a PCR positive or serologic positive bird in Canada does not
necessarily mean that West Nile virus has spread to Canada.

[Dr. Tabachnick raises some important issues. Unfortunately the nature of
the diagnostic tests are rarely communicated and there are not enough hours
in the day for ProMED-mail moderators and editors to ferret out the
information. - Mod.CP

West Nile virus, inappropriate optimism
---------------------------------------
Is it interesting to anyone else that not a single predictor of the
emergence and spread of West Nile virus has been useful? In New York City,
authorities (or perhaps "spokespeople" would be a better term), who were not
able even to make a misdiagnosis of St. Louis encephalitis, leaving that to
CDC instead, spoke of containing West Nile virus and hoped the virus would
not overwinter in the harsh climate of the northeastern U.S. It overwintered
quite nicely.
When cases began occurring in Staten Island (Borough of Richmond) this year
the spokespeople were quick to point out that the probable dates of
infection of those cases were before insecticide spraying/vector control
began. No one has since announced that recent cases likely were infected
after such control programs began.
New Jersey spokespeople indicated that, because of the excellence of their
mosquito control program, there would likely be no human infections due to
West Nile virus in New Jersey. So much for that prediction.
Although West Nile virus has spread from the apparent epicenter in New York
City and has been found from near [and across? the Canadian border to near
all other state lines, West Nile virus has not been found in Pennsylvania,
suggesting that birds are not crossing the state line.
An Israeli spokesperson was quoted in various media sources (and posted on
ProMED-mail) that West Nile virus occurs with some regularity in Israel and
that the government was not planning on panicking, as "the people of New
York had done". This morning's newspaper carried a story about 13 deaths and
thousands of cases of West Nile virus there and that a "state of emergency"
has been declared. [The Israeli outbreak has been designated an "epidemic"
and "not-an-epidemic" in quick succession by Israeli spokespeople with
different agendas. - Mod.CP
The expansion of West Nile virus habitat to North American cities clearly
has underlined what many of us have been saying for years, that short shrift
has been paid to arbovirology, to the training of medical entomologists, and
to the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. That sentinel chickens are
useless as indicators of West Nile virus activity (why?), that the
southwestern border of New York State is as far as the virus has been found
in that region (why?), that the virus has not spread further south than
Maryland (why not?), that outbound migratory birds last year did not take
the virus with them to Florida and Latin America (why not?), that we
obviously do not know what the vectors are as this virus adapts to its new
ecosystem (why not?). It is likely that the control programs that have been
employed have been less a factor this year than have the natural conditions
in the northeastern U.S. Worst of all this, not a single prediction has been
correct.
Here are two predictions: As West Nile virus expands further and probes even
more eco-niches in the U.S., it will infect more arthropod vectors, and kill
more humans, horses, wild birds, bats, pet rabbits, and domestic animals.
That everyone who makes a prediction about this virus in North America,
without any knowledge whatsoever, will be shown to be wrong.
Education and training are needed, not more people with suits.

[Dr. Calisher has highlighted many important issues regarding the
epidemiology of West Nile virus infection in North America, and concerning
the management of information. I have edited Dr. Calisher's contribution to
make it conform with certain aspects of ProMED-mail policy. If anyone feels
short-changed, the full text is available from the source. In defence of
spokespeople, it should be recognized that very often they are merely acting
on inadequate and equivocal information provided by their scientific and
medical advisors. - Mod.CP
