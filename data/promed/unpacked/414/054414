The first confirmed case of avian flu in a mammal in Washington state has been detected in a baby raccoon at Sacajawea Historical State Park in Pasco. It is also the first case of avian flu confirmed in a raccoon in North America, according to the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

The agency is warning pet owners not to let their dogs and cats scavenge sick or dead birds or other wildlife or even interact with sick wildlife. (Rabies is another reason not to let your pet interact with sick wildlife. - Mod.TG]

Four raccoon kits with apparent avian influenza were found at the park at the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers earlier this month [June 2022], according to Fish and Wildlife. One was tested to confirm the disease. 2 of the kits were dead, and the other 2 were obviously sick and were euthanized.

Avian flu was detected in the Tri-Cities [Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, in the Columbia Basin of Eastern Washington. - Mod.SH] starting in May this year [2022] in baby geese. Visitors to the park were finding dead goslings and baby geese were walking in circles, having seizures and sitting still and letting people approach them. There followed reports of more geese with avian flu across the Tri-Cities area; a mallard, a duck, and a crow in Richland; a gull at Sacajawea Park; and a sandhill crane in Connell.

To date, Benton and Franklin counties are not among the 10 counties in Washington with outbreaks in backyard poultry flocks. However, flocks in Spokane and Yakima counties have tested positive. While sick goslings, in particular, continue to be reported, officials have been receiving fewer reports than they did initially, said Staci Lehman with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. Avian flu, or bird flu, is very contagious among birds. It is spread through saliva and feces and surfaces contaminated with them, such as the bottom of shoes.

Avian flu has previously been detected in red foxes and skunks in North America. Elsewhere in the world, it has infected pigs in Asia, domestic cats in Germany, and a domestic dog in Thailand. There's the potential for it to infect other mammals as bird flu viruses evolve, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife does not expect the spread of avian flu to have a large impact at this time on wildlife in the state. People should be watching for it in their backyard flocks of chickens, ducks, and poultry.

One strain of avian flu, highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI, is generally fatal for birds. But there may be no signs of disease or mild signs such as ruffled feathers or a drop in egg production in the low pathogenic avian influenza, or LPAI, strain. A single sick bird in a flock should be reported to your veterinarian. If multiple birds die or have an unusual illness, you are asked to call the state sick bird hotline at 800-606-3056.

There is no treatment for the disease. Avian flu is not easily transmissible from birds to people, but there are occasional cases. Just one case in a person in the United States has been reported this spring [2022]. A person who had handled infected poultry tested positive for an avian flu virus.

People who see a wild bird or mammal appearing to be infected or dead should report it to the Fish and Wildlife department at https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/bird-flu.

Fish and Wildlife recommends common sense precautions to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading avian flu or any wildlife disease:
- Wear disposable gloves when cleaning harvested birds or cleaning bird feeders.
- Do not dispose of processed bird carcasses in the field where they could be eaten by scavengers or raptors. Bag them and place in the garbage, bury or incinerate them.
- Ensure all equipment (boots, clothes, vehicles, firearms) is cleaned and disinfected to prevent the spread of diseases.
- Do not harvest or handle wild birds which are obviously sick or found dead.
- Do not eat, drink or smoke while cleaning game.
- Wash hands with soap and water or use alcohol hand sanitizer immediately after handling game or cleaning bird feeders.
- Wash tools and work surfaces used to clean game birds with soap and water, then disinfect with a 10% solution of chlorine bleach.
- Separate raw meat, and anything it touches, from cooked or ready-to-eat foods to avoid contamination.
- Cook game birds thoroughly. Meat should reach an internal temperature of 155 to 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill disease organisms and parasites.
- If you experience flu-like symptoms following contact with sick or dead wild birds or have concerns about potential exposure to infected birds, contact the Benton Franklin Health District for recommendations and guidance on monitoring symptoms or possible testing.

[Avian influenza continues to affect a variety of bird species. We do not always expect it to cross over into mammals. However, consumption of diseased birds, or prolonged contact with infected birds or their droppings, may hasten transmission to other species of animals, or potentially to humans.

When dealing with wild or domestic birds or animals, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, and perhaps follow with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Protect yourself and other domestic animals if you can. - Mod.TG

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common but, since April 2022, there have been several events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in wild carnivores (Order Carnivora). Most reports have been of red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, Family Canidae), but skunks (Family Mephitidae) and now raccoons (Family Procyonidae) have also been found infected.

The fact that there is also a high number of reports of HPAI H5N1 in birds of prey and scavengers suggests that predators/scavengers in general (both mammals and birds) are being highly exposed. Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB
