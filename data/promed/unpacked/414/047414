Mumps outbreak spreads to WA from NT cases
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of mumps, which appears to have spread to Western
Australia (WA) from the Northern Territory (NT), has caused about 10
times the usual number of cases so far this year [2008]. A total of
46 cases of the childhood infection had been reported to health
authorities by the middle of last month [February 20008] compared
with 4 cases at the same time last year and 6 in early 2006.

The Health Department, which is investigating the outbreak, described
the number of cases as surprising and well above normal. They
appeared to be part of an outbreak which started in a boarding school
in the Northern Territory last year [2008] and spread firstly into
the Kimberley and then into other parts of WA. While most of this
year's cases have been in the Kimberley and the Goldfields, several
have been reported in the metropolitan area [Perth].

Mumps is a contagious infection caused by a virus and occurs mainly
in school-aged children. It had become rarer thanks to the MMR
vaccine which protects against mumps, measles and rubella and is
given to children when they are babies and as they start preschool.
Infection spreads when a person breathes in the mumps virus that has
been coughed or sneezed into the air by an infectious person. The
mumps virus can also spread from person to person via direct contact
with infected saliva. Serious complications from the mumps are
uncommon but can include inflammation of the brain, spinal cord and
pancreas, hearing loss and sterility.

The department's director of communicable disease control, Paul Van
Buynder, said that although parents needed to ensure their children
were properly immunised against mumps, there was no evidence that the
spike in cases was because fewer children were being vaccinated.

"We have always known that mumps vaccine is not as effective as the
measles vaccine, but the rate of disease is surprising," he said.
"The Communicable Disease Control Directorate is conducting a
detailed study with NT Health to investigate why this has happened.
There is no indication at present that this represents low
vaccination levels. The Department of Health continues to encourage
parents to make sure their children's immunisations are up-to-date."

The routine time for the MMR vaccination is at 12 months then again at 4 years.

The interactive HealthMap of Australia can be accessed at
<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=-25.7,134.5,4> to show the location of
the state of Western Australia. The Kimberley district is located in
the northeastern part of the state (see map at
<http://www.ozhorizons.com.au/wa/map.htm>) with the Goldfields
district lying to the south.

Corresponding information for the mumps outbreak in the Northern
Territory would be appreciated. It is not clear whether the outbreak
in Western Australia is a consequence of inadequate vaccine coverage
or is a problem of vaccine efficacy. - Mod.CP]
