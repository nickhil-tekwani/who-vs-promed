The strain of non-O157 _Escherichia coli_ that has caused recent illnesses
in Ohio, Michigan, and New York has been identified, but the food source
remains unknown, according to health officials. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified the strain as O145, which, like
O157, produces Shiga toxin, according to Jennifer House, spokeswoman for
the Ohio Department of Health.

A CDC team arrived in Ohio yesterday [2 May 2010] to assist in the
investigation, House told CIDRAP News.

About 15 cases have been confirmed in the outbreak so far. House said Ohio
has 6 confirmed, 2 probable, and 5 suspected cases, all in the Columbus
area. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, Washtenaw County Public Health has reported 8
confirmed cases, with 13 more awaiting confirmation. One case has been
reported in New York. College students, including some from Ohio State and
the University of Michigan, have been among the patients in all 3 states,
according to press reports.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the potential vehicle or
vehicles of this enterohemorrhagic strain. The link between the 3 states
appears to be related to college campuses which suggests a common food
deliverer, on or near the campuses. - Mod.LL]
