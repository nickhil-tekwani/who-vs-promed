[The location of the outbreak is available in the interactive map at the source URL.

The publication of the serotype and, particularly, of the genotyping results of the causative agent by the Russian veterinary authorities, in fact simultaneously with the immediate notification of the outbreak, reveal a commendable, exemplary policy.

It will be interesting to obtain information on the vaccination policy applied: Are all 4 named domestic ruminant species covered?

Data on the efficiency of the vaccine(s) used to prevent further spread of the current FMDV-A strain in Russia, and in earlier-infected China (where experience may have already been accumulated), will be appreciated.

It will also be useful to have the meaning of "modified stamping out" in the current case clarified (selective culling of clinically affected animals?).

The FMDV-A epizootic in China, initially notified to the OIE on 1 Mar 2013, is continuing; a follow-up report was submitted to the OIE on 18 Mar 2013, reporting a new outbreak; it is available, with an interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13147. - Mod.AS
