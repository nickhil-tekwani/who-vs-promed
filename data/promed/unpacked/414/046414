Eight employees of the hospital of Coihaique, among them one doctor and
personnel of the infirmary, were positive for hantavirus [? when blood
samples were tested at the CDC in Atlanta. The study that included a group
of 340 persons, among them groups of doctors and administrators, was done
to investigate the possibility of infection by [in? those who are positive
for hantavirus but remain asymptomatic. They also examined the possibility
of transmission among humans in the regional hospital, denoting "the most
exposed", as those who had treated the 11 confirmed hantavirus cases (6
fatal) in Region XI of Aisen. Apart from the above [11 cases, four others
are classified as suspicious.
The positive results for medical personnel have caused anxiety among health
care workers; however, those who were discovered to be seropositive remain
more relaxed. The director of the Hospital of Coihaique, Dr. Felix Torres,
in confirming the results for El Mercurio, indicated that they will
immediately conduct a second stage of the investigation of those positive
[persons to determine how they might have become seropositive. He said
that of the eight, about half had no contact with hantavirus patients in
this health center. The remainder, including the one doctor, nurses, and
others in the infirmary, had direct contact--although light--with
hantavirus patients.
Dr. Torres pointed out that "none of the personnel who worked in the
Intensive Care Unit were seropositive; because of this we are more hopeful
that person to person transmission is not a certainty." He explained that
there will be an epidemiological investigation of these [eight people, to
obtain information about their places of residence, habits, relation to
rural areas, and possible contact with rodents. According to the
preliminary findings, of the eight, who live in Coihaique, more than half
had frequented rural areas. Included were some who were born in or lived
in the country [countryside? i.e. rural areas? years ago.
Dr. Torres indicated that they are also waiting for the results of tests of
samples from the urban and rural populations of Aisen, to determine for the
positives, antibody titres and lifestyle.

[Large molecular differences between closely related viruses can be
expressed as large epidemiological differences; so can small molecular
differences. If it is shown by these inventive studies that Andes virus is
transmitted to humans who do not subsequently become ill, the next logical
study would be to determine whether these asymptomatic people are simply
responding to an antigenic challenge or are actively supporting virus
replication, with all that that implies. -- Mod CHC
