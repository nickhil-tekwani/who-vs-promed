A young man is admitted to the Castro Rendon [Hospital] since last
week [week of 26 Apr 2010]. Physicians are working to take him off of
the respirator. His wife stated that the 23-year-old man had no
contact with any risk area where he might have contracted the virus
[infection].

Suspicions were confirmed. Last week, the young man from Villa La
Angostura was taken to the emergency room of the Castro Rendon
Hospital with [a] hantavirus infection, according to the results of
the tests carried out at a specialized [diagnostic] center in Buenos
Aires. The hospital Director, Alejandra Piedecasas, reported the
confirmation of the hantavirus [infection] case in the La Angostura
Digital site. The wife stated that the notification was certain and
indicated that the man continued in intensive care at the Castro
Rendon Hospital, with respiratory assistance, and under isolation.

The [wife] stated that the man had no contact with any risk area.
[She] ruled out that he had been working in any place where we might
have had contact with the virus. "We are investigating how the young
man might have contracted the virus [infection], because this
specific case is not a usual situation, since he had not been in a
rural area or in closed places such as barns where rodents that
transmit the virus through saliva, excrement, or urine [are found],"
commented Piedecasas. "Also, we are doing follow-up with his family
members and people who were in contact with [the patient] during his
infectious period, although to be in close proximity does not signify
that they were, or might have been, infected."

The wife said that the man began to feel unwell on 21 Apr [2010] when
he had fever and headache. She said that on Saturday 24 [Apr 2010],
it was impossible to reduce the fever and they went to the [health]
station at the Villa Angostura Hospital but they sent him [back to
his] home in the Las Piedritas neighborhood. She said that on Tuesday
27 [Apr] he had difficulty breathing and on Wednesday returned to the
[health] station, where he was seen by a physician who decided to
admit him [to hospital]. On [Fri 30 Apr 2010] his condition worsened
and he was taken to the emergency unit in San Martin de los Andes.
[A] hantavirus [infection] was suspected, and it was decided to take
him to the emergency unit of the Castro Rendon Hospital, where he
remains hospitalized.

[Villa La Angostura is located in an inter-Andean valley not far from
the border with Chile, where several cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome have occurred. Although the specific hantavirus involved in
this case is not stated, it most likely is Andes virus, as has
occurred in Chile. Checking up on close family members, and
especially the wife, is wise since Andes virus is the only hantavirus
to be shown to be transmitted directly from person to person. More
casual contacts with the patient were probably not at risk of being infected.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus,
