As the weather gradually warms, hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is about to hit peak season. This morning [22 Mar 2016], an HFMD vaccine (Enterovirus 71, EV71) researched and developed by China was administered for the 1st time. The significance is that HFMD vaccine has formally begun usage.

This morning [22 Mar 2016] at Gaobeidian [a township in Beijing's Chaoyang District] Community Health Station, a resident brought her 5-year-old daughter for the EV71 vaccine. As she was signing the informed consent form, [she] told reporters that although her daughter had never had HFMD before, her classmates have had it causing class to be cancelled. After the vaccine is given, mothers no longer have to worry.

On 25 Mar 2016, the 1st batch of vaccine for HFMD caused by Enterovirus 71 -- Enterovirus 71 Inactivated Vaccine (or EV71 Inactivated Vaccine) -- was administered in Nanning. The significance is that EV71 Inactivated Vaccine has now formally begun usage in Guangxi. After commercialization, EV71 Inactivated Vaccine will 1st be used as a "Class II Vaccine" and administered on the basis of "Aware, Voluntary, Self-Pay," with each injection priced at 218 yuan [USD 33].

A spokesperson at Guangxi CDC said that Guangxi has purchased 30 000 doses of EV71 inactivated vaccine, which will gradually be allocated to 14 local disease control agencies. If parents wish to obtain the vaccine for their own children, they can go to local disease control agencies for detailed understanding of vaccination sites.

[Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), is a contagious illness that is caused by different viruses that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, older children and adults can also get it. HFMD typically presents with a prodrome of non-specific symptoms that last 1-2 days, followed by a rash that lasts 7 to 10 days. The exanthem is usually a macular, maculopapular, or vesicular rash on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The enanthem is similar in the mouth.

The disease may be complicated by meningitis, encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, or myopericarditis. The diagnosis is made clinically, but PCR can be performed on samples from the throat, stool, urine, and vesicular fluid. Treatment is supportive.

In January 2016, China approved Sinovac's vaccine for HFMD. No vaccine existed before December 2015. But in December 2015, the China FDA approved the 1st vaccine against the virus, Enterovirus 71 (EV71), made by the Institute of Medical Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. But competition was not far behind: the agency approved a 2nd vaccine against the virus in January 2016, this one developed by Sinovac ($SVA).

Having 2 vaccines against HFMD made locally is a boon for China's public health and local manufacturing sectors. While other countries in Asia have reported cases and outbreaks of HFMD, China reported far more cases in 2014 than its neighbors did: 2.7 million cases and 394 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. In contrast, Japan reported 79 000 cases and no deaths, and Singapore reported 21 400 cases and no deaths.

"EV71 vaccine is the 1st innovative vaccine product successfully developed and commercialized by Sinovac," said Weidong Yin, Sinovac CEO and president, in a statement. "We envision opportunities to collaborate with relevant government authorities to further test the safety and immunogenicity of the EV71 vaccine in order to provide scientific evidence of using this vaccine on a broader population."

Sinovac will manufacture the EV71 vaccine at a facility in Beijing, which is expected to produce 20 million doses annually.

The vaccine is a 2-dose regimen for infants aged between 6 months and 3 years. The company expects to receive its Good Manufacturing Practices license in early 2016, after which it will immediately commence production of the EV71 vaccine, Sinovac said in the statement. It expects to have the jab on the market 4-5 months later.

The company plans to go through the private pay sector of the Chinese vaccine market, where it has experience selling hepatitis and flu vaccines. This strategy allows Sinovac to leverage its existing sales networks to quickly boost sales of the EV71 vaccine.

It is not clear which of the 2 vaccines is being implemented in the posts above.
