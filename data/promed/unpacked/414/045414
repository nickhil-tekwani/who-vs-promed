After a record-setting 2015, where Egypt reported 136 H5N1 cases (39 deaths), 2016 saw only 10 cases (and 3 deaths) reported. The reasons behind this welcomed drop are not clear, but it should be noted that several studies have suggested that the majority of avian flu cases are never identified and reported (see EID Journal: H5N1 in Egypt).

Today we have several Arabic media reports of a supposedly fatal case of avian flu (subtype not provided, but probably H5N1) in Fayoum, and at least 1 report from the Fayoum health department stating they had not received an official report.

The 1st report, from Youm7.com [Sat 25 Feb 2017]:

Dr. Jamal Sami governor of Fayoum, said in a special statement for the "7th day," he demanded of Veterinary Medicine and the Department of Health to maintain an urgent report on the incident and the death of infected citizens by bird flu on [Sat 25 Feb 2017], and procedures that have been followed for Immunization and to eliminate the epicenter of the disease.

The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health in Fayoum, Dr. Hisham El Shenawi, announced the death of the 1st cases of bird flu in 2017; a patient named O.A.M. (48 years-old) from the village of "compromise" Senoras Center. He pointed out that he was attended Status General Hospital suffering from symptoms of a cold and high temperature, and was transferred to a hospital in Fayoum where samples were obtained and sent to laboratory in central Cairo. With the results proving bird flu, he was transferred to the Abbasid Fever, where he died.

The 2nd report, from VetoGate.com [Sat 25 Feb 2017]:

Dr. Hisham Shenawi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health in Fayoum, said he had not yet received a report on the death of A.A.B.M. (48 years-old), who died of bird flu, according to the statements of Veterinary Medicine Department in the governorate.

The victim was hit by a rise in temperature and shortness of breath, and went to the Chest Hospital where he remained 3 days. His samples were sent for analysis and confirmed a positive case after which he was transferred to the Abbasid Hospital and pronounced dead there.

His body was flown to his home village on [Fri 24 Feb 2017] night, where the Veterinary Medicine Department of the Committee was sent to deal with the sterilization of the area around the poultry farm.

While this sounds like a probable case, hopefully they will get this sorted out and reported to the WHO shortly.

[This is the 1st report on a suspected fatal case from Egypt in 2017, both reports refer to the same case. However, the information available from these media reports appears contradictory [i.e., the 1st report refers to the 48-year-old patient as O.A.M. and the 2nd report refers to the patient as A.A.B.M. - Mod.ML]. Any further updates to clarify the actual situation would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA
