Deer from hunting season tests positive for bovine tuberculosis
---------------------------------------------------------------
A deer harvested during hunting season in Minnesota has tested
positive for bovine tuberculosis [TB], the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources [DNR] announced Monday [21 Dec 2009].

The deer was one of more than 1400 samples collected from hunters
during the fall. The DNR is still waiting for complete results but
was able to confirm the case after samples from the suspect deer were
sent for expedited testing, said Dr Michelle Carstensen, DNR wildlife
health program coordinator.

Carstensen said the deer that tested positive was a 3.5-year-old
buck. It was killed within 3 miles [5 km] of where previous bovine TB
cases in deer have been found in northwestern Minnesota.

"This finding reinforces the need to remain focused on continuing
efforts to accomplish the goal of completely eliminating the disease
in Minnesota," Carstensen said in a statement.

There have now been 27 positive bovine TB cases in Minnesota deer
since the disease was first found in the state in 2005. Despite the
new case, DNR officials said it doesn't appear bovine TB is spreading
much within the deer population.

The state Board of Animal Health has established an area in
northwestern Minnesota that calls for more surveillance of cattle and
deer for bovine TB. The last cows that tested positive for bovine TB
were found in Beltrami County last December [2008].

The DNR said surveillance efforts and sharp shooting for deer in a
targeted area of northwestern Minnesota will continue in 2010. There
will also be a special late-season deer hunt in part of northwestern
Minnesota from 26 Dec 2009 through 10 Jan 2010.

[This article does not tell us in which county this deer was located
[although in an earlier ProMED-mail posting, a white tail deer was
found to be positive for bovine tuberculosis in northwest Beltrami
county (see Bovine tuberculosis - USA (07): (MN) cervid
20090625.2307)]. Minnesota has a split state status with regard to
tuberculosis. The majority of the state is 'modified accredited
advanced' and a small portion is 'modified accredited'. This
designation can be seen on the map at
<http://www.bah.state.mn.us/tb/maps/split_state.pdf>

The US Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) classifies
states or zones within states according to their prevalence levels of
bovine tuberculosis. There are 5 classifications: accredited free,
modified accredited advanced, modified accredited, accredited
preparatory, and non accredited. Restrictions on the interstate
movement of cattle and bison become less stringent as a state
approaches or achieves accredited free status.

Status level of a region/state also determine the frequency of
testing a producer must conduct to move animals, and that the state
much show a certain level of testing as part of its surveillance plan
to know its prevalence level.

So the location of this deer may be very important to the status of a county.
