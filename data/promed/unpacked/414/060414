An outbreak of anthrax has killed 5 people among the population in
the region of Bouna (Northeast), said a statement from the Ivorian
Ministry of Animal Production and Fish Resources on Wednesday [14 Jul 2010].

According to the statement, "anthrax" was triggered in the herds of
livestock. "The human victims have been in contact with sick
animals," said Minister of Animal Production Alphonse Douaty, stating
that it is a cattle disease transmitted to humans.

He has announced that he will be making a tour in the region "in the
coming days" to bring the condolences of the government to families
of the victims.

"Currently located in the region are 100 000 head of cattle which are
at risk. We will take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of
the disease," promised Mr. Douaty.

The minister also appealed to people so that they avoid contact with
domestic animals infected with anthrax.
