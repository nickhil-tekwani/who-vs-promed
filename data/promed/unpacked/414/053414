Soldiers return with a condition that limits breathing and doesn't
show on most tests
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Robert Miller worries that too many Iraq war veterans are not
being diagnosed for a disease that can't be seen on X-ray, CT scan,
or pulmonary function tests.

The condition is constrictive bronchiolitis, a disease that shows up
only when soldiers exert themselves physically, said Miller, an
associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

"The problem is the typical soldier is someone who comes in and says,
'I'm short of breath and I can't complete my 2-mile run,'" Miller said.

Normally, that wouldn't be enough evidence for Miller to order a lung
biopsy. But because the simple tests -- X-ray, CT scans, and
pulmonary testing -- were completely normal, and most of the soldiers
referred to Miller from Blanchfield Army Community Hospital had been
exposed to smoke from the burning Mishraq Sulfur Mine in northern
Iraq in 2003, Miller ordered the invasive tests.

What Miller found was nearly all of the soldiers had the condition,
which is irreversible and untreatable.

Miller has evaluated 80 patients so far. He's performed 45 biopsies
on these soldiers, 44 of whom showed some form of inhalation injury.
34 have been diagnosed with constrictive bronchiolitis, the others
with sarcoidosis, respiratory bronchiolitis, respiratory
bronchiolisitis with interstitial lung disease, and hypersensitivity
pneumonitis.

[One sergeant] realized he had a problem in late 2007 in the middle
of the night. "I woke up and I couldn't breathe," he said. As a
member of the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, he was on the verge of
heading to Afghanistan for a year. "I deployed and forgot about it,"
he said. When he got back in January 2009, he went through Miller's
battery of simple tests, all resulting in normal findings.

Now, after having a lung biopsy and being diagnosed with the disease,
[he] is seeing the effects. "I can run maybe 50 yards before I start
running out of breath," he said. He has no idea when he contracted
the disease, but he suspects it was from the sulfur fires he was
close to in northern Iraq on his 1st deployment in 2003.

[The sergeant] says he's adjusting to his new condition, but with 2
young boys -- 6, and 2 -- who are getting into soccer, he wonders
what his life will look like a few years from now. "I don't know if
it's going to get worse, but I do know it's not going to get any
better," he said. [He] is still in the Army, much like many of his
friends who complain of similar symptoms, but they press on. He is
planning to leave the service this summer [2010]. "It's more of a
personal choice," he said. "I've thought about (staying in); I just
don't know if I could survive another year."

[Another patient was] a 101st Airborne Division aviation maintenance
officer in 2005 and 2006, and when deployed to Iraq he lived 1/8 mile
[200 m] from a 24-acre [approx 10 ha] burn pit, also a common finding
in Miller's patients. "They put everything in there," he said,
including trash, feces, wreckage, and more. "It burned 24/7 the
entire year I was there. Your clothes would have soot on them. We
were up in the middle of the night choking." [He] disregarded what
was happening. "You didn't think about it -- you were doing your job," he said.

He retired in September 2007 and has since been back to Iraq, where
sandstorms rage and burn pits still blaze. He began to experience
symptoms not long after but didn't think much of it. "Maybe I'm just
out of shape," he remembers telling himself. He also didn't go to the
doctor until his wife forced him to after having episodes while
working in the yard that forced him to lay down for 15 minutes just
to catch his breath. "That was a pride thing -- you just didn't want
to go to the doctor," he said. Now, [he] is the oldest of Miller's
patients and one of the newest, diagnosed just more than a month ago
with the condition and so far the only patient with it seen in the
upper and lower portions of his lungs. With 15 grandchildren at age
53, [he] should be in the prime of retirement, but he is nearly
crippled. "I just can't do that much anymore," he said. "I walk up
and down stairs, and I've gotta stop."

An effort is under way to make more people aware of this lung
condition afflicting men and women in uniform.

Miller testified before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs in
October 2009, issuing a call to federal lawmakers to address the
growing problem, whose reach is unknown.

"More research is needed to understand the cause and prevention of
this disease," he told the committee. "There is little doubt about
the cause of bronchiolitis in those who were exposed to the Mishraq
Sulfur Mine fire. There is also little doubt that those not exposed
to the sulfur fires suffer from a disease caused by toxic inhalation."

Attention around the burn pits has grown, so much so President Barack
Obama signed an executive order banning toxic burn pits in October
[2009], vowing they would not become another Agent Orange. Williams
also fears if nothing is done soon, the situation will escalate to
the level of Agent Orange, which the military denied for decades.
"Let's do the right thing now," Williams said.

Miller alluded to a problem with the VA in his testimony. He
testified that the Army has given the condition one disability rating
only to see it downgraded by VA.

[The retired 53-year-old] said the VA wouldn't help him at all, and
he was told he was the 1st person to claim the condition for
disability benefits. "I'm really disheartened with VA," said the
patient, who was told there wasn't enough information or details on
the condition for it to be considered a disability. [He] gives Miller
a lot of credit for leading the charge to bring attention to the
disease. "He's our crusader," he said.

And he also doesn't mind leading the charge for younger soldiers who
might not know they have the disease or are getting it now. "I don't
mind being the sacrificial lamb if it helps other soldiers," he said.

[By way of comparison, constrictive bronchiolitis (CB) (or
obliterative bronchiolitis) designates inflammation and fibrosis
occurring predominantly in the walls and contiguous tissues of
membranous and respiratory bronchioles, with resultant narrowing of
their lumens. It differs from bronchiolitis obliterans organizing
pneumonia in its histopathology and clinical course. It also differs
from bronchiolisitis because there is little to no interstitial lung
involvement.

Constrictive bronchiolitis results in chronic airflow obstruction,
the clinical severity of which depending on the proportion of
bronchioles involved, and their degree of narrowing. The clinical
criteria used for the diagnosis of constrictive bronchiolitis are
irreversible airflow obstruction with an FEV1 [forced expiratory
volume in one second] of less than 60 percent of predicted volume in
the absence of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, or other cause
of airway obstruction.

The chest radiograph in patients with constrictive bronchiolitis may
be normal or may demonstrate variable degrees of overinflation,
peripheral attenuation of the vascular markings, and a nodular or
reticulonodular pattern. On HRCT [high resolution] scans, the major
findings are mosaic perfusion and air trapping. Lobular, segmental,
or larger areas of reduced lung attenuation in conjunction with
reduced vessel size are seen adjacent to areas of normally ventilated
lung that demonstrate increased perfusion. Detection of air trapping
is facilitated by the use of expiratory CT. Although the
abnormalities are usually patchy in distribution, occasionally, these
findings may be seen predominantly affecting one lung,

While this article only mentions sulfur, it is likely sulfur dioxide.

Inhalation is the major route of exposure to sulfur dioxide. The odor
threshold is 5 times lower than the OSHA PEL [permissible exposure
limit] (5 ppm). Most exposures are due to air pollution, and this has
both short-term and chronic health consequences for people. Inhaled
sulfur dioxide readily reacts with the moisture of mucous membranes
to form sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which is a severe irritant. People
with asthma can experience increased airway resistance with sulfur
dioxide concentrations of less than 0.1 ppm when exercising. Healthy
adults experience increased airway resistance at 5 ppm, sneezing and
coughing at 10 ppm, and bronchospasm at 20 ppm. Respiratory
protection is required for exposures at or above 20 ppm. Exposures of
50 to 100 ppm may be tolerated for more than 30 to 60 minutes, but
higher or longer exposures can cause death from airway obstruction.
Sulfur dioxide is heavier than air; thus, exposure in poorly
ventilated, enclosed, or low-lying areas can result in asphyxiation.
Also continued exposure of high levels can result in lung problems.

Sulfur dioxide respiratory irritation induces symptoms such as
sneezing, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest
tightness, and a feeling of suffocation. Reflex laryngeal spasm and
edema can cause acute airway obstruction. Bronchospasm, pneumonitis,
and pulmonary edema can occur.

Some individuals are very susceptible to the presence of sulfur
dioxide and overreact to concentrations which, in most people, elicit
a much milder response. This hyperreactive response occurs the 1st
time the individual is exposed and is therefore not an acquired
immune or "hypersensitivity" response.

Acclimatization (a physiological adjustment of the individual to
environmental changes) may also occur in up to 80 percent of exposed
individuals. This is not necessarily beneficial although exposure may
become less subjectively objectionable upon continuous or repeated exposure.

Asthmatics who are sensitive to sulfites in food can develop
bronchospasm or an anaphylactoid reaction. Sulfur dioxide, along with
other components of air pollution, can exacerbate chronic
cardiopulmonary disease.

Exposure to high concentrations of sulfur dioxide can lead to
reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS), a chemically- or
irritant-induced type of asthma.

Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive agents than adults
because of the relatively smaller diameter of their airways. Children
also may be more vulnerable because of relatively increased minute
ventilation per kg and failure to evacuate an area promptly when exposed.
