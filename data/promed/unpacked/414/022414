New Zealand authorities are on alert for an "untreatable gonorrhoea super-bug."

The New Zealand Sexual Health Society has released guidelines for the detection and management of the sexually transmitted infection [1]. In a statement, the society said there was growing concern around the world about the "emergence of an untreatable gonorrhoea super-bug." There were reports that the ability of antibiotics to battle the infection was decreasing. Many antibiotics that once were used to treat gonorrhoea no longer work, and there are no further treatment options on the horizon.

There were no cases yet of treatment that failed in New Zealand, but there had been cases in Auckland of gonorrhoea that was more resilient against the one-remaining antibiotic that could still battle it.

[The news report above refers to a guideline for the management of gonorrhea developed by the New Zealand Sexual Health Society and published online in September 2014 (available at: http://www.nzshs.org/guidelines/NZ-gonorrhoea-guideline-version-2014-09-10.pdf).

Treatment for gonorrhea has been complicated by emerging antimicrobial resistance. _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, the cause of gonorrhea, has developed resistance successively to sulfonamides, penicillin, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) and the extended-spectrum oral cephalosporin cefixime after each was introduced for treatment of gonorrhea.

Ceftriaxone, an injectable 3rd generation cephalosporin, is the most effective cephalosporin for treatment of gonorrhea, but the percentage of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates with elevated minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to cephalosporins has been rising in the US (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6026a2.htm) and elsewhere, including New Zealand (http://www.nzshs.org/guidelines/NZ-gonorrhoea-guideline-version-2014-09-10.pdf). Because of the experience with other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance, combination therapy using 2 antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action has been recommended by the U.S. CDC to improve treatment efficacy and potentially delay emergence and spread of resistance to ceftriaxone.

Gonococcal strains in the U.S. with elevated MICs to cefixime are also likely to be resistant to tetracyclines but susceptible to azithromycin. Consequently, in the latest iteration of the CDC's "Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2014," only one regimen, dual treatment with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and azithromycin 1 g orally, is recommended for treatment of gonorrhea in the U.S. (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2014/2014-std-guidelines-peer-reviewers-08-20-2014.pdf).

The CDC considers that the 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone is sufficient to treat gonococcal infection at all anatomic sites caused by strains currently circulating in the U.S. (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm) and says that "there are no clinical data to support use of doses of ceftriaxone over 250 mg" (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2014/2014-std-guidelines-peer-reviewers-08-20-2014.pdf). The updated European gonorrhea guideline, however, recommends a 500 mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus azithromycin 2 g oral dose for uncomplicated gonorrhea (http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956462412472837), and the New Zealand guideline also recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg IM, but combined with azithromycin 1 g orally.

Spectinomycin, which is useful in persons who cannot tolerate cephalosporins, is expensive, must be injected, and is not available in the U.S. and New Zealand (http://www.nzshs.org/guidelines/NZ-gonorrhoea-guideline-versiona-2014-09-10.pdf). However, it has been effective in published clinical trials, curing 98.2 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections. Spectinomycin has poor efficacy against pharyngeal infection (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/STD-Treatment-2010-RR5912.pdf). - Mod.ML
