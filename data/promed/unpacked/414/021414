Torrential rain and floods linked with the El Nino weather phenomenon have
in 2 months killed more than 2,500 people and displaced 1.5 million others
in the Horn of Africa. Floods have also destroyed hectares of pasture and
farmland, washed away roads, and drowned large numbers of livestock in
Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti.
In response, the United Nations World Food Programme has established a
global task force based in Rome, to disseminate accurate information, to
evaluate the impact of El Niño in poor countries, and coordinate resource
mobilisation from donor countries.
According to Joseph Ng'ang'a, Chairman of the Department of Meteorology at
the University of Nairobi, Kenya, this freak El Niño is likely to hit
agricultural production in the affected countries. Last week, Ethiopian
officials said El Niño may reduce 1997-98 coffee-crop production by 20%.
For now, aid agencies are busy distributing food and medical supplies in
order to avert further human disaster.
Since Dec 10, WFP has been airlifting food to more than 300,000 people in
north-eastern Kenya. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is providing
protein-enriched food, medical supplies, and shelter in the form of plastic
sheeting to those affected by floods in Wajir district.
Malini Morzaria, an MSF official in Wajir town, estimates that about 30,
000 people have been moved to higher ground because the town is nearly
submerged and wells are contaminated by faecal pollution. Also affected
are three camps in the district, holding 120 000 Somali refugees. MSF has
now re-located the camps. But malaria, diarrhoea, and other diseases are
increasing in the camps and surrounding villages, says Maria Rossi of MSF
in Dadaab camp.
Similar rescue missions are occurring in Ethiopia where more than 500
people have died and 250 000 been displaced. According to WFP, several
trucks in Djibouti have been marooned and tonnes of rice, maize, beans,
sugar, and oil lost. In Uganda, 100 people died and 60,000 were displaced
by floods and mud-slides as the river Nile burst its banks. Heavy rains
have also hit southern Sudan disrupting relief in the war-torn region.
Aid workers say that even if the rains subside, the aftermath of the floods
will be too much to cope with given the limited supplies.
[Strange that The Lancet did not mention the cholera outbreak in the region.
