Efforts are under way to fight back against an aggressive invader spotted in Southern California -- a mosquito species that has never been seen before [in this locality? There are numerous reports of _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ detected in several places in Southern California over several years.- Mod.TY] Known as _Aedes aegypti_, the black insects with white stripes are not typical mosquitoes. They are an invasive species with the potential to transmit yellow fever, dengue, the West Nile virus, and the Zika virus.

"It is a day biting mosquito," said Brian Reisinger of the West Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District. "It will aggressively follow somebody to try to get a blood meal." The agency has been increasing surveillance of the mosquito after one of the insects was discovered in a trap earlier this week [week of Aug 2017].

Unlike other mosquitoes, _Ae, aegypti_ lay their eggs by gluing them to the sides of small containers which then wait for contact with water. "It's all these tiny sources -- not the big dirty swimming pool, not the dairy lagoon we are worried about," Reisinger said. "It's all these tiny sources that collectively put a neighborhood at risk."

ISCA Technologies, a Riverside based company, is helping to modernize how vector control districts deal with the problem. Biologists are working on several low-impact and targeted pest control solutions. "We're getting the mosquitoes to do what we want -- either attracting them to a toxic point source or attracting pregnant [gravid] mosquitoes to lay (eggs) in a treated water source," said Jesse Saroli, an ISCA biology manager. The process uses odors such has pheromones or nectar-based compounds to lure the mosquitos away from their human blood meals. ISCA says the company's product is being field tested and officials hope to have it on the market within 18 months.

Mosquitoes capable of transmitting serious viruses have been detected in La Quinta east of Palm Springs, prompting enhanced surveillance of the infestation within the city, local vector control officials have announced.

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which can transmit viruses like chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, and Zika, was recently detected in an area of the city bordered by Vista Dunes Lane, West Harland Drive, Via Rosa, and Sun Brook Lane. About 120 homes are within that area, according to the Coachella Valley [Riverside county] Mosquito and Vector Control District.

Starting [Mon 28 Aug 2017], district teams will be searching for standing water sources and other breeding sites in residents' yards. Door-to-door inspections will begin on [Tue 29 Aug 2017]. "_Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes love your home just as much as you do," said Jill Oviatt, district public information manager. "This mosquito species prefers backyard water sources over other environments and is commonly found laying eggs in saucers of potted plants, soda cans, discarded bottle caps, bird baths, and other manmade sources."

The mosquitoes were first detected in the Coachella Valley last May [2017], officials said. Following its initial appearance in Coachella, the mosquito has been seen in Indio, Cathedral City, and Palm Springs. However, district officials say "aggressive surveillance and control activities" have been successful in reducing its prevalence in Coachella, Indio, and Cathedral City, while spraying applications are ongoing in Palm Springs.

Residents are encouraged to drain standing water and install screens on windows and doors in order to keep mosquitoes out.

[This is the 1st report of _Aedes aegypti_ in San Bernardino county this year (2017). _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes were found in Riverside county last year (2016) and in several locations in the county in 2015; this is the 2nd report that ProMED-mail has posted of detection of _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes in the county this year (2017).

As noted earlier, finding _Ae. aegypti_ in these counties is not surprising. Both _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ have been found in various locations in California over the past 13 years (see archives listed below). Both of them have been detected in southern California in several new locations over the past 1-4 years. Fortunately, few individuals have been trapped in these locations, indicating very small populations that are probably too limited to initiate and sustain ongoing Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus transmission.

Air conditioning and screened windows and doors will help limit their abundance. However, the introduction of these viruses into southern California will continue, so aggressive vector surveillance and control will be important to limit populations of these vectors.
