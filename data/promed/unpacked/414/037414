Experts of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
have announced that their study of porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS), or green-ear disease [see comment], in
pigs in the central province of Quang Nam, Viet Nam, shows that the
green-ear virus there now is stronger than the one from the previous
epizootic in the northern province of Hai Duong in March [reportedly
starting in the northern province of Hai Duong on 12 Mar 2007,
spreading to other northern provinces, such as Hung Yen, Bac Ninh,
Son La, Thai Binh, Hanoi, and Bac Giang. See ProMED-mail
20070512.1516. - Mod.AS]
Speaking to VietNamNet, Jeffrey Gilbert, senior technical advisor of
FAO, said that when they carried out the study in Quang Nam province
FAO's experts discovered a difference between this type of virus and
those of Europe and the Americas.
"It seems that this type of virus is much stronger than those of
Europe and the Americas. It is nearly like the green-ear virus in
China. However, we need to do further research to know whether this
type is similar to ones in China or in other countries," said Mr.
Gilbert.
Hoang Van Nam, Vice Head of the Veterinary Agency, said that the
agency was about to send a sample of the virus that is causing
green-ear disease in pigs in Quang Nam to an international laboratory
for testing.
So far, green-ear epidemic has been reported in more than 40
communes, wards, and towns of 6 districts in Quang Nam province, with
a total of 18 000 ill pigs. More than 800 pigs have died or been
culled.
Last weekend [14-15 Jul 2007], the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
Development went to Quang Nam to instruct local agencies on how to
control the disease. The Head of the Veterinary Agency, Bui Quang
Anh, is now in the central region to directly guide [personnel] to
combat foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), green-ear, and cholera in pigs.
[This implies that the porcine population in Quang Nam is currently
affected by 3 diseases: FMD, PRRS, and hog cholera, which is
synonymous with classical swine fever (CSF). - Mod.AS]

[The enigma of the porcine disease in Viet Nam -- probably the same
epizootic plaguing China since mid-2006, initially called a
multifactorial "pig high fever disease", later "highly pathogenic
PRRS", and in North Viet Nam, bordering China, since March 2007 PRRS
(blue ear disease) -- continues to surprise, now coloured "green" (a
subjective colour interpretation by observers?). Now, it has spread
southwards to Quang Nam; its final decoding is pending.
The following clinical description of the Chinese "highly pathogenic
PRRS", derived from the recent paper by Tian et al, as cited in
ProMED-mail 20070622.2017, may be useful in comparing the Chinese and
Vietnamese disease entities:
"Initially, the "high fever" was suspected to be hog cholera or
African swine fever (ASF). The representative sick pigs had the
following common clinical symptoms: rubefaction, blood spots,
petechiae, erythematous blanching rashes, and pimples, frequently
observed in ears (see figure 2D, which can be enlarged in the on-line
paper!), mouth, nose, back, and the inner thigh. Other common
symptoms included high fever (40-42 deg C / 104-107.6 deg F),
depression, anorexia, cough, asthma, lameness, shivering, disorder in
the respiratory tract, and diarrhea. Infected pigs could be divided
into two groups: group one, which appeared fat and healthy; and group
two with thin and debilitated features, ultimately leading to death.
To our surprise, many grown pigs also died during this epidemic
period, which is unlike the case for typical PRRSV infection.
The free, on-line, richly illustrated paper is available at
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1885284>.
Viet Nam's decision to submit samples for further viral investigations
is timely and commendable.
The OIE's (World Organisation for Animal Health) reference laboratory
for PRRS is:

It will be sensible to rule out (even a slight) possibility that
other pathogens are involved, by forwarding samples also to a
reference laboratory for other highly pathogenic porcine diseases
such as CSF and ASF. The reference laboratory, which recently
diagnosed ASF in samples from Armenia, is:
Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright Laboratory, Pirbright, Woking,

Results of the laboratory investigations are expected with interest. - Mod.AS
