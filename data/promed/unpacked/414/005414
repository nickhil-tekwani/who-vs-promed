Wildlife officials have confirmed that an outbreak of a common virus
is killing white-tailed deer throughout Virginia. Hemorrhagic disease
[HD], which is spread by tiny biting midges, has been linked to
deaths of whitetails in 8 localities, including Alleghany and Bedford counties.
"This is the most common deer disease in the Southeast," said Bob
Duncan, chief of the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries' (DGIF)
Wildlife Division. "Not too many years go by when we don't have an outbreak."
The most recent major outbreak in Virginia was in 2002.
The disease, reported in several Southeast and Mid-Atlantic States
this year [2007], poses no known health threats to humans or pets,
said Dr. Jonathan Sleeman, the state agency's staff veterinarian.
There are no cures. "There's not much we can do to prevent it or
control it," Sleeman said. "It's just a matter of tracking it."
The disease tends to peak in late summer and early fall, then fades
rapidly after the 1st subfreezing temperatures arrive and kill the
biting midges that spread the virus.
This year's [2007] outbreak has the potential to be serious, said Bob
Ellis, assistant director of the game department's wildlife division.
"It's going gangbusters this year," Ellis said. "And it's happening
earlier than normal."
Deer afflicted with HD suffer high fevers and may exhibit swollen
heads and necks, and sores around their mouths. They may also limp.
Animals that survive HD may exhibit [hooves with sloughing or peeling
tissue.] They also develop a resistance to the specific HD-causing
virus, several of which exist.
The most recent major HD outbreak in Virginia was also the most
serious. In 2002 the disease was confirmed in 35 counties. In
previous outbreaks the disease had been confined to central and
eastern Virginia, but in 2002 it made its 1st appearance in counties
west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
The disease is showing up in Western Virginia this year [2007], with
sick and dead deer reported in Scott and Alleghany counties. "It's
going to be new for some people seeing this in the west," Duncan said.
Other counties affected so far are Bedford, Cumberland, Essex,
Hanover, Nelson, and Shenandoah. HD has affected deer in 8 counties,
but the number will likely grow because it's still early in the peak
HD season. The 1st reported case was in Cumberland County on July 26.
That deer was confirmed to have been afflicted with the serotype 2
strain of the virus, the most common type of the epizootic
hemorrhagic disease virus found in Virginia.
The deer herd at the MeadWestvaco Covington paper mill has been hit
hard. Mill spokeswoman Becky Johnson said roughly 20 deer had been
confirmed dead inside the mill's fenced area, which covers between
150 and 200 acres (61-81 hectares). Equipment operator Kenny Wolfe of
Covington said he started seeing dead deer on the property a couple
of weeks ago. "That it was so concentrated in the plant is what
really concerned me," Wolfe said. "There were 2 stuck on the dam this
morning. My brother floated the Jackson River this weekend and saw 2
bucks dead in the water."
While mortality can be high in concentrated areas, Duncan said
gauging an outbreak's impact on the statewide deer herd can be
difficult. "But the overall impact on the population tends to be
minimal," he said. "Still, nobody likes to see these losses,
especially right before hunting season."
Mortality from the 2002 outbreak was thought to have been high enough
in some Eastern Virginia counties to lead to lower-than-normal hunter
success during that fall's hunting season.
Outbreaks of HD tend to be worse in years of dry weather. Ellis said
such weather can concentrate deer near water sources and swarms of
the biting midges, which thrive in exposed, muddy areas. Dead and
sick deer also seem to be concentrated near water because the animals
seek relief from their high fevers in cooler areas.
Hemorrhagic disease is a common infectious viral disease of
white-tailed deer transmitted by tiny biting flies. It has no known
health effects on humans or pets. Infected deer may have a high
fever, swollen head, neck, or tongue, or have trouble breathing. Many
can be found near water, which they seek for relief from the fever.
[Mortality] depends on the potency of the virus, as well as the
duration of the illness. Some deer will die within a few days. Many
will recover. Deer that survive may exhibit sloughing (peeling) hooves.
If you see sick or dying deer call your nearest DGIF office (visit
<http://www.dgif.virginia.gov> for contact information) and report
the location of the sighting, along with the number of and
description of the sick or dead deer.

[The most significant information is the serotype of the virus has
been reported as serotype 2 strain. Although this is the most common
strain of EHD (Epizootic hemorrhagic disease) or HD as this article
refers to the disease, it is good to know exactly which strain is
circulating. - Mod.TG]
