Two howler monkeys have been found dead within the past 3 weeks in
Miguelopolis, in the Rio Grande valley in the Franca region of Sao Paulo
state, Brazil, on the border with Minas Gerais state. Since then 1.7
million people have been vaccinated against yellow fever in an intensified
campaign which will continue up to the end of March 2003. Organs from the
animals are being tested at the Adolfo Lutz Institute in Sao Paulo. The
city of Ribeirao Preto is also on the alert, since it is in an area of
transition for the disease.

[More than 40 human cases of YF were reported from the neighboring state of
Minas Gerais earlier in 2003. Howler monkeys are particularly susceptible
to the disease and act as reliable sentinels of its circulation in forest
mosquitoes and mammals. " Area of transition" means an area into which YF
periodically spreads from its endemic zone in the forests of central
Brazil. - Mod.JW]
