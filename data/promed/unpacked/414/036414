[This is the 2nd territory of Russia into which lumpy skin disease (LSD) has penetrated for the 1st time, in both cases this year (2015). Earlier this summer, the disease was reported from Dagestan. Another country in the Caucasus region into which LSD entered in 2015 is Azerbaijan. We wonder if Georgia has remained untouched.

An interactive OIE map showing all reported LSD outbreaks, globally, since 1 Sep 2014, is available at http://tinyurl.com/p9846ba (Click on the Caucasus cluster, including Azerbaijan, Dagestan, and Chechnya and zoom in).

Although Russia reports the application of a "modified stamping" policy (which, as far as LSD is concerned, generally means the culling of clinically affected bovines only), no such culling has reportedly been applied in the current case.

It will be interesting to note if Russia has considered the issue of LSD vaccination.

On 21 Sep 2015, Russia submitted its follow-up report no 2 on LSD, reporting a 3rd outbreak in Dagestan. The report, including an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=18706.
The outbreak is located in the village of Krasnoe, where 10 animals have been found clinically affected, out of a population of 1100 susceptible cattle. No culling or slaughter of the affected animals is reported. - Mod.AS
