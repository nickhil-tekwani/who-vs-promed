Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has taken a toll on wildlife animals in
Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve. The disease has already killed over a
dozen animals including 6 swamp deer, 3 chitals and 3 boars.

Chief conservation officer Jagannath Singh said a team led by himself
is collecting details about the epidemic.

Singh preferred not to give the actual number of wildlife animals
killed due to the disease. A team of doctors from the Department of
National Parks and Wildlife Conservation had inspected the affected
areas and officially diagnosed the disease.

Officials said the death toll was on the rise for lack of timely
treatment of infected animals. "There is no treatment other than
supplying clean water to contain the disease," Singh said. "As the
ponds are drying out, we are trying to fill them."

According to the latest census, the reserve is home to over 1700
swamp deer alone.
