The minister of health affairs for the Darfur Regional Authority, Firdos Abdel Rahman Yousif denied reports of the deadly Ebola virus disease in El Geneina, capital of West Darfur State.

The Sudan News Agency quoted the minister as saying the suspected case had come from Abeche in Chad. The patient suffered from hemorrhagic fever, began taking treatment from the health center, and was then transferred to a hospital in El Geneina, she claimed.

[It is important to exclude yellow fever in this case, as the recent epidemic of yellow fever in Darfur was brought from Chad by nomadic herdsmen. See ProMED-mail. Yellow fever - Africa (09): Chad, archive no 20130214.1543009. - Mod.JW
