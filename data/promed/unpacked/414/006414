Update: Influenza Activity - United States and Worldwide, 20 May to 15 Sep 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------
During the period 20 May to 15 Sep 2007,
influenza A (H1), influenza A (H3), and influenza
B viruses co-circulated worldwide and were
identified sporadically in the United States.
This report summarizes influenza activity in the
United States and worldwide since the last MMWR
update (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5631a2.htm>1).
United States
-------------
In the United States, the Centers for Disease
Control and Protection (CDC) uses 9 systems for
national influenza surveillance (2), 6 of which
operate year-round: 1) World Health Organization
(WHO) collaborating laboratories; 2) the National
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System
(NREVSS); 3) the U.S. Influenza Sentinel Provider
Surveillance System; 4) the 122 Cities Mortality
Reporting System; 5) the Influenza-Associated
Pediatric Mortality System, part of the National
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS);
and 6) novel influenza A virus case reporting
through NNDSS. Data from these 6 systems are included in this report.
During the period 20 May to15 Sep 2007, WHO and
NREVSS collaborating laboratories in the United
States tested 21 029 respiratory specimens for
influenza viruses; 398 (1.9 percent) were
positive. Of these, 330 (83 percent) were
influenza A viruses, and 68 (17 percent) were
influenza B viruses. Of the influenza A viruses,
152 (46 percent) were subtyped: 67 (44 percent)
were influenza A (H1) viruses, and 85 (56
percent) were influenza A (H3) viruses. Influenza
viruses were reported from 22 states in eight of
the nine public health surveillance regions.
However, 200 (50 percent) of all the influenza
viruses, including 63 (94 percent) of the 67
influenza A (H1) viruses, were reported from
Hawaii, and 100 (25 percent) were reported from
Florida. Of the 398 influenza viruses reported
during the summer months, only 124 (31 percent)
were reported during August and the first half of
September. Among this subset of viruses, 105 (85
percent) were influenza A, and 19 (15 percent) are influenza B.
During the period 20 May to 15 Sep 2007, data
from the U.S. Influenza Sentinel Provider
Surveillance System indicated that the weekly
percentage of patient visits to U.S. sentinel
providers for influenza-like illness (ILI)
remained below the national baseline of 2.1
percent and ranged from 0.6 percent to 1.0
percent. The percentage of deaths attributed to
pneumonia and influenza (P&I) as reported by the
122 Cities Mortality Reporting System was below
the epidemic threshold. One influenza-associated
pediatric death occurred during June and was
reported to the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Reporting System.
There were 2 human cases of novel influenza A
reported to NNDSS. Both persons were infected
with swine influenza virus and were infected by
handling ill pigs at a county fair in Ohio. Both recovered from their illness.
Worldwide
---------
During the period 20 May to 15 Sep 2007,
influenza A (H1), influenza A (H3), and influenza
B viruses cocirculated worldwide. Influenza A
(H3) viruses predominated in Asia; however,
influenza A (H1) and B viruses also were
reported. In Africa, influenza A viruses
predominated, with approximately equal numbers of
influenza A (H1) and A (H3) viruses reported and
a smaller number of influenza B viruses
identified. In Europe and North America, small
numbers of influenza A and influenza B viruses
were reported. In Oceania, influenza A viruses
predominated. Influenza A (H3) viruses were
reported more frequently than influenza A (H1)
viruses in Australia and New Caledonia; however,
in New Zealand, influenza A (H1) viruses
predominated. In South America, influenza A (H3)
viruses were most commonly reported, although
influenza B viruses also were identified.
Antigenic Characterization of Influenza Virus Isolates
------------------------------------------------------
The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, located
at CDC, analyzes influenza virus isolates
received from laboratories worldwide. Of 4
influenza A (H1) viruses that were collected
during the period 20 May to 15 Sep 2007 (3 from
Asia and one from Europe) and analyzed at CDC,
all 4 (100 percent) were antigenically similar to
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006, the H1N1 component of
the 2007-08 influenza vaccine. Of the 94
influenza A (H3) viruses that were characterized
(4 from Europe, 78 from Latin America, 4 from
Asia, 2 from Africa, and 6 from the United
States), 17 (18 percent) were antigenically
similar to A/Wisconsin/67/2005, the H3N2
component of the 2007-08 influenza vaccine,
whereas 77 (82 percent) had reduced titers to A/Wisconsin/67/2005.
Circulating influenza B viruses can be divided
into 2 antigenically distinct lineages that have
cocirculated worldwide since March 2001,
represented by B/Yamagata/16/88 and
B/Victoria/02/87 viruses. The B component of the
2007-08 influenza vaccine belongs to the
B/Victoria lineage. Of the eight influenza B
isolates collected during 20 May-8 Sep 2007 and
characterized at CDC, one belonged to the
B/Victoria lineage (from Asia). This
B/Victoria-lineage virus was similar to
B/Ohio/01/2005; B/Ohio/01/2005 is antigenically
equivalent to B/Malaysia/2506/2004, the
recommended influenza B component for the 2007-08
influenza vaccine. The remaining 7 influenza B
viruses (3 from South America, 3 from Asia, and
one from the United States) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage.
Human Infections with Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Viruses
------------------------------------------------------
During the period 20 May to 15 Sep 2007, a total
of 21 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1)
infection was reported to WHO from four countries
(China, Egypt, Indonesia, and Vietnam). Fourteen
(67 percent) of the cases were fatal. Since 1 Dec
2003, a total of 328 human avian influenza A
(H5N1) infection have been reported to WHO (3).
Of these, 200 (61 percent) were fatal. All cases
were reported from Asia (Azerbaijan, Cambodia,
China, Indonesia, Iraq, Laos, Thailand, Turkey,
and Vietnam) and Africa (Djibouti, Egypt, and
Nigeria). In addition, no human case of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection has been identified in the United States.

MMWR Editorial Note
------------------
During the period 20 May to 15 Sep 2007,
influenza A (H1), influenza A (H3), and influenza
B viruses cocirculated worldwide. The influenza
virus strain that will predominate and the
severity of influenza-related disease activity
for the 2007-08 influenza season are difficult to predict.
Vaccination is the best method for preventing
influenza and its potentially severe
complications. In the United States, the
influenza vaccine can be administered to any
person aged >6 months who wants to reduce the
likelihood of becoming ill with influenza or
transmitting the virus to others. Annual
influenza vaccination is targeted toward persons
at increased risk for influenza-related
complications and severe disease (e.g., children
aged 6-59 months, pregnant women, persons
aged >50 years, and persons aged 5-49 years with
certain chronic medical conditions) and their
close contacts (e.g., health-care workers and household contacts)
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5606a1.htm>4).
In addition, all children aged 6 months to <9
years who have never received influenza
vaccination should receive 2 doses of influenza vaccine
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5606a1.htm>4).
For the 2007-08 influenza season, vaccine
supplies are projected to be plentiful in the
United States; therefore, influenza vaccination
can proceed for all persons, whether healthy or
at high risk, either individually or through mass
campaigns, as soon as vaccine is available.
Although many of the recently examined influenza
A (H3) viruses show reduced reactivity with sera
produced against the A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)
vaccine strain (the H3N2 component of the 2007-08
influenza vaccine), vaccination is still the best
means of protection against influenza and
influenza-related complications. Even in years in
which the match between the vaccine strains and
circulating strains is not exact and protection
against illness is reduced, the vaccine can still
mitigate the severity of illness and reduce the
likelihood of severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death.
Although vaccination is the best method for
preventing and reducing the impact of influenza,
antiviral medications are a valuable adjunct. For
patients who consult a health-care provider
within 48 hours of illness onset, antiviral
medications can reduce the duration of illness
and might reduce the likelihood of complications.
Antivirals also can be used to prevent influenza
in persons who have not received vaccine and to
control outbreaks in institutions or group
residential settings such as nursing homes.
On 19 Sep 2007, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved the live, attenuated influenza
vaccine (LAIV), FluMist, for use in healthy
children aged 2-4 years. Vaccination providers
should ask the parents or guardians of these
children about wheezing and should not use LAIV
in children who have recurrent wheezing. LAIV,
which is administered as a nasal spray, had
already been approved for healthy children
aged >5 years and healthy adults aged <50 years.
Other FDA-approved changes in the use of FluMist
for persons of all approved ages include 1) a
reduction in the volume of vaccine used to 0.1 mL
per nostril, 2) a reduction in the minimum dose
spacing to 4 weeks for children who require 2
doses, and 3) a change in the temperature
requirements for shipping and storage of the
vaccine (now 2-8�C [35-46�F]). Trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine, which is
administered as an intramuscular injection, may
be used for any person aged >6 months, including
those with high-risk conditions
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5606a1.htm>4).
There were 2 cases of human infection with swine
influenza virus reported in the United States
during August [2007]. Although human infection
with swine influenza is uncommon, sporadic cases
occur in most years, usually among persons in
direct contact with ill pigs or who have been in
places where pigs might have been present (e.g.,
agricultural fairs, farms, or petting zoos). The
sporadic cases detected in recent years have not
resulted in sustained human-to-human transmission
or community outbreaks; however, human infections
with swine influenza viruses or any other
nonhuman or novel influenza virus should be
identified quickly and investigated. Clinicians
should consider swine influenza A in the
differential diagnosis among patients with
influenza like illness (ILI) who have had recent
contact with pigs. Testing of respiratory
specimens from these patients for influenza virus
should be coordinated with the state health
department laboratory. In Jan 2007, the executive
committee of the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists (CSTE) voted to make human
infection with a novel influenza A virus,
including swine influenza viruses, a nationally
notifiable condition, and the proposal was approved by CSTE in June 2007
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5613a4.htm>5,6).
In collaboration with local and state health
departments, CDC continues to recommend enhanced
surveillance for possible influenza A (H5N1)
infection among travelers with severe,
unexplained respiratory illness returning from
countries affected by influenza A (H5N1) (7).
