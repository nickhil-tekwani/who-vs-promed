RABID BOBCAT BITES RAISE FEARS
Two New Yorkers were attacked last week by rabid bobcats in what health
officials say was dramatic evidence of the state's worst-in-the-nation
animal rabies problem. The bobcat attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday occurred
in two Delaware County communities 45 miles apart.
Last year the state had 1,084 confirmed cases of animal rabies, more than
any other in the nation. This year, the state has already had 360 cases of
confirmed animal rabies, a 20 percent increase from that period last year,
said Charles Trimarchi, director of the state's rabies lab. Tuesday's attack
involved an 80 year-old man in Roxbury. The man suffered eight puncture
wounds before the bobcat noticed a domestic cat and chased the animal. It
wound up in a garage where a resident shot it, Merwin said. Ward Stone, a
wildlife pathologist for the state DEC, found that the bobcat was rabid.
The next day, a group of students were playing in the schoolyard of Hancock
elementary school when they noticed a bobcat nearby. The bobcat jumped on
the back of a 13 year-old, splitting open the youth's thumb and puncturing
his arm before he was able to get the animal off of him. The child then
began strangling the animal, and an adult who arrived on the scene later
killed the bobcat himself. That cat was also tested by Stone and was
revealed to have rabies. Both victims have to undergo rabies
treatments that will last a month, Merwin said.
