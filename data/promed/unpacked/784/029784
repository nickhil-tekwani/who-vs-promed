Fowl plague probably also in Belgium
------------------------------------
THE HAGUE: Fowl plague (Highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI) is also
seriously suspected in Belgium. It relates to a poultry plant in Ravels,
near Poppel -- just a few yards from the border with the Dutch province
North Brabant, under the city of Tilburg. This has been announced Tuesday
evening by the Belgian Agriculture Ministry. The Belgian Food Agency has
imposed a buffer zone covering the communities Ravels and Baarle-Hertog.
The control measures in this area are similar to the ones implemented in
the Netherlands; no transportation of live poultry, hatching eggs, poultry
bedding and litter is allowed. Table eggs should not exit the farms and all
poultry are required to be kept indoors. Dogs and cats in the engaged farms
are also required to be kept indoors; wheels and tires of all vehicles
should be disinfected before leaving any poultry plant.
The described measures are applied also in the adjacent Dutch territory,
but the number of Dutch plants involved has not been available Tuesday evening.
The involved plant in Ravels includes 12 000 chickens. According to the
spokesperson of the federal Food Agency, the suspicion was raised when 2000
chickens died. Suspected clinical signs were observed by a veterinarian who
alarmed the federal Food Agency.
The presence of the disease is under investigation; it might take several
days before confirmation or exclusion of fowl plague is obtained.
