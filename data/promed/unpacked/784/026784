Hundreds of pigs have been killed in southern India to fight an outbreak of
Japanese encephalitis that has claimed the lives of 138 children in a
month, officials said Tuesday. At least 660 other children are suffering
from Japanese encephalitis in government hospitals across the state of
Andhra Pradesh, but the outbreak has been controlled, said the state health
minister, S. Aruna.
Aruna said thousands of doses of vaccine have been administered in the
affected areas. "The worst is over," she said after visiting a children's
hospital in Hyderabad, the state capital.
Doctors say pigs carry the virus, which is spread to humans by mosquitoes.
Children are most vulnerable, and hundreds die in India each year,
especially after the annual monsoon rains when mosquitoes breed. At least
2200 children have died of encephalitis in Andhra Pradesh during the last
10 years.
Earlier this month, Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the state's
highest elected official, ordered local authorities to ensure pigs were
kept three miles away from all neighborhoods, and to slaughter them if
necessary. Hundreds of pigs have been killed during the last two weeks.
Naidu also asked officials to find alternate employment for about half a
million people in the state who live off pig farming, so that he can ban
the trade [and thereby fight encephalitis.

[I am comforted to know that "the worst is over". I wonder: What is the
cost of killing all those pigs vs. the cost of vaccinating children?
"Cost" is an interesting word. - Mod.CHC
