[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) has been a big problem to the cattle owners in
the Kunene Region from where it had spread to Owambo Region in the towns of
Oshana, Oshitoko, and Ohangwena. The disease is spreading quite fast in the
northern part of the country. Laboratory diagnosis/confirmation is strongly
advised even though the infection is considered endemic and presents
typical clinical signs. For a detailed overview on LSD, refer to the
commentary in ProMED-mail archive no. 20080131.0388. - Mod.FE
