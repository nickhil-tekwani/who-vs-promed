9 measures to prevent extension of avian influenza
--------------------------------------------------
In response to the fatal case of human infection with avian influenza
occurring on 20 Feb 2008, and to protect the health and safety of the
masses and preserve social stability, the Nanning Municipal Administration
of Industry & Commerce immediately adopted emergency measures and actively
undertook avian influenza prevention and control work to guarantee that
avian influenza does not extend and does not spread.

Sources say that on 19 Feb 2008, Guangxi Ruikang Hospital admitted a
pneumonia patient. The patient was a 42 year old unemployed man, registered
residency in Beihu'anju Neighborhood in Nanning Municipality's Xixiangtang
District. On 23 Feb 2008 the patient came down with fatigue, nasal
congestion, and runny nose. The next day he developed chills, fever, and
cough. He gave himself Ganmaoling Granules [a traditional Chinese cold
medicine]. Symptoms did not improve. On 14 Feb 2008, he sought medical
attention at Guangxi Minzu Hospital. On 18 Feb 2008, the patient's
condition rapidly deteriorated. After all treatment failed, he died on 20
Feb 2008. The Ministry of Health human avian influenza prevention and
control expert team determined this was a fatal case of infection with
avian influenza. According to investigations, the patient bought 3 live
chickens on 4 Feb 2008 from a chicken vending stall at Heping Market in
Pumiao Township, Yongning District [of Nanning Municipality]. That night,
one chicken died of unknown causes (this chicken was thrown in a garbage
dump by the patient, unconsumed). On 5 Feb 2008, the patient found that of
the other 2 chickens, one had developed symptoms of "chicken cholera." The
patient then slaughtered and ate them. Later, the patient developed
symptoms of infection.

Woman in China's Guangdong has suspected bird flu
-------------------------------------------------
A woman in southern China is suspected to have been infected with the H5N1
bird flu virus, the Hong Kong government said on Monday [25 Feb 2008], a
week after the country reported its 3rd death from the disease since last
year [2007]. The Centre for Health Protection said it had been notified by
the Department of Health of the southern Guangdong province and Ministry of
Health that the 44 year old woman had developed symptoms on 16 Feb 2008 and
the case had yet to be confirmed. It gave no further details.

Last week [20 Feb 2008], a man from China's southern Guangxi autonomous
region died of the H5N1 bird flu virus [see above], the 3rd death from the
disease since late last year [2007], the Health Ministry said. Of the 29
cases confirmed to date in China, 19 have been fatal. There have been 232
