Fatalities from rabies in Negros Occidental [Province] have risen to 4 with the death of a 10-year-old boy from Brgy. Puey in Sagay City, Negros Occidental. Renante Decena, Provincial Veterinary Officer [PVO], said yesterday [18 Jun 2014] that the boy, who died on [11 Jun 2014], several weeks after a dog bit him, had failed to seek immediate medical attention.

Before his death, a 10-year-old girl from Brgy. Prosperidad in San Carlos City [Negros Occidental Province] also died from the disease last month [May 2014], he said. A woman from Cadiz City who died in March this year [2014] after she was bitten by the dog of their neighbor in January and a 6-year-old boy from Sagay City were the 1st 2 recorded rabies fatalities in Negros Occidental.

Decena said they have already conducted dog vaccination in the areas where there are rabies fatalities. He said 10 000 doses of anti-rabies vaccines are set to arrive in Negros Occidental today [19 Jun 2014]. Rabies outbreaks have been declared in 3 cities and 2 towns in Negros Occidental after dogs from these places tested positive for the virus, Decena had said earlier. He said that even if only one dog tests positive in an area, it will already be considered an outbreak, since it is presumed that the animal had bitten other stray dogs, and can cause the spread of the virus.

Based on data gathered by the PVO, there are 219 000 dogs in Negros Occidental but only 24 000, or about 10 percent, have been vaccinated. As to human cases, there are 4000 reports of dog bites in Negros Occidental, although this is not yet considered alarming, Ernell Tumimbang, provincial health officer, said.
