Tajikistan has opened a criminal investigation after 14 prison inmates died of food poisoning while being transferred from Tajikistan's northern Sogd region to prisons in Dushanbe, Norak, and Yovon in southern Tajikistan on 7 Jul 2019.

"During transportation, one of the prisoners shared 3 pieces of bread with another 15 inmates in Varzab Valley," the Justice Ministry said in a statement. "Their health deteriorated when they arrived in Dushanbe."

It said that "16 prisoners, who were in the back of one of the cars, experienced nausea, dizziness, and vomiting" half an hour after consuming the bread.

Medical staff were only able to save the lives of 2 of the prisoners, according to the statement, which was relayed by the Khovar state information agency.

The Prosecutor-General's Office has launched a probe into the incident.

The incident was the 2nd case of mass deaths among prisoners in Tajikistan in the past 2 months. Unrest in Vahdat prison, 20 km east of Dushanbe, left 29 prisoners and 3 guards dead on 19 May 2019.

Authorities blamed the Islamic State (IS) extremist group for the riot.

In November 2018, another riot claimed by IS left 26 people dead in Khujand, a city in the northeast of the country.

Tajikistan endured a 5-year civil war that claimed tens of thousands of lives shortly after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

Since 1992, Tajikistan has been led by authoritarian President Emomali Rahmon, 66, who has tolerated little opposition.

Tajikistan is regularly cited for its poor human rights record. In its 2018 World Report, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said Tajikistan's human rights record "worsened further in 2017."

[There is little information on clinical signs to go on, but when we consider that 3 pieces of bread affected 16 people with nausea, dizziness, and vomiting half an hour after consuming it, one has to wonder what was in the bread.

Often times, some salt is used in bread. Generally not much, but there are types of bread using a much larger amount of salt. Nitrite has occasionally been mistaken for salt. Nitrite poisoning can occur by accidental ingestion of food and water or through recreational inhalation of amyl nitrite. Severe nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness and methemoglobinemia inducing profound cyanosis are the main symptoms. Rapid use of methylene blue can be life-saving, as coma and death can ensue if an early diagnosis is not made.

However, dizziness, and vomiting are not specific signs only for nitrate intoxication. Organophosphate can also produce vomiting. Dehydration can produce dizziness.

There is very little to go on in this article. If there is more information on this situation, we would be appreciate knowing about it. - Mod.TG
