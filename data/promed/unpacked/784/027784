The number of people reporting digestive problems
after eating at the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine
booth at Taste of Chicago last weekend [7-8 Jul
2007] tripled Fri 13 Jul 2007, Health Department officials said.
As of noon 13 Jul 2007, 378 people had called
claiming symptoms of salmonella poisoning, up
from 126 on the day before [12 Jul 2007],
officials said. [Laboratory analysis has
confirmed salmonellosis in 32 cases], with more
tests pending. About a dozen people have been
hospitalized for dehydration, diarrhea, or fever.
Officials determined at least one, and perhaps
the only, source of the bacterial infection was a
dish of herbs, tomato, and cucumber known as
hummus shirazi, and ordered Pars Cove to stop
serving hummus while a full-scale investigation
proceeds. "The hummus shirazi is implicated -- at
least that's one thing that we know now," said
Terry Mason, Chicago's commissioner of public
health. "But the investigation is not complete."
City officials were quick to caution that the
outbreak may not be as widespread as it seems, as
symptoms cannot be tied to salmonella without testing.

City Health Dept. Investigation of Food Borne Illness Continues
Public Outreach Leads to Dozens of Calls
For Immediate Release
Contact: Tim Hadac
Phone: (312) 747-9805

-----------------------
As anticipated by Chicago Department of Public
Health (CDPH) officials on Wednesday [11 Jul
2007], public outreach related to a food borne
illness outbreak has increased the number of reported cases.
As of noon today, 126 people have reported that
they became ill after they ate food purchased
from the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth at Taste
of Chicago -- up from the 17 reported yesterday [11 Jul 2007].
Nine of the 126 are laboratory-confirmed cases of
salmonellosis, with more results pending -- up
from the 5 reported yesterday [11 Jul 2007]. Ten
people are known to have been hospitalized -- up
from the 3 reported yesterday [11 Jul 2007].
Most of the individuals live in the Chicago area;
a few are from downstate and a few others are from other states.
�In public health, better surveillance always
leads to better case finding, and we are grateful
to all those who have helped us reach out to the
public about this situation in a clear, factual
way,� stated CDPH Commissioner Terry Mason, M.D.
�Our challenge now is to analyze these new
reports and gain a greater understanding of the
outbreak and therefore strengthen our ability to
prevent outbreaks in the future.�
People who ate at the Pars Cove booth and who
feel ill are advised to consult with their doctor
and to call the City of Chicago at 311. Those
calling from outside the city should phone (312) 744-5000.
The Pars Cove situation represents the 1st
confirmed outbreak of illness associated with the
event in at least 20 years. In the larger context
of having safely served tens of millions of
people in recent years, the Taste remains quite
possibly the safest food service operation in the
city. [About Food Safety at Taste of Chicago -- see below]
Nationally, there are about 40 000 cases of
salmonellosis reported every year, although
federal health officials say that the actual
number of cases may be as much as 30 times higher
-- since most cases are mild and go unreported.
In Chicago, there are about 300 reported cases
each year. [Facts About Salmonellosis see
<http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_ATTACH/SalmonellaFAQsJul07.html>]
To alert the medical community to be on the
lookout for cases of illness that may relate to
the Pars Cove booth, CDPH earlier this week
notified all hospitals in the city, as well as
other public health departments, including the
Illinois Department of Public Health and the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention --
who, respectively, have notified health departments statewide and nationwide.
CDPH sanitarians have visited the Pars Cove
restaurant, 435 W. Diversey, to thoroughly
inspect the premises. Additionally, CDPH is
interviewing Pars Cove food handlers and
administering stool tests for presence of the
Salmonella bacterium. Pars Cove management is
cooperating fully in the investigation.
Health officials say it is still too early to
speculate on whether the bacteria were
transmitted by food handlers or came from the food or a food ingredient.
About Food Safety at Taste of Chicago
Taste of Chicago is by far the most intensively
regulated food service operation in the city. The
event features a 24-hour-a-day food safety
presence � teams of CDPH sanitarians inspect and
re-inspect the 70-plus food booths from 8:30 a.m.
to midnight each day, and staff hired by the
Illinois Restaurant Association monitors and logs
the temperatures in the refrigerated storage trucks overnight.
All vendors are required to undergo training to
prepare, serve and store food safely under outdoor conditions.
Scrutiny is intense. A food booth is typically
inspected at least four times each day, while a
typical city restaurant is inspected twice a year.
While most vendors do an exceptionally good job
of ensuring food safety, the intense scrutiny
typically results in CDPH ordering the disposal
of food that does not meet its exacting
standards. Each year, about 2000 pounds of food
(an average of 200 pounds a day) at the event are
disposed of by order of CDPH inspectors.

[The outbreak numbers continue to increase.
ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Paul Axelsen for
submitting a similar story as well. - Mod.LL]
[The press release from the Chicago City
Department of Health is a very good example of
the need for transparency when investigating an
outbreak. Clearly the initial release of
information on a "small outbreak" has lead to
reports of a significant number of additional
cases, many of whom might not have been
officially reported -- the "silent majority"
referred to in the Press Release that frequently
are not reported to the official health sector
"since most cases are mild and go unreported".
This moderator's favorite expression -- "seek and ye shall find". - Mod.MPP]
