Because West Nile virus (WNV) has become endemic in North America, and
cases can be expected to occur throughout the virus transmission season,
ProMED-mail will be reporting only newly detected virus and human cases in
the US states and Canadian provinces for the current reporting period.
Those wishing to see the complete summary for virus detection in birds,
mosquitoes, sentinel animals, and equines, as well as a breakdown of human
disease cases for 2008, can access that information on the following sites:

Human cases: no new cases this period
Total human cases in 2008: 36 (includes 2 cases from outside home province)
Wild birds: the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Center has informed
ProMED-mail that for the year, as of 4 Nov 2008, birds have been tested in
the following provinces:

(Number positive for WNV / Total tested):
British Columbia 0 / 215
New Brunswick 0 / 50
Nova Scotia 0 / 44
Ontario 150 / 794
Prince Edward Island 0 / 82
[Note: Quebec appears not to have tested any birds in 2008. - Mod.TY]

The Public Health Agency of Canada reports that for the year to 18 Oct
2008, 85 per cent of the WNV positive birds are American crows (_Corvus
brachyrhynchos_), and 15 per cent are blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_).

Equine cases for the year as of 18 Oct 2008 total 2 in Quebec, 2 in
Ontario, and 2 in Saskatchewan.

Mosquito pools positive for WNV during the period 12-18 Oct 2008: none

Cumulative for the year to 18 Oct 2008: Ontario (62), Manitoba (41),
Saskatchewan (19).

States newly reporting WNV detected: none
(The only states not reporting WNV presence in 2008 are: Alaska, Hawaii,
and Maine).
States newly reporting human cases: none
There have been a total of 1200 human cases and 27 fatalities to date in
2008 in the USA.

A dramatic increase in cases of West Nile virus in one part of southern
California has been linked to the nation's foreclosures crisis.

Abandoned swimming pools in thousands of repossessed homes have turned into
fetid breeding grounds for mosquitoes which carry the virus, helping to
fuel a large increase in cases of the disease, researchers say.

A study focused on Bakersfield, among the cities hardest hit by the
nation's home repossession crisis, found a surge in incidence of West Nile
virus last year [2007] following a 300 per cent increase in mortgage defaults.

Although public health officials have long suggested a link between the
housing crisis and West Nile cases, the Bakersfield study is the 1st to
examine the extent of the link, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The study was published in the online journal Emerging Infectious Diseases
[see reference below]. It noted that aerial surveys of Bakersfield last
year [2007] showed "an extensive number of green or neglected pools, most
of which were producing mosquitoes." "Green pools" are those where algae
has bloomed to create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The abandoned
pools were usually in homes that had been abandoned due to foreclosure, the
study noted.

West Nile virus is transmitted to humans and animals via mosquito bites.
Most people who become infected do not become ill, although the elderly and
frail can develop flu-like symptoms. A tiny percentage of people develop a
potentially fatal form of the disease.

Kern County, where Bakersfield is, has undertaken extensive mosquito
control this year [2008] and has, so far, reported no human cases of West
Nile during 2008, according to the website of California's Department of
Public Health.

In 2007, it recorded 140 cases. Statewide, there were 380 human cases. This
year [2008], California has seen 355 human cases, with 126 in Los Angeles
county. [The US CDC reports 329 human WN virus cases in 2008 to 4 Nov 2008.
- Mod.TY]

The 1st death from the virus in California this year [2008] was reported in
August 2008. In 2007, 5 people died. Across the US, 1108 human cases of
West Nile have been reported so far this year [The total human cases in
2008 to 4 Nov 2008 are now 1200, US CDC reports. - Mod.TY].

[This report is interesting, as it clearly makes the connection between the
current difficult economic situation in the USA, with houses being
foreclosed on for failure to pay mortgages, and the inadvertent creation of
habitats that favor pathogen transmission, in this case WN virus and its
mosquito vectors. - Mod.TY]
