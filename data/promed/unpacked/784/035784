Gull deaths on Gooseberry Island linked to virus
------------------------------------------------
The more than 2200 birds that were found dead on and near Gooseberry
Island on Pelican Lake in August [2009] died of a circovirus, according
to State Wildlife Veterinarian Erica Butler.

In July of 2009, several citizens reported dead gulls on the
island, located near Breezy Point Resort. The reports were then
investigated by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) who
determined that the majority of dead birds were found in the far
southeast corner of the island in a 1-2 acre [0.4-0.8 ha] nesting
area.

Butler said during a phone interview last week [week of 23 Nov 2009]
that circovirus is a disease that depresses the immune system, which
increases the possibility of secondary infections.

"We found salmonella, and there were different bacterial and fungal
infections," said Butler. "It took a long time to get results and the
trouble was there wasn't much in common, until we figured out the
underlying cause. The birds technically died from other infections
but the main cause was the circovirus."

"It spread from bird to bird from feather dust or fecal particles --
and the circovirus impacts their [immunity and] lowers white blood
cells and weakens them, therefore they cannot fight off other
diseases," explained Butler. "It is pretty much species-specific, we
had questions about the goats on the island but they were not
involved or affected."

She said there is no danger posed to humans from the circovirus, but
added that with any dead creature there is some risk with handling
the remains. When asked if anything could be done to prevent this
type of occurrence in the future, Butler said, "It's just one of
those things that can affect bird colonies where there are a lot of
birds in close contact."

Butler noted that 3 separate labs were used to determine the cause,
the University of Minnesota Diagnostic Veterinary, the National
Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin and the USDA Labs in Georgia.

She was happy that people took the time to call about the birds in
July [2009], "We appreciate the reports from the public that alerted
us to the deaths."

According to DNR regional non-game specialist Pam Perry said that
Gooseberry Island is the only known nesting colony in the Brainerd
Lakes area. "The colony has been there a long time and is home for up
to 1000 nesting pairs of gulls as well as some cormorants," said Gary
Drotts, Brainerd Area Wildlife manager.

[New viruses of humans and animals continue to be discovered every
year. The circoviruses are a recently discovered such group of
viruses. They have been found in pigs and birds, but none have been
detected as yet in humans, or mammals other than pigs. During the
last 15 years, several new circovirus species have been found in
birds, and they tend to be very host-specific. None of the avian
circoviruses have been grown yet in vitro, and their effect on the
host, if any, is poorly understood. They are, however, suspected to be
immunosuppressive based on their presence in lymphoid tissues of
infected birds.

With the exception of psittacine beak and feather disease virus, and
occasional case reports, there appears to be no research on
circoviruses of birds in US; with one exception the new viruses of
the last 15 years are being discovered by researchers in other
countries.

Circoviruses have been known to present in pigeons and other birds as
beak and feather disease. What is described from Minnesota seems to
be different from those 2 disease entities.
