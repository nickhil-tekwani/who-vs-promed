Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: A variant strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) associated with outbreaks of diarrhea with high morbidity and high mortality in suckling piglets has emerged in central and southern regions of Taiwan since December 2013. The disease was spreading rapidly in swine farms in Taiwan, posing significant economic concerns and impacts. Clinical signs were characterized by acute vomiting, anorexia, and watery diarrhea, with high mortality in piglets. Samples were taken from affected farms and confirmed as PED by RT-PCR. Detailed genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the genomic sequences of viruses showed that the emergent PEDV strains were most closely related to strains isolated from the United States of America and China in 2013. According to the testing results of affected farms from regional and national laboratories, 34 pig farms were confirmed being infected with PEDV.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (supportive care)

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal Health Research Institute (National laboratory) / Swine / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 8 Jan 2014 / Positive
Animal Health Research Institute (National laboratory) / Swine / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 5 Feb 2014 / Positive
Animal Health Research Institute (National laboratory) / Swine / virus isolation / 13 Feb 2014 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[During the last OIE World Assembly of Delegates in May 2014, Member Countries exchanged views on events related to porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED). To gather the latest knowledge on the disease and provide guidance to Member Countries, the OIE Director General recommended convening an ad hoc group of subject matter experts. This group of experts from all over the world met in June 2014 to draft recommendations related to the safe trade of pigs and pork products. See http://tinyurl.com/ok64nq3.

Taiwan becomes the 2nd country in the OIE Region of Asia/Oceana to officially report PEDv to the OIE as an "emerging disease."

PED is not a zoonotic disease and appears to affect only pigs. - Mod.CRD
