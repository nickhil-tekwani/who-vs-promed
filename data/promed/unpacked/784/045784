Is this the end for Ome plum industry?
--------------------------------
The outbreak of plum pox virus in Ome was first seen in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20100126.0283). Ome means unripe plums, and plums from here are well known. Now the Ministry of Agriculture have determined that the whole region is infected with the disease and the trees have to go.

"The best thing to do is cut down every plum tree to make sure the virus is completely eradicated and then replant after 3 years," says Ome city's forestry section. The fruit trees are not as valued as they once were. The number of commercial growers has been falling in recent years.

From the growers' perspective, the planned response to the outbreak is a worrying halfway house between their needs and the imperatives of tourism. Officials will determine on a tree-by-tree basis which plums are commercial and which are decorative. If a random sampling of a commercial orchard finds that 10 percent of the trees are infected, then the entire site has to be cleared. Decorative trees, meanwhile, will be spared as far as is possible, in order to preserve the landscape.

"That doesn't really guarantee that the virus is gone, does it?" says a farmer who has an orchard of 148 trees with several of the trees nearly a century old. [He is] citing practice in Europe, where the disease originated. If an infection is suspected on a single tree there, he says, all other trees within 800 meters are immediately taken down. "We're not ready to be drastic, [but] we're prolonging the problem." A few growers have already levelled their own orchards in anticipation of the imposed felling.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa, and the Americas, but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 percent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible including hops, pea, tomato, and a number of weedy annual plants.

Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, and can lead to premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host species. PPV isolates have been grouped into several strains according to their serological and molecular properties, and some strains do not infect certain _Prunus_ species.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical inoculation, grafting, in seed for some host species, but is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus reservoirs, and use of certified planting and grafting material. Resistant cultivars are available for several types of stone fruits.

PPV was reported for the 1st time from Japan in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100424.1317). Detection occurred on apricots in the Tokyo area, including Ome, where the virus now seems to have spread to the plum population. Eradication attempts of established pathogens are rarely successful, especially when highly mobile vectors such as aphids are involved, and consequently the concerns of the farmers reported above appear justified.
