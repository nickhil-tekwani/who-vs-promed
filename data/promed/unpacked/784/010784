An outbreak of hepatitis A reported in the Ryazansk Oblast
----------------------------------------------------------
About 20 children in the village of Kostin in the Ribnovskii Region
have contracted hepatitis A virus. Most of the infected children are
pupils of a local residential school. Among the possible causes of
the outbreak is the poor quality of the drinking water available in
the village of Kostin. There are other possible reasons for the
spread of the infection. Local physicians have reported a general
rise in the incidence of hepatitis A in the Region. According to the
Ryazansk Oblast Rospotrebnadzor [Public Health Service], there have
been more than 250 cases of hepatitis A virus infection recorded
since the beginning of the year. However, the current outbreak in
Kostin is the most severe.

[Outbreaks of hepatitis have been recorded frequently in Russia (see
the ProMED-mail archives). According to the World Health
Organisation, hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause
mild to severe illness. Hepatitis A virus is spread by faecal-oral
transmission when a person ingests food or drink contaminated by
another infected person's stool. The disease is closely associated
with poor sanitation and a lack of personal hygiene, such as hand-washing.

Hence it is likely that deficiencies in the water supply in village
of Kostin are responsible for the outbreak affecting children in a
residential school in the village. Improved sanitation and
administration of hepatitis A vaccine are the most effective ways to
combat the disease.
