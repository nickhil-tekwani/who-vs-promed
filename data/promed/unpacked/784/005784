Goats may be tested for BSE
----------------------------
Australian goats could be tested for BSE, after confirmation that a goat in
France has contracted the disease. It's taken 3 years to confirm that mad
cow disease -- normally found in cattle -- has jumped species.
Dr Greg Curran, from the National Disease Outbreak Response team, says
increased testing may be needed to protect Australian markets. "Certainly
with cattle and with sheep there is a surveillance program, and that's been
going on for quite a few years now, but we haven't been able to look at the
problems in goats. We might add goats to the group of animals that's
checked for BSE, now that this discovery's been made in Europe."

EU food agency to explore 'mad goat' risk
------------------------------------------
Current science finds no link between goat meat and meat product
consumption and variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD). But a group of
experts calls for new research, to fully understand the risk this meat may
pose to the food chain, and the consumer. The move follows confirmation
earlier this week that mad cow disease had been identified in a goat in
France. This is the 1st case of the disease identified in an animal other
than cattle.
Following the discovery, a group of scientists at the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA) are now recommending that more information is needed to
assess the significance of the single French case.
The EFSA panel on biological hazards (BIOHAZ) this week underlined the need
to carry out a quantitative risk assessment concerning BSE-related risks
associated with the consumption of goat meat and goat meat products.
They expect to complete the assessment by July 2005, if pertinent data
become available.
Assessing the health risk of goats milk and milk derivatives -- for
example, lactoferrin and lactose -- in November [2004], the panel [said]
such products are "unlikely to present any risk of TSE contamination
provided that milk is sourced from clinically healthy animals."
BSE, also known as mad cow disease, belongs to the group of diseases that
also include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) in man and scrapie in sheep
and goats. These diseases lead to a degeneration of brain tissue which
takes on a typical spongy appearance.
1st identified in 1986 in the UK, 180 000 cases of BSE have since been
diagnosed there alone and only 4 [Sic; see comment] out of the 25 EU member
states have not yet declared any cases. BSE has affected the entire beef
food chain, from producer to consumer.
A recent report from the European Association of Animal Production
estimates the cost of BSE to EU15 (prior to accession) member states at
more than 90 billion Euros [USD 117 billion]. In addition, the BSE crisis
has had a significant impact on public trust in government and governmental
scientific advice.
Indeed, the newly created European Food Safety Authority formed the hub of
Europe's white paper on food safety. Cleared in the 1990s, the legislation
found its roots in the string of food safety crises, such as BSE, in Europe.
While it has been established that small ruminants can also be infected in
experiments with BSE, up to now, there are no signs of natural infection.
The feeding of meat-and-bone meal -- linked to BSE development in cattle --
is under discussion as the possible cause of the only confirmed case of BSE
infection in the goat.
The goat in question was already born before the ban on the feeding of
meat-and-bone meal. It was slaughtered in 2002. Other animals in the herd
were also examined, but they all tested negative.
[7 EU member states have not yet declared any cases of BSE. They are
Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Sweden. Sweden has
been classified by the EU as a GBR II country, namely a country where the
presence of one or more cattle clinically or pre-clinically infected with
the BSE agent is "Unlikely but not excluded". The other 6 mentioned
countries are classified as GBR III, namely countries where the presence of
one or more cattle clinically or pre-clinically infected with the BSE agent
is "Likely but not confirmed". For further details on GBR (EU's Geographic
BSE risk classification system) see posting 20030529.1311.- Mod.AS]

Goat found infected with BSE
-----------------------------
A French goat has been confirmed as the 1st food animal other than a cow to
catch BSE. The finding deepens fears that the disease is lurking undetected
in European sheep, which are farmed in a similar way.
The goat may have developed the disease before the European Union banned
potentially infected feed in 2001. Unlike cattle, sheep and goats are
thought to be able to transmit BSE to each other, and this would keep the
disease circulating despite the feed ban. Also unlike cattle, both species
carry the infection in muscle, making their meat potentially more dangerous.
There are further fears that scrapie, a BSE-like disease widespread in
Europe, might have masked the presence of BSE in sheep and goats. So
animals that appear to have scrapie are now being randomly tested for BSE.
The European Commission aims to quadruple the number of tests to assess the
extent of any infection.
Before cattle remains were banned in animal feed, French goats might have
run a higher risk of acquiring BSE than sheep or goats elsewhere in
Europe. Cattle remains were used as a protein supplement, which is needed
mainly by animals that are heavily milked. Goat's cheese is a huge industry
in France. Sheep and goats might have been less likely to be affected in
the UK, where they are rarely kept for their milk. [This might be true in
relation to sheep, but goats, in the UK -- as elsewhere in Europe, are kept
for milk production. - Mod.AS]

1st case of BSE in a goat: Member States support Commission proposal for
increased testing
-------------------------------------------------
The Member States today voted in favour of the European Commission's
proposal to step up testing for BSE in the EU goat population, following
the confirmation last week of the 1st case of BSE found in a goat. The
testing scheme was proposed by the Commission to determine if this BSE case
represents an isolated incident or if further measures need to be taken.
The situation will be closely monitored and reviewed at the latest after 6
months, based on the results of the increased testing and the outcome of a
quantitative risk assessment on the safety of goat meat currently being
carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
Markos Kyprianou, EU Commissioner responsible for Health and Consumer
Protection, said "Our priority is to safeguard the health of Europe's
citizens, and I therefore want to act quickly to determine the significance
of this case. That is why we are significantly stepping up the level of
testing. We will monitor the situation closely and review all the data and
scientific advice again in 6 months."
The Commission is proposing increased testing in goats for at least 6
months (185 000 tests of healthy goats in the EU and 15 000 goats dead on
farm) to determine if this is an isolated incident. The extent of the
monitoring programme will be based on the goat population in each Member
State and will focus primarily on Member States where BSE is present in the
cattle population. All confirmed TSE cases will be subjected to a 3-step
testing scheme, already in use, which will make it possible to
differentiate between scrapie and BSE. The Commission will co-finance this
increased testing.
Following the findings by a research group in France of a suspected BSE
infection in a goat, the European Commission immediately made the findings
public on 28 Oct 2004. The case was confirmed on 28 Jan 2005 and today the
Commission presented its proposal for increased testing to the Standing
Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), representing the
Member States. This proposal will now formally be adopted by the European
Commission in the coming days and will enter into force immediately after
publication in the Official Journal.
The Annex gives an indication of the number of tests to be carried out in
the Member States. This information is only indicative, based on the number
of animals slaughtered in each Member State in 2004, to show the
approximate distribution across the Member States: actual numbers will vary.

[Scrapie is known to have been under-reported for decades due to the
reluctance of breeders of sheep (and goats) to admit even slight suspicions
of cases in their flocks. The main reason was the stigma of scrapie (cum
tremblente, rida, traberkrankheit) being hereditary. There will be no
problem in achieving the planned number of tests in healthy animals, at
slaughterhouses; getting the right number of appropriate animals re:
"dead-on-farm" goats might be more complex. The odds of detecting TSE are
significantly lower in randomly tested healthy animals than in clinically
suspected or dead-on-farm animals. - Mod.AS]
