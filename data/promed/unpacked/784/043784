[This is the 1st occurrence of FMD serotype SAT1 in northern Africa; according to the Algeria web page of the WRLFMD (Pirbright), FMD serotype SAT1 has "never" (0000) been reported earlier from this country, nor from Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, or Egypt.

Algeria belongs to FAO/EUFMD's "FMD pool 3" ("West Eurasia & Middle East"), in which the circulating serotypes are O, A, and Asia1. Algeria borders, on its south, "FMD pool 5" ("West/Central Africa") in which serotypes O, A, SAT1, and SAT2 are known to be circulating.

For "MAP 1. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus pools: world distribution by serotype in 2011-2016", showing FAO/EUFMD's 7 pools globally, see http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/Feb2017.pdf.

Algeria has been recently suffering another emerging FMD outbreak caused by a new virus strain, namely FMDV-A. This event reportedly started on 24 Mar 2017 and is currently present in 3 provinces. Both viruses are affecting cattle in the northern part of the country, along the Mediterranean. They are of grave concern regionally.

Genotyping results of the new Algerian FMDV-A strain have just been published; it has been coined "topotype Africa, lineage G-IV", and is very close (98.3 per cent) to Nigerian strains collected in 2015. The detailed results, including a dendrogram, are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2017/WRLMEG-2017-00028-Algeria-A-current-v2.pdf.

The FMDV-A genotyping results above and the new FMDV SAT1 event, may be interpreted as an indication of direct or indirect contacts between the livestock populations of Pool-5 countries and of Algeria.

Confirmation of the serological and genotyping results of the new Algerian FMD SAT1 virus by an international reference laboratory are anticipated with interest. FMDV SAT1 is known to have recently been circulating in Nigeria, one of "Pool 5" largest countries. (ref 1). The paper includes, in its discussion chapter, the following comments:

"Although it cannot be excluded that the genetic diversity is a consequence of the high mutation rate of the FMDV [SAT1] genome, these findings are suggestive of a new introduction. The source of this virus introduction is unknown. However, there is an increasing movement and trade with animals from the East and South that could have contact with buffalos. Even though these animals do not come directly to Nigeria there might be intermediate trading steps in countries around Nigeria where SAT1 is circulating unrecognized. It would be highly interesting to define livestock trade patterns and nomad routes in this part of Africa and to combine it with phylogenetics to help understand the spread of FMD as has been carried out for sub-Saharan Africa."

The genotyping results of the Nigerian strain are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2016/WRLFMD-2016-00034-Nigeria-SAT1-approved.pdf. This introduction of a new virus strain was not notified to the OIE. Nigeria's annual report for 2015 indicated one untyped FMD outbreak, and for 2016, a total of 3 untyped FMD outbreaks.

FMDV serotype SAT1 demonstrated its intercontinental spreading potential in the Near East during the early 1960s. The major event started in Bahrain in December 1961. By February 1962, the disease was extending northwestwards through the Gulf States to reach Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Syria by April. It then entered the Asiatic regions of Turkey and Iran. In September 1962, it entered the Bosporus to enter Europe for the 1st time and in November 1962 caused an outbreak near the border between Turkey and Greece. It was suspected that the said event originated in eastern Africa. The current event probably started in West/Central Africa.
