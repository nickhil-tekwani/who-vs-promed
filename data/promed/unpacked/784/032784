X-ray reveals hundreds of reptiles in luggage of Czech man leaving
Argentina
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An exotic animal salesman tried to board a flight from Argentina to
Europe with almost 250 undeclared poisonous snakes and endangered
reptiles in his baggage, each meticulously labeled with its Latin
name.

[The 51-year-old Czech citizen] was detained after police spotted
wriggling reptiles in the X-ray scanner at Buenos Aires' international
airport and made him open the checked baggage. They found 247 exotic
and endangered species in all, packed inside plastic containers, bags,
and even socks.

Argentinian authorities believe the Czech was a courier for a criminal
organization that smuggles exotic species whose exports are banned, a
judicial source told The Associated Press. [The man] only arrived in
Argentina days earlier and wouldn't have had time to gather all the
animals himself, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the judge hasn't finished his investigation.

Judge Marcelo Aguinsky believes the boa constrictors, poisonous pit
vipers, and coral snakes, lizards, and spiders could have escaped the
cloth suitcase in the unpressurized cargo hold of the 7 Dec [2011]
Iberia flight to Madrid, and perhaps attacked people there or at his
final destination in Prague, where antidotes for South American snakes
aren't common, the source added.

[The man] was released on about USD 2500 bail after surrendering his
passport and has refused to talk even though he faces up to 10 years
in prison. [He] runs a Czech website that offers reptiles for sale,
including South American pit vipers similar to those found in his
luggage. A woman who answered the contact number given on the site
said she was his wife but did not give her name and said only that her
husband was "ordinary."

Czech authorities have no information about [this person], said
Martina Kankova, spokeswoman for Czech customs administration. She
said authorities have broken up several smuggling rings in recent
years. Czech television has reported that in 2010, customs officials
detained 55 smugglers with dozens of exotic animals.

"We strictly condemn any illegal activity including the smuggling of
animals, but from our point of view and according to our law he is not
guilty at this moment unless the court will say otherwise," Czech
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Karel Srol told the AP on Wednesday [21 Dec
2011]. "It is in the hands of our embassy in Buenos Aires."

Most of the animals and bugs are being held under quarantine at the
Buenos Aires Zoo, while some of the venomous snakes were sent to
Argentina's national health institute, which has a high-security
department where scientists develop antidotes using venom from
snakes.

The species include lizards native to Mexico and snakes, spiders,
snails, and other species from northern Argentina, Paraguay, and
Brazil. Some were already dead in the suitcase, while others have
succumbed to stress since then. Many were quite weak on arrival at the
zoo, but most are still alive.

Wild snakes and reptiles are known to carry infectious diseases and so
must be kept apart from the public and other animals, said Miguel
Rivolta, the lead zoo veterinarian.

"It's difficult to find the right kind of bugs they eat, and to
replicate as much as possible their environment in the wild," Rivolta
said. "The best thing that can happen to these animals is that they
liberate them as soon as possible in their natural habitat."

[This kind of international wildlife smuggling is also dangerous
because pathogens/parasites can be introduced to new ecosystems. The
international reptile trade has grown steadily during the last several
years. The danger of introducing new parasites into naive hosts
outside their natural habitat increases accordingly.
