[Heartwater (cowdriosis) is a rickettsial disease of domestic and wild ruminants caused by _Ehrlichia ruminantium_ (formerly _Cowdria ruminantium_) and transmitted by Amblyomma ticks. It is also known by the synonyms malkopsiekte (Afrikaans), pericardite exsudative infectieuse (French), hidrocarditis infecciosa (Portuguese), idropericardite dei ruminanti (Italian), and a variety of names in different African languages. _Ehrlichia ruminantium_ is classified in the order Rickettsiales and in the family Anaplasmataceae, together with the genera Anaplasma. Although ruminants remain the primary target of the pathogen, in South Africa a possible canine _E. ruminantium_ infection has been reported.

Heartwater occurs in nearly all the sub-Saharan countries of Africa where Amblyomma ticks are present and in the surrounding islands: Madagascar, Reunion, Mauritius, Zanzibar, the Comoros Islands and Sao Tome. The disease is also reported in the Caribbean (Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante and Antigua), from where it threatens the American mainland.

All domestic and wild ruminants can be infected, but the former appear to be the most susceptible. Indigenous domestic ruminants are usually more resistant to the disease. Wild animals could play a role as reservoir, but rusa deer, white tailed deer, springbok, chital, timor deer, which are used in wildlife farming, seem to be the main wild ruminant species in which heartwater can have a significant economic impact.

The average natural incubation period is 2-3 weeks, but can vary from 10 days to a month. In most cases, heartwater is an acute febrile disease, with a sudden rise in body temperature, which may exceed 41 deg. C within 1-2 days after the onset of fever. It remains high for 4-5 weeks with small fluctuations and drops shortly before death. Fever is followed by inappetence, sometimes listlessness, diarrhoea, particularly in cattle, and dyspnoea indicative of lung oedema. Nervous signs develop gradually. The animal is restless, walks in circles, makes sucking movements and stands rigidly with tremors of the superficial muscles. Cattle may push their heads against a wall or present aggressive or anxious behaviour. Finally, the animal falls to the ground, pedalling and exhibiting opisthotonos, nystagmus and chewing movements. The animal usually dies during or following such an attack. The disease can cause high mortality (up to 90 percent) in susceptible domestic ruminants.

Subacute heartwater with less pronounced signs, and peracute heartwater with sudden death, can also occur, according to the breed of ruminant and the strain of _E. ruminantium_ involved.

The most common macroscopic lesions are hydropericardium, hydrothorax, pulmonary oedema, intestinal congestion, oedema of the mediastinal and bronchial lymph nodes, petechiae on the epicardium and endocardium, congestion of the brain, and moderate splenomegaly.

A tentative diagnosis of heartwater is based on the presence of Amblyomma vectors, nervous signs, and presence of transudates in the pericardium and thorax on post-mortem examination. When making a diagnosis based on clinical signs, the following other diseases should be considered: bovine cerebral babesiosis and theileriosis, anaplasmosis, botulism, haemonchosis in small ruminants, rabies and poisoning.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.1.6, Heartwater, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.06_HEARTWATER.pdf.

_E. ruminantium_ is not thought to be zoonotic, but recently, positive PCR results for this organism were obtained in 3 fatal cases of human ehrlichiosis in South Africa; 2 cases occurred in children with encephalitis, vasculitis of the brain, and pulmonary oedema. Clinical details were not available for the other case. _E. ruminantium_ was not proven to be the cause of death in any of the 3 people, and it remains to be determined whether this organism can cause human disease. However, it should be kept in mind that _E. ruminantium_ infects easily human endothelial cells in vitro and that immature Amblyomma ticks (potentially infected) can bite humans. It has thus a zoonotic potential (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/HEARTWATER_FINAL.pdf).

Recommendations for international trade for heartwater are spelled out in chapter 8.7 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.7.htm.

According to information found in the WAHID database under the section "List of countries by sanitary situation" (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist), 144 of 178 OIE Members have provided some information related to heartwater disease (this information is based on the most recent 6-monthly report sent by the countries). Of these 144 OIE Members, the disease was reported as "never occurred" in 102, as "absent" in 21, as "suspected" in 5, as "infection present (with no clinical disease)" in 1, and as "demonstrated clinical disease" in 15 (Botswana, Burundi, Comoros, Republic of Congo, Ghana, Guadeloupe, Madagascar, Mozambique, Somalia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia and Zimbabwe).
