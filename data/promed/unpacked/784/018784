Summary, week 49/2013
---------------------
Influenza activity in the WHO European Region remains at pre-season levels with sporadic detections of influenza viruses being reported mainly from countries in western Europe. Influenza A was detected in the majority of cases testing positive for influenza this week. The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) remains stable, with no influenza detected among SARI cases.

Virological surveillance for influenza
-------------------------------
During week 49/2013, the number of influenza detections in the region remained low despite a slight increase in the number of specimens tested for influenza in comparison with previous weeks. In total, 7121 specimens from sentinel and non-sentinel sources were tested for influenza during the week, 106 (1.5 percent) of which were positive: 92 (87 percent) for influenza A and 14 (13 percent) for influenza B.

Since the beginning of the season (week 40/2013), sentinel and non-sentinel sources have yielded 655 influenza detections: 489 (74 percent) were influenza A viruses and 166 (26 percent) influenza B. Of the 318 influenza A viruses that have been subtyped, 152 (48 percent) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 166 (52 percent) were A(H3N2).

Since the number of influenza detections remained low in week 49/2013, only 3 countries reported a dominant virus, influenza A (Norway), and influenza A, subtype H3N2 (Italy and Turkey).

Virus strain characterisation
------------------------
Circulating influenza viruses are assessed each season for their antigenic and genetic characteristics to determine the extent of their antigenic similarity to the viruses included in the seasonal influenza vaccine and to determine the prevalence of mutations that affect pathogenicity or are associated with susceptibility to antiviral drugs.

Since week 40/2013, 3 countries (Germany, Portugal and the United Kingdom (England)) have characterized 12 influenza viruses antigenically: 10 were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like) and 2 B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage viruses (1 B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like and 1 B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like). Six countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden) have characterized 33 influenza viruses genetically: 14 A(H3N2), 16 A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3 influenza B-Yamagata lineage. The 14 A(H3N2) viruses belonged to subgroup 3C, represented by A/Texas/50/2012 in the A/Perth/16/2009, A(H3) clade; the 16 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to genetic group 6, represented by A/St Petersburg/27/2011; 2 influenza B viruses belonged to clade 2, represented by B/Massachusetts/02/2012 and 1 to clade 3, represented by B/Wisconsin/1/2010, all in the Yamagata lineage.

Since week 40/2013, 4 countries (Norway, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom (England)) have screened 21 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 13 influenza A(H3N2) and 2 influenza B viruses for susceptibility to oseltamivir and zanamivir. All showed susceptibility to both drugs. The 12 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 8 influenza A(H3N2) viruses screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

For the 2013/2014 northern hemisphere influenza season, WHO recommended inclusion of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like, A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2)-like (an egg-adapted virus antigenically like the cell-propagated prototype virus A/Victoria/361/2011) and B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like (Yamagata lineage) viruses in vaccines (see the WHO headquarters web site).

Outpatient surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI):
Similarly to previous weeks, during week 49/2013 almost all of the European countries reporting qualitative indicators indicated low influenza activity and mainly stable trends, with predominantly no or sporadic influenza activity.

During week 49/2013, consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) remained below the national baselines or at pre-season levels in all countries reporting clinical data except for the Republic of Moldova.

Hospital surveillance for SARI
The number of SARI hospitalisations was similar to previous weeks during week 49/2013. It remained at interseason levels in reporting countries participating in hospital surveillance for SARI in the WHO European Region.

Similarly to previous weeks, none of the 123 SARI samples collected in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine tested positive for influenza during week 49/2013.

Since week 40/2013, Ireland, France, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have reported 30 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in total, with 11 being influenza B, 7 A(H1N1)pdm09, 1 A(H3) and 11 type A not subtyped.

This summary clearly indicates that the winter influenza season has not yet begun in Europe. No significantly novel strains of influenza virus have appeared, and it is likely that the current winter influenza vaccine will be effective. - Mod.CP]
