An additional human H9N2 avian influenza case was reported in Mainland China. According to officials, the case was reported in a 2 year-old boy from Changde City, Hunan Province. This is the 7th case reported in China in 2018.

In most human cases of H9N2 avian flu, the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.

[A total of 7 human cases of avian Influenza A/H9N2 is a cause for concern. Every animal to human transmission event of non-human viruses provides potential for re-assortment events and possible emergence of strains that can transmit easily between humans.

The continued surveillance of circulating seasonal influenza viruses is essential to evaluate any evolutionary changes early and determine the annual vaccine composition accordingly. At the same time surveillance for novel or avian/swine strains in animals as well as human cases can help in early detection and response to prevent further spread. - Mod.UBA
