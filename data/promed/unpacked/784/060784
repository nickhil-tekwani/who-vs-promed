[Let us be reminded that just after New Year, swine carcasses were
found in Lomonosovskiy rayon of St Petersburg. On 8 Jan 2011, 8 more
swine carcasses were found on a private farm in the St Petersburg
settlement of Volodarskiy. All these cases were confirmed by
Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human
Welfare) to be due to ASF. See ProMED-RUS report 20110110.124904 (in

Videoconference devoted to eradication of new ASF outbreaks in the
territory of the Russian Federation [RF] held at the initiative of
Elena Skrynnik, RF, Minister of Agriculture
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A live videoconference was held between Moscow and Heads of
Administrations of Agro-Industrial Complex and veterinary services of
the Leningrad and Rostov Oblasts [regions], Stavropol Krai
[territory], and St Petersburg -- regions where ASF outbreaks had
been detected earlier and recently.

New ASF outbreaks were detected on 29 Dec 2010 in the Lomonosovskiy
Rayon [district], Leningrad Oblast, on 9 Jan 2011 in St Petersburg,
and on 2 Jan 2011 in the Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon, Stavropol Krai.

As Elena Skrynnik noted, at the present time it is necessary to take
anti epidemic measures aimed at eradication of further spread of ASF
and to enhance measures aimed at prevention of occurrence of this
dangerous animal disease.

According to the protocol decision signed by the Minister following
the videoconference, the executive authorities of St Petersburg, the
Stavropol Krai, and the Leningradskaya Oblast recommend the following:

- to take prompt measures aimed at containment of ASF outbreaks, to
find out the reasons for inefficiency of the work aimed at prevention
of introduction and spread of the ASF virus, establishment and
elimination of reasons for incomplete fulfillment of the
recommendations given by the Ministry of Agriculture of Russia, the
Rosselkhoznadzor and the Interdepartmental Commission on Prevention
of ASF Spread through the Territory of the Russian Federation;
- to enhance the control of registration and movements of pigs in
private backyards and farms in the territory of the Stavropol Krai,
to take all the necessary measures aimed at prompt transfer of these
categories of holdings to alternative livestock farming trends other
than pig breeding (cattle breeding, sheep breeding, poultry breeding);
- taking into account the special status of St Petersburg (border
seaport city, transit transport hub) and the economic importance of
this region, to ban keeping and breeding of pigs in holdings of all
types and in private backyards within the limits of St Petersburg;
- to take measures aimed at assurance of timely disposal of
biological wastes, first in cases of pig deaths (including those from
ASF), to assign administrative territories to disposal plants, to
develop a mechanism of notification of economic entities about their
assignment to biowaste disposal plants, to ensure notification of
people and businessmen;
- to promptly forward materials on facts of dead pigs' detections in
the Leningrad Oblast and occurrence of ASF outbreaks in St Petersburg
and the Stavropol Krai to internal affairs bodies and the General
Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation;
- to ensure notification of people through mass media about
imposition of administrative and criminal sanctions on persons found
responsible for actions (non-action) that caused occurrence of ASF
outbreaks and ASF spread;
- to ensure work of 24-hour guard quarantine posts along the
automobile roads going out of the affected ASF districts of St Petersburg;
- to adopt in the Leningradskaya Oblast a regulatory act forbidding
keeping pigs in private backyards and pig producing farms with
non-compliant closed operation mode and in the Tosnenskiy,
Gatchinskiy, Luzhskiy Rayons of Leningrad Oblast and in the zone
within a radius of 5 km [3 mi] from Federal Roads M-10, M-18, and
M-20 in the territory of other rayons of Leningrad Oblast before the
situation due to ASF spread improves;
- to notify the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation
[RF] about the measures performed before 1 Feb 2011.

On the whole, the RF Subjects should ensure strict observance of the
recommendations given earlier by the Ministry of Agriculture of
Russia, the Rosselkhoznadzor and the Interdepartmental Commission
concerning in particular the monitoring of ASF situation in domestic
pigs and wild boars, provision of close confinement of pigs in
private backyards and farms, work of large pig breeding plants in
closed operation mode, detection and prevention of illegal movement
of pigs, porcine products and feeds for animals by all kinds of transport.

In addition, executive bodies of the RF Subjects should ensure
notification of people of the ASF hazard level and its potential
impart, actions of animal owners in cases of ASF suspicion through mass media.

According to departmental statistics, 59 ASF-affected sites were
registered in the territory of the Southern and the North-Caucasian
Federal Districts in 2010. 50 000 pigs were destroyed in the
Rostovskaya Oblast in 2010. The sum of compensations for the seizure
of population was more than 168 million rubles [about 5.6 million USD].

Taking into account the gravity of the situation and the possible
economic damage done to the domestic pig breeding industry, the
Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation has developed a
draft Federal target program aimed at ASF eradication in the
territory of the Russian Federation.

According to the Minister, implementation of the program will allow
us not only to minimize the risks in the livestock industry but will
contribute to strengthening of food safety in the country.

[A presentation (in Russian) on the 2010 ASF situation in Russia is
appended to the protocol above and can be seen at
<http://fsvps.ru/fsvps-docs/ru/iac/2011/files/asf_2011.pdf>

The declared intentions of the Russian authorities are far-reaching,
in particular the plan to eliminate the keeping and breeding of pigs
in holdings of all types and in private backyards within several
given regions. The Russian government will need very significant
financial and technical means, as well as political powers, in their
efforts to achieve such goals. - Mod.AS]
