The recently reported concurrent outbreaks of _Shigella sonnei_
infections in Denmark (1) and Australia (2) have been found to be
linked to a common baby corn packing house in Thailand via trace-back
of the distribution chain. Distribution records indicated that 3
additional countries received affected product from the implicated
Thai packing house during the period of potential contamination.
These countries were notified through the World Health Organization's
International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN). Associated
cases of _S. sonnei_ have not been reported in these 3 countries.
Denmark
-------
In Denmark, 218 cases of laboratory-confirmed _S. sonnei_ infection
were reported to the Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen between 1 Aug
and 30 Sep 2007. During investigations, 12 cases reported recent
foreign travel, 2 had an alternative exposure and 3 were deemed to be
secondary cases and were therefore excluded, leaving 201 primary
domestic cases. Of the 201 primary cases, the median age was 38 years
old (range 2-92 years), and 150 cases (75 percent) were female.
Symptom onset dates, which ranged from 6 Aug - 20 Aug 2007, were
available for 94 cases (Figure 1 [for figure, see original URL. -
Mod. LL]). The last recorded onset date (20 Aug 2007) in Denmark was
no more than 3 days after the recall of the implicated product on 17 Aug 2007.
Australia
---------
In Australia, a total of 12 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported,
all of whom acquired their infection in the state of Queensland. This
included 2 residents of the state of Victoria and one from New
Zealand. The onset of illness among all cases was between 9 and 27 Aug 2007.
Food analysis
-------------
Microbiological examination of the suspected batches of imported baby
corn in Denmark detected various serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_
and high levels of _Escherichia coli_, indicating fecal
contamination. _Shigella spp._ were not detected, suggesting that
contamination levels were low. Australia was unable to test the
implicated batch of corn, but did detect greater than 100
colony-forming units of _E. coli_ per gram in 25 gram samples from
other batches from the same importer.
Conclusion
----------
Baby corn was implicated in the Danish outbreak following case
reports of baby corn consumption and baby corn being found to be
significantly associated with illness in a cohort study (1). The
possibility that the outbreaks might be linked was raised by the
Australian public health authorities following the publication of the
Danish outbreak strain's antibiotic resistance pattern (1). This was
further reinforced when isolates from Denmark and Australia were
found to display indistinguishable PFGE patterns. As well as the
report in Eurosurveillance, international awareness of the outbreak
and the outbreak strain was raised via numerous international
networks, such as the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) and Rapid
Alert System for Food and Feed (RASSF) of the European Union,
Enternet, Pulsenet Europe, Pulsenet US, Pulsenet Asia, and INFOSAN.
This outbreak highlights the importance of timely international
communications in helping to identify when a contaminated food enters
international trade and results in human illness.

[Many varieties of corn <http://ask.yahoo.com/20030203.html> can be
used to produce baby corn. Seed companies offer special types of seed
to grow baby corn, but all of these grow plants and corn ears that
are just as big as the usual corn. The secret is in the harvesting.
Baby corn ears are picked by hand immediately when the silks emerge
from the ear tips or a few days after. Corn matures quickly, so the
harvest must be timed carefully to avoid ending up with normal corn
ears. Baby corn ears are generally 4.5 cm to 10 cm (approx. 2-4 in)
in length and 7 mm to 17 mm (0.3-0.7 in) in diameter.
Most baby corn commercially available is grown and processed in Asia,
particularly in Thailand. Because baby corn must be picked by hand,
it is too labor-intensive for most western farms. It has been an
extremely important crop in Thailand since 1976, and other Asian
nations have also begun producing and exporting it. Perhaps this is
why baby corn is so often found in Asian recipes. - Mod.LL]
