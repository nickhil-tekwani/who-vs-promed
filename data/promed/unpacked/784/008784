[re: ProMED-mail Rickettsiosis - Mexico: (Michoacan) 20111231.3724]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the rickettsiosis reported in Michoacan could represent Rocky
Mountain spotted fever, the extent and location of this outbreak
suggests a diagnosis of endemic [murine] typhus. In the following
graph, I've compared the incidences of these 2 diseases in Mexico:

In fact, 6 rickettsiae (including _Coxiella burnetii_, a related
taxon) are reported in Mexico. The following summary is abstracted
from Gideon http://www.gideononline.com) and references 1-3 (primary
references available on request).

_Rickettsia felis_:
-_R. felis_ infection was first identified in the Yucatan in 1996,
where the organism has subsequently been identified in both humans and
fleas.
- Infected fleas have also been recovered from flying squirrels in
Mexico.
- 4 cases were documented in the Yucatan to 2006.
- 8 cases (3 fatal) of "spotted fevers" were reported in the Yucatan
during 2006 to 2007.
Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 20 percent of _Ctenocephalides felis_ fleas in Yucatan (2002
publication)
Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 5 percent of healthy persons in Yucatan (1999).

Epidemic typhus (_R. prowazekii_):
- 7353 fatal cases of epidemic typhus were reported during 1893 to
1907.
- 1220 cases (707 fatal) were reported during 1939 to 1943.
- The average incidence during 1959 to 1961 was 146 cases per year.
- 64 cases (14 fatal) were reported during 1960 to 1963.
- A total of 3 outbreaks were reported during the 1980s, 2 in Chiapas
and 1 in Mexico State.
Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 0 percent of body lice from prisoners and homeless persons in Mexico
City (2009 publication)
Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 1951: an outbreak (737 fatal cases) was reported.
- 1966: an outbreak (10 cases, 0 fatal) was reported in Zoyatlan de
Juarez.
- 1966 to 1967: an outbreak (18 cases, 3 fatal) was reported in Minas
Viejas (Mexico State).
- 1967: an outbreak (40 cases, 1 fatal) in Atlacomulco, Mexico State,
originated from a patient with Brill-Zinsser [recurrent form of
epidemic typhus] disease.
- 1983: an outbreak (102 cases, 0 fatal) was reported in Mexico State

Endemic typhus (_R. typhi_):
- Endemic typhus is reported in Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Mexico,
Michoacan, Nayarit, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro, Tamaulipas,
Yucatan, and Zacatecas states.
Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 14 percent to 17 percent of blood donors in Mexico City (2004
publication).

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (_R. rickettsii_):
- In Mexico, this disease is known as 'fiebre manchada'.
- During 1930 to 1950, cases were reported from Coahuila, Durango, San
Luis Potosi, Sinaloa, and Sonora.
- Rocky Mountain spotted fever has been identified in the Yucatan
since 2005.
- Cases continue to occur in Sonora as of 2010.
- Mexico's 1st fatal case was reported in the southwestern region in
2004.
- 52 cases were reported in Baja California during February to July
2009.
Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 40 percent of patients suspected of having dengue (Yucatan and
Jalisco, 1993)
Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 5.6 percent of persons in rural Yucatan are seropositive toward
spotted fever-group rickettsiae (possibly the _R. akari_ group, 1999
publication)
Vectors
-------
- The local vector is _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_.
- Spotted fever-group rickettsiae have also been isolated from
_Amblyomma cajennense_ in Veracruz.
- _Amblyomma imitator_ has been identified as a potential vector in
Nuevo Leon.
Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 2009: an outbreak (4 fatal cases) was reported in Baja California.

Rickettsialpox (_R. akari_):
- 2 cases of rickettsialpox were documented in Yucatan in 2008.
- Evidence of canine infection has been reported in Yucatan (2009
publication).

Q fever (_C. burnetii_):
Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 2 percent of humans, 2 percent of cattle, and 6 percent of goats and
sheep (1952).
- 1.46 percent of cows (1950)
- 28 percent of the dairy cattle, 10 percent of beef cattle, 35
percent of goats, and 40 percent of sheep (Nuevo Leon, 2002
publication).
