Virginia's 2018 mosquito season is proving to be one of the worst in years, animal health officials said as they encouraged owners to ensure their horses' EEE and WNV vaccines are up to date.

Recent deluges of rain have created stagnant pools of water perfect for mosquito breeding, while cooler temperatures have helped to slow the maturation of larvae, delaying the pests' season this year [2018]. "Now it has hit in full force, and horses are at risk of contracting mosquito-borne diseases such as eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile virus (WNV)," said Charles Broaddus, DVM, Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS).

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2-3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80% among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurological problems.

Clinical signs for WNV, also transmitted by bites from infected mosquitoes, include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia; changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it;" occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rates can be as high as 30-40%.

There is no cure for either disease; however, veterinarians can help horses recover with supportive care in some cases.

The VDACS is encouraging horse owners to check with their veterinarians and if she or he recommends vaccination, the time to do it is now. "Both the WNV and EEE vaccine are highly effective in minimizing disease, if given appropriately," said Broaddus.

Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually, one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

Humans cannot become infected with EEE or WNV by handling an infected horse, nor can a horse acquire the virus directly from another infected horse. The presence of an infected horse in the area indicates that mosquitoes carrying the EEE or WNV viruses are present, however, and those insects pose a threat to both humans and horses.

[Eastern equine encephalitis is not as common in Virginia as it is in Florida, but it is still a lethal infection for horses. Owners must not procrastinate. Compared to the social and economic values of a horse, the vaccination is extremely cheap with a high benefit cost ratio, to be academic. But who wants their beloved horse to die? West Nile virus, like eastern equine encephalitis, is preventable by a vaccine, as mentioned in the article. The 2 are usually in combination, so it is only a single injection to prevent these diseases. Injection needs to be given at an initial time and again about 21-30 days later. It should then be given annually or every 6 months, depending upon your location or the recommendation of your veterinarian. - Mod.MHJ
