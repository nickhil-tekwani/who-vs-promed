A striped dolphin (_Stenella coeruleoalba_) stranded in Tarragona on 7 Sep 2016 was confirmed to have cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) disease.

It was a juvenile female (180 cm long, 47 kg). The dolphin showed abnormal swimming, and bradypnoea (1 breath/min). It died few hours after stranding. A necropsy was performed at the Veterinary School of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. The dolphin had broncho-interstitial pneumonia and lymphoid cell depletion in lymph nodes, with presence of syncytial cells and viral inclusions (both in nucleus as well as in cytoplasm), and mild, multifocal encephalitis.

Morbillivirus infection was detected by immunohistochemistry in lung, brain and lymphoid organs. Therefore, a systemic CeMV disease was diagnosed, which implies circulation of CeMV in the striped dolphin population, after an epidemiological silence of 9 years. For the moment, an increase of the basal mortality of this species has not been noted in the area.

This diagnosis was performed under the framework of the Catalonian Government's program for surveillance of marine mammal mortality.

[Special thanks to Dr. Mariano Domingo for kindly providing more information on the episode.

Viruses in the morbillivirus genus, Paramyxoviridae family, are enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses known to infect 3 mammalian orders: primates, carnivores and Cetartiodactyla (previously separated as 2 orders, Cetacea and Artiodactyla).

Several dolphin die-offs have been attributed to this pathogen in the Mediterranean Sea since 1990. An acute form of the disease appears to occur during the die-offs, but following the outbreaks, unusual MV infections affecting only the central nervous system were reported.

According to Guardo (Front Microbiol. 2012; 3: 431), several cases of chronic infection by dolphin morbillivirus (DMV or CeMV) sharing striking features in common with human measles virus-related "subacute sclerosing panencephalitis" (SSP), as well as with canine distemper virus-related "old dog encephalitis" (ODE), have been recently described in Mediterranean dolphins. Indeed, these DMV-infected cetaceans showed immunohistochemical and/or biomolecular evidence of morbilliviral antigen and/or genome exclusively in their brain tissue, similarly to what reported in SSP-affected patients and ODE-affected dogs. - Mod.PMB
