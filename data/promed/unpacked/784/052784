Chinese health authorities report a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in an 81-year-old female farmer from Changzhou of Jiangsu Province.

The individual had exposure to live chickens at home prior to developing symptoms on [16 Nov 2020]. She was hospitalized and subsequently passed away on [27 Nov 2020].

From 2014 to date, 25 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Chinese health authorities.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.

The clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.

The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.

People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

The Centre for Health Protection is closely monitoring a new case of human infection with avian influenza [AI] H5N6 in the Mainland. The patient was an 81-year-old female farmer in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province. Before she developed symptoms on [16 Nov 2020], she had contact with live chickens at home and died on [27 Nov 2020] after admission.

The spokesperson said that since 2014, the Mainland health authorities have reported a total of 25 cases of human infection with avian influenza H5N6, reminding the public to avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets, or farms if they go to the Mainland or other affected areas. If you return to Hong Kong from the affected area, you should seek medical advice immediately if you develop symptoms.

[China's 1st H5N6 strain was isolated in March 2014 from a domestic duck in Guangdong Province. Since then, the H5 subtype has gradually become the main cause of the sporadic AIV infections in poultry in southern China. To date, a total of 24 laboratory-confirmed cases (excluding the case above) of human infection with influenza A(H5N6) virus, including 7 deaths at the time of the IHR (International Health Regulations) report, have been reported to WHO from China since 2014 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20201204.pdf)

Epidemiological investigations have confirmed that most cases of H5N6 human infection had contact with infected poultry. Live poultry markets (LPMs) and backyard poultry flocks (BPFs) are 2 major risk factors for human infections. It had also been noticed that in many provinces, human infections of AIVs decreased gradually after closing LPMs.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected.

With continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.

Surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of the viruses. For more information on confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) virus reported to WHO, visit http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/en/.
