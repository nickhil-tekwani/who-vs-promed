A health alarm has been raised in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh where
38 people have died of suspected Japanese encephalitis [JE] in an adjoining
district of capital Lucknow since the beginning of this year [2009], a
senior government official said on Saturday [9 May 2009]. "We suspect 38
people have died of Japanese encephalitis in Maharajganj district. Other
districts may also get affected," deputy chief of health in the state LP
Rawat told media. "Moreover, over 170 people are undergoing treatment in
hospitals in the district."

Japanese encephalitis is a disease caused by the mosquito-borne Japanese
encephalitis virus from the family _Flaviviridae_. Domestic pigs and wild
birds are reservoirs of the virus while transmission to humans may cause
severe symptoms.

[The Indian state of Uttar Pradesh is endemic for JE virus. At this point
one cannot determine if the 39 cases represent the beginning of a seasonal
outbreak, or if there will be few or sporadic cases throughout the JE virus
transmission season instead. It is not clear if the 170 hospitalized
individuals had symptoms suggestive of JE virus infection or not. This
situation bears watching, and ProMED-mail would appreciate additional
information, especially laboratory confirmation (or not) of the 38 fatal
cases and the 170 hospitalized individuals.

JE is a serious public health problem in Asia, with 30 000-50 000 cases
annually. Many JE virus infections are subclinical. The case fatality rate
is 30 per cent and 30 per cent of those surviving clinical disease suffer
neurological sequelae (see the US CDC fact sheet at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/jencephalitis/facts.htm>).
