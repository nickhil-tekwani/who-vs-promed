The Iowa Department of Natural Resources reports 36 positive chronic wasting disease (CWD) tests from some 5000 deer samples this hunting season.

The DNR's Tyler Harms, who oversees the deer management program, says 2 new counties were added to the list of counties in which CWD has been detected in the wild. Greene County in central Iowa and Fremont County in southwest Iowa brings the total number of counties to 12.

CWD was first detected in Iowa in 2013 with 72 cases in Allamakee County in northeast Iowa, the most cases in any one county in any year since. The 2nd most were 29 CWD cases in neighboring Clayton County in 2016. Ten cases were detected in Winneshiek County and 2 in Fayette County in 2019.

Harms says, overall for the state there's been a 2% prevalence rate of CWD out of the 5000 samples, which is about what the DNR expected. He adds the goal is to keep that prevalence as low as possible.

Harms encourages deer hunters to keep hunting and keep submitting samples for testing and to properly dispose of the deer carcasses to help prevent the spread of the disease. He adds that the general public can also help by not putting out feed for deer, noting that CWD is spread via direct contact between individual animals.

A deer found in Warren County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks [MDWFP] announced Thursday [30 Dec 2021].

The mature buck was reported to MDWFP in mid-December [2021] as potentially diseased given its drastically emaciated and lethargic condition. It was found approximately 4 mi [6.4 km] north of Vicksburg and 4.5 mi [7.2 km] south of where the 1st CWD-positive white-tailed deer was detected in Mississippi, in Issaquena County, in 2018.

The sample is considered "suspect positive" through initial testing and will be sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, for final confirmation.

[There appears now to be a 2nd CWD case in Warren County as of 1 Feb 2022.

Two white-tailed deer in Waukesha County have tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), according to the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. The farm they were raised in is under quarantine.

CWD is a neurological disease caused by an infection. It can be contagious, which is why the 9-acre farm is being quarantined. Farm-raised deer are generally used for their antlers, venison, pelts, and more.

CWD is normally tested in animals after they have already died.

Wildlife officials are alerting people to a diseased deer killed in Floyd County this hunting season.

On Tuesday [8 Mar 2022], the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources released its chronic wasting disease surveillance results for the 2021-2022 hunting season. In Virginia, a total of 134 deer from 11 counties have tested positive for the disease since 2009.

This incurable disease, found in deer, elk, and moose in North America, is a slow and progressive neurologic disease ultimately resulting in death of the animal. The disease-causing agent is spread through the urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals.

In CWD Disease Management (DMA) Area 3, which comprises Floyd, Montgomery, and Pulaski counties, of the 1259 deer tested, 2 tested positive for the disease: one in Montgomery County and the other in Floyd County.

A 3rd deer, sampled by a cooperator located in DMA3, was determined to be infected with CWD; however, the location of harvest for this animal was not able to be confirmed.

Because of the new CWD detection in Floyd County, the Department of Wildlife Resources is expanding that DMA to include Carroll County.

Officials said the diseased deer found in Floyd County was about 5 mi [8 km] from the 2020 Montgomery County detection, and less than 10 mi [16 km] from Carroll County.

["Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Since its discovery in 1967, CWD has spread geographically and increased in prevalence locally. CWD is contagious; it can be transmitted freely within and among cervid populations. No treatments or vaccines are currently available.

"Chronic wasting disease is of great concern to wildlife managers. It has been detected in at least 23 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and South Korea. CWD is not known to infect livestock or humans.

"CWD is transmitted directly through animal-to-animal contact, and indirectly through contact with objects or environment contaminated with infectious material (including saliva, urine, feces, and carcasses of CWD-infected animals)."
