Two prisoners at the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers [city in the state of Connecticut, USA] have tested positive for legionnaires disease, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of Correction confirmed.

The rare disease, which causes lung infections, was first confirmed in 2 prisoners from the medium-security unit while they were undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital, according to Karen Martucci, a DOC spokeswoman. Both individuals were treated and returned to the prison, she said. Martucci confirmed the positive tests in an email on Monday [17 Oct 2021]. She did not say when prison officials first learned of the outbreak.

"The Department of Correction is working closely with the Department of Public Health (DPH), following CDC recommendations to protect the health and safety of the incarcerated population and staff at the Osborn facility," Martucci said in an email.

Legionnaires' disease is caused by a bacterium that can grow in large water systems such as heating and cooling units and is typically spread through water droplets in the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the disease can be treated with antibiotics, it is fatal in about 10 percent of cases.

As part of the prison's remediation efforts, Martucci said officials moved the population of prisoners from the affected area. Because the prisoners were moved, Martucci said there was no need to distribute bottled water.

Martucci did not say whether prison officials have determined the source of the illnesses.

[_Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Debilitated patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described [Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L. pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Somers (population, 11 444 in 2010 ) is a town in Tolland County, Connecticut, located 13 miles (21 km) southeast of the city of Springfield, Massachusetts and 22 miles (35 km) northeast of the city of Hartford, Connecticut (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somers,_Connecticut).
