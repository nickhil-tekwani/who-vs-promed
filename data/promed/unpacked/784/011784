The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of Norh Kivu and Ituri dated 13 Jun 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 2120, of which 2026 are confirmed and 94 are probable.
- In total, there were 1420 deaths (1326 confirmed and 94 probable) and 588 people cured.
- 322 suspected cases under investigation;
- 12 new confirmed cases, including 5 in Mabalako, 3 in Biena, 2 in Kalunguta, 1 in Rwampara, and 1 in Mandima;
- 9 new deaths of confirmed cases: 2 community deaths in Biena; 7 deaths at CTEs, including 4 in Beni and 3 in Mabalako; and 3 new cures out of ETCs: 2 in Mabalako and 1 in Butembo.

News
Meeting of the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations

- The meeting of the Emergency Committee for International Health Regulations, convened by the director-general of WHO, was held on Fri 14 Jun 2019. The committee concluded that the Ebola outbreak in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri did not constitute a public health emergency of international concern, although it constitutes a health emergency for the Democratic Republic of Congo.
- The committee noted that epidemiological trends are evolving positively in the Butembo and Katwa epicentres. However, the response is beginning to face challenges related to community acceptance and security in areas such as Mabalako where the epidemic has resumed recently. On the other hand, the response continues to be limited by the lack of adequate funding and limited human resources.
- The committee commended the communication and collaboration between the DRC and Uganda that rapidly contained the Ebola cases that crossed the border. Uganda's rapid response proves the importance of preparing border countries for DRC.
- After lengthy discussions, the committee considered that the criteria for declaring a public health emergency of international concern were not fulfilled. The committee considered that all public health measures and recommendations needed to end the epidemic were already being implemented by WHO and the affected countries.

[2] Outbreak summary
Thu 13 Jun 2019. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO: Disease outbreak news, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/13-june-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to show a decrease in the number of new cases in hotspots such as Katwa, Beni, and Kalunguta health zones. However, in other areas such as Mabalako and Butembo, moderate rates of transmission continue.

With ongoing EVD transmission within communities in 12 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, factors such as persistent delays in case detection, approximately a third of cases dying outside of Ebola treatment or transit centres, and high population mobility pose a high risk of geographical spread both within the DRC and to neighbouring countries. This was highlighted by the recent exportation of cases to Uganda: the 1st confirmed cases detected outside of North Kivu and Ituri provinces since the onset of the outbreak over 10 months ago. For more information, please see Disease Outbreak News on EVD in Uganda.

A weekly decrease in the incidence of new cases have been reported in several health zones; however, an increase or continuation of the outbreak has been observed in others (Figure 1). In the 21 days between 22 May and 11 Jun 2019, 62 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 9% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 212 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (33%, n=69), Butembo (18%, n=39), Katwa (14%, n=30), Mandima (11%, n=23), and Beni (9%, n=20). Single confirmed cases were also reported from Rwampara and Komanda health zones this past week following a prolonged period since the last reported case, with both cases acquiring the infection in the aforementioned hotspots.

As of 11 Jun 2019, a total of 2084 EVD cases, including 1990 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1405 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1311 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2084 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1194) were female, and 29% (605) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 118 (6% of total cases).

[3] WHO Emergency Committee - no PHEIC declared
14 Jun 2019. After Ebola spills into Uganda, WHO decides it's not an emergency
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/14/ebola-uganda-who-no-emergency-declaration/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

The long-running and dangerous Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- which spilled over into neighboring Uganda this week -- is an emergency for the country and a threat to its neighbors but doesn't constitute a global health emergency, the World Health Organization concluded on Friday [14 Jun 2019].

The decision, which quickly garnered criticism in some quarters, was made on the recommendation of a panel of outside experts, called an emergency committee.

Dr. Preben Aavitsland, acting chair of the committee and one of the people who wrote the rules governing public health emergencies of international concern after the 2003 SARS outbreak, said there was extensive debate within the group, but in the end they agreed the declaration was not needed and could worsen the situation on the ground.

"This is not a global emergency. It's an emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a severe emergency. And it may affect neighboring countries," said Aavitsland, a senior physician at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

He noted the additional powers that come with an emergency declaration are not needed at this time. It allows the WHO to disclose to other countries information about a disease event even if the country experiencing the outbreak doesn't wish to share. And it gives the WHO director-general authority to issue temporary recommendations, effectively instructing other countries not to cut off trade and travel with the affected nation.

In previous instances when a public health emergency of international concern -- called PHEIC for short -- has been declared, the WHO's recommendations on travel and trade have sometimes been ignored. Countries have interpreted the declaration as a threat. Many, for instance, stopped issuing visas to people from Ebola-affected countries during the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. And most international airlines stopped flying into those countries.

"So it was the view of the committee that there is really nothing to gain by declaring a PHEIC, but there is potentially a lot to lose," Aavitsland said.

The WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, on Friday [14 Jun 2019], accepted the committee's recommendation.

"Although the outbreak does not at this time pose a global health threat, I want to emphasize that for the affected families and communities, this outbreak is very much an emergency," said Tedros, as he is known. He will travel Saturday [15 Jun 2019] to Butembo, one of the recent transmission hot spots and a place where attacks on Ebola response team workers have occurred.

Some global health experts have been calling for months for this outbreak to be declared a PHEIC. The lack of such a declaration is potentially depriving the Ebola response of badly needed assistance and donor cash, they have argued.

The latter is badly needed. The WHO said the response has been hampered by a lack of funding; the agency currently has a USD 54 million funding gap for this work. Efforts to prepare neighboring countries for cross-border spread, for instance, has not proceeded at the pace it ought to because funding for the work isn't there, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program, which is leading the response in conjunction with the DRC ministry of health.

Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said the declaration of a PHEIC might have helped on the funding front and would have generated more attention globally for the outbreak.

"I don't think it should change one iota of what we do" to curtail spread of the virus, he said. "But we live in a political world, and we live in a world of communication."

[The recent incursion of Ebola cases from DRC into Uganda prompted the 3rd WHO Emergency Committee meeting since the current DRC outbreak began last spring, but this "spillover" event thus far appears controlled by available resources in Uganda, and thus the committee again stopped short of calling a PHEIC. For full meeting details, see the official statement available at https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/14-06-2019-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-for-ebola-virus-disease-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo.

[4] Merck to make more Ebola vaccine
Fri 14 Jun 2019. Merck to make more Ebola vaccine
[Devex, abridged, edited]
https://www.devex.com/news/merck-to-make-more-ebola-vaccine-who-declines-to-declare-global-emergency-95114
[Byline: Jenny Lei Ravelo]

Merck announced it would produce an estimated 450 000 additional doses of experimental Ebola vaccine, just after the 1st cross-border case was confirmed to have spread to Uganda from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

"Merck has determined with the U.S. Government, WHO, and others that additional vaccine supply would benefit overall public health preparedness, both to support the current DRC outbreak and for preparedness against any new Ebola . . . outbreak(s) that might occur," Pamela Eisele, product, pipeline, and supply media relations at Merck, told Devex in an email, just days after the 1st case of Ebola was reported in Uganda. Eisele said the decision was made "recently."

Just last week [week of Mon 3 Jun 2019), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert Redfield raised concerns that responders may run out of the investigational Ebola vaccine, currently the only one used in the DRC response outbreak.

"Unfortunately, there's going to be a 6-12-month lag before there's adequate vaccine supply, so we do project that we are going to run out of vaccine," he said in testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives.

Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies program, said in a press conference on Friday [14 Jun 2019] that there are "a quarter of a million doses" of Ebola experimental vaccines ready to ship, and a further 100 000 doses by the end of the year [2019]. While adjustments on vaccine dose usage has been made to double its reach, WHO welcomes Merck's decision to produce more from its plant in West Point, Pennsylvania.

To aid Uganda in its response, meanwhile, WHO flew in 4000 doses of the vaccine, and the DRC health ministry donated 400 doses of its own stock to the country, according to a news release issued on Thursday [13 Jun 2019] by Uganda minister of health Jane Aceng.

Merck declined to provide specific numbers of its current stockpile. "We do not give out specific numbers at any given point in time, because it fluctuates. The stockpile, as with any vaccine stockpile, is inherently dynamic: numbers change due to shipments, expiry, and replenishment," Eisele said.

But she said that in addition to the currently available supply, Merck would produce an estimated 450 000 additional doses of investigational V920 that should be available "in about 12 [plus or minus] months."

"This new supply is intended to help offer continuity in preparedness, inform future planning by WHO and others, and serve as a bridge until V920 is licensed and our manufacturing facility is operational and producing commercially labeled doses," she added.

The company is still waiting for validation to operate its German facility, where it expected to continue production of the vaccine. Getting the facility up and running remains a top priority for the company so it can have a "more sustainable supply" of the vaccine," Eisele said.

The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on Friday [14 Jun 2019] recommended countries put in place the necessary approvals for investigational therapeutics as part of their preparedness measures. The committee, which was reconvened by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to review the Ebola outbreak, also recommended that vaccine strategies that have "maximum impact on curtailing the outbreak . . . be implemented rapidly."

[These additional Merck vaccine doses are certainly welcome and needed for the current ring vaccination strategies, but if contact tracing efforts falter to the point that ring vaccination is no longer adequate to help control this Ebola outbreak, then millions of vaccine doses would be needed for broader community-wide vaccination campaigns. - Mod.LXL]

[5] African Union: Africa CDC response
13 Jun 2019. Update on African Union Actions in Response to Recent Ebola Outbreaks
[African Union press release, abridged, edited]
https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20190613/update-african-union-actions-response-recent-ebola-outbreaks

Following the recent outbreak of Ebola cases reported in Uganda, the African Union (AU) is collaborating with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Uganda to mobilise support to ensure adequate response and implementation of prevention and control measures, including deployment of senior experts from the AU's Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).

Africa CDC teams are also currently deployed to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and have been involved in implementing key interventions in partnership with the government and other partners.

Summary of Africa CDC activities in the DRC:

1. Deployment of public health experts
Africa CDC deployed 41 experts, both at national and regional level, who have been involved in contact tracing, immunization, data management, and training of local health workers and partner staff. The following experts were also involved in mass sensitisation, public education, and coordination with partners:
- epidemiologists: 17
- infection prevention and control specialists: 8
- laboratory scientists: 4
- anthropologist: 1
- communication experts: 3
- data manager: 1
- logistician: 1
- central support team: 4
- national coordination team: 2

2. Provision of laboratory services
- Africa CDC provided laboratory diagnosis services in 6 health zones.
- 6 GeneXpert Machines with more than 3000 cartridges
- laboratories in Goma and Butembo entirely equipped and run by Africa CDC
- improved lab capacity and turn-around time of lab results in the field area

3. Contact tracing and surveillance
- Africa CDC is fully responsible for surveillance and alert investigation in Butembo and Tshomia health zones.
- 17 epidemiologists and 8 infection prevention experts were involved in active case and contact search and follow-up in the villages.
- investigating alerts reports in the community and providing reports for follow-up action
- close monitoring of field operations and support to field missions

4. Infection prevention and control
- trained 469 health workers, traditional healers, and teachers
- provide personal protection equipment (PPEs) to 13 health centres and hospital
- evaluated the state of hygiene in several health centres, training health workers, supporting schools, and churches by providing facilities of washing hands
- A training video on how to correctly wash hands was produced by both the IPC and communication team and was broadcasted on the national television and others national private media institutions.

5. Port-of-entry screening
- Africa CDC is supporting port-of-entry screening training in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, and to date, a total of 350 people have been trained.
- A cumulative total of 770 alerts were notified, of which 320 were validated, 9 of which were confirmed to be EVD following laboratory testing.

6. Vaccinations
- Africa CDC worked with the Ministry of Health DRC, the World Health Organisation (WHO), and other partners to vaccinate 104 342 people in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.

[It is highly encouraging that the Africa CDC is playing an active role, thus far largely unpublicized, in helping to control the Ebola outbreak in the DRC. The experience and knowledge -- of language, culture, history, and not just healthcare -- contributed by experts and workers from other African countries is particularly welcome at a time when the role of other foreign and international agencies such as the U.S. CDC, charitable medical foundations, and even Medecins Sans Frontiers has been limited or curtailed in the DRC for any number of reasons. Although African Union medical teams were deployed and very active during the 2014-2015 West African Ebola epidemic, this is the 1st such AU effort coordinated through the Africa CDC, which was only recently (in 2017) founded (see https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/stories/africa-cdc.html).
