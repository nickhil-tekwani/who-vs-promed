The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Tuesday [15 Oct 2013] urged the public to avoid eating uncooked food in order to reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis A.

With 117 cases reported as of Mon 12 Oct 2013, Taiwan has seen a 4-year high for infections of the disease, which is spread through contact with unhygienic sources, said CDC official Liu Ting-ping. For comparison, Taiwan saw 96 cases in all of 2012, 104 in 2011, and 110 in 2010. Since 40 percent of this year's [2013] patients have a habit of eating raw food, mostly seafood, the CDC recommended either avoiding raw food entirely or choosing to dine at restaurants with higher standards of hygiene.

The disease is usually contracted from consuming food or water contaminated with the hepatitis A virus, Liu cautioned, and the majority of younger people in Taiwan have not built up an immunity to the disease because they have grown up under improved sanitation. Foods that pose higher risks include raw oysters, shellfish and other seafood, as well as frozen blueberries, raspberries, dried tomatoes and uncooked vegetables, she added.

The mortality rate for hepatitis A is low, at around 0.1 percent, and a person will become immune to the disease after being infected once, according to the CDC. But the risk of death increases with age and for carriers of hepatitis B and patients with hepatitis C, all of whom are more likely to develop acute liver failure after contracting hepatitis A, Liu added.

While food hygiene can help prevent the spread of the disease, people with no immunity to hepatitis A can reduce the risk of infection further by getting vaccinated, the CDC said.

[Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. The disease is closely associated with a lack of safe water, inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality.

Hepatitis A virus is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne infection. Hepatitis A viruses persist in the environment and can resist food-production processes routinely used to inactivate and/or control bacterial pathogens. The incubation period of hepatitis A is usually 14-28 days. Symptoms of hepatitis A range from mild to severe and can include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine, and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). Not everyone who is infected will have any or all of the symptoms.

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and may take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Improved sanitation, food safety and immunization are the most effective ways to combat hepatitis A. - Mod.CP
