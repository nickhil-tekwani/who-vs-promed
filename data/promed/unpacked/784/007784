week, 380 new cases with symptoms of dengue were reported, and those people
are undergoing tests.

Dengue Fever Claims 60 Lives in Vietnam
---------------------------------------
HANOI: At least 60 people have died of dengue fever in Vietnam so far this
year, or 17 more deaths than last year, as the disease swept through a vast
region in the country.
As many as 30 198 cases of dengue fever have been registered in Vietnam to
date, a year-on-year rise of 69.2 percent, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported on Tue 30 Oct. In October alone, dengue fever has spread to over
29 cities and provinces with 2408 people suffering from the disease. Most
of these cases were found in the Mekong delta, which has been worst hit by
seasonal flooding.
The last [outbreak of this contagious disease in Vietnam occurred in 1998
[affecting 234 920 people with 377 deaths.

Dengue, control methods - Singapore
------------------------------------
Researchers from Singapore's Ministry of the Environment are looking at a
new method of killing mosquito larvae breeding in stagnant water so as to
reduce the number of people contracting dengue fever outdoors. The method,
which has been used successfully in Vietnam, involves the use of
_Mesocyclops_ sp., which are 1-mm-long water-borne creatures found in
reservoirs and lakes. They reproduce themselves every 3 days and feed off
mosquito larvae, bacteria, and algae.
While dengue is under control in Singapore, the Environment Ministry's
recent study of 1068 children showed that most had been exposed to it
outside their homes. It was also found that 27% of schools and 8% of
construction sites in Singapore are mosquito-breeding grounds. In 1998,
there were 100 cases of dengue fever a week in Singapore, or a total of
about 5200 cases, with one death, but the number fell to an average of 47
cases a week until August 2001.

[I cannot do better than recycle this 1999 comment to the reference at the
top by Moderator Emeritus Charlie Calisher, - Mod.JW: "This is certainly
not the first time that _Mesocyclops_ sp. have been used for mosquito
control. There are some drawbacks, however. First, _Mesocyclops_ sp.
usually can manage to devour only first instar larvae, i.e., small larvae.
Second, _Mesocyclops_ sp. are known intermediary hosts for _Dracunculus
medinensis_, the guinea worm, the etiologic agent of dracunculiasis;
_Vibrio cholerae_, the etiologic agent of cholera; and other
microorganisms. Therefore (third), control of mosquito larvae in anything
but confined containers is unlikely and potentially dangerous.
"Nonetheless, when dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever are as great a
problem as they are in Vietnam, something needs to be tried. - Mod.CHC"
