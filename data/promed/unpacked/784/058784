Request for Assistance: Provision of H5N1 Isolates from Birds and Humans
--------------------------------------------------
[ProMED-mail has received the following request for assistance from
Dr. Vladimir A. Zhukov, Head of the Laboratory for Prediction of
Viral Virulence for Humans, Institute of Aerobiology, SRC Virology &
Biotechnology "Vector", Koltsovo, Novosibirsk rg., 630559, Russia]
Because of the extraordinary situation created by the outbreak of
highly pathogenic avian influenza in East Asia, I am making the
following request for assistance. As Head of the Laboratory for
Prediction of Virus Virulence for Humans at the State Research Center
of Virology and Biotechnology "Vector", Russia, and within the
framework of an investigation funded by DARPA [USA's Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, the central research and development
organization for the Department of Defense], we have developed a
method of prediction of human susceptibility to influenza using data
obtained from in vitro experiments with primary cells from humans.
Results have been presented at several international conferences
(Slovakia, 2000; Atlanta, 2002; Munich, 2003), and publications are
in preparation.
I am [seeking a collaborating laboratory] which has and can
officially supply our Center with live avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus, isolated both from chickens and humans [during the current
outbreak], to [enable us to] estimate the probability of virus
transmission from human to human.
