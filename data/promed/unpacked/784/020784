Ebola still claiming lives as DRC cases climb to 835
----------------------------------------------------
The pace of new Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) slowed slightly last week, though the outbreak's intensity is still moderate, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [14 Feb 2019] in its weekly overview.

Meanwhile, in a daily update today [15 Feb 2019], the DRC's health ministry announced that the virus has likely infected 6 more people, in Katwa [North Kivu] and Komanda [Ituri], and killed 5 more, including an infant.

Community resistance still a factor
-----------------------------------
The WHO said Katwa and Butembo [North Kivu] are still the hot spots, though small widely dispersed clusters continue to be reported. One more health worker infection was reported, an individual in Katwa, raising that number to 68.

On 13 Feb 2019 the DRC's health ministry launched the 3rd phase of its response, which will cover the next 6 months, with the main goals of stopping transmission in North Kivu and Ituri provinces and prevent spread of Ebola to other DRC provinces and neighboring countries. To support the next phase, the WHO, the DRC, and their partners are asking for USD 148 million from the international community.

- Sat 16 Feb 2019. Uganda: negative laboratory results, WHO/AFRO
[WHO/AFRO, abridged, edited]
https://afro.who.int/news/who-obtains-laboratory-results-dead-man-drc-assure-anxious-people-uganda

WHO obtains laboratory results for dead man from DRC to assure anxious people in Uganda
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday [15 Feb 2019] provided scientific evidence assuring national authorities and the general public that the Ebola virus disease (EVD) results of the 46-year-old male who died in DRC and the body repatriated back to Uganda for burial were indeed negative for Ebola [See ProMED-mail Ebola update (18): Congo DR (NK, IT) cases, summaries, vaccine RFI, research 20190215.6319043].

This followed "inconclusive" results obtained by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) from samples using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. The PCR results were inconclusive because the body had been treated with formalin that interferes with the PCR techniques.

While the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) had been used to obtain the negative results that were shared earlier, further testing using PCR is required to confirm the patient status. In this particular case, the PCR could not confirm the status due to the reason mentioned above.

This situation created some discomfort among some people but especially to health workers who were observing the 13 people in Tororo who brought the body from DRC.

[WHO states] there is NO confirmed Ebola virus disease case in Uganda. Active case search continues in all communities, health facilities and on formal and informal border crossing in all districts, especially in the high-risk areas. Alert cases continue to be picked, isolated, treated and blood samples picked for testing by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).

[This is a little concerning since the PCR assay was compromised by formalin treatment of the body, but one can feel reassured by the continuing active surveillance that is ongoing.

Formalin fixation is a problem when one wants to detect viral RNA because it modifies the RNA. [The following is extracted from McKinney MD, Moon SJ, Kulesh DA, et al. Detection of viral RNA from paraffin-embedded tissues after prolonged formalin fixation. J Clin Virol. 2009; 44(1): 39-42; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18977691): "RNA extraction remains difficult and inefficient, due to degradation or modification of the RNA. Formalin fixation-induced cross-linking between proteins and DNA or RNA is probably the most significant result of formalin fixation (13,14,15) and is most likely the greatest obstacle for obtaining RT-PCR-amplifiable RNA. Cross-linking preserves cellular structure, but traps the nucleic acids in tissues, making their extraction more difficult {16}; disrupts the chain elongation of the nascent DNA by interfering with primer extension of the RT (14); and modifies RNA by adding mono-methylol (-CH2OH) groups to all 4 bases, interrupting reverse transcription.(6) Extraction efficiency of amplifiable RNA from a [formalin fixed] tissue is inversely proportional to the fixation time.(17,18,19) Therefore, tissues containing pathogens requiring BSL [biosecurity level]-3 and -4 containment and extended formalin fixation to ensure inactivation, pose a significant challenge for the extraction of amplifiable RNA and use in PCR-based assays."

- Sun 17 Feb 2019. Aid agency MSF suspends work in part of eastern DR Congo
[Daily Mail Online, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report, abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6714917/Aid-agency-MSF-suspends-work-eastern-DR-Congo.html

Doctors Without Borders [MSF] said [Sun 17 Feb 2019] it had suspended non-essential work in part of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo after gunmen abducted two of its local staff there earlier this month [February 2019].

MSF told AFP it was acting after the [8 Feb 2019] incident in the Masisi health zone in North Kivu province.

"Out of concern over the safety of its teams, Doctors without Borders has decided to cut back its staff on site," said MSF spokeswoman in DR Congo, Francine Kongolo.

"The organisation will nevertheless continue to provide emergency care at Masisi's main hospital," she added.

"This measure comes after the abduction on February 8 of two local MSF agents by unidentified armed men," she added.

Cosmas Kangakolo, administrator in the Masisi territory, told AFP that for him, MSF had taken the action to force local people to better assure the safety of their staff.

Masisi lies some 100 kilometres (60 miles) northwest of North Kivu's provincial capital of Goma.

Armed groups in this troubled province frequently abduct foreigners and Congolese nationals working for aid organisations.

- Fri 15 Feb 2019. No serious side effects from South Sudan Ebola vaccine: WHO
[Xinhua News Agency, abridged, edited]
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-02/15/c_137825144.htm

The World Health Organization (WHO) has denied reports that some South Sudanese health workers vaccinated against the Ebola virus have been hospitalized after suffering serious side effects. Local media reported on [Thu 14 Feb 2019] that a number of health workers who received the experimental Ebola vaccine have been hospitalized in Yambio, a border town close to Ebola-hit Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). WHO said in a statement to Xinhua that its vaccination teams followed up all beneficiaries of the vaccination exercise, and there are no cases of adverse side effects.

[It would be informative to know what the actual diagnosis was determined to be for these health workers who became ill following vaccination.

An anonymous subscriber wonders if these individuals had symptoms in the time frame that would be considered side effects, even if they don't meet the definition for serious adverse reaction.

We are hoping WHO will provide further information. - Mod.LK]

UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore's remarks at Munich Security Conference: Town Hall Event: "Update on Ebola in the DRC & Beyond" , Munich, Germany
----------------------------------------------------------------------
"... once again, we face familiar challenges -- and more. An unforgiving disease that requires 100 per cent of cases to be controlled and isolated. A high-density, mobile population. A lingering mistrust of aid. More children and women among those infected and dying of the disease. And a new, unexpected threat: security concerns and direct attacks that impede access.

"Since the beginning of the epidemic, UNICEF and our partners have deployed more than 650 staff members to the effort. All under the excellent leadership of the Ministry of Health, which is well-trained and experienced from previous outbreaks.

"Together, we're providing drinking water to more than 1.3 million people. We're providing sanitation and hygiene kits -- and emergency nutritional care for Ebola patients. We're directly assisting 950 affected families. We're supporting orphans and unaccompanied children. And we've reached more than 10 million people with information on preventing this disease and reducing transmission -- including in schools.

"We're also deploying innovative approaches -- isolation cubes for treatment, new vaccines, experimental therapeutics, and big-data analysis to track the spread of the outbreak.

"Our protection teams are doing intense-contact follow-up work, to ensure well-being within communities and to prevent spread to non-affected areas.

"We're putting a renewed emphasis on risk communication and community engagement, to improve trust in -- and uptake of -- vital health and prevention services.

"And the UN peacekeeping force is providing a welcome security umbrella for all that we're doing.

"Thanks to this work, we've controlled the outbreak in Equateur, and in many spots in North Kivu, including Beni. We've also succeeded in preventing the outbreak from spreading to other regions and countries.

"But the outbreak remains active. There is a serious risk of it reaching major urban centres, like Goma.

"Our staff members -- across all of our organizations -- are stretched thin. They're facing continued community resistance -- and new security threats.

"In this uncertain environment, we will be strained to control new outbreaks in DRC -- or even respond to other health emergencies like cholera or polio that might emerge in neighbouring countries.

"We must find ways to stay one step ahead of Ebola.

"And we can do it. The excellent work of Uganda and Rwanda to prepare has made all the difference in preventing an outbreak.

"Which is why -- in addition to our immediate response -- UNICEF is working with our partners with a new urgency to strengthen health systems and local response capabilities over the long-term.

"This includes bolstering immunization stocks and capacity.

"It includes scaling-up surveillance and isolation capabilities, especially in urban areas -- so important in controlling the Lagos outbreak in 2014.

"And it includes investing in stronger communication efforts with communities, and new prevention and control efforts in health facilities and schools. This includes a new team of anthropologists and communication for development specialists to improve our research and assessment efforts.

"In the meantime, we must make the most of a key window of opportunity, before the Strategic Response Plan ends in July 2019. We must continue raising the alarm on this emergency to summon more funds, recruit more staff, and be strategic about where -- and when -- we deploy current staff.

"Throughout, we must work closely with the new government to reduce security threats, strengthen health systems for the future, and gain access to every child and community affected.

"Ebola is unforgiving -- but it's not unbeatable.

"Let's draw inspiration -- and learn lessons -- from our successes so far, and act now, before the outbreak spreads to Goma or crosses the border.

Thank you."
