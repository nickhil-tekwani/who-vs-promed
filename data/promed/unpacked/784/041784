The Rhode Island Department of Health is urging residents to protect themselves after nearly 150 people have reported becoming sick with shigellosis.

Earlier this month [July 2013], 134 cases of the illness were reported from people who swam at Spring Lake Beach on 4 Jul 2013. An additional 14 cases were reported from people who recently swam at Wallum Lake, and more cases were reported from Rhode Island residents who swam in Massachusetts.

The Director of Health, Michael Fine, recommends washing your hands frequently and not swimming if you have been sick with diarrhea in the past 48 hours.

Most people with shigellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps starting one to 3 days after exposure. Most infections are not severe and last between 48 and 72 hours.

The Department of Health investigated an outbreak of the gastrointestinal sickness after people were sickened after swimming in Burrillville. The beach has since been reopened to swimmers.

People who develop symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever or vomiting should contact their doctor.

[The posting seems to suggest the shigellosis clusters have occurred from multiple lakes in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts. It is important to know whether the isolates that are different geographically are also different genotypically.

From the US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Bad Bug Book (http://www.foodsafety.gov/~mow/chap19.html):

Shigellosis accounts for less than 10 percent of the reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in this country. _Shigella_ rarely occurs in animals; principally, it is a disease of humans except for other primates such as monkeys and chimpanzees. The organism is frequently found in water polluted with human feces. The infective dose is as few as 10 cells depending on age and condition of host. The _Shigella_ spp. are highly infectious agents that are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.

Associated foods include salads (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and chicken), raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and poultry. Contamination of these foods is usually through the fecal-oral route. Fecally contaminated water and unsanitary handling by food handlers are the most common causes of contamination.

Clearly, unlike foodborne infections in humans due to _Salmonella_ (except for typhoid fever), _E. coli_ O157, and _Campylobacter_, shigellosis is associated with food contaminated by human, not animal, feces. - Mod.LL
