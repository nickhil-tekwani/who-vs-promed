Defra traces one horse related to Wiltshire swamp fever cases
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Defra investigation has traced only one horse that it says is at
risk of developing swamp fever [equine infectious anemia, EIA] in
Britain following the cases discovered in Wiltshire last month [January 2010].

One animal from the shipment of Romanian horses that came to the UK
via Belgium was moved from the yard in Wiltshire currently under isolation.

A Defra spokesman confirmed: "One horse from the original consignment
had been sold, so it was traced and tested and the test was negative."

Furthermore the spokesman said that during 22 Dec 2009, when the
horses arrived, and 11 Jan 2010, when they were tested, no other
equines were taken on or off the Wiltshire premises.

The owner of the yard has not yet been officially named, but
widespread speculation suggests he is a large-scale dealer and H&H
has received unsubstantiated reports that horses were taken to sale
rings around the country over the Christmas and New Year [2009] period.

Defra said on Wed [3 Feb 2010] that 2 horses have been traced in
Britain that came into contact with an EIA-positive horse in Belgium.
He said they have tested negative, and that further tests are pending
-- but their whereabouts is not specified.

The Defra spokesman told H&H yesterday [4 Feb 2010] that the yard in
Wiltshire "is the only premises still under movement restrictions."

The charity World Horse Welfare has been doing work in Romania since
2004 and is concerned that these horses were able to leave Romania
and travel across Europe so easily.

Chief executive Roly Owers said: "There is a legal requirement for
health certification before export from Romania, which includes blood
testing for EIA.

"Romania, where it is endemic, is one of the largest exporters of
horses for slaughter in Europe.

"We have raised concerns with the authorities in the United Kingdom,
Brussels, Romania, and other member states many times over the last 6
to 7 years.

"If this disease spreads across to the United Kingdom it could have
catastrophic affects on our horse population."

World Horse Welfare wants the European Commission to review the
export procedures for horses leaving Romania to ensure they cannot
carry the disease and put in place an EIA eradication programme to
get rid of the disease once and for all.

The charity advises owners in the UK to undertake rigorous checks
when buying a horse from abroad and would discourage anybody from
importing Romanian horses.

Equine infectious anaemia in the EU -- an update
------------------------------------------------
Horses in the EU are subject to clinical examination and must be
declared healthy prior to movement [which means that they should be
accompanied by health certificates and undergo clinical examination
prior to movement. - Mod.AS]

EU rules do not allow movement of horses from [EIA] affected premises
for a period of time, during which there should have been no new
cases since the last reported case and remaining horses have been
tested twice with a negative result. Horses from Romania also have to
undergo EIA testing (with negative result) prior to movement.
Traces, the EU trade electronic notification system, [should] capture
horse consignments from [Romania].

[Presentations on the recent Romanian-origin EIA cases in Belgium and
the UK have been submitted to the SCFCAH (Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health) meeting in Brussels, 4-5 Feb 2010. The
Belgian and the UK presentations, respectively, can be accessed at
the following URLs:
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1020405_EIA_Equine%20Infectious%20Anemia%20in%20Belgium.pdf>
and
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1020405_eia_Equine%20Infectious%20Anemia%20in%20the%20UK.pdf>.

According to the reports above and to the Belgian and UK
notifications to the OIE, the timeline of the event is as follows:

1. 21 Oct 2009: 18 horses arriving from Romania at a dealer's
establishment at Drongen, Belgium.
2. 22 Dec 2009: 10 horses from Belgium including 9 of the Romanian
consignment above, sent to the UK.
3. 23 Dec 2009: TRACES (EU's TRAde Control and Expert System to track
the movement of animals within the EU and from outside the EU)
message received at UK Vet Services on the origin of the said horses.
4. 29 Dec 2009: UK Compliance inspection
5. 11 Jan 2010: 1st blood samples taken
6. 15 Jan 2010: suspicious result (Coggins test) 2 horses (VLA);
restrictions served (51 horses) and 2nd samples taken on
non-negatives; tracings and restriction (1 horse).
7. 19 Jan 2010: positive results (Coggins test) in 2 horses. UK's CVO
confirms EIA to EU Commission and to Belgium.
8. 20 Jan 2010: UK notification to OIE.
Belgium starts investigation in order to
- identify the location of the remaining horses from the consignment;
- identify the in-contact animals; and
- take the appropriate actions.
9. 29 Jan 2010: 1 Romanian horse found positive in Assenbroek, Belgium.
10. 1 Feb 2010: all contact horses negative in Drongen; results for
the other contact horses pending as of 4 Feb 2010.
11. 2 Feb 2010: Belgium notification to the OIE.

All in all, it took about 2.5 months between the arrival of an EIA
infected consignment in Belgium and its identification (thanks to
information from the UK) there. And while the UK acted in line with
the prevailing requirements (obtaining a timely note from TRACES),
yet it took 19 days before samples were collected and another 8 days
to obtain positive results. Some of the delay could be attributed to
the 2009 holiday season.

Luckily, the UK episode occurred during the cold season, with reduced
vector activity, and while EIA is a slow-moving disease. Other
pathogens (such as African horse sickness) and seasons could
potentially have a different outcome.

The concerns expressed by World Horse Welfare (item 2 above) seem
justified. Some questions have not been (publicly?) cleared yet: had
the horses been tested in their premises of origin, in Romania -- a
country known to be heavily EIA-infected?
Were they accompanied by health certificates? Results of the
investigation will help.

Notably, one of the suspected routes of the introduction of BTV-8 to
the triangle Belgium/Netherlands/Germany in 2006, and of additional
BTV serotypes later, was related to possible movements of horses
(and/or their accompanying culicoids). The event described, and the
suspected loophole, may be a cause for a potential concern within the
EU as well as among third countries. - Mod.AS]
