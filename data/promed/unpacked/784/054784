----------------------------------------------------------------------
Human hepatitis E is a major disease not only in developing countries but also in industrialized countries, and identification of animal strains of human hepatitis E virus [HEV] in pigs and deer and its zoonotic potential has raised considerable public health concerns. Recent reports suggest that other animals such as rats, mongooses, chickens, rabbits, and trout also may harbor HEVs. We used random PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate HEV sequences in ferrets (_Mustela putorius_) from the Netherlands.

In 2010, fecal samples were collected from ferrets in the Netherlands and stored at -80 deg C [-112 deg F]. Samples that were negative for ferret coronavirus were further characterized for other pathogens. Viral RNA was isolated and viral metagenomic libraries were constructed for 454 pyrosequencing and 248 840 sequence reads were generated from 7 fecal samples. We identified 289 sequence reads in one sample that were related to rat HEV and that could be assembled into 6 contigs covering approximately 50 percent of the ferret HEV (FRHEV) genome.

We then developed a set of nested PCR primers on the basis of obtained sequences to detect viral RNA. Total RNA extracted from 43 ferret fecal samples collected from 19 locations in the Netherlands was used to perform reverse transcription PCR amplification. Using this PCR, we detected viral RNA in 4 (9.3 percent) fecal samples tested from 4 locations (distance between each sampling location ranged from 25 km to 127 km [15.5 mi - 79 mi]). All amplicons were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. We have limited information regarding the clinical disease this virus may cause because these samples were obtained from household pet ferrets that did not show overt clinical signs. In addition, 4/16 animals from a single farm were IgG positive when tested for IgG against HEV by using recombinant human HEV protein.

[For technical details pertaining to the characterization of the complete genome of this virus, subscribers are referred to the source URL above]. FRHEV full-genome sequences FRHEV4 and FRHEV20 showed 98.6 percent sequence identity and were deposited into GenBank under accession nos. JN998606 and JN998607, respectively.

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes clearly showed that FRHEV was separated from genotype 1-4 HEVs and clustered with rat HEV. The phylogenetic distance between rat HEV and FRHEV is larger than the distance between genotype 1 and genotype 2 HEV.

In recent years, an increasing number of sporadic cases of hepatitis E have been reported. Several observations suggest that autochthonous cases are caused by zoonotic spread of infection from wild or domestic animals. In addition, IgG anti-HEV seropositivity in the United States has been associated with several factors, including having a pet at home [see comment]. Further studies are needed to identify the zoonotic potential of FRHEV.

[One of the references cited in the paper above (ref 1, see below) includes the following observations from the USA: "Having a pet in the home and consuming liver or other organ meats more than once per month were significantly associated with increased odds of HEV seropositivity". And: "Exposure to HEV is common in the US population, although hepatitis E is rarely reported. Having pets and consuming organ meats may play a role in HEV transmission in the United States, but other mechanisms of transmission may also exist. HEV may be considered a possible etiologic agent of acute and chronic hepatitis in US patients reporting no travel history."

For background information on HEV, subscribers are referred to Mod. CP's commentary in posting 20100624.2107.

The possible addition of ferrets to the list of pets (dogs, cats, farm animals, lagomorphs) which may have zoonotic potential, is in need of further studies.
