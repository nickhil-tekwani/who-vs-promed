In Luanda more than than 90 people have died from bites of rabid dogs
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Between 1 Jan 2012 and 15 Dec 2012 a total of 20 236 people have been bitten by rabid dogs in Luanda, and 84 have died according to ANGOP. According to a source in the Provincial Directorate of Health in Luanda, the urban district of Kilamba Kiaxe, in the municipality of Belas, recorded most cases (4067), followed by the municipalities of Viana (3428), Cazenga (2877) and Cacuaco (2178), and Sambizanga District, in the municipality in Luanda (2492).

Among those bitten, 86 percent were male, and 5-9 year-olds were the most affected age group said the source, adding that in the week from 9-15 Dec 2012, 568 bites have been reported, including 564 dogs and 4 cats. Kilamba Kiaxe District recorded 20 percent of the total cases, followed by Viana (17 percent) and Cazenga, 14 percent.

As a consequence the health authority has requested owners and breeders of domestic animals to have them vaccinated and kept under restraint. Parents with young families should warn their children of the risk of exposure to rabies virus infection.

[Nothing short of a nation-wide compulsory vaccination programme is likely to address this problem.
