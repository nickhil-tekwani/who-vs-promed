The presence of BTV serotype 1 was confirmed in Corsica on 5 Sep 2013 by the National Reference Laboratory at Maisons Alfort after notification of the clinical suspicion on 2 Sep 2013 in 2 farms.

To date, 4 outbreaks have been confirmed, and a dozen others are suspects. These farms were placed under surveillance, and susceptible animals on confirmed farms are to be vaccinated in accordance with the current regulations. Exemptions allowing animals from Corsica to be moved to the mainland, being liable to European regulations, are to be applied.

The appearance of these infected households do not affect the free status of mainland France. Corsica had maintained its status as a protected area in relation to serotypes 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16, which are still considered endemic in this region [a European map is included; see at the source URL]. Vaccination against these serotypes is allowed in Corsica.

The ANSES [French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety] Bluetongue Emergency Steering Committee, a national organization that brings together representatives of government, producers, and scientists, will meet on Tue 17 Sep 2013 to discuss the strategy and its implementation. This episode highlights the importance of clinical vigilance to detect any reemergence of the disease. The question of the revision of the programmed surveillance applied in Corsica will be studied in light of trade implications.

[The above report adds some light to the status of Corsica within the complex EU bluetongue-related regulations. France declared to the OIE its mainland's freedom from bluetongue in December 2012 (see 20130523.1733915). Such a status has significant international trade implications.

Details on the incidence of clinical bluetongue disease in Corsican sheep during previous years will be helpful. In case the current epizootic represents a recurrence of BTV-1 causing serious clinical disease following the absence of such disease for an extended period, its notification may deserve consideration for the sake of transparency.

A serious outbreak of the same serotype has been reported from north Sardinia, facing south Corsica; see map at the source URL.
