Heroin fear spreads
--------------------
Fife Police have issued a warning about the possibility of contaminated
heroin circulating in the area. But the force said there was no suggestion
of a connection with the nine deaths in Glasgow, apparently caused by
heroin containing another substance which has caused a serious illness
among addicts.
The chairman of Fife drug action team, assistant chief constable David
Mellor, said heroin diluted with an unusual contaminant was being sold. A
batch of the drug appears to have been broken down with an unidentified
substance which can cause crystallization.

[Fife is to the immediate north of Edinburgh and lies between the Firths of
Tay and of Forth. It is well to the south of Aberdeen. There is the
suggestion of a third area affected in Scotland. - Mod MHJ
