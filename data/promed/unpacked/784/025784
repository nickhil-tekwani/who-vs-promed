Biologist urges closer look at dolphin deaths
---------------------------------------------
A spike in the number of dead dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf could point
to a problem other than poisonous sea slugs -- if only authorities
would do the necessary tests, says a researcher. Marine biologist Dr
Karen Stockin, who is responsible for autopsies on common dolphins
that wash up around Auckland, wants authorities to investigate the
deaths of 8 otherwise seemingly healthy dolphins in the space of 3
weeks.

She said the deaths were probably not linked to dog deaths that
occurred at about the same time, "but that does not mean we should not
be concerned. The common dolphin is an important biological indicator
and if something changes in their system that causes an increase in
deaths, that is important."

Dr Stockin said that on average, 1 or 2 common dolphins would wash up
around the coastline of New Zealand each month. However, "8
independent deaths from 1 region [were reported] in just a 3-week
period," she said. "Not a single [dolphin] was emaciated or
malnourished. On the contrary, the animals examined were seemingly
healthy prior to death." Tissues tests had failed to explain why they
died. "These were all mature, robust animals."

Dr Stockin, a Massey University scientist, is pushing for the
dolphins' stomach contents to be tested. She has kept samples from
their stomachs and contacted the Auckland Regional Council -- which
has been leading the investigation into deaths of dogs and marine life
-- to ask about testing them. She was told it was "not a line of
inquiry" the council wanted to pursue.

The council's monitoring and research manager, Grant Barnes, said
yesterday [2 Sep 2009] that the priority had been explaining the dog
deaths. "From our perspective we had to get on top of why the dogs
were dying."

A task force of agencies started out testing many different species
but narrowed that once dog deaths were linked to sea slugs found to be
poisonous with tetrodotoxin, said Mr Barnes. The council and other
agencies ruled out a link between the dog and dolphin deaths without
testing the dolphins' stomachs. [It seems very presumptuous to rule
out a link, without testing the dolphin's stomach contents. After all,
they may be linked to sea slugs and tetrodotoxin as well. - Mod.TG]

Dr Stockin said dolphins were often among the 1st victims of changes
to their environment because they were high in the food chain. Whales
and seabirds were other "indicator" species, she said.

Dolphins are the only species whose deaths have not been explained
after a spate of initially mysterious deaths. Pilchard beachings were
attributed to a virus attacking their gills, several penguin deaths
were blamed on malnutrition, while sudden dog deaths and illnesses
have been linked to tetrodotoxin.

Mr Barnes said Dr Stockin was the best person to comment on dolphin
deaths but "we don't believe there's anything to suggest acute changes
in the Hauraki Gulf ... it is part of the natural life cycle." He said
it was up to the Department of Conservation to decide if the dolphins
warranted further testing. A spokeswoman for the department did not
return messages yesterday.

Dr Stockin was keen to test pilchards found in stomachs of some
dolphins, after other pilchards were found to have died of a herpes
virus. "We have a number of seemingly healthy dolphins found with
stomachs full of a type of prey that has been washing up dead ... We
should be looking at that."

[It was a significant finding to link the dog, the sea slug and the
tetrodotoxin. It is very logical to test the dolphin stomach contents
for the tetrodotoxin.

Although the dolphin deaths have occured off and on for periods of
time, this may be a breakthrough of some sort if the stomach contents
were tested. If the tetrodotoxin is not there, there has been little
spent to investigate it. While on the other hand, if it is there, it
may be a breakthrough that is what we have all longed for to
understand some of these dolphin deaths.

Surely there are diagnostic labs that can test the stomach contents of
these dolphins for tetrodotoxin? - Mod.TG]
