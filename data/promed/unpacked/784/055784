Uganda's health ministry today [26 Sep 2022] reported a steady surge in Ebola Sudan cases in the past few days, bringing the total to 36 of which 23 (64%) have proved fatal.

In another worrying development, the ministry said yesterday [25 Sep 2022] that illnesses have been reported in 2 more locations, as the affected area expands. Just 4 days ago, only 7 cases and one death were confirmed.

The outbreak involving the rarer but still deadly Ebola strain initially involved people from Mubende, located west of the capital city of Kampala. However, yesterday [25 Sep 2022] the country's health ministry said cases were reported in Kyegegwa, a city on a busy road west of Mubende, and Kassanda, located just east of Mubende.

On Twitter today [26 Sep 2022], the health ministry said 2 new cases were confirmed, putting the outbreak total at 36 cases, 18 of them confirmed and 18 listed as probable. So far, 23 patients have died, including 5 who had confirmed Ebola infections. Thirty-five people have been admitted for medical care.

Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the outbreak location poses a risk of further spread, because it is on a busy road that leads to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and because the area contains gold mines that attract people from within and outside of Uganda.

The WHO said in an update today [26 Sep 2022] that preliminary investigations identified a number of community deaths in Madudu and Kiruma subcounties of Mubende district that were reported in the 1st 2 weeks of September [2022]. It added that the deaths are now considered to be probable Ebola Sudan cases. Deaths that occur in the community pose a high risk of community spread.

Of the 18 lab-confirmed cases reported so far, 3 are from Kyegegwa and 1 is from Kassanda. Of the confirmed and suspected case-patients, 62% are female, and the median age of patients is 26 years. The case-fatality rate among confirmed cases is 28%. So far, health officials have recorded 223 contacts.

The WHO said 7 Ebola Sudan outbreaks have been reported since 1976, 4 in Uganda and 3 in Sudan. It estimates that the case-fatality rate ranges from 41%-100%, based on information from past outbreaks.

The virus is thought to jump to humans through close contact with blood, secretions, or other body fluids from infected animals, which can include fruit bats, non-human primates, forest antelope, or porcupines found sick or dead in the rainforest. Like Ebola Zaire, responsible for large outbreaks in West Africa and in the DRC, the virus spreads among humans through infected body fluids.

The WHO said the risk to Uganda is high, since there is no vaccine, and that the outbreak may have started 3 weeks before the 1st case was detected, raising the possibility of several undetected transmission chains. The patients who died earlier were buried with traditional practices and ceremonies involving large gatherings.

Though Uganda has shown a strong capacity for responding to Ebola outbreaks in the past, the system could be overwhelmed if cases spike dramatically and the outbreak expands further, the WHO warned.

"In addition, the outbreak was detected among individuals living around an active local gold mine. Mobility among traders of this commodity is likely to be high, and the declaration of the outbreak may cause some miners already incubating the disease to flee," it said.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) also said it is putting together a team of health workers, epidemiologists, and logisticians who have experience with hemorrhagic fevers to start work this week.

In a recent statement, MSF said Uganda's health ministry asked the group to help support its outbreak response. An MSF team traveled to Mubende on 21 Sep [2022] to assess the situation, including at the hospital where the 1st case was detected.

MSF said it has started setting up and an isolation and treatment center in the Mubende hospital and that its teams are weighing the possibility of setting up a 2nd center in the town of Madudu. The town is about 15 mi [24 km] north of where the 1st patient was from and where several suspicious cases have been reported.

[Bringing this outbreak under control is going to be a challenge, what with the busy location, the lack of a vaccine or antiviral, and the undetected early activity, which likely initiated more than a single chain of transmission. Furthermore, before Ebola was identified as the etiologic agent, traditional burials were held, which are known to spread the virus through exposure to infectious bodily fluids. But now, with strong communication to the populace to adopt safe practices and provision of sufficient personal protective equipment to healthcare workers, it is hoped Uganda will be able to lower infection risk. - Mod.LK]

Book explores the Ebola epidemic and disparities in maternity care
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
North London consultant obstetrician Dr Benjamin Black has written an account of the West African Ebola epidemic.

Belly Woman will be released on 18 Oct [2022] and lays out what Dr Black found when he arrived in Sierra Leone, just weeks after Ebola had spread over the border from Guinea.

Q: What is Belly Woman about?
Dr Black: Belly Woman is a firsthand account of the impact a humanitarian crisis has on access to maternal and reproductive healthcare. The story centres on the West African Ebola epidemic, but the themes are transferrable to many settings. It is a story too often left untold. Belly Woman explores the global disparity in maternity care, including safe abortion care, alongside the compounding factors of a humanitarian emergency. As an obstetrician working throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I also reflect on what lessons we failed to learn.

Q: What led you to write this?
Dr Black: I wrote Belly Woman because I felt it was an important event to document and share; I also wanted to bring the issues of maternal health disparity into focus.

Q: As a doctor, what was the moment that stood out while dealing with the Ebola epidemic?
Dr Black: The West African Ebola epidemic was a massive event associated with immense suffering scattered with as moments of hope. It is difficult to single out one event, as each life lost and each life saved mattered. I'm very proud of our efforts to try and improve the care pregnant women received inside the Ebola Treatment centres and our efforts to improve access to contraception.

Q: Why did you swap the relative comfort of the Whittington Hospital for a role with Médecins Sans Frontières in 2014?
Dr Black: I had always wanted to work in humanitarian assistance -- it is the reason I become a doctor in the 1st place -- so you could say, it was always in my plan.

Q: What is your big takeaway from the experience of dealing with 2 major epidemics of Ebola and COVID-19?
Dr Black: There are many lessons to consider, the 1st being whether or not we are capable of learning from these episodes at all. Although very different illnesses, there was a lot that should have been transferred across to the COVID response from the "lessons learnt" during Ebola; in practice, this did not happen, [resulting] in a chaotic and poorly communicated response. The other big takeaway is that you cannot separate the emergency health response from the continued need for standard healthcare: one supports the other. Having a weak public health system and poorly functioning clinics allows fertile ground for epidemics to spread.

Belly Woman is released on Neem Tree Press on 19 Oct [2022].

Product description
Review
"Oh my goodness, I could not put the book down. Benjamin Black has the most amazing gift for telling a story. Belly Woman transports you to Sierra Leone, to the compounds, to the hospital wards, to the villages ravaged by Ebola. As Dr Black and his colleagues fought for better care and to improve maternity services, you feel every drip of sweat inside their PPE, you hold your breath as they, too, wait for the newborn to cry, and you weep at every life that could have been saved but for the lack of facilities and equipment." - Victoria MacDonald, Health and Social Care Editor at Channel 4 News
