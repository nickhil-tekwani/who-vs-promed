The 9th human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection Cambodia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On Sat 23 Feb 2013, L'Institut Pasteur du Cambodge confirmed the 9th human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in a 35-year-old man from Kbal Ou village, Me Sar Chrey commune, Stueng Trang district in Kampong Cham province. He developed fever on 8 Feb 2013 and his condition worsened on 10 Feb 2013 with fever, frequent cough, and dyspnea. Local private practitioners initially treated him but his condition further deteriorated. On 13 Feb 2013 he was admitted to the Kampong Cham Hospital with fever, severe cough, and dyspnea and was immediately treated with Tamiflu. He developed pneumonia on 21 Feb 2013 and was transferred to Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh. Unfortunately, despite intensive medical care, he died on 25 Feb 2013.

There is evidence of recent deaths among poultry in the village and the man had a history of coming into contact with sick poultry prior to becoming sick. The man is the 9th person this year [2013], the 30th person to become infected with the H5N1 virus, and the 27th person to die from complications of the disease in Cambodia.

A 35-year-old man has become Cambodia's 8th fatality from [avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection], prompting concern about the spread of the virus in the country, a health official said Tuesday [26 Feb 2013]. The latest victim, from the northeastern province of Kampong Cham, died on Monday night [25 Feb 2013] in a Phnom Penh hospital, said Ly Sovann, deputy head of the health ministry's disease surveillance bureau.

He said the man had eaten 2 ducks which had previously died, before he became sick himself earlier this month [February 2013]. "We are really worried about the situation because in just 2 months we have had 9 cases of bird flu," Ly Sovann said. 8 of the 9 people died, along with thousands of birds in the villages where the victims lived. "There was a lot of dead poultry, but the people did not report this to (officials). In the villages that I went to, almost all poultry had died," Ly Sovann said, adding it took up to a month for officials to be told of poultry deaths in some areas.

The Ministry has enhanced surveillance to try to detect and treat avian influenza cases in the early stages, he said. "We are also worried about (possible) human-to-human transmission of bird flu, but it is not the case now," said Ly Sovann. He urged villagers to report dead poultry immediately, and not to touch or eat the birds.

Sonny Krishnan, communications officer with the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Cambodia, said WHO was keeping "a close watch" on the situation. "The disease is still of limited transmittability from poultry to humans," he said.

Cambodia has recorded 30 human cases of H5N1 since 2003, with all but 3 of them proving fatal. The virus has killed more than 365 people worldwide since a major outbreak in 2003, according to WHO statistics.

[Kampong Cham province is the 11th largest province in Cambodia. With a population of 1 680 694 (2008), it ranks as the 2nd most populated province in the nation. It can be located in the map at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Cambodia_Kampong_Cham_locator_map.svg.

It is unusual that almost all the confirmed human cases of avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection in Cambodia have had a fatal outcome, whereas as of 15 Feb 2013, globally, only 367 of the 620 confirmed cases had fatal outcomes. - Mod.CP]
