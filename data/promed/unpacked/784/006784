[1] Cholera, possible - Spain (Andalusia)

Unfortunately, cholera has returned to Puerto Real (Cadiz,
Andalusia). Yesterday [16 Aug 2010], the mayor of that town informed
the provincial governor of 2 deaths that due to the disease.

The governor, Fernando de Gabriel, has ordered the isolation of the
population of Puerto Real, and the placing of all merchandise from
that area, under observation. The workers from Puerto Real employed
in La Carraca [a military center for construction and repair of ships
and storage and distribution of ammunition and armament] may not
return to their homes, but will remain in the military establishment
until the cessation of the epidemic. This way they can keep working
and sending their wages to their families.

In La Linea (de la Concepcion) there have been 2 [outbreaks?] of
cholera yesterday [16 Aug 2010] and people have been protesting the
allowed free movement of goods from Gibraltar, the [possible] origin
of the disease. In the rest of the province public health is satisfactory.

Cholera bacteria were found in Dnieper [River] water near
Zaporizhzhya. As reported by the regional sanitary epidemiological
station, swimming is prohibited on the central beaches near the
Khortytsya island and on the beaches located on the area from the
Dniprohes hydroelectric power station to the lower limits of the city.

Cholera bacteria were found during monitoring of water in the Dnieper
near the Embankment on the central beach and purification
installations of water supply system. Epidemiologists warn that
infection can cause serious gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, to
swim in such water and the more so to drink the Dnieper is dangerous.

Farhan Safdar is a volunteer working for Doctors Worldwide, the
British medical relief organization, in the affected of Nowshera in
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

His diary for Al Jazeera is posted below:
I've been in Pakistan 3 weeks and have been working with the Doctors
Worldwide team from a few days in to this humanitarian disaster.

If you ask me if anything has changed on the ground, I have to
respond with honesty and say that things are taking a turn for the
worse. The rain keeps on falling and the true magnitude of this
disaster is becoming clearer minute-by-minute.

Earlier, I was with a doctor from an international medical
organization. He confirmed that there are cases of cholera in Sindh
province and the reality is that if cholera has been found in Sindh
then it will of course be found in other parts of this broken and
devastated country.

[4] Cholera - Pakistan (Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa)

The WHO has asked Pakistan to investigate a reported case of cholera
in the northwest Swat Valley [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa/Northwest Frontier
Province] amid fears that an epidemic could break out in its flood-hit regions.

The international health body says cholera, which is endemic in the
flood-affected country has a high chance of spreading rapidly after
floods and other disasters. WHO spokesman Paul Garwood said
international health rules require Pakistan to probe into the case
and report back to the organization.

If an epidemic were to occur the WHO says close to 140 000 cases of
cholera could sweep the country over the next 3 months.

[5] Cholera - Nigeria (Bauchi, Borno)
Date: Mon 16 Aug 2010

A cholera outbreak in Nigeria has killed 87 people during the past
month while 1315 others have been infected, official figures showed
Mon 16 Aug 2010.

The outbreak in the northern states of Bauchi and Borno was believed
to be because of poor sanitation and the contamination of wells,
while Nigeria's rainy season often sees a surge in cholera cases.

Bauchi State has recorded 47 deaths and 1200 infections in the past
month, state health commissioner Mohammed Yahaya Jalem told AFP by
telephone from the state capital.

Borno State health commissioner Abdurrahman Terab told AFP on Thu 12
Aug 2010 that 40 people had died from cholera in the state within the
previous week while 115 others were infected.

Jalem attributed the outbreak to poor sanitation and the
contamination of open wells on which rural communities largely depend
as major water source. "We have mobilised health personnel and drugs
in the affected areas and we have stepped up... campaigns on how
people can guard against cholera and other water-related infections
especially in the rainy season," he said.

Health experts say a surge in cholera outbreaks is noticeable in
Nigerian villages in the rainy season when rain water washes dirt
into open wells and ponds.

More than 260 people died of cholera in 4 northern states in the last
quarter of 2009.

[6] Cholera - Cameroon (Far North)

Cholera has killed 200 people in the west African nation of Cameroon,
the government said Thu 12 Aug 2010, and aid agencies feared the
outbreak could spread to neighboring regions and nations. Another
2500 cases of cholera, a deadly water-borne disease, have been
diagnosed in Cameroon since an outbreak warning in June 2010.

About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north
[Extreme-Nord] region, bordering Nigeria and Chad, do not have access
to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official.

Sanitation is also limited in the area and recent flooding has
aggravated the situation. UNICEF said it has dispatched emergency
medical kits containing surgical gloves, water treatment tablets,
cholera medicine, oral rehydration salts and educational materials.
The United Nations children's agency said the outbreak could be
devastating for children, who are especially vulnerable.
