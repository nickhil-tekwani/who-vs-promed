The Ministry of Health and Social Services and other stakeholders at Gobabis are working around the clock to curb the spread of hepatitis E in the region. Since the 1st case in the Omaheke region was reported in December 2017, about 137 other cases have been confirmed between March and November 2019. Out of the notified cases, one death has been recorded.

Most of the reported cases in the region are from Gobabis, mainly from the Kanaan C informal settlement, where 123 cases were reported. This is as a result of a lack of clean drinking water, lack of sanitation facilities, and open-air defecation in the settlement. Responding to questions emailed to him by Nampa [Namibia Press Agency], Omaheke health director Jeremiah Shikulo said regional and district health emergency committees have been activated and are in full operation, leading and coordinating the outbreak response process with other line ministries.

"The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry has provided 4 water tanks to the community of Kanaan, which the Gobabis municipality are refilling on a regular basis. Water purification tablets are also being distributed to households on a daily basis by community health workers," he added. The municipality has likewise given Kanaan C informal residents permission to build their own affordable temporary toilets.

Among other attempts to combat hepatitis E in the region, campaigns on how to properly clean water containers, screening pregnant women for the virus, and health education through community health workers have been conducted at Kanaan C. Five clean-up campaigns have also been held at the informal settlement, with another one set for tomorrow [6 Dec 2019].

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus, usually as a result of poor sanitation. The disease was declared an outbreak on [14 Dec 2017] by the health ministry.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL
