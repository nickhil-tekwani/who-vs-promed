A case of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) was
reported Monday in northern Denmark, the government said. The 4-year-old
cow was immediately slaughtered while the rest of the herd was put under
observation.
"It's totally incomprehensible. In Denmark, we have done all that is
possible to avoid this," said Lennart Korsgaard Nielsen, chairman of the
Danish Livestock and Meat Board.
It was the second known case of BSE detected in this country. The first one
occurred in 1992 when the disease was found on an animal imported from
Britain.
The case was detected in a herd in the northern part of the Jutland
peninsula, which has the largest cattle population in Denmark (364 500 head
in 1998).
Panic swept Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s after British-raised
cattle contracted BSE and it was linked to a brain-wasting disease in
humans. The European Union ruled in August British beef was again safe for
import, although France has maintained its ban.

Mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) has been detected
for the first time since 1992 in Denmark, which prides itself on strict
food hygiene and veterinary control standards, the ministry of food and
agriculture said on Monday.
"I can confirm that there has been an outbreak. We don't know very much
about it yet but we are looking into it urgently," a ministry spokeswoman
told [news reporters by telephone.
The 1 cow found with BSE was euthanized immediately.
Denmark's only previous known case of BSE was in August 1992 when one
single cow, imported from Britain, was found to have contracted the
disease. At that time, the whole herd was put down and cremated
immediately, an official at the Danish Livestock and Meat Board said.
Denmark has some two million cattle, 700 000 of which are cows.
People can fall ill with new variant-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nv-CJD),
the human form of BSE.
