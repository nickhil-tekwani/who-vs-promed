New apple disease defoliates trees
----------------------------------
In 2010, severe leaf fall was observed before harvest in untreated apple trees in eastern Switzerland. Scientists of Agroscope were able to show that the reason was the fungal disease marssonina blotch, which previously had not been reported in the region. Since then, the disease has been spreading. This year (2013), many untreated apple trees are showing severe loss of leaves already in mid September. Healthy trees do not lose their leaves until November. Disease hot spots can be observed in some organic orchards.

In Asia, marssonina blotch is one of the most important apple diseases. In central Europe, the disease has been spreading since 2010. Affected trees have also been reported from northern Italy, southern Germany, and Austria.

Surveys have shown that crop varieties vary in their sensitivity to the disease, and some important cultivars are susceptible. Some genetic resistance has been observed in wild _Malus_ species and these could be included in resistance breeding programmes. However, developing resistant cultivars is likely to take several decades. In the meantime, practical control measures are being investigated.

[Marssonina blotch (MB) of apple is caused by the fungus _Diplocarpon mali_. It has been found in some countries in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Infections first appear on mature leaves. Symptoms may include spots on leaves and fruit as well as severe premature leaf fall. In affected orchards, apples nearing maturity are often seen hanging from defoliated branches. MB affects size, colour, and quality of fruit making the produce unsaleable. It also reduces fruit set in the following season.

The fungus is reported to survive between seasons in fallen leaf litter, and spores are spread by mechanical means and wind. MB development is favoured by humid conditions. Multiple cycles of infection may occur in one crop leading to severe epidemics. Disease management includes phytosanitary measures, cultural techniques, and fungicides.

_D. mali_ has been added to the alert list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Its emergence in central Europe appears to be another example of a plant disease spreading northward due to warming climate. Previous examples in Europe are bark canker (ProMED-mail post 20110718.2172) and black rot (ProMED-mail post 20090914.3230) of apple caused by _Diplodia mutila_ and _Diplodia seriata_, respectively, as well as soybean wilt caused by _Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens_ (ProMED-mail post 20120809.1235745).
