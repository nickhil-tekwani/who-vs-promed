Molecular Characterization of a New Begomovirus Associated with Tomato
Yellow Leaf Curl and Eggplant Yellow Mosaic Diseases in Thailand.

Station, Baan Khao, Moamg, Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Plant Dis. 87:446, 2003;
published on-line as D-2003-0129-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 15 Jan
2003.
Leaf curl and yellowing symptoms on tomato, and yellow mosaic symptoms on
eggplant, are frequently observed in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand.
In preparation for cloning, DNA was extracted from leaves of 13 symptomatic
tomato and 6 symptomatic eggplant samples by Gilbertson et al (1). Viral
DNA was amplified by polymerase chain PCR using the begomovirus-specific
degenerate primer pair PAL1v1978/PAR1c715 (3), which amplified a 1.4-kb
fragment of DNA-A. All samples, except one eggplant sample, yielded the
expected product.
The 1.4-kb PCR products of one tomato and one eggplant sample were cloned
and sequenced. Both begomoviruses from tomato and eggplant contained a
DNA-B component, amplified using 2 degenerate primer pairs, DNABLC1/DNABLV2
and DNABLC2/DNABLV2 (2).
Based on sequences of the DNA products amplified by the degenerate primer
pairs, specific primers were designed to complete the DNA-A and DNA-B
sequences. Computer-assisted sequence comparisons were performed with
geminivirus sequences available in the laboratory at the Asian Vegetable
Research and Development Center, Taiwan and in the GenBank sequence
database. Both tomato (GenBank Accession Nos. AF511529 and AF511528) and
eggplant (GenBank Accession Nos. AF511530 and AF511527) virus isolates
contain the conserved geminivirus sequence-TAATATTAC on the DNA-A and B.
Based on the high sequence identities of 99 percent DNA-A and 98 percent
DNA-B, these 2 virus isolates are considered to be the same species.
The genome organization of these isolates was the same as Tomato yellow
leaf curl virus Thailand (TYLCV-TH; GenBank Accession Nos. X63015 and
X63016), including 6 ORFs on the DNA-A (AV1, AV2, AC1, AC2, AC3, and AC4)
and 2 ORFs on the DNA-B (BV1 and BC1).
Sequence comparisons showed highest DNA-A sequence identity (73 percent)
with Ageratum yellow vein virus from Singapore (GenBank Accession No.
X74516) and highest DNA-B identity (77 percent) with TYLCV-TH (X63016).
To our knowledge, these tomato- and eggplant-infecting viruses from
Thailand constitute a distinctly novel bipartite Begomovirus species.

[This report is similar to others that have documented the detection of new
begomovirus species, strains, and isolates in Asia. TYLCV infections of
infections in solanaceous crops such as tomato and eggplant can cause
serious crop losses. Up to 90 percent of infected flowers abscise in these
crops after infection, especially in young plants, and thus very few fruits
may be produced. TYLCV is transmitted by whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_ and
_B. argentifolii_), which rapidly spread the virus in warm and humid
climates. If any of our readers in Thailand have information on the degree
of infection in tomato and eggplant, please let me know. According to FAO,
world production of tomato for 2002 was about 108 million metric tonnes, of
which 236 000 metric tonnes were produced in Thailand. -Mod.DH]
