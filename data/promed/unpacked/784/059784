Measles outbreak in Norway in children adopted from China
---------------------------------------------------------
The Nasjonalt Folkehelseinstitut (Norwegian Institute of Public Health,
<http://www.fhi.no/>) was alerted to this outbreak in early April [2004] by
the mother of one of the sick children. A few days later, we became aware
of a similar outbreak of 6 confirmed and 3 possible cases among adoptees
from China who were taken to the United States (US) in March 2004 [1]. Due
to the international character of the outbreak and because we assumed that
some of the children had been infectious during their journey from China to
Norway, an early warning was issued through European Union Public Health
Information Network Health Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases
(EUPHIN HSSCD) on 14 Apr 2004. A response from Spain reported one possible
case of measles in an adoptee from Hunan province in China.
Our epidemiological investigation, which included an internet search and
contact with the parents of the adoptees, found that the Norwegian adoptees
came from the same orphanage in Hunan province as the American adoptees
with measles. The children were all 11-12 months old at the time of the
outbreak, with the exception of one, aged 16 months. The orphanage staff
had informed the adopting parents that the children had not been vaccinated
against measles. The parents were not informed officially, but some of them
reported having heard rumours of an outbreak in the orphanage (there are
around 400 children in the orphanage, of all ages).
The Norwegian parents travelled to China as a single group. They collected
their children from the orphanage on 22 Mar 2004, and left Beijing by
plane, arriving in Norway via Copenhagen on 31 Mar 2004. Before the flight,
one child was admitted to hospital in Beijing due to illness with a rash,
and her journey to Norway was delayed by a few days. The hospital diagnosed
pneumonia, but measles was not confirmed.
3 children came down with fever and a rash shortly after arrival in Norway,
and 2 of them were admitted to hospital. One case was laboratory-confirmed
as measles in the hospital, one was clinically diagnosed as a typical case
of measles, and the 3rd was initially regarded as not measles. Later,
laboratory testing at the reference laboratory at the Folkehelseinstitut
(serum and saliva) confirmed measles in all 4 children who had developed a
rash, including the child who had been admitted to hospital in Beijing.
The children who went to the US and developed measles became ill between 22
Mar and 6 Apr. The Norwegian cases became ill between 24 Mar and 2 Apr. The
Spanish case became ill during the flight to Spain on 1 May.
The 4 uninfected children were not tested for susceptibility. 2 of the 4
children who stayed well during the outbreak were given immunoglobulin on 6
Apr 2004. At least one of the measles patients admitted to hospital in
Norway was malnourished, but all the children with measles are reported to
have recovered fully. There have been no reports of secondary cases in
Norway during this outbreak.
The vaccination programme in Norway includes one dose of measles, mumps,
and rubella vaccine (MMR) at the age of 15 months and one at the age of 13
years. The coverage of MMR in children aged 2 years has been slightly below
the coverage of the other programme vaccines, and has been about 90 per
cent in recent years (slightly lower since 2001).
Over the past 4 years, 0-8 cases of measles have been notified per year in
Norway, all either imported or linked to importation, and seldom resulted
in any secondary cases in the country. Many of the measles cases in recent
years have been in refugee children who have fallen sick shortly after
arrival in Norway.
At present we regard Norway as free from endemic measles, but with MMR
coverage somewhat below the desired level, we must be prepared for
outbreaks in connection with imported cases. This outbreak is a reminder
that children adopted abroad may bring diseases into their new home
country. Adoption agencies should work with the authorities in the country
of origin to make sure that adoptees receive the necessary vaccines and
that vaccinations are properly documented. In situations of outbreaks, such
as measles, particular care should be taken in the country of origin that
children are not brought to their new country before possible risk of
communicable disease is clarified and controlled.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has ambitious objectives of reducing
measles in the world, and of eventual eradication. The WHO European Region
has specifically targeted elimination of measles by 2010 [2]. For Norway,
the challenges are to maintain and improve MMR coverage and to maintain
surveillance, adequate diagnosis, and timely implementation of necessary
actions when cases appear.

[The outbreak in the orphanage in China -- with importations of cases of
measles to the USA, Spain, and Norway -- serves as a reminder of the
presence of measles internationally and the need to adhere to vaccination
schedules. After identification of a case in Norway, through the use of the
European Union Public Health Information Network Health Surveillance System
for Communicable Diseases (EUPHIN HSSCD), an additional probable case was
identified in Spain -- further demonstrating the value of increased
communication networks. - Mod.MPP]
