The cholera outbreak in Papua New Guinea's Madang is still worsening
with more than 300 people now being treated for the illness. An
epidemiologist with the World Health Organization, Alexander Rosewell,
says local authorities are still considering whether to declare a
public health emergency as has been done in neighbouring Morobe
province.

Rosewell says most affected people come from a settlement just outside
of Madang city. "Approximately 320 cases have come through health
facilities in Madang, they are suspected cases. In terms of laboratory
confirmation, we now have 10laboratory confirmed cases from Port
Moresby's laboratory, as well as 22 confirmations from laboratories
from Madang." Rosewell says they hope to establish a longer-term
special cholera treatment facility in the next few days.

Diarrhoea: 484 more hospitalized in 24 hours
--------------------------------------------
Experts blamed contaminated sources of water as well as climate change
for the sudden outbreak of diarrhoea in different areas of Dhaka and
Pabna district recently.

A total of 484 diarrhoeal patients were admitted to the International
Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research in Bangladesh (ICDDR,B)
hospital yesterday, according to the authorities.

To tackle the outbreak, the ICDDR,B has already established a
makeshift treatment corner on the premises and discussed with the
Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and Dhaka City
Corporation to find a place for a mobile or temporary camp to provide
immediate treatment to the affected people of Badda.

People of Nayanagar at Badda and Jagannathpur -- near Bashundhara
residential area -- are the worst sufferers of the disease that broke
out early in the month, said Dr M Shahadat Hossain, scientist and head
of ICDDR,B long stay unit.

Immediately, the ICDDR,B collected stool, rectal swab and water
samples from the area and the laboratory investigation found 60
percent patients suffering from cholera. The report on the water
samples would be available today, said another scientist of the centre.

60 percent of diarrhoea patients come from Badda, 11 from Gulshan, 7
percent from Mirpur and 6 percent from Lalbagh area, according to the
ICDDR,B record.

The immense pressure on water and sanitation due to over-population,
climate change and contamination of water are the major causes for
spread of diarrhoea -- even in this off period during the month of
November, said Dr Shahadat.

Sumona, mother of a 7-year old boy, busy yesterday to find an auto
rickshaw at the Norda crossing to take her son to ICDDR,B said ?We
live in a slum at Badda. Last week, diarrhoea inflicted all of my
family members.? ?We did not find any smell from the tube well water,
but there were some very small substances and we thought it would not
be harmful,? she added.

In another incident, the director of disease control and line director
of DGHS requested the ICDDR,B to conduct an investigation in Pabna
district as a large number of people were suffering from diarrhoea in
the first week of October.

According to an investigation report, due to contaminated water a
total of 1580 people suffered from diarrhoea in October and 1467 in
September this year 2009] while the number was only 618 and 668
respectively in the previous year.


[These are very probably cases of cholera, but Bangladesh does not
officially report it as such for a well-founded fear of losing seafood
exports.
