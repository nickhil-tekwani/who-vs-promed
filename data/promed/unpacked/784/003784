Since early November [2015] disease outbreaks in pigs have occurred around the nation, including localized outbreaks of FMD in Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shanxi, affecting local pig prices. The effect of FMD in Jiangsu has been especially large, causing a reduction in local pig prices in early to mid November and reluctance to bring in live pigs from elsewhere. Once outbreaks stabilize, pig supplies become tight for a while, causing prices to rise.

In Guangdong where epidemic diarrhea and respiratory disease have occurred, local pig prices have also been under pressure, causing local prices to drop for a while under 8 RMB [Chinese yuan] per jin (16 RMB/kg) [USD 2.50/kg].

[FMD is regarded to be endemic in China. According to the People's Republic of China page in the WRLFMD website, the following serotypes have been recorded throughout the years:
FMDV-O: 1958, 1986, 1999-2001, 2003, 2005, 2010-2014
FMDV-A: 1951, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964, 2009-2010, 2013-2014
FMDV-C: 0000
FMDV-Asia 1: 1958, 2005-2009
FMDV-SAT 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 2: 0000
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000

According to the stipulations of OIE's International Animal Health Code, immediate notifications are prescribed if/when there is a significant change in the epidemiology of an endemic disease or following the appearance of a new or exotic strain. Otherwise, all FMD outbreaks and the relevant statistics and applied measures are to be reported twice yearly in the semi-annual reports, summarised in the annual report.

Of the 3 separate outbreaks reported by China in 2014, 2 have been reportedly "resolved", one is still regarded by China as "continuing", namely the outbreak which started in November 2014 in Jiangsu, affecting swine, caused by FMD serotype O Myanmar 98 (see 20141126.2992235). So far, only one focus, caused by this strain, has been reported (no additional outbreaks as far as April 2015, when follow-up report no 1 was submitted). - Mod.AS
