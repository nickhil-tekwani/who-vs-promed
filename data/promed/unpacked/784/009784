Officials in North Dakota are investigating the deaths of 58 pregnant cows on 29 Jul [2021] in a pasture near Jamestown.

Rancher [BA] described the deaths as "peculiar" to KFYR TV in Bismarck. He found the dead cows where they were grazing on the Arrowwood National Wildlife Refuge approximately 100 mi [161 km] northwest of Fargo. Eighty cows in the pasture survived. Arrowwood is managed by the US Fish & Wildlife Service.

An investigation was launched by the Stutsman County Sheriff's department and the North Dakota Stockmen's Association. North Dakota State University veterinarian and livestock stewardship specialist Gerald Stokka was called in to examine the cows.

"We knew it wasn't lightning, because we hadn't had any thunderstorms in several months, so that was ruled out right away," Stokka told KFYR. "We went through this list of things that could cause high-death loss in a very short period of time."

Anthrax was also ruled out.

"The death loss was certainly way above almost any expectation of a natural cause, a natural infection, a natural disease, or a natural exposure to some toxins," Stokka said.

[BA], a 4th-generation rancher, said the cattle had a value of USD 100,000.

"It's extremely saddening, frustrating, emotional to think someone else would have such disregard for animal life. I don't understand, just not designed that way as a rancher. Our job is to take care of animals," said [BA].

The surviving cows are due to calve within the next 2-10 weeks. Long-term effects from the incident are unknown.

The North Dakota Stockmen's Association and the owner are offering up to USD 40,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.

Call the Stutsman County Sheriff's Department at 701-251-6232 or the NDSA at 701-290-3993 or 701-390-2975 with information.

A North Dakota ranch and the North Dakota Stockmen's Association have put up a USD 40,000 reward for information about the deaths of 58 pregnant cows that were grazing on the Arrowwood National Wildlife Refuge.

The cows were found dead on 29 Jul [2021] on land leased by the ranch. Of the 138 cows grazing in the pasture, 58 were dead and 15 more suffered spontaneous abortions. After testing ruled out lightning, anthrax, blue-green algae, clostridial disease, lead poisoning, lack of water, or naturally occurring nitrate toxicity, investigators have launched a criminal investigation.

At a news conference held in at the Jamestown Law Enforcement Center on Wed 1 Sep [2021], officials with the North Dakota Stockmen's Association, Stutsman County Sheriff's Department, and North Dakota State University joined rancher [BA] to discuss the case.

[BA] said he had checked the cows the week prior, on 23 Jul [2021]. The cows in the pasture were in his fall calving herd, which would be due to calve in September and October [2021]. His crew was busy with artificially inseminating their larger spring calving herd. A crew on horseback went to move the fall-calving cows to a new pasture on 29 Jul [2021] and found the dead animals.

"I immediately went to the pasture, and the whole process kind of started with calling the state veterinarian and the correct officials needing to be there to help us figure out the what and the whys immediately, that there wasn't a threat to the other livestock, ourselves, or anybody else in the surrounding area," [BA] said.

Anthrax was an immediate concern. Anthrax has been confirmed in other cattle in the state this year [2021], and it can be dangerous to humans as well. But after anthrax was ruled out, North Dakota State University Extension veterinarian Gerald Stokka and 3 veterinarians from the North Dakota Veterinary Diagnostic Lab came out and did necropsies on the animals on an unseasonably warm day.

"It was not pleasant conditions at all," Stokka said.

Stokka, at the news conference, said the deaths appeared to have occurred within about a 48-hour window and seemed to indicate a "point-source event," which narrowed down the possible causes of death.

"Without being able to stand on 100% certainty of this, it's my opinion that somehow these cattle had access to non-naturally occurring nitrates, which can come from a number of different sources," Stokka said.

Stokka said there is no evidence at this time to definitively say where the nitrates could have come from.

"There's no way I can know any of this for sure," he said. "What we're trying to do is rule things out that might be suspicious."

Stokka said "there are ways to accomplish" nitrate toxicity if someone were to "set out to do so." Dry urea is one possibility, he said. He recalled an incident when he worked in Kansas where dry urea was applied to an area and some spilled. Cattle walked by and ate it and died.

"Why would cattle do that?" he asked. "I don't know, but they will."

"Whether it's dry urea or placed in the water, I'm not sure," he said.

Stokka said there were low levels of nitrates in the water, but not enough to have caused the magnitude of death loss as occurred. Plus, the surviving cattle were moved to an adjacent pasture with the same water source without incident, indicating the water was not the problem.

Stutsman County Sheriff's Investigator Jason Falk said 2 hay fires at [BA's] ranch, in "very close" proximity to the pasture where the cattle died, also are under investigation. Those fires, on 10 and 22 Apr [2021], have been labeled "highly suspicious" and resulted in the loss of 2000 bales of hay, worth USD 200,000.

[BA] said the incidents have been an "unnecessary distraction" in a year already full of challenges. Ranchers become resilient to occasional animal losses, he said.

"But typically, you don't experience much more than maybe a percent or a percent and a half death loss, and it may be kind of normal industry standards," he said. "This is a significant death loss. It's not normal."

He said they wanted to know if there was some kind of management problem or accident that could have caused the cattle deaths, but it doesn't appear to be the case.

"Unfortunately, we've had to come to this conclusion, and it is very suspicious: there was something else involved, and it wasn't natural to cause this," he said.

[BA] and his family have put up USD 26,000 in rewards for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever was responsible for the cattle deaths, and the North Dakota Stockmen's Association offered another USD 14,000, Chief Brand Inspector Blaine Northrop said. Falk said there was no known connection between the cattle deaths and the shooting deaths of 2 cows in Kidder County, which occurred earlier in July [2021]. A USD 24,000 reward has been offered in that case.

Anyone with information can contact the Stutsman County Sheriff's Department's tip line at 701-251-6232, North Dakota Stockmen's Association Deputy Brand Inspector Fred Frederikson at 701-290-3993, or Chief Brand Inspector Blaine Northrop at 701-390-2975.

[The articles indicate a few things that were ruled out in the death of these cattle. However, there is no mention of prussic acid having been ruled out. Prussic acid may not be able to be found in the carcasses if there are a few days between death and testing. However, one has to wonder if there were any cyanogenic plants in the area. Plants producing prussic acid often include Johnson grass [or Johnsongrass, _Sorghum halepense_], especially rapidly growing Johnson grass. It would seem appropriate to get a toxicologist to check the plants having been grazed on at the time of the deaths. The timing of death is important, as plants may have been growing/flourishing or even dying at the time of the animals' death but may be in a different growth stage now.

The article mentions ruling out blue-green algae. Blue-green algae may be in a pond or water source and, if blown to one side of water, some cattle may consume it and not others. Furthermore, weather conditions can cause the blue-green algae to bloom or to die off. This may have affected any analysis the lab performed.

This incident is out of the ordinary, and there is quite a reward for finding the cause of these deaths. We look forward to any other developments or new information. - Mod.TG
