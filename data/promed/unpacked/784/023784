Cyprus in new foot and mouth scare
----------------------------------
The results of new tests on Cyprus sheep indicate that the Mediterranean
island may be facing its 1st outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in
more than 40 years, the agriculture ministry said on Saturday [3 Nov 2007].

The authorities have imposed a 3-km (2-mile) protection zone around the
farm at the centre of the scare in Dromolaxia close to the island's main
international airport at Larnaca, the ministry's veterinary services
department said. [See maps at

and <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CY/3/Dhromolaxia.html>. - Mod.AS]

If definitive results expected on Monday [5 Nov 2007] confirm the outbreak
of the highly contagious disease, an estimated 150 000 animals face being
culled.

The new alert came just days after an exclusion zone on dozens of farms in
the Dromolaxia area was lifted when an earlier scare on another farm just
half a km (a third of a mile) away proved a false alarm.

The new batch of samples sent for analysis at an EU-accredited laboratory
in Britain showed a "strong suspicion" the animals on Cyprus had contracted
the disease, the ministry said. "This is the 1st time that lab results from
the overseas laboratory indicate a serious suspicion of FMD," it added. The
authorities said an EU expert has been dispatched to the island to monitor
and evaluate the situation.

The last reported outbreak of FMD on the island was in 1963.

[It has not made known what kind of samples (foot/buccal tissue? sera?)
have been sent to the reference laboratory from the previous suspected
flock of sheep as well as from the current one, and on what grounds has the
suspicion been raised.

Cyprus bans vaccination against FMD, hence the entire ruminant population
(exceeding 60 000 cattle and 600 000 sheep and goats, excluding livestock
in the Turkish controlled territory of the island) is susceptible.

It would be helpful to note what the FMD situation is in the Turkish
controlled, northern part of the island and if similar suspicions have been
raised there. Dromolaxia is situated about 5 km from the Larnaca
international airport, and 20-25 km from the border with the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus. According to the data of the World reference
laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, the last occurrence of FMD in Cyprus was
recorded in 1964 (Serotypes A and O). - Mod.AS
