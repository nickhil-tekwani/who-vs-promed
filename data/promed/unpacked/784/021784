Another case of anthrax in SD in 2007
---------------------------------------
Anthrax has appeared in South Dakota livestock for the 2nd time this
year [2007]. Dr. Sam Holland, State Veterinarian, reports the disease
has struck a cattle herd in Brule County.
Anthrax was confirmed today, 24 Jul 2007, in a 100-cow cattle herd
pastured southwest of Kimball. The death total was 11 head. This herd
had not previously been vaccinated for anthrax. The herd was
processed early this morning in accordance with the state
veterinarian recommendations prior to lab confirmation which was
received at noon today.
Dr. Holland reports there have been numerous reports of livestock
losses, which evidence suggests are heat related. Some involve
significant numbers of over 100 head. Producers are urged to seek
veterinary advice whenever numerous deaths occur.
"I am having my staff collect samples from local veterinarians and
hand delivering them to the Brookings lab to rule out anthrax, other
infectious or toxic diseases," stated Dr. Holland.
It is important that producers take preemptive action in this heat in
confinement settings to:
a.) Ensure adequate good quality water ;
b.) Provide shade if at all possible. Allow access to tree areas,
improvising netting or such (allowing adequate air flow);
c.) Timely sprinkling of animals with water from sprayers obtained
from neighbors or farm supply companies such as elevators. Sprinkling
must occur prior to heat exhaustion when animals' ability to regulate
body temperature is lost;
d.) Swine and poultry confinement operators are reminded to
continuously monitor electricity and water supplies to avoid failure
of exhaust fans, air curtains, etc.; and
e.) Handling and transport must be avoided in the extreme heat, and
exhibitions must monitor air flow, provide fans, water baths for
livestock and continual supply of fresh water. This applies to
animals and handlers alike.

Another case of anthrax hits South Dakota
---------------------------------------------------------
South Dakota's 2nd case of livestock anthrax this year [2007] killed
11 cows in Brule County, according to the state Animal Industry Board.
Anthrax spores occur naturally in the soil. Drought, floods or wind
expose the spores and they can be ingested when livestock graze close
to the ground.
The state's 1st case of livestock anthrax this year was in Brown
County, where one heifer died.

Heat kills South Dakota cattle, anthrax threatens
-------------------------------------------------
Over a thousand head of cattle in northeast South Dakota died from
extreme heat stress Monday and Tuesday [23-24 Jul 2007]. And while
the threat of cattle losses from extreme heat appears to be
moderating in South Dakota, anthrax remains a threat to cattle across
the state.
That's according to Dr. Sam Holland, South Dakota state veterinarian,
who told Brownfield that after several days of high heat, high
humidity and virtually no air movement, the cattle that perished
earlier this week simply succumbed after losing the ability to
regulate their temperature. And he says while such extreme weather
conditions aren't unknown in South Dakota, they hadn't occurred in
that part of the state for many years, catching the producers
involved off guard. But according to Holland, further heat losses in
South Dakota aren't likely.
"We've got people now getting out in the morning before the heat of
the day, before these animals get heat stressed to where they start
losing their ability to regulate their body temperature," Holland
said. They're getting the water to them and getting them sprinkled
and sprayed earlier."
Holland pointed out pork and poultry producers also need to be
cognizant of the heat. He said if electricity to animal housing
facilities goes out for even a short period of time, death losses can be total.
In the meantime, Holland said the hot and humid weather is also
favorable for anthrax, and an animal tested positive for the disease
Tuesday [24 Jul 2007] at a location south of highway I-90. According
to Holland, when anthrax turns up in a cattle herd a whole cascade of
consequences follow. That's why he strongly encourages South Dakota
cattle producers to include anthrax in their vaccination regimen.
"I've never talked to a producer who's lost animals from anthrax that
said, 'I'm sure glad I didn't vaccinate and waited to handle it once
it occurred,'" Holland quipped.
Holland also urged quick testing for anthrax in the case of sudden
cattle death loss. He said early diagnosis can help reduce costs
related to containment and clean-up efforts.

[High temperatures stress livestock severely. It is not unusual in
some states to have large fans built into milking sheds and such to
try to bring the summer temperatures down. The heat also
significantly reduces the innate resistance and as a result brings
down the LD50 necessary to infect and kill cattle with anthrax. Apart
from animals dying from heat stress these herds will also witness a
range of other conditions such as ephemeral fevers, increased
mastitis rates and such indicative of a reduced health status. And
tucked in amongst them will be cases of anthrax. These need to be
identified so that soil recontamination is not allowed to occur and
that the carcasses do not go for rendering and recylcing. -Mod.MHJ]
