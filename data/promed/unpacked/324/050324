Guava production in Western Cape province is increasing due to the absence of the devastating guava wilt which is rife in Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces in the north of the country. The national guava industry depends entirely on one single cultivar, Fan Retief, which would come under serious threat if the disease were to spread south.

A disease resistant cultivar was developed in 2000, but in 2009, it became susceptible as well. It is thought that the pathogen mutated to break host resistance. The disease has become more aggressive and there is no chemical control. It kills the trees and is soil borne, so new trees cannot be planted in previously infected orchards. It is not clear why the wilt does not occur at the Cape. Due to the high risk, guava trees cannot be transferred to the south.

In the north, guava production has decreased dramatically, with 70 per cent less produce offered at the Johannesburg markets within the last 2 years. The expected productive life span of guava orchards has decreased from 30 to around 10 years due to the wilt.

[Guava wilt in South Africa is caused by the fungus _Nalanthamala psidii_. The pathogen causes a serious disease and has also been reported from Malaysia and Taiwan. Symptoms include a quick wilting process of leaves, starting in the upper crown and spreading downwards, followed by necrosis of leaves and branches, defoliation and death of the tree.

In South Africa, an estimated 80 per cent of northern guava plantings are thought to have been lost to wilt in the 1980s and 1990s. The resistant cultivars mentioned above were rootstocks (TS-G1 and TS-G2) protecting grafted susceptible fruit producing scions from infection. Emergence of new host resistance breaking fungal strains have placed the national guava industry under threat again. Strict quarantine measures have so far been able to prevent a spread of the fungus to the south.

A guava wilt due to _Fusarium_ species occurs in India and the surrounding region. Other fungal species and also nematodes have been identified in wilt-affected guava plants in different areas. A "slow" and a "quick" form of wilt are reported, which may be due to different pathogen combinations.
