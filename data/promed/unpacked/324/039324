PILCHARD MORTALITY SOUTH AUSTRALIA - UPDATE
Update of spread:
Following reports from commercial fishermen of pilchard deaths in the south
eastern part of Spencer Gulf beginning on 4 October, Primary Industries and
Resources South Australia (PIRSA) has confirmed pilchard kills from Spencer
Gulf, the vicinity of Kangaroo Island and at Coffin Bay on the Eyre
Peninsula. To the west of south Australia, dead pilchards have been sighted
as far as Streaky Bay; the most eastern sightings are from Victor Harbour.
The extent of the kill is still expanding, particularly westwards.
There are no reports about dead individuals from other fish species, or
cephalopods.
More than 95% of the dead pilchards are mature fish, over 13 cm length, in
otherwise good body condition without overt or gross post mortem signs of
disease.
Diagnostic testing:
Current fish testing includes gross pathology, histopathology,
bacteriology, viral culture, electron microscopy and molecular virology.
Results of testing so far indicate that affected fish have gill lesions
(epithelial hyperplasia) similar to those observed in the 1995 kill.
To date, electron microscopic examination of ultra-thin sections as well as
by negative contrast staining has not detected any virus particles,
however, sample quantity and quality (autolysis; sloughing off of gill
epithelium) have been insufficient to reach definitive conclusions.
In the 1995 event, the pilchard herpesvirus - although being visualised by
EM in gills of affected pilchards - could not be cultured in any of the
fish cell lines used. The herpesvirus was never conclusively shown to be
the causative agent of the mortality.
Water samples taken do not indicate the presence of toxic algae.
Control measures:
As a precautionary measure, Primary Industries and Resources South
Australia has formally suspended commercial fishing for pilchards
throughout the State until 31 October. The fishing industry in SA and
authorities in Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania are closely
monitoring coastal waters for any signs of further pilchard deaths. The
Australian Fisheries Management Authority has also closed the pilchard
fishery in Commonwealth waters.
Public health issues:
Commercial users of frozen, locally harvested pilchards in South Australia
had disposed of their stocks several weeks before the recent deaths. As a
precautionary measure, the South Australian Health Commission has cautioned
the public against the taking of dead pilchards.
Strategic emergency management:
On Thursday 15th October, a telephone hook-up under the auspices of
Australia's Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases (CCEAD)
linked States/Territories Directors of Fisheries and States/Territories
Chief Veterinary Officers with Commonwealth authorities and the CSIRO
Animal Health Laboratory.
A multidisciplinary Joint Scientific Working Group was established under
CCEAD, comprising representatives from Commonwealth and State agencies and
covering expertise in public health, epizootiology, marine biology,
oceanography and veterinary medicine, to identify issues of concern and to
recommend on surveillance, diagnosis and further studies to determine the
cause of this event.
The Joint Scientific Working Group met in person in Adelaide on Friday 16th
October. As an ad hoc measure, an up-graded surveillance and sampling
program was decided, to meet the need of all agencies involved. It was
decided to expand the diagnostic testing to cover a wider range of putative
disease agents.
Enhanced surveillance and sampling was initiated over the weekend. This
includes aerial helicopter surveys to assess the size and the distribution
as well as spread of pilchard mortality (for results see under 'update'
above), as well as sampling dead and moribund fish off shore.
A long term research and monitoring program was agreed upon, including
requests for Federal funding to examine the interactive relationships
between pilchards and their predators (penguins, Australian sea-lions,
Australian salmon). In addition, the Group endorsed projects to gather base
line information on the health status of pilchards and the effects of
natural environmental occurrences such as up-wellings.
The Joint Scientific Working Group also examined the role of imported
pilchards as a factor in the mortality, concluding that there is no
evidence linking this pilchard kill or the 1995 kill with imported frozen
pilchards. However, as a precautionary measure, samples of imported
pilchards are being tested for signs of disease or pathogens.
The Joint Scientific Working Group will be meeting on a regular basis to
monitor the progress of the upgraded sampling program and the additional
diagnostic testing, and report to CCEAD.
