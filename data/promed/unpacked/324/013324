As agriculture officials ramp up the battle against the poultry-killing Newcastle disease outbreak in Southern California, state Veterinarian Annette Jones has issued a directive that state, county and city workers avoid poultry areas in an effort reduce spread of the highly contagious virus. When such visits are unavoidable because of a public-health threat, a strict protocol -- including biosecurity clothing -- is detailed in the guidelines issued by Jones last week.

Friday [17 May 2019] will mark the one-year anniversary since the 1st Newcastle case was identified in Los Angeles. "Remember -- people, equipment and vehicles can easily spread dangerous diseases from one location to another," Jones wrote. "Personnel who spread the disease can be held liable." The California Department of Food and Agriculture could not immediately clarify what penalty, if any, faced public workers who didn't follow protocol.

So far, 1.1 million commercial birds and 120 000 backyard birds -- predominantly chickens -- have been euthanized in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to California Department of Food and Agriculture spokesperson Sandy Cooney. Euthanasia orders remain in place in 15 communities in Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire as state and federal officials gather birds that may have been exposed to the virus.

Additionally, all of Los Angeles County and large portions of San Bernardino and Riverside counties have been under a poultry quarantine since 27 Feb 2019. There is a ban on transporting birds into or out of quarantine areas.

Chickens and eggs do not pose a health threat to consumers provided they are cooked properly, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). "In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected," according to the USDA website. "Signs are usually very mild and limited to conjunctivitis and/or influenza-like symptoms."

Eradication efforts got a boost last month [April 2019] when the USDA allocated USD 45 million in emergency funding, which is allowing state and federal officials to double to 300 the staff working on identifying infected chickens and enforcing quarantines.

While more than one million birds have been euthanized, the USDA tally shows far fewer have actually tested positive. Of the 432 cases identified in the current outbreak, 250 were in Riverside County, 139 in San Bernardino County and 42 in Los Angeles County. Additionally, there has been one each in Ventura and Alameda counties, and one each in Utah and Arizona -- all of which are suspected of being tied to the Southern California outbreak.

Beside urging non-Newcastle public employees to avoid chicken areas, Jones' directive notes that commercial poultry producers have been asked to minimize personnel entering chicken areas. Additionally, guidelines for public workers echo suggestions listed for all people who have been near chickens:
- Those who have live poultry at home should not visit other areas where there are chickens.
- Those visiting a poultry farm or who have been exposed to wild waterfowl should wait 72 hours before subsequent visits to poultry farms.
- Those visiting a poultry farm should wash their vehicle first.
- Freshly laundered clothes are recommended for those visiting poultry.
- Biosecurity clothing -- including rubber boots, disposable gloves and hair nets -- should be worn.

[This disease has been rolling around in California since 2018. Every week there are updates on how many birds are being euthanized. It is now reaching a crisis, as we recently have seen euthanasia orders for large areas.

When the first few cases of this disease broke out, these types of biosecurity warnings should immediately have gone out with spot checks to ensure compliance of all state individuals. There should have been biosecurity education on how to safeguard the pet flocks to all individuals owning birds, as pets or commercial enterprises.

We are walking down the same road as 2003. So one wonders, where is the corporate and collective memory? Why are we repeating history? Why didn't these types of biosecurity warnings go out in 2018? How much education has been done on teaching the hobby flock owners, whether they are pets or avian athletes or commercial producers, how to do this? I somehow feel like I am living the old adage of shutting the barn door after the horse is out, as this kind of precaution/advice may be the proverbial day late and dollar short. - Mod.TG
