The implications of the recent discovery that wild rodents may carry new
deadly viruses are disturbing. I am particularly concerned for the safety
of students (that I am supervising) carrying out studies on tick-borne
diseases that involve trapping and handling mice, such as _Clethrionomys
glareolus_. According to Italian law, I am responsible for the health of
students working with me, and I should provide them with all means and
suggestions to minimize risks for their health. Should we just stop
trapping mice?

[If there is concern about wild rodents carrying "new and deadly viruses",
what about old and deadly viruses? For as long as there have been
mammalogists studying rodents in the Americas, there have also been
hantaviruses infecting these rodents. Nonetheless, a serosurvey of
mammalogists did not provide any evidence that these people had been
infected. Either those who had become infected had died and didn't show up
to be bled or the infection rate is very low; the CDC suspects the latter.
_Clethrionomys glareolus_ (bank vole) is a known host of Puumala virus, a
hantavirus responsible for Nephropathia Epidemica in Europe. I am certain
that small mammals, and the ticks for which they are hosts, carry all sorts
of viruses in Italy (Bhanja and others) and elsewhere.
I suggest you tell your students there are no guarantees in this world but
that if they take PROPER safety precautions they can minimize their
exposure to potential human pathogens. - Mod.CHC
