Health authorities in Meghalaya today sounded an alert following
reports of 2 people being infected with Japanese encephalitis [JE]
[virus], officials said. The mosquito-borne disease had been reported
from Ri-Bhoi and West Khasi Hills districts in Eastern part of
Meghalaya, a senior health official said.

"Both the patients infected with Japanese encephalitis [virus] are
undergoing treatment in 2 city hospitals here," Director of Health
Services AS Kynjing told UNI. He said instructions have been given to
hospitals to collect blood samples from all suspected patients,
including malaria patients, in order to confirm the disease.

Dr Kynjing said a team of doctors have rushed to Langja village in
the state's West Khasi district to ascertain the outbreak of Japanese
encephalitis in the valley areas.

The disease [virus], transmitted from pigs [and wild birds - Mod.TY]
through mosquitoes, strikes during the period of April to September.

Encephalitis causes inflammation of the brain tissue, producing
symptoms of high fever, headache, rigidity of the neck, and loss of
voice and involuntary movement of the body.
