Invasive algae killing Costa Rican coral reef
A tropical algae thriving on fertilizers from hotel golf courses and
badly treated sewage is killing one of Costa Rica's most important
coastal reefs, scientists say. The green, feather-like algae is
spreading along the reefs of Culebra Bay in Costa Rica's northwestern
Gulf of Papagayo, a popular scuba diving spot and home to a rare
species of coral. The algae blocks the sunlight and suffocates the reefs.
A tourism and construction boom along the palm tree-lined beaches is
creating nitrogen- and phosphate-rich waste that feeds the algae,
known as _Caulerpa sertularioides_, and Costa Rica is only just
becoming aware of the problem.
"It's an ecological disaster," said Cindy Fernandez, a marine
biologist with the nonprofit MarViva Association, who alerted the
Costa Rican government to the threat, which is now being taken on by
the state-run University of Costa Rica.
Scientists say about 80 percent of the reef area, which stretches for
about a mile and a half (2.4 km) along the coast line, is covered in the algae.
The aggressive algae spreads when even the smallest sliver comes
loose, from the likes of strong currents or dive boats dropping
anchor, to root itself in another part of the reef. Even the sweep of
a diver's hand or the kick of a diver's fin can send a fragment
swirling away to start another patch. That means experts cannot pull
it up like weeds.
"If you pull it up it will reproduce faster," said Jenny Asch,
coordinator of the government's marine conservation program, who is
leading efforts to find a way to eradicate the algae.
If left unchecked, the algae could also severely damage the ecosystem
of the bay, allowing non-native species of fish to come in and
displace the native species. The highly invasive Mediterranean strain
of the algae, _Caulerpa taxifolia_, was discovered in Southern
California in June 2000, where scientists have used solid chlorine
blocks to eradicate the pest. Costa Rican scientists do not yet know
if similar eradication techniques will work on Caulerpa sertularioides.
The algae is the latest challenge facing Costa Rican authorities as
the Central American country struggles with conserving its unique
tropical biodiversity while attracting tourists and marketing itself
as an ecotourism paradise.

_Caulerpa taxifolia_ is a marine green alga believed to have been
accidentally introduced into the Mediterranean Sea. It forms
continuous meadows from the surface to more than 30 meters (98 feet)
deep; has been found in water to 100 meters (328 feet) deep
(Boudouresque et al, 1995). Meadows of _Caulerpa taxifolia_ in the
Mediterranean can attain exceptional densities, while in its native
tropical seas the plant is usually isolated (Meinesz and Hesse,
1991). It reproduces by fragmentation; sexual reproduction has not
been observed at 10 meter (32.8 feet) depth, while reported biomass
rates up to 700 g (dry weight) m2 (375 tons of wet biomass per acre)
(Meinesz et al, 1994). _Caulerpa taxifolia_ protects itself by
producing substances that are toxic to the Mediterranean's 2 main
macro-herbivores, sea urchins and their eggs (as well as to hamsters
and mice) (Lemee et al., 1993), and the fish _Sarpa salpa_ toxicity
is highly seasonal: highest in July-November, lowest in March-April.
Although it appears native to the Caribbean, where previously it has
not caused a problem, climate changes and water changes may have
altered that previous non-problematic state.
