Further to my report of 4 Feb 2000, I am advising of two further farms with
evidence of virulent Newcastle disease (NCD) virus in New South Wales.
The first farm is at Rossmore, approximately latitude 33*57*S, longitude
150*46*E, (10 km South-South-East of the Orchard Hills layer farm reported
on 12 January). There have been very few deaths and little evidence of
clinical illness in the flock. The farm has been placed in quarantine and
it is proposed it will be vaccinated according to established protocols.
The second farm is at Calala, near Tamworth, approximately latitude 31*8*S,
longitude 150*57*E. The infected farm is a breeder farm of approximately 14
000 birds. The farm recorded low mortalities of 20 birds over four days,
with affected birds showing clinical signs of incoordination, nervous
tremors and green-stained vents. The owners of the farm chose preemptively
to depopulate and render carcasses at their own expense, as a precautionary
measure. This was completed over the last week-end.
The CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory has confirmed the presence of
virulent virus, based on histopathological, immunohistochemical and
molecular virological testing. Virulent virus has been isolated from the
Rossmore property, but isolation attempts are still proceeding with respect
to the Calala property.
