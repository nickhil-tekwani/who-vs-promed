The Department of Health published the final investigation report of the large foodborne outbreak in a well known chain buffet restaurant. The oysters imported from Korea were found to be contaminated with norovirus, which causes diarrheal disease. Epidemiological investigation indicated that consumers became ill after eating raw oysters. The Department of Health will fine the importer NT60 000 to 6 mil [USD 2001 to 200 166], and the 150 000 oysters prohibited from sales have been ordered to be destroyed.

On [25 May 2012] and [2 Jun 2012], Taipei City Bureau of Health received reported of consumers becoming ill following eating at 3 different restaurants of the buffet chain. Customers reported to have suspected foodborne illness with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating sashimi (raw fish) and raw oysters. 62 people reported illness in one week.

At the same time, the United States also indicated that imported raw oyster from South Korea may have been contaminated by norovirus, and were recalled. Therefore, despite initial testing by the Taipei City Bureau of Health done on [19 Jun 2012] found _bacillus cereus_ in the oysters, people still suspected that norovirus was the culprit of the outbreak.

The Department of Health's Food and Drug Administration indicated that following the outbreaks, the Department of Health prohibited the sale of raw oysters from Korea imported by 5 importers. There were a total of 7204 boxes (155 682 oysters). Among the 29 samples taken, _B. cereus_ was found in 4, norovirus and astrovirus in 3. One of the importers with contaminated products was the supplier to the chain restaurant. The Taiwan Food and Drug Administration indicated that human specimens, food specimens, and epidemiological investigations indicated that eating raw oysters was associated with illness, concluding that the cause of the foodborne outbreak was raw oysters.

The Department of Health indicated that all raw oysters imported from Korea will be tested. Since the outbreak on [9 Jun 2012], no more raw oysters from Korea have been brought in by importers.

[Outbreaks of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis can be a consequence of fecal contamination of food or water, and foodborne outbreaks are not uncommon. In particular, contaminated shellfish are major causes of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis, with bivalve molluscs (oysters, mussels, and cockles) being the most common source. These animals are filter-feeders and can become infected where there is discharge of untreated sewage.

Filter-feeding shellfish are a source of infection because they are often consumed partially cooked or raw. Heat treatment at normal cooking temperatures would destroy infectivity. In general, consumption of raw shellfish anywhere in the world should be avoided. - Mod.CP]

[One wonders if there have been norovirus outbreaks in other countries where oysters from these contaminated oyster beds may have been imported and consumed. This outbreak serves as a reminder that we live in a global village.
