Grapevine red blotch disease threatens the US grape industry. First noticed in 2007 at the UC [University of California] Davis Oakville research station, the virus wasn't identified until 2012, and much remains unknown about it or ways to manage it. Currently, the only treatment is to remove the entire vine.

In 2016, Frank Zalom, UC, and collaborators discovered the three-cornered alfalfa hopper [ProMED-mail post 20160610.4276953] was a vector of red blotch, but it may not be the only one. The disease has been detected in California, Oregon, and New York.

A grant will allow UC Davis, UC Berkeley, and Oregon State University researchers to examine the spread of the disease, potential vectors, and assess its economic impact on grape production and wine quality. "Red blotch is a huge new problem for the grape industry," said Anita Oberholster, UC. "We will be working to understand the disease and develop sustainable management practices to support the grape industry."

[Grapevine red blotch (GRB) has been identified recently as a syndrome that affects fruit ripening. So far it is being reported from the US and Canada on a wide range of grape cultivars, including wine, table, raisin, and rootstock varieties. GRB does not appear to be a new disease but is likely to have escaped detection because its symptoms resemble leafroll disease (associated with several viruses within the family Closteroviridae; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Symptoms of GRB appear in autumn when leaves normally would turn shades of yellow. They may include irregular red(ish) blotches on leaf blades, pink or red veins, occasional reddening of whole leaf blades, as well as slow accumulation of sugars or failure to mature in fruits. Symptoms differ from leafroll disease mainly in that the leaf margins do not roll downwards.

The new geminivirus _Grapevine red blotch virus_ (GRBV; genus _Grablovirus_) has recently been shown to be associated with GRB. GRBV has been detected in the host before appearance of symptoms and also in dormant canes. It is not known so far whether there are any effects on fruit yield or plant longevity. GRBV is transmitted by grafting tools, with infected budwood and via rootstocks. A treehopper (_Spissistilus festinus_; family Membracidae) vector for GRBV has also been identified (ProMED-mail post 20160610.4276953).

GRBV is considered an emerging threat to grape industries. Given the vegetative propagation methods used for grapevines, longevity of the host, and historic international exchange of germplasm, viruses and viroids may be widely distributed in some or many commercial cultivars. They can accumulate over many generations, leading to general decline of plants and severe yield reductions. Disease management of grapevine viruses may include vector control and phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified virus free planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting) is essential.

In the US, in addition to production vineyards, GRBV has also been found in a germplasm collection for distribution of cultivars to growers (ProMED-mail post 20180117.5566550). Isolates were related to 2 different GRBV groups, indicating multiple incursions. The presence of the virus in a germplasm collection compounds the risk of its spread.
