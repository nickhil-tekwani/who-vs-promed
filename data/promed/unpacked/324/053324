Viet Nam's southern Ba Ria Vung Tau province has seen its 1st outbreaks of A/H5N6 bird flu, which have led to the culling of 10 500 chickens, local media reported on Tuesday [6 Aug 2019].

The outbreaks were spotted in 2 communes in Xuyen Moc district on 31 Jul and 1 Aug 2019, and then tests confirmed that some chickens were infected with the bird flu virus, Viet Nam News Agency quoted the provincial Department of Livestock and Animal Health as reporting.

Relevant local agencies have culled 10 500 chickens raised by 2 households in the 2 communes, disinfected surrounding areas, and intensified vaccination among fowl in the district.

In late July 2019, the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said that the outbreaks of A/H5N6 and A/H5N1 bird flu had been reported in 13 communes of 11 localities from the start of 2019, leading to the culling of more than 23 000 poultry.

The bird flu is forecast to widely spread in the remaining months of this year [2019] due to changing weather and surging poultry transportation in time ahead of the lunar new year holiday.

Viet Nam 1st detected the bird flu virus strain A/H5N1 in December 2003, in both humans and fowl. More than 45 million poultry in Viet Nam were culled between 2003 and 2006. Since then, hundreds of thousands of fowl have been killed each year.

In the 2004-2014 period, 127 people in Viet Nam were infected with H5N1, including 64 fatalities, according to the ministry. The country has detected no new human cases of H5N1 infection since 2014.

[Earlier during 2019, HPAI H5N6 and HPAI H5N1 outbreaks were reported by Viet Nam to the OIE (20190705.6553662, 20190524.6485532, 20190314.6365230). The most recent outbreak took place in a backyard holding in Thai Binh province, starting 23 Jun 2019. Viet Nam applies stamping out policy.

Viet Nam has been reporting cases of HPAI H5N6 in poultry since 2014; no human cases have been reported. "Since 2014 (as of 3 Aug 2019), there were 23 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) reported globally, and all occurred in Mainland China. The latest case was reported on 23 Nov 2018." (https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/2019_avian_influenza_report_vol15_wk31.pdf).

To view all HI outbreaks in Viet Nam's poultry since the start of 2019, please visit OIE's interactive map at https://tinyurl.com/y3cfahwx; click on Viet Nam to center; zoom in. H5N1 was shown, earlier, to exhibit a strong north-south divide in Viet Nam, with repeated occurrence in the extreme south of a cluster of high-risk provinces. In contrast, H5N6 was found to be homogeneously distributed throughout Viet Nam (Ref 1). This is also apparent in 2019's map.
