We are currently advising in an additional (3rd) outbreak of EHV-1 infection with cases of myelopathy (EHM). Previously, we reported of 2 outbreaks near Munich, Bavaria, Germany [see 20190204.6294642].

The current, 3rd outbreak, is located in the Nuremberg area, more exactly in the Amberg/Sulzbach-Rosenberg area in eastern Bavaria close to the Czech border. The affected facility is a riding/boarding facility with a mixed horse population, however, mainly composed of warmbloods. On the grounds of the operation there are 5 barn units with one affected. A total of 3 horses were euthanized due to quadriplegia/hind limb paralysis. 2 of them were transported to a state diagnostic laboratory awaiting confirmation of EHV-1 diagnosis. There are 15 horses out of 25 (?) with fevers and additional 3 horses with fevers/ataxia. Nasal swab and EDTA blood samples have been submitted. The facility is under voluntary quarantine as EHV-1 is not a reportable disease in Germany.

Infection with EHV-1 is listed by the OIE but not officially reportable in Germany. The updated information above on its spread to the Amberg/Sulzbach-Rosenberg area in eastern Bavaria is thus of underlined significance to all horse owners/breeders in Germany and those transporting horses to and, in particular, from the affected area. Though the report does not include, for obvious reasons, the exact location of the affected facility, the report, and the details included, will contribute to the required caution/alertness.

Primary infection by EHV-1 is characterised by upper respiratory tract disease of varying severity that is related to the age and immunological status of the infected animal. EHV-1 also causes the more serious complications of abortion, perinatal foal death, or paralytic neurological disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy). Like other herpesviruses, EHV-1 induces long-lasting latent infections and can be reactivated following stress or pregnancy. Most horses are likely to be re-infected multiple times during their lifetime, often mildly or subclinically. This is not a zoonotic disease.

The above and exhaustive additional information on the disease, its diagnosis and vaccines, are available in chapter 2.5.9. of OIE's Manual of terrestrial animal diseases, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/fr/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.09_EQUINE_RHINO.pdf. Both live attenuated and inactivated viral vaccines are available.

Until 2014, the disease was reported to the OIE as equine rhinopneumonitis, but since then, it is reported as equid herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). - Mod.AS
