The Ukrainian Ministry of Health has released the following
information (in Ukrainian) on its website
<http://www.moz.gov.ua/ua/main/press>. Some cases of influenza-like
illness (ILI) and at least one death have been confirmed as due to
influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection.

Currently, there are or have been about 1000 people admitted to
hospitals. (It is unclear from the report whether these numbers are
current or cumulative). More than 100 are being treated in intensive
care units.

There are restrictions on large gatherings. Schools and entertainment
establishments have been closed for 3 weeks.

Another Ministry report (in Ukrainian
<http://www.moz.gov.ua/ua/main/press/?docID=3D13938>) states that as
of Fri 30 Oct 2009, there are over 80 000 suspected cases and 33 deaths.

The report describes 3 features of the outbreak: (1) Complicated
courses in pregnant women, people of working age, children, and the
elderly (but not as many), and people with cardiovascular and
respiratory disease, diabetes, immune deficiency, obesity etc.; (2)
Rapid spread; (3) In some cases, a viral pneumonia with rapid
progression that is difficult to treat.

[ProMED-mail thanks Irene Lai for providing these translations. It is
clear that the outbreak has all the characteristics of influenza
pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection, although a precise diagnosis
has been established only in very few cases. For whatever reason, the
Ukrainian authorities seem reluctant to reach this conclusion.
