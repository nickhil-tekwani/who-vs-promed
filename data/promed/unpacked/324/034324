JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS, IMPORTED - USA EX PHILIPPINES
****************************************************
From: Peter Cowen <Peter_Cowen@ncsu.edu>
Date: Nov. 11, 1997
A thirteen year old girl has been diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis (JE)
after being evacuated to the United States from the Philippines. She is
currently under treatment and in a coma at University of California, San
Franciso hospital. Her symptoms started on September 20th or thereabouts
while on a trip to visit relatives in the Philippines. She initially
complained of blurred vision but symptoms progressed including fever,
convulsions, other neurological signs and coma.
She was not vaccinated for JE and is presumed not to have travelled outside
Manila, so vaccination was not recommended. However, I am not sure that
vaccination guidelines consider the rather large and growing group of
individuals who are born and raised in one country but have strong family
and other reasons to regularly travel to countries where they may not have
developed immunity to endemic diseases. Such individuals are relatively
unprotected when compared to relatives who are well immunized by continous
exposure to endemic disease. Additionally, older siblings or parents are
likewise better protected by previous exposures in the past. However,
people who have family ties in two different countries may travel for
longer periods of time or more frequently than the average tourist but not
stay long enough to develop levels of immunity comparable to the local
population. I wonder if such increasingly common situations as this are
taken into account when developing vaccination protocols.
While this young girl is obviously receiving the best of treatment and is
clearly having a very difficult time, anyone with any ideas should contact
me personally as she is a friend of the family.
