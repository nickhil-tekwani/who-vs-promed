Letter to Senate Leader May Hold a Poison
------------------------------------------
A suspicious substance was found in the mail room of the Senate
office of the majority leader, Senator Bill Frist, on Monday
afternoon, and officials said repeated tests indicated the presence
of the poison ricin.
The Capitol Police said they received the report of the material in a
room of the Dirksen Senate Office Building adjacent to the Capitol
about 3 p.m. and conducted initial tests that came back positive for
ricin. About 16 workers, who were on the fourth floor, were
evacuated, and aides said the material was sent away for testing. Two
of these 3 tests were positive, Police Chief Terrance Gainer said.
Officials said that the ventilation system had been shut down and
that the mail room workers had been moved elsewhere in the building
for medical supervision and decontamination. Dr. Frist, a heart-lung
transplant surgeon who wrote a book advising the public on how to
prepare for a bioterror attack, said no one had shown signs of
sickness.
"Most importantly, nobody has been hurt," Dr. Frist said.
An official with the Federal Bureau of Investigation said Monday
night that if the case appeared to be a criminal or terrorist act
against a member of Congress, the bureau was prepared to begin an
investigation.
Ricin (pronounced RICE-in) could cause illness or death if enough was
ingested, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Envelopes containing anthrax were mailed to the offices of Senators
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, and Patrick J.
Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks. Two
postal workers at an office that processed the envelopes died.

[Ricin is a toxin derived from the castor bean plant (_Ricinus
communis_) This toxin is protein in nature, and is very toxic and one
of the most easily produced plant toxins. It is a lectin consisting
of two polypeptide chains, the A-chain and the B-chain, linked by a
disulfide bond.
The toxicity of castor beans has been known since ancient times, and
more than 750 cases of intoxication in humans have been described.
Although ricin's lethal toxicity is approximately 1000-fold less than
that of botulinum toxin, ricin may have significance as a biological
weapon because of its heat stability and worldwide availability, in
massive quantities, as a by-product of castor oil production.
Ricin was used in the highly publicized assassination of Bulgarian
defector Georgi Markov. In recent years, ricin has become a favorite
tool of extremist individuals or groups who seek to harm others, as
the following examples demonstrate:
-Two tax protesters were convicted in February 1995 of possessing
ricin as a biological weapon. This was the first case of prosecution
under the 1989 Biological Weapons Anti-terrorism Act.
-A retired electrician who had worked on the trans-Alaska pipeline
recently committed suicide in an Arkansas jail after being arrested
under the antiterrorism act for possessing castor beans. Two years
before, a large quantity of ricin toxin and weapons, ammunition, and
gold were found in his car by Canadian customs officials as he
crossed the border from Alaska to Canada.
There is a 100-fold variation in the lethal toxicity of ricin for
various domestic and laboratory animals, per kilogram of body weight.
Of animals tested, the chicken and frog are least sensitive, while
the horse is the most.
Toxicity of ricin also varies with route of challenge. In laboratory
mice, the approximate dose that is lethal to 50% of the exposed
population (LD50) and time to death are, respectively, 3 to 5 mcg/kg
and 60 hours by inhalation, 5 mcg/kg and 90 hours by intravenous
injection, 22 µg/kg and 100 hours by intraperitoneal injection, 24
µg/kg and 100 hours by subcutaneous injection, and 20 mg/kg and 85
hours by intragastric administration. Low oral toxicity reflects poor
absorption of the toxin from the gastrointestinal tract.
The clinical signs, symptoms, and pathological manifestations of
ricin toxicity vary with the dose and the route of exposure.
Experimental animal studies indicate that clinical signs and
pathological changes are largely route specific; for example,
inhalation results in respiratory distress and airway and pulmonary
lesions; ingestion causes gastrointestinal signs and gastrointestinal
hemorrhage with necrosis of liver, spleen, and kidneys; and
intramuscular intoxication causes severe localized pain, muscle and
regional lymph node necrosis, and moderate involvement of visceral
organs.
Although data on aerosol toxicity exposure are not available for
humans, lesions induced by oral and parenteral exposure are
consistent with those seen in experimental animal studies, suggesting
that the same would hold true for aerosol exposures. The only
information on inhalation of ricin in humans is an allergic syndrome
reported in workers exposed to castor bean dust in or around castor
oil processing plants. The clinical picture is characterized by
sudden onset of congestion of the nose and throat, itchiness of the
eyes, urticaria, and tightness of the chest. In more severe cases,
wheezing, leading to bronchial asthma, may also occur, and may last
for several hours. Affected individuals respond to symptomatic
therapy and removal from the source of exposure.
In a recent study of nonhuman primates, inhalational toxicity was
characterized by a dose-dependent preclinical period of 8 to 24
hours, followed by anorexia and progressive decrease in physical
activity. Death occurred 36 to 48 hours after the challenge, time to
death also being dose dependent. Relevant gross and histopathological
changes were confined to the thoracic cavity All monkeys had acute
marked-to-severe fibrinopurulent pneumonia, with variable degrees of
diffuse necrosis and acute inflammation of airways. There were also
diffuse, severe alveolar flooding and peribronchovascular edema
acute tracheitis, and
marked-to-severe purulent mediastinal lymphadenitis. Two monkeys had
acute adrenalitis.
The differential diagnoses of aerosol exposure to ricin would include
staphylococcal enterotoxin B, exposure to pyrolysis by-products of
organofluorine polymers (e.g., Teflon [polytetrafluoroethylene,
manufactured by Du Pont Polymers, Wilmington, Delaware], Kevlar
[polyparaphenyleneterephthalamide, manufactured by Du Pont Advanced
Fiber Systems, Wilmington, Delaware]) or other organohalides, oxides
of nitrogen, and phosgene. Insecticides such as paraquat and
anaphthylthiourea (ANTU), can be spread aerially over large
geographical
areas and are also potent edemagenic agents.
Confirmation of ricin inhalational intoxication would most likely be
through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of a swab
sample from the nasal mucosa; ricin can be identified by this method
for at least 24 hours after the challenge. Because ricin is extremely
immunogenic, individuals surviving a ricin attack would likely have
circulating antibody within 2 weeks after the exposure; serum samples
should be obtained from survivors. Following inhalational
intoxication in laboratory animals, laboratory findings are generally
nonspecific.
The most likely scenarios in which ricin intoxication might be seen
are (1) small-scale battlefield or terrorist delivery of an aerosol
and (2) parenteral administration of the toxin to an individual as an
assassin's tool. Because ricin acts rapidly and irreversibly
(directly on lung parenchyma after inhalation, or is distributed
quickly to vital organs after parenteral exposure), postexposure
therapy is more difficult than with slowly processed, peripherally
acting agents (such as the botulinum toxins or bacterial agents) that
can be treated with antibiotics. Therefore, immunization of personnel
at risk for ricin exposure is even more important than it is for some
of the other potential biological warfare agents.
As is the case in toxicity and pathogenesis of intoxication, the
route of exposure is important in relation to possible modes and
their likelihood of success of prophylaxis and therapy. For oral
intoxication, supportive therapy includes activated charcoal
administration and intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement. For
inhalational intoxication, supportive therapy to counteract acute
pulmonary edema and respiratory distress is indicated. Symptomatic
care is the only intervention presently available to clinicians for
the treatment of incapacitating or lethal doses of inhaled ricin.
Positive end-expiratory ventilatory therapy, fluid and electrolyte
replacement, antiinflammatory agents, and analgesics would likely be
of benefit in treating aerosol-intoxicated humans. As we learn more
about the pathogenesis of intoxication by this route, specific
mediator blocking agents may prove valuable, as well.

3 Senate Buildings Shut After Ricin Is Mailed to Senator
---------------------------------------------------------
3 US Senate buildings were closed today after a suspicious substance
was found in the mail room of the office of the majority leader,
Senator Bill Frist, on Mon. afternoon, 2 Feb 2004. Officials said
repeated tests indicated the presence of the poison ricin. More
definitive test results were expected later today.
Early today, Senator Frist's office announced that the Senate will be
in session as scheduled, starting at 9:45 a.m. But the 3 Senate
office buildings, the Hart, Dirksen and Russell, will be closed while
all unopened mail is collected and removed, forcing the cancellation
of committee meetings scheduled for those
buildings. The Capitol will be open, but all tours have been
canceled, said Bob Stevenson, a spokesman for Senator Frist.
The Capitol Police said they received the report of the material in a
room of the Dirksen building next to the Capitol at about 3 p.m. and
conducted initial tests that came back positive for ricin. The
workers, who were on the 4th floor, were evacuated, and aides said
the material was sent to a location away from the Capitol for testing
in a laboratory setting.
At least 16 people on the floor were decontaminated, and others who
might have been in the area were urged to contact Senate officials,
the Capitol Police Chief, Terrance Gainer, told reporters late Mon, 2
Feb 2004.
Congressional officials said the ventilation system had been shut
down and the mail room workers had been moved to another room in the
building for medical supervision. Dr. Frist, a heart-lung transplant
surgeon who wrote a book advising the public on how to prepare for a
bioterror attack, said no one had shown any signs of sickness.

An official with the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that if the
case appeared to be a criminal or terrorist act against a member of
Congress, the bureau was prepared to begin an investigation.
Ricin could cause illness or potentially death if enough was
ingested, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Envelopes containing anthrax were mailed to the Capitol offices of
Senators Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, and
Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, in 2001, shortly after the Sep
11 attacks. Two postal workers at an office that processed the
envelopes died, and the Hart Senate Office Building was subsequently
closed for months for decontamination.
A new system for handling mail for the Capitol was instituted after
of those assaults. There have been other incidents of suspicious
substances since then, though they have proven to be mainly false
alarms.
"To the best of my knowledge, in a human being, inhaling it has never
hurt anybody," said Dr. Frist, who said the police were following
procedures put in place after the anthrax attacks were being followed.

[It should be noted that it is not entirely clear that the white powdery
substance was found in the mailroom was in an envelope or just in the mailroom.
It also has not been stated what test was used to confirm the presence of
ricin. Immunoassays for ricin have been developed including polyclonal and
monoclonal ELISAs (1, 2) and in a fluoroimmunoassay using the fluorescent dye
Alexa Fluor 647 in RAPTOR, a fiber optic biosensor (3).
Ricin is a phytotoxin that is easily derived from the waste mash from castor
oil production. This material can contain as much as 5 percent ricin. It can
be produced from material available to anyone. The toxin functions as a
protein synthesis inhibitor by removing a single adenine residue form the 28S
ribosomal which prevents the binding of elongation factor-2. Castor oil is
produced from castor beans (actually they are seeds) which come from soft-
spined fruits of _Ricinus communis_. This plant is native to Africa but is
now grown in many areas of the world and can be used as a house or bakcyard
plant. The plants and the seeds are available on the Internet. The oil itself
does not contain the toxin but the bean itself if chewed and ingested can
produce a significant hemorrhagic enteritis which can be, but is not usually,
fatal (4). The name _Ricinus_ is derived from a word for tick and the seeds
actually can appear to look like an engorged tick. The seeds, which are
attractively mottled, have been used to make necklaces.
If used as a biowarfare agent, the ricin is likely to be aerosolized although
massive quantities of ricin are though to be necessary as compared to kilogram
quantities of anthrax spores in order to cause 50% lethality over a 100 square
kilogram area (5). Although Senator Frist stated in the posting that there is
no human data, that is not correct. There is, indeed, limited data describing
the outcome from an inhalation exposure. In the 1940s, sublethal and accidental
exposures were said to have occurred and were manifest 4-8 hours after exposure
with fever, cough, shortness of breath and nausea (6). Studies in rodents
suggest an inhaled ricin aerosol could lead to necrosis of the upper and lower
airway, respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. Chest x-ray
would be expected to show bilateral infiltrates. In animal studies death
occurred in 36 to 72 hours and was dose dependent. In primates (7), symptoms
and time to death were also dose related and associated with alveolar flooding,
fibropurulent pneumonia and necrotizing tracheitis. Death occurred 36 to 48
hours after challenge following a 8-24 hour preclinical period. Pulmonary
edema may develop one to three days after ricin exposure, in contrast to
staphyloccocal enterotoxin B or phosgene where time to development of pulmonary
edema is twelve and six hours respectively.
Exposures due to ingestion of ricin have not been reported. Due to poor
absorption, lethality is less than with inhalation. The clinical presentation
is most likely similar to that observed with castor bean ingestion. Cutaneous
contact with ricin is inocuous but if injected systemically, it can be lethal
as occurred in the assassination of Georgi Markov (8).
Castor seed constituents are highly antigenic. Contact dermatitis and even
anaphylaxis has been reported after contact with castor seed necklaces.
Hypersensitivity symptoms have occurred in workers in castor oil factories,
merchant seamen and dock workers who may be directly or indirectly exposed to
sacks of the seeds, felt industry workers (derivatives of the seed may be used
in felt manufacture) and even in those with latex allergy (the plants are in
the same _Euphobiaceae- family.
At this writing, white powder has been also discovered in a postal facility in
Wallingford, CT but its identity is not yet known.
