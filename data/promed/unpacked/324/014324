The total for outbreaks of classical swine fever in the Netherlands
today rose to 197 (the first outbreak was on February 4th). In less than
three months, this terrible virus has decimated the Dutch pig industry.
In the latest incredible turn of events, the culling of half a million
unweaned piglets began on May 20th. The European Union does not normally
approve of piglets being taken from the sow before three weeks of age,
however, a dispensation has been agreed and the Dutch authorities can cull
piglets between three and seventeen days of age as their latest swine fever
control measure.
The reason for the culling is to prevent growing welfare problems in
overcrowded farms which have not been able to sell and move pigs in the
normal way. Movement of pigs has been banned in many areas as part of
the measures to control the classical swine fever epidemic. The
disruption of normal trade has until now been dealt with by EU
subsidised purchase of more mature pigs (e.g. 125 kilograms liveweight).
However, there is not enough capacity at rendering plants to dispose of
the large carcasses.
The Dutch Minister of Agriculture tried to prevent the media taking
pictures of the culling, but he media went to court over this and the judge
supported their right to report the culling. The piglets are being killed
by injection of a lethal anaesthetic overdose into the heart.The Dutch
Ministry of Agriculture is applying in Brussels for the culling of a
further 500,000 unweaned piglets.
The number of outbreaks (we know of) in other EU countries this year,
is 42 in Germany, 31 in Spain and 13 in Italy.
