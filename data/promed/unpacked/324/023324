There are fears that the area affected by the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has increased and spread further north in 2017, according to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

A department spokesperson confirmed to AgriLand that the Regional Veterinary Laboratory (RVL) network has reported an increase in the number of suspected SBV cases in aborted lambs and calves submitted this past week.

The increase has been particularly prevalent in aborted lambs.

Results of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test are currently being awaited from these submissions -- which are suspected to have SBV.

But these submissions -- from counties Sligo, Cavan, and Leitrim -- tend to confirm observations, made last autumn by RVLs, of animals showing antibodies to SBV in new areas north of the Dundalk-Galway line, the spokesperson for the department said.

It also supports the hypothesis that the SBV-affected area has now increased, and includes counties Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo and probably some neighbouring counties, the spokesperson added.

"The department's advice to Irish farmers on SBV remains essentially unchanged since its 1st incursion. "SBV is a low-impact disease, with the potential to cause significant losses in individual herds/flocks. Particularly where a substantial number of susceptible animals are infected, for the 1st time, at a vulnerable stage of gestation -- especially where breeding is synchronised," the department spokesperson explained.

The department continues to offer free post-mortem examinations and SBV screening for deformed ruminant foetuses/neonates where SBV is suspected.

As it is not a regulated or statutorily controlled disease entity, there is no active surveillance programme for SBV, the department spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, the department also explained that the PCR test is for viral genetic material (RNA) and needs to be interpreted with caution. The presence of viral DNA is not definitive proof of a causal link; a negative does not prove the absence of SBV viral involvement, the spokesperson concluded.

More information on the disease is available on the department's website [at https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/diseasecontrol/schmallenbergvirus/].

Figures from the department show that between the beginning of 2016, and the end of last year [2017], there were 67 positive SBV cases confirmed.

A total of 35 of these positive cases were detected in bovine animals, after 1025 samples had been tested. The remaining 32 cases originated in ovine animals, after 218 samples were tested.

[Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a member of the Simbu serogroup of orthobunyaviruses, was first identified using a metagenomics approach in plasma samples collected during the summer of 2011 from adult cattle with fever and reduced milk production originating from the city of Schmallenberg, Germany. The vector borne virus, initially identified in Germany, Belgium, and Netherlands, spread rapidly over Europe and its presence was reported by 29 European countries in a time span of less than 2 years, causing abortions, premature or stillbirth, and outbreaks of congenital malformation which appeared in winter and spring of 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. Sheep were affected as well. Since high levels of population immunity, reaching up to 90 percent and more, were reported after the initial spread of SBV through Europe, it was first unclear whether the virus would disappear due to a shortage of serologically naive animals to sustain transmission, or would become endemic with potentially cyclic re-emergences associated with congenital malformations. Data from several countries indicate that SBV has circulated endemically at a very low level since 2013, while the population immunity against SBV declined. The return of the virus, manifested by sudden increase in seroprevalence against SBV in the summer of 2016 in several European countries, was found to be closely related to the decline on herd immunity.

The mechanism by which these SBV and other Simbu serogroup, vector borne teratogenic viruses cross-pass yearly periods of very low vector abundance in temperate climate zones remains undefined. Yearly windborne reintroductions of infected midges from tropical endemic regions with year-round vector activity have been proposed (particularly in relation to Akabane virus; see further), just as overwintering in long-lived adult midges. Experimental and field data however indicate that a role of vertical virus transmission in the ruminant host currently cannot be excluded as an overwintering mechanism.

SBV, together with 2 other members of the Simbu serogroup of Orthobunyaviruses, namely the Akabane and Aino viruses, which are known from earlier years and other parts of the world (in particular Japan, Australia, and Israel) as cause of arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly in domestic ruminants, but whose infections in adults are mostly asymptomatic, has been subject to a recent richly-referenced review to which subscribers are commendably referred (ref 1).

As recently stated (ref 2), SBV re-emerged and recirculated at a significant level in Ireland during 2016 in herds which had been exposed to the virus earlier. This level of circulation was, according to the authors, most likely made possible by the low level of SBV circulation in 2014 and 2015 which resulted in documented substantial drop in herd immunity at the beginning of the 2016 vector season. This, coupled with favourable weather conditions during the 2016 vector season, was considered by them likely to be behind the re-introduction of SBV in these previously exposed herds during 2016. It may be assumed that the recent recurrence of SBV in Ireland may be related to the virus' circulation in the western parts of the UK (including Scotland, from where it has been reported recently).

According to accumulated information, it is very unlikely that SBV poses a risk to humans.
