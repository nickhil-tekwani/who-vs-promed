Five people have lost their lives in the Upper West Region, following the outbreak of Yellow Fever (YF) in the Sissala West and Wa East Districts of the region.

Dr Damien Punguyire, the Upper West regional director of health services who announced this in Wa on [Fri 19 Nov 2021], identified the Ducie, Motigu, and Gurumbelle communities in the Wa East District and Zinni in the Sissala West District as some of the communities where the active cases had been picked up with the casualties being children within the ages of one to 10 years.

Dr Punguyire disclosed this at a press briefing on the YF outbreak and the COVID-19 vaccination exercise in the region in Wa on [Fri 19 Nov 2021]. He indicated that the Regional Health Directorate was supporting the affected districts to investigate and institute appropriate measures to control the outbreak. "Vaccination is currently ongoing in the affected communities. A total of 2545 persons aged 6 months to 60 years in the affected communities have been vaccinated representing 38% of the targeted population (6909) as at [Wed 17 Nov 2021]", Dr Punguyire explained.

The director said yellow fever was transmitted by an infected mosquito and urged the general public to get vaccinated against the disease as well as to prevent mosquito bites. He entreated the public to "report to the nearest health facility if you have a fever, yellowish discoloration of your eyes, general weakness, headache, nausea and vomiting" which were symptoms of the yellow fever disease.

Touching on the COVID-19 vaccination, Punguyire indicated that only 5.9% of the region's targeted population was fully vaccinated against the virus as of [Wed 17 Nov 2021]. "So far, the region has received a total of 201 980 doses of 3 different types of vaccines and has administered 124 480 doses to 91 017 people representing 19% of the target population as of [Wed 17 Nov 2021]", he said. He explained that the Regional Health Directorate was targeting to vaccinate 52% of the region's total population of about 887 000 people. He urged the public to disregard the false speculation about the vaccine and to get the jab to boost their immune systems against the virus, saying, "The vaccine is therefore safe and free for everybody within the target group."

[It appears that yellow fever (YF) is gradually spreading in Ghana, now with cases in Sissala West and Wa East Districts of the Upper West region. With just 38% of the population in the affected areas vaccinated, there is more to be done if the WHO recommendation of at least 80% of the population vaccinated to be achieved.

The prompt response has gone well so far, but there is more to do to bring this outbreak to a halt. If there are abundant populations of YF virus vector mosquitoes present in an area where a large proportion of the population is unvaccinated, YF can quickly get out of hand.
