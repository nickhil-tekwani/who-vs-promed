Leptospirosis is increasing in Russia
-------------------------------------
The epidemiological surveillance center has reported that the incidence of
leptospirosis has increased. In Russia, for the last 6 months of 2004,
incidence was 0.11 per 100 000 persons. The highest incidence is reported
in Krasnodar, with 1.02 per 100 000 persons. Case lethality rate is
reported to be 30 percent.
Flooding of households, school and businesses may be an important factor.
Rodents are [usually - Mod.LL] the carriers of leptospirosis, with humans
infected usually by contact with water contaminated with rodent urine.
The Stavropol region is also one of the leading areas for leptospirosis.
Every year, 30-50 cases on average are reported in this region.

[ProMED would like more information regarding the increased incidence of
leptospirosis in Russia. Specifically, the clinical aspects of the cases,
epidemiology and how the diagnoses were made. Additionally, a case-fatality
rate (CFR) of leptospirosis of 30 percent is quite high. Generally, the CFR
is 1-5 percent but can be over 20 percent in circumstances when liver and
kidney failure become manifest.
Leptospirosis is a disease widely distributed throughout the world. - Mod.LL]
