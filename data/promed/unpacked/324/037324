Rabies found in foxes in Svalbard
---------------------------------
The National Veterinary Institute has identified rabies infection in
an arctic fox which earlier this week [12-16 Sep 2011] was killed by a
dog on Svalbard. The fox had abnormal behavior, and samples were
therefore sent to the Veterinary Institute for analysis. Samples from
another fox and a reindeer are under investigation.

The Food Safety Authority and the Governor handled the matter
according to Svalbard's emergency plan. Rabies has been detected in
animals in Svalbard since 1980, most recently in January this year.
Mainland Norway is free of rabies and it is therefore important that
pet owners follow the vaccination rules when traveling with pets.

Rabies is a zoonosis, meaning that the disease can be transmitted from
animals to humans. Rabies appears sporadically in foxes in the Arctic.
All mammals are susceptible to rabies, but in varying degrees. Saliva
from infected animals or carcasses containing large amounts of virus
can be transmitted through wounds in the skin, mucous membranes and
the consumption of infected carcasses.

The symptoms can vary among different animal species, but will often
include abnormal behavior. Wild animals may be less shy, while
domestic animals can become aggressive. This may develop later to
paralysis.

It is important that local people and walkers notify authorities of
any discovery of dead foxes in the wild.
