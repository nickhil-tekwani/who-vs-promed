Since 3 May 2010 an epidemic of yellow fever [YF] has killed 2 persons
in Abidjan with at least 19 cases reported, said the Ivorian Minister
of Health Aouel Aka, on Thursday [29 Jul 2010], when announcing a
vaccination campaign. "Since May, cases of hemorrhagic fever
[presumably YF] were registered in the health districts of Abidjan,
Grand Bassam (near Abidjan, the economic capital) [Sud-Comoe region]
and Bouake (center) [Vallee du Bandama region]," he said to the press.
In Abidjan alone, 2 people have died from yellow fever, with 8 cases
reported. A case of yellow fever has also been confirmed in
Grand-Bassam. The Minister has not clarified the situation in Bouake,
a town held by former rebels since the failed coup d'etat of 2002.

"A vaccination campaign is due to start Friday [30 Jul 2010] in the 3
affected towns," he added.

The last epidemic of yellow fever in Cote d'Ivoire was in December
2009, said a medical source, and it killed about 15 people people.
Yellow fever is transmitted to humans by the bite of a mosquito.

[The last YF cases reported in Abidjan occurred 2 years ago (2008) --
the outbreak in 2009 was elsewhere in the country. One hopes that
previous and current YF virus vaccination campaigns have provided
sufficient herd immunity to prevent a major outbreak.

Abidjan has an international sirport from which Emirates airlines
flies to Indian cities within 36 hours, connecting in Abu Dhabi. If
an unvaccinated, YF-infected passenger in the incubation period of the
disease were to embark in Abidjan he could arrive apparently healthy
in India -- or elsewhere in Asia -- and set off an epidemic there.
One hopes that destination cities in Asia are carefully checking the
vaccination status of passengers arriving from Abidjan.
