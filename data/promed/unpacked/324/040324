Date: Fri 8 Jul 2011

Update since 7 Jul 2011
-----------------------
As of today 8 Jul 2011, using the new case definition, the cumulative
number of non-HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] STEC [Shiga toxin
producing _Escherichia coli_] cases in the EU is 3024, including 16
deaths and 750 HUS cases, including 28 deaths. Suspected cases
(Germany: 154 HUS (7 deaths), France: 1 HUS, 8 non-HUS) are no longer
included.

In Germany, since 7 Jul 2011, 3 probable HUS cases have been
excluded, and 8 non-HUS STEC cases have been newly reported. 5 HUS
cases and 8 non-HUS STEC cases fell ill within the last 10 days (28
Jun-7 Jul 2011). The last known date of illness onset in a patient
with confirmed STEC O104 was 27 Jun 2011. The last reported date of
illness onset among all cases was 4 Jul 2011.

In Denmark, 1 HUS case and 1 non-HUS STEC case have been newly
reported. They have been attributed to person-to-person transmission,
from relatives who are known cases infected in Germany [see [2] below
- Mod.LL]

There is no update regarding the outbreak in France (Bordeaux
Region).

Update since 6 Jul 2011
-----------------------
The EU member states have updated the case definition for reporting
at the EU level the number of cases of STEC and HUS. At this stage of
the epidemic, where sporadic cases are still reported as well as new
limited clusters, only probable and confirmed epidemic cases are
reported. As a consequence, suspected cases, not meeting the case
definition have been removed from the totals. These are 152 HUS
including 7 deaths in Germany, 1 HUS, and 8 non-HUS STEC cases in
France.

As of today 7 Jul 2011, using the new case-definition, the cumulative
number of non-HUS STEC cases in the EU is 3016, including 16 deaths
and 752 HUS cases, including 28 deaths. In Germany, since 6 Jul 2011,
42 non-HUS STEC cases, 8 HUS cases including 2 deaths have been newly
reported. 5 HUS cases and 9 non-HUS STEC cases fell ill within the
last 10 days (27 Jun-6 Jul 2011). The last known date of illness onset
in a patient with confirmed STEC O104 was 27 Jun 2011. The last
reported date of illness onset among all cases was 4 Jul 2011.

There is no update regarding the outbreak in France (Bordeaux
Region).

[By noting the EU number of daily cases of HUS and non-HUS cases and
their total as well as deaths reported, the daily trends of the
numbers can be seen:

Deaths
Mon 6 Jun: 3 / 67 / 70 / 22

Thu 7 Jul: 8 / 42 / 50 / 44 (new case definition)
Fri 8 Jul: 1 / 9 / 10 / 44

Total cases: 3774 with 44 deaths -- 1.16 per cent case fatality rate.
The new case definition resulted in lower total cases and deaths but
did not affect case fatality rate.

The cases do not necessarily reflect date of onset of disease but
rather when the diagnosis was made and reported. The number of newly
reported cases per day clearly decreased from the corresponding day in
the previous week. - Mod.LL]

[2] Denmark ex Germany: secondary cases
Date: Thu 7 Jul 2011

A 6 year old girl and a 60 year old woman contracted _E. coli_
[O104:H4] infection that has killed some 50 people mainly in Germany
from relatives who traveled there, a Danish laboratory said on Thu 7
Jul 2011.

The bacteria are most often transmitted through food consumption, but
"since the infection can transmit from person to person through food
or hands contaminated with fecal matter, these new cases emphasise the
importance of good hygiene when in contact with such patients," the
statement added.

The latest cases, detected in mid-June 2011 and the beginning of July
2011, bring to 25 the number of Danes who have fallen ill with the
bacteria, including 10 who have contracted hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS), a kidney complaint caused by EHEC [enterohemorrhagic _E.
coli_], according to SSI [Statens Serum Institut].
