A 25-year-old woman who lives in District 12 [of Ho Chi Minh City
(HCMC)], has a hantavirus [infection], which is transmitted by
inhaled dust exposed to rodent feces or urine, or transmitted by
rodent bites, according to Phan Ngoc Nam, head of Internal Medicine
and Infectious Disease at People's Hospital 115. The woman fell ill
late last month [September 2008], but was not diagnosed correctly
until a couple of days ago as the disease is very rare in Viet Nam,
he said. Vu Thi Que Huong, head of HCMC Pasteur Institute's
Department of Micro-organisms and Immunity, said on Monday [6 Oct
208] that the woman [presents] a very typical case of the disease.
But she said the virus had yet to be properly studied.

The woman fell ill with a high fever on 20 Sep 2008 and was diagnosed
with dengue fever by her doctor. As the fever had not subsided 3 days
later, she was hospitalized and with viral fever. The patient then
began having kidney problems, difficulty breathing, and blood showed
in her urine, plus her stomach swelled and her lungs began to fill
with fluid. She was moved to the cardiovascular department when her
heartbeat slowed. She also had polyuria (excessive urination), fluid
leakage in the outer cardiac membrane, and other lung problems.

On Fri 3 Oct 2008, the patient was diagnosed with hantavirus
[infection] at HCMC Pasteur Institute. The patient said she had seen
mouse feces in her home. The institute has given her family 8
mousetraps to catch mice in her house and some nearby houses.

The institute previously diagnosed another patient with hantavirus
[infection], but the case was not as typical as this case, Huong
said. Hantavirus disease has an incubation time of 9 to 35 days in
humans before symptoms of infection occur, according to Nam. Nam said
the symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness,
chills, stomach problems, and problems related to the heart and lungs.

No specific medications for the disease are available now, although
ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, is effective in the 1st stage of
treatment, helping decrease the likelihood of death, Nam said. The
most effective treatment, according to him, is intensive care,
respiratory support, and the timely treatment of cardiovascular problems.

Hantavirus [infection] has historically killed more than half those
infected since its discovery in 1993.

[Hantaviruses (family _Bunyaviridae_, genus _Hantavirus_) are
enveloped RNA viruses with tripartite genomes, carried primarily by
specific rodent or insectivore hosts. _Sin Nombre virus_ and related
viruses are associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in
North and South America. Whereas in Europe and Central Asia Puumala,
Dobrava, and Saaremaa viruses, are the most prominent cause of the
condition known as haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). In
East Asia (China and Korea -- where the 1st hantavirus was
discovered) the virus species _Hantaan virus_ and _Seoul virus_ are
associated with HFRS. Hantaan virus is transmitted by the field mouse
_Apodemus agrarius_, whereas Seoul virus is transmuted by the rat
_Rattus norvegicus_.

It will be interesting to learn the identity of the hantavirus
responsible for this isolated case of HFRS appearing in an urban
setting in Viet Nam -- most likely a sub-species of _Hantaan virus_.
