A 2nd CWD [chronic wasting disease]-positive deer has been reported at an Oneida County [Wisconsin] shooting preserve, according to the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP). The 5 year old buck was shot at Three Lakes Trophy Ranch LLC in Three Lakes. The agency received the CWD-positive report on the animal 29 Dec 2015.

A 3 year old buck at the facility also tested positive for the disease in November [2015], initiating a baiting and feeding ban in Oneida, Forest, and Vilas counties.

Officials with DATCP said [Fri 15 Jan 2016] there was no plan to depopulate the facility since "none of the deer are removed alive and all are tested as they leave." At least some residents in the area, however, are concerned about disease spread from animals in the facility to wild deer as animals come into contact along the facility's perimeter. The recent CWD-positive findings, as well as other deer management issues, will be discussed on Thursday evening [21 Jan 2016] at a special meeting of the Vilas County Deer Advisory Council.

According to records from December [2015], Three Lakes Trophy Ranch had about 425 deer on 570 acres [231 ha]. The captive animals are the only deer to test positive for CWD in that portion of the Northwoods, including the Upper Peninsula [UP] of Michigan. Last year [2015], Michigan officials unveiled a campaign called "Keep the U.P. CWD Free!" It is illegal to bring whole deer carcasses from Wisconsin into Michigan.

Chronic wasting disease was identified in Colorado in 1967. The disease, among a family of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, including mad cow disease [also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE - Mod.TG] and Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD, humans), is fatal to deer, elk, and moose. It has not been found to cause illness in humans or livestock such as cows. The disease was first detected in Wisconsin in 2002 near Mount Horeb.

As of this month (January 2016), 41 of the state's 72 counties are considered "CWD-affected" by the DNR. Meat from a CWD-positive animal should not be eaten, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Further, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health recommends that venison from deer killed in CWD-affected counties should not be consumed by humans until a test shows the animal to be CWD-negative.

[Chronic wasting disease has, thus far, not been shown to transmit from animals to people, but caution on the consumption of the meat is recommended.

This particular article does not represent an expansion of the disease, only recognition that the disease is currently within a captive cervid facility. - Mod.TG
