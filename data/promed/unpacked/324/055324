Indonesia quits offering prompt notice of H5N1 cases
----------------------------------------------------
Indonesia's health minister said today [5 Jun 2008] the government
has stopped the practice of promptly notifying global health
officials each time it confirms a human H5N1 avian influenza case or
death, a move some say will likely hamper efforts to monitor the
world's pandemic risk level.

Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari today confirmed that a
15-year-old girl from Jakarta tested positive for H5N1 avian
influenza on 13 May 2008 and died the next day, according to a report
from the Associated Press (AP). Indonesia's National Committee for
Avian Influenza Control and Pandemic Influenza had previously listed
the case as confirmed on its Web site, but the information is
apparently no longer listed [see comment below].

The WHO, which typically confirms cases when it receives
notifications from health ministries or test results from its
collaborating laboratories, has not yet confirmed Indonesia's most
recent case and has not commented on Supari's decision to stop
sending out H5N1 case notifications. The WHO last confirmed, on 30
Apr 2008, an Indonesian H5N1 case, in a 3-year-old boy who died on 23
Apr 2008.

Supari told the AP that the health ministry would not send out H5N1
case confirmations until after they have been reported in the media.
However, Reuters reported today that the ministry will announce the
death toll from the H5N1 virus only every 6 months.

"How does it help us to announce these deaths?" Supari told the AP.
"We want to focus now on positive steps and achievements made by the
government in fighting bird flu." She told Reuters that announcements
of H5N1 deaths are sometimes misunderstood. "It's OK not to announce
it. Sometimes they only give hurtful comments instead of helping,"
she said without further explanation. Indonesia has been hit hardest
of any country by the H5N1 virus. According to the WHO's most recent
count, the country has had 133 cases and 108 deaths.

The country's refusal to share timely reports of human H5N1 cases is
the latest in a series of controversies that began when Indonesia
stopped sharing its H5N1 isolates in early 2007 to protest what it
views as a lack of access to affordable H5N1 therapies and vaccines.
The WHO has held several meetings to resolve the virus sharing
issues, but so far no agreements have been reached.

Sharon Sanders, editor-in-chief of FluTrackers, a well-known Web
message board that focuses on avian flu developments, told CIDRAP
News that Indonesia's decision to delay H5N1 notifications will
obscure what is happening there, which negatively affects the world's
ability to prepare for a pandemic. She said Indonesia's news blackout
would likely have the opposite effect from what the government
apparently intends. "Now, there will be intense speculation and
generation of rumors surrounding suspicious deaths that have similar
symptoms to H5N1 infections," Sanders said. "False rumors of an H5N1
outbreak have the potential to be even more economically devastating
than a government-confirmed outbreak." Sanders said media reports
coming out of Indonesia are generally reliable, but have some
drawbacks. "In many instances, reported suspicious human cases have
little or no follow up, so we are left with gaps in our total
picture," she said.

[The WHO table of the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of
avian influenza A/(H5N1), last updated on 28 May 2008, records 133
cases and 108 deaths in Indonesia [see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2008_05_28/en/index.html>].
The death of the 15-year-old girl described in the 2nd paragraph of
the above report would raise the case total to 134 and the number of
deaths to 109, if confirmed independently.

It is not clear, however, whether this case is one of the 2 suspected
cases described in ProMED-mail on 14 May 2008 (see: Avian influenza,
human (47): Indonesia, susp 20080514.1623). In this posting it was
reported that: "A 16-year-old girl died 4 days after being admitted
to the Persahabatan Hospital in the Indonesian capital on 8 May 2008
with laboratory test later confirming she had the avian flu virus.
10 days before her death, her 15-year-old brother died after a brief
treatment at another hospital with symptoms similar to bird flu." The
cause of death of the 15-year-old could not be confirmed because no
blood sample had been taken. It is possible therefore that the death
toll may now be at least 110. - Mod.CP]
