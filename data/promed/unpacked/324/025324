MANILA (July 4) XINHUA - One person died Friday while nine others were
hospitalized following a reported cholera outbreak in Malingin, Cotabato,
the Southern Philippines, the Philippine News Agency said Saturday. The
agency quoted Renato Ty, information officer of the Department of Health,
as saying that most of the affected patients are children and a 36-year-old
man died Friday. Ty said the outbreak stemmed from contaminated drinking
water in the locality, and warned people in the area against drinking
unsafe water.
