An outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza, type H5N2, has been
diagnosed on a poultry farm in Lugo, Italy. This has been notified by
the Ministry of Agriculture.
Lugo is 25 km west of Ravenna, in Emilia Romano [see map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=44.42907,11.90699|14|4&loc=IT:44.42907:11.90699:14#t=l&map=44.42907,11.90699|9|4&loc=IT:44.42907:11.90699:14>].
The farm included 7000 adult ducks, 3000 geese and 150 chickens. The
infection was detected within the framework of the annual, routine
sero-surveillance activities. No clinical symptoms were seen.
The holding was confined, and the animals will be culled. A
restriction zone of one-km radius has been imposed around the site.
Last week, an infected hobby-holding was found.

[In late July 2007, LPAI H7N3 was found in a holding with ornamental
birds ("ducks, geese, pheasants, peacocks, ostriches, etc.") in the
region of Veneto; the same strain was found earlier, in May 2007. See
item 3 in posting 20070804.2531.
H7 and H5, even if of low pathogenicity, are -- according to the OIE
terrestrial animal health code -- regarded as notifiable. - Mod.AS]
