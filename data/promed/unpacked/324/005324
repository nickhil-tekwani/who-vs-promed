Japan has detected its 1st outbreak of bird flu for the 2021 winter season, with confirmation of a case of "highly pathogenic avian influenza" [HPAI] at a poultry farm in the northeast of the country, the agriculture ministry said on Wednesday [10 Nov 2021].

About 143 000 egg-laying chickens are being exterminated at the farm in Yokote city in Akita Prefecture, the ministry said in a statement on its website, adding that restricted zones up to 10 km (6.2 miles) from the site have been established.

Japan has temporarily suspended exports of chicken meat and eggs from all regions following the outbreak, the ministry said.

"Under the current situation in Japan, we do not believe that there is any possibility of avian influenza being transmitted to humans through the consumption of chicken meat or eggs," the ministry said.

But an increase in the number of people in China getting infected from bird flu this year [2021] is turning into a source of concern among epidemiological experts, especially as the world slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.

China has reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza in 2021 to the World Health Organization [WHO], compared with only 5 last year [2020], with 6 dead and many of the others critically ill.

[According to NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), an additional H5 outbreak affecting poultry has been recorded in Japan on the morning of 12 Nov 2021, affecting a poultry farm in Izumi City, Kagoshima Prefecture, where many chickens were reported dead. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5 was detected in 13 birds examined. In response to this, Kagoshima Prefecture has begun culling chickens at this poultry farm. In addition, the poultry farm has been designated as a "restricted movement area" that prohibits the movement of chickens and eggs within a radius of 3 km (1.86 mi), and a "restricted export area" that prohibits the shipment of chickens and eggs from that area within a radius of 10 km (6.2 mi). Within a 10 km radius of this poultry farm, there are 119 farms and about 5.53 million chickens and other animals are bred. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries informed that this is the 2nd outbreak of bird flu in poultry farms nationwide this season, following Akita Prefecture, which was confirmed as infected on 10 Nov 2021 (https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211113/k10013346441000.html; in Japanese).

The distance between Kagoshima (on Japan's southern island of Kyushu) and Akita (in the T≈çhoku region of Honshu Island, north Japan) is about 1247 kilometers (775 miles). The route(s) of introduction and the full identity of the H5 strain in each of the foci have yet to be established and published.

Japan has suffered several epizootics of HPAI H5 strains, affecting poultry and wild birds, during the 2 recent decades. This included H5N2 (2005-2006), H5N1 (2007, 2010-2011), H5N6 (2016-2017) and H5N8 (2014-2015, 2020-2021). Several of the said episodes were attributed to be introduced by migratory birds and shared with seasonal HPAI outbreaks in South Korea, China and other eastern and south-eastern Asian countries. - Mod.AS
