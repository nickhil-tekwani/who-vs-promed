Animal experts on Vancouver Island [British Columbia] have issued a warning to pet owners in Nanaimo after a contagious virus was detected in 4 cats in the last month.

The cats, all in the Harewood community, have tested positive for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a disease typically spread from cat to cat through blood, most commonly during fight. "It's much like HIV is in humans, cats can live a long time with it, they can live a short time with it, but it is infectious," said Leon Davis with the Nanaimo SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals].

A Vancouver Island veterinarian says the disease can suppress an animal's immune system and make them more prone to certain forms of cancer.

"They get other infections that can make them quite ill and in some cases fatally ill," said Ken Langelier, medical director at Island Veterinary Hospital. "It's a life-long quality of life problem."

Nanaimo Animal Control Services took to Facebook to warn cat owners to keep their felines indoors to prevent it from spreading.

The animal service says the virus is typically found in rural areas and the fact that it's been discovered in a residential neighbourhood is cause for concern.

"It's certainly the 1st time that we've had 4 positives in one area so quickly together," said pound and adoption coordinator Carley Colclough.

Experts say the illness can be difficult to detect and recommend all cats be tested.

"Not spaying and neutering your cats will cause them to kind of roam, can cause them to fight more and those 2 things are what are going to transmit diseases," said Davis.

Vets say once a cat is diagnosed, it must be kept indoors and not interact with other cats.

There is a vaccine for FIV, but Langelier says not one that he would recommend.

It hasn't proven overly effective so it's not even on our list of recommended vaccines because the strains vary, the efficacy of the vaccine is always questionable," he said.

[In infected cats, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) attacks the immune system, leaving the cat vulnerable to many other infections. Although cats infected with FIV may appear normal for years, they eventually suffer from this immune deficiency, which allows normally harmless bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi found in the everyday environment to potentially cause severe illnesses. The median survival time for a cat diagnosed with FIV is approximately 5 years.

Sometimes this disease is described as HIV for cats. Cats can transmit it between each other in several ways, but especially by bites. An infected pregnant queen is likely to pass it to her kittens.

There is a vaccine. FIV vaccines cause a vaccinated cat to produce antibodies against the FIV virus that can be difficult to distinguish from those produced by a cat in response to natural infection with FIV. For this reason, it is necessary to know a cat's FIV vaccination history (where possible) in order to accurately interpret test results.

Vaccines to help protect against FIV infection are now available, although these are not considered core vaccines for cats. Not all vaccinated cats will be protected by the vaccine, so preventing exposure is important, even for vaccinated cats. As discussed above, vaccination will impact future FIV test results, and any vaccination carries the risk of inducing vaccine-associated-sarcoma (a type of cancer) in cats, so it is important that you discuss the advantages and disadvantages of vaccination with your veterinarian to help you decide whether FIV vaccines should be administered to your cat.

If an animal is infected, there is currently no definitive cure for FIV. It is important to realize, however, that while it is impossible to predict the survival of a given cat infected with FIV, cats infected with FIV can live ostensibly normal lives for years if managed appropriately. Once an FIV infected cat has experienced one or more severe illnesses as a result of infection, however, or if persistent fever and weight loss are present, the prognosis is generally less favorable.

Management must include spaying or neutering, living indoors, and a very well balanced and nutritious diet. Because of the risk of bacterial infections, raw foods, especially meat, are not recommended. Involving your veterinarian in the health and feeding of your pet can help a relative normal life.
