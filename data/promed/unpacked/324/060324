Plague outbreak kills thousands of prairie dogs
------------------------------------------------
PUEBLO, Colo.-- Tens of thousands of prairie dogs may have died from a
recent outbreak of bubonic plague in Pueblo West.
Animal specimens sent to the Colorado State University laboratory have
confirmed bubonic plague is killing prairie dogs in the area.
"The last major outbreak we've had of this magnitude was in 1987 when there
were hundreds of thousands of prairie dogs dead," said Mando Torres,
environmental health technician at the Pueblo City-County Health
Department. "There are easily tens of thousands of dogs having died during
this recent outbreak."
Bubonic plague is a bacterial infection caused by _Yersinia pestis_ and
treatable with antibiotics in humans and animals. Symptoms include high
fever, chills, muscle aches and nausea as well as pain and swelling in
lymph nodes. The disease is commonly spread through infected fleas.
Torres cautioned people living near affected areas to take precautions and
keep children and pets away from the prairie dog area.
"Cats are very susceptible to the plague and while dogs aren't, they will
bring the fleas back home," he said. Torres recommended using flea powder
on pets.

veterinarians. Furthermore, pets should be examined by a veterinarian for
any swollen lymph nodes and early signs of the disease. - Mod.TG
