Summary of the Current Situation in Paraguay: As of 8 Feb 2007, the
epidemiological alert issued by the Ministry of Public Health and
Social Welfare of Paraguay (MSPBS) has been in effect throughout the
entire country, in view of cases of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic
(DH). To date, there have been 3 fatal cases of DH.
Up to 8 Feb 2007 (Epidemiological Week No. 6), official reports indicate:
- 3672 cases of dengue,
- 22 cases of dengue hemorrhagic,
- 3 deaths,
- Case-fatality rate: 13.6 percent,
- Departments affected: 90 percent [of the cases] in Asuncion and
Central department and 10 percent in the rest of the country,
Key Programmatic Elements:
The central focus in response to this outbreak is as follows:
- The scheduling of environmental sanitation operations complemented
by a communication strategy with emphasis on identified breeding sites.
- Environmental management complemented by chemical control in the
identified high-risk areas, commencing Wed 31 Jan 2007 and lasting
for as long as the risk of transmission and disease spread persists.
- The neighborhoods and municipalities have been classified
accordingly as very high, high, or medium priority.
In the very-high-priority municipalities, the following activities
are underway:
- Broadcasts
- Environmental management (intensified elimination of breeding sites
in all dwellings).
- Detection of cases with fever
- Spraying door to door every 3 days using motorbike backpacks
- Residual spraying every 5-7 days
- Infestation index determination sampling pre- and post-intervention.
The country currently has 200-250 brigades (special personnel plus
the armed forces), with an approximate total of 500 people,
transportation media (pickup trucks, buses, trucks, dump trucks),
fuel, maps of target areas, and forms for corresponding registries).
Results of the environmental-management operations: The various
activities that made up these operations started on 31 Jan 2007. A
total of 33 433 houses were inspected in a total of 37 targeted
neighborhoods, showing indices of infestation of between one percent
and 15 percent.
Establishment of the Situation Room: Due to current needs, local
levels report 3 times a week to the Situation Room to provide data on
patient care and community-level activities in order to maintain
up-to-date information on an ongoing basis. The Situation Room
analyzes the trends and patterns of the epidemic at the country
level. Thus, the operations of the different federal departments will
be evaluated with feedback so as to redirect strategies should the
entomological and epidemiological evidence obtained indicate the need to do so.

The Argentine health authorities on Tuesday [13 Feb 2007] reported 13
new cases of dengue fever in Formosa province, north of the capital
Buenos Aires.
None of those infected were in danger of dying, the authorities said,
adding the new cases were classic dengue instead of the more deadly
hemorrhagic dengue.
"Those suffering from the disease had traveled to Paraguay where
dengue is prevalent," the source said.
Formosa, some 1850 km north of Buenos Aires, borders Paraguay, and
6500 cases of dengue have been reported there in recent weeks.
Anibal Gomez, Formosa's head of human development, called on
residents not to travel to Paraguay, "unless it is essential and inevitable."
Moreover, Formosa authorities have set up spraying vans in Clorinda,
the village bordering Paraguay, and health department inspectors are
going from house to house to remove stagnant water containers, which
provide a breeding place for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes that
spread dengue [virus].

Summary:
Up to Epidemiological Week (EW) 3, 20 Jan 2007, the following was
reported [nationwide]:
- 21 444 cases of dengue, which represents an increase of 20 percent
when compared with the same period in 2006 (preliminary results,
seeing that the states of Amazonas, Roraima and Rio Grande do Sul
have not sent information)
- 11 cases of dengue hemorrhagic (DH)
- 3 deaths
Affected states: 24 states have sent data for this period. The states
with the greatest number of cases are as follows: - Mato Grosso do
Sul: 15 335 cases (71 percent) - Rio de Janeiro: 1284 cases (6
percent) - Minas Gerais: 748 cases (3 percent) - Sao Paulo: 699 cases
(3 percent) - Tocantins: 455 cases (2 percent) - Rio Grande do Sul
and Santa Catarina continue to report no native transmission of dengue
Historical Background: Dengue outbreaks occur mainly from January to
May due to climatic conditions favorable to the transmitting vector,
_Aedes aegypti_, during that time of year. Since 1986, when the
disease was reintroduced into the country, dengue cases have occurred
every year, with various epidemic peaks occurring during this period.
In the 1990s, including during non-epidemic years, the disease
produced tens of thousands of cases every year. The last epidemic
peak occurred in 2002, following the introduction of the DEN-3 virus,
with reports of 794 000 cases, most of them from Rio de Janeiro. In
the following years, the dispersion of DEN-3 throughout other
Brazilian states perpetuated a surge in outbreaks and epidemics,
although not reaching 2002 levels. Last year [2006], 306 180 cases
were reported, with the regions most affected being the Southeast
(with 121 197 cases) and the Northeast (91 760 cases).
Situation in Mato Grosso do Sul
Summary: At present, reports show an increase of dengue cases in the
state of Mato Grosso do Sul in such areas as the municipality of
Campo Grande. Up to 5 Feb 2007 (Epidemiological Week 6), reports are
as follows:
- 15 335 suspected cases of dengue
- 3 cases of dengue hemorrhagic
- 2 deaths
- Case-fatality rate: 66.6 percent
Affected municipalities: Municipio de Campo Grande (with 70.5 percent
of all cases), Aquidauana, Cojin, Dorados, and Anastasio. In 2007,
according to the State Health Department, 11 085 cases of dengue have
been reported so far, 70.5 percent (7818) of them concentrated in the
municipality of Campo Grande and the rest dispersed throughout 38
municipalities in the interior, especially in Aquidauana (1167
cases), Cojin (572 cases), Dorados (275 cases), and Anastasio (244 cases).
Three cases of dengue hemorrhagic were confirmed, one of them being
in Campo Grande with a favorable outcome, and 2 that resulted in
deaths, one in Aquidauana and one in Laguna Carapa. Comparing the 1st
2 weeks of January 2007 with the same period in 2006, Mato Grosso do
Sul registered a notable increase in dengue cases.
Prevention and Control Activities to Fight Dengue: During 2006, the
Ministry of Health developed activities in Mato Grosso do Sul to
provide support to the State and Municipal Departments of Health in
their dengue prevention and control activities, for example
[increased funding, intensified surveillance and vector control,
training, and logistical support. This section of the report was
summarized - Mod.TY]

In one week, the number of dengue cases increased 61 percent in Ceara
[State], according to a bulletin issued yesterday [18 Feb 2007] by
the state's Secretary of Health (SESA). There were 615 cases
confirmed in 37 municipalities. In the previous bulletin, 380 cases
were registered. The most critical situation is in Brejo Santo, in
the Cariri region, 508 km from the Capital, where there has been an
epidemic with 245 cases confirmed this year [2007], followed by
Reriutaba (82 [cases]), Forealeza (67 [cases], and Varjota (38 [cases]).
The number of DHF cases being investigated by SESA has also increased
from 4 to 10. One of the suspect cases [of DHF] was in Pacajus
(fatal), and the others were in Fortaleza (4 [cases]), Brejo Santo,
Quixelo, Maranguape, Sobral, and Santa Quiteria, with one case each.
According to the Coordinator of Public Policy of SESA, Manoel Dias de
Fonseca, this increase in disease [incidence] is due to the start of
the rainy season. This increase is worrisome, as we have dengue
[virus] types 1, 2, and 3, which [cause] an alert [situation] for DHF.

[2007, like 1998 and 2002, is shaping up to be another dengue year in
Brazil. _Aedes aegypti_ now is found in all units of the federation
and is expanding. Cases are occurring everywhere, but especially in
Mato Grosso do Sul state. - Mod.LJS]

A seasonal dengue fever outbreak in Indonesia has killed at least 307
people and sickened more than 20 000 others this year, health
officials and local media reports said Wed 14 Feb 2007. Health
Minister Siti Fadilah Supari warned of a possible major spike in
mosquito-borne dengue fever cases during the next 2 weeks because of
torrential rains last week that flooded the capital Jakarta and 2
neighboring provinces.
"Due to changeable climate conditions after recent flooding, we're
assuming that dengue fever cases will sharply increase," Supari was
quoted as saying by the Indonesian daily Koran Tempo newspaper.
She said the floods had created more small pools of fresh water,
which are excellent breeding ground for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
It can transmit the dengue virus to humans through a single bite.
The Indonesian Health Ministry had declared 8 of the country's 33
provinces, including all provinces on densely populated Java Island,
as high-risk for dengue fever because of the skyrocketing number of cases.
Rita Kustriastuti of the health ministry's dengue team told Elshinta
private radio that a total of 20 416 dengue fever cases were recorded
in the country since 1 Jan 2007, with 307 people dead.
She said additional dengue fever cases were reported from, among
others, Central and West Java provinces, as well as in the capital Jakarta.
Kustriastuti said health authorities would conduct a mass eradication
against nests of mosquitoes that transmit the disease in the capital
Jakarta on Friday [16 Feb 2007?], including a mass fogging through
residential areas that [are] considered to be high-risk.
She said unless there is a step-up in vigilance and continued effort
in ridding our environment of the mosquitoes that transmit the
disease and their larvae, we may still see more casualties in the coming weeks.
West Java was the worst-hit province, with 86 deaths and more than
4958 people infected. West Java and neighboring Banten province's
infection rates have been declared an "extraordinary occurrence,"
after the number of [dengue virus] infected people there rose sharply.
In Jakarta, 9 people have died from dengue fever, and more than 2970
others have been infected. Fatalities were also reported in Central
and East Java provinces and the provinces of West and South
Kalimantan, North Sulawesi and Papua.
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes lay their eggs in fresh, still water. The
mosquitoes can breed in discarded tires, flower pots, oil drums and
water storage containers [in and] near human dwellings.
Other health officials likened dengue fever in Indonesia to an
"iceberg," saying that with the rainy season underway, the disease
will continue spreading. They have urged residents to be vigilant
about keeping their surroundings clear [of mosquito breeding sites],
as infection rates were on the rise.

[It is difficult to know if the recent flooding in Indonesia has
washed away existing _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites or created new
ones. That may depend on the persistence of fresh water catchments in
and around human habitations after the flood waters recede. A map of

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop
shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and
die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
