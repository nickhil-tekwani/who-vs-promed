The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed yesterday [19 Feb 2008] an
enterovirus-71 case involving a 21-month-old child in Pingtung
County, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Taiwan to 14
for the year [2008]. Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the Centers
for Disease Control under the DOH, said that the girl's parents took
her to a Kaohsiung medical center on 4 Feb 2008 after discovering
blisters all over her body. The child was released from hospital the
next day after her condition improved. However, on 6 Feb 2008, the
child developed a fever, symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD), as well as arm and leg spasms, Lin said. The parents brought
the child back to the same medical center, and the child was
immediately admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. On 19 Feb
2008, after conducting tests, the hospital reported the suspected
enterovirus-71 case to the CDC. The child was released from the
medical center several days later after her condition had improved.

Lin said that although the latest data shows that enterovirus may be
on the wane, the data was compiled ahead of the start of school
following the extended holiday break, which he noted may be the
reason for the decline in new enterovirus cases. Pointing out that
enterovirus may make a resurgence when school starts again, Lin
reminded parents and teachers to not let their guard down and to pay
attention to students' sanitary habits as well as to make sure that
they wash their hands often to avoid being infected. He also urged
parents to take their kids to a hospital immediately if they develop
a fever, HFMD symptoms, or arm and leg spasms.

In 2007, there were a total of 49 cases of confirmed enterovirus
infections in Taiwan, with 2 fatalities. So far this year [2008],
there have been 14 cases, with no fatalities, which Lin said shows
that citizens have become more aware of the threat of enterovirus.

[The hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) syndrome commonly observed in
infants and young children can be caused by several enteric viruses.
Human enterovirus-71 and human coxsackievirus A16 are the most
frequent pathogens. Human enterovirus-71 infections, however, tend to
have more severe outcomes and have been associated with cases of
acute neurologic disease including poliomyelitis-like paralysis,
encephalitis, and aseptic meningitis. Hand-foot-mouth disease occurs
worldwide, but causes greatest concern in Southeast Asia and the Far
East. It is unclear whether this is due to the prevalence of more
virulent enteroviruses or to lower standards of hygiene.
Hand-foot-mouth disease in children is unrelated to the
foot-and-mouth disease of ruminants.
