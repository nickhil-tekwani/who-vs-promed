Infection with Nipah virus, named for the Malaysian village where it was
first identified, results in a particularly serious form of brain
inflammation along with signs and symptoms that include vomiting, fever,
muscle aches, and malaise, according to a group of Singapore researchers.
In humans, the infection is often fatal -- of the 269 cases reported in
Malaysia and Singapore through mid-1999, 102 patients died. And more than
half of patients surviving the infection are left brain damaged, the team
note in the September issue of Annals of Neurology.
Co-author Dr. Wei-Ling Lee of the National Neuroscience Institute in
Singapore explained to Reuters Health that while "it is totally speculative
whether (the virus) has been latent in pigs (or in other animals, such as)
fruit bats for some years, or whether it is a new mutation of some
previously harmless virus, it seems certain that this is the first time
that humans have been infected and come down with (this) illness in such an
epidemic manner."
The report describes the cases of 11 slaughterhouse workers in Singapore
who have become infected over the past year. Although "two patients had
only respiratory symptoms, 9 patients had encephalitis," the researchers
write.
What distinguished these cases of encephalitis, the authors continue, is
how the damage manifested itself in the brain. Upon reviewing magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans, the investigators determined that Nipah
virus had damaged the cerebellum, a unique but expected finding, according
to Lee, since [other viral; encephalitides usually do not affect this
region of the brain.
The cerebellum, located at the back of the brain, is involved in
maintaining balance and coordinating movement. According to the report, 5
patients displayed signs of cerebellar involvement such as gait
abnormalities and the inability to properly control limb motions.
Other neurological problems found in the Singapore patient group included
disturbances in vision, such as "impaired movement of the eyes" and
"alteration in mental status ranging from confusion to coma," Lee explained
to Reuters Health, noting that one patient "had vivid hallucinations of
pigs running around his bed."

[The July report, noted above, mentions cerebellar ataxia but does not
mention cerebellar lesions, so this report provides the histopathologic
correlate for the clinical sign. If I am not mistaken, tertiary syphilis
affects the cerebellum. Are there other infectious diseases that target
this part of the brain? - Mod.CHC
