[1] _Banana bunchy top virus_ - USA (Hawaii): Molokai Island

_Banana bunchy top virus_, BBTV, has once again has made its
appearance in central Molokai. BBTV was 1st discovered on Molokai in
2005. Infected banana plants were killed and removed. Subsequent
disease survey indicated that Molokai was free of the BBTV. However
laboratory tests conducted in November and December [2007] on
suspected samples resulted in positive findings of the disease.
Banana is one of the most consumed fruit in the world. No doubt
Molokai has contributed to that statistic as many families are
growing their own plants in their back yard. [Molokai's] geographic
isolation has made it difficult for dreadful banana diseases to make
it to [the] island. Banana disease such as Panama wilt has existed on
Oahu for many years and has limited the banana varieties they can
grow. Molokai has been fortunate to be free of the Panama wilt and
able to produce other varieties.
Unlike Panama wilt, BBTV is non-discriminatory and will infect and
destroy all banana varieties. There is no plant resistance for this
viral disease. BBTV is a disease that survives and moves in the
[conducting] vessels of the banana plants. The disease is moved from
infected plants and transmitted to other banana plants by aphids.
There is no anti-virus solution that will cure the plant of the
disease. The infected banana plants will serve as a reservoir of the
virus that can be moved to other plants by aphids. While there is no
regulation that requires anyone to destroy their infected plants, it
is best for Molokai that infected plants be destroyed to keep the
disease from spreading. Experts recommend that infected plants either
be completely destroyed mechanically or chemically. Destroying plants
mechanically means physical removal of the complete infected plant
mat. Chemical removal requires injecting each plant in the infected
mat with herbicide. The College of Tropical Agriculture and Human
Resources website <http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/bbtd/> provides
detailed information.

[2] _Banana bunchy top virus_, nematodes - USA (Hawaii): control

Hawaii banana growers who are ranked number one nationally in banana
production are being threatened by a perilous pathogen known as
banana bunchy top disease. To help slow the spread of the disease,
caused by the _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV), the Plant and
Environmental Protection Sciences Department in the College of
Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) at UH [University of
Hawaii] Manoa are producing and distributing tissue-cultured banana
plants that are free of BBTV.
Plants infected early with BBTV do not bear fruit, and fruits of
later infected plants are typically stunted, unattractive and not
saleable. The disease is transmitted by a small soft-bodied insect
known as the banana aphid. "The spread of BBTV in Hawaii is greatly
influenced by the movement and use of infected plant material, thus,
the use of field-grown banana suckers as replant material is risky,"
said Cerruti Hooks, a CTAHR entomologist. Cerruti said that although
the banana plants may appear healthy, they may already be infected
with BBTV. "Using known BBTV-free plants is the safest practice
available today for replacing diseased banana plants."
In addition to BBTV, CTAHR nematologist Koon-Hui Wang discovered that
many banana fields are infested with plant-parasitic nematodes. These
nematodes feed, multiply, and migrate into the banana root system,
where they impair water and nutrient uptake. This affects plant
anchorage and toppling might occur under high infestations. Banana
suckers collected from fields containing nematodes may already be
infested with these organisms, but using tissue-cultured plantlets
may also help prevent the unintentional spread of nematodes.
The University of Hawaii at Manoa Agricultural Diagnostic Service
Center in coordination with the Hawaii Banana Industry Association is
currently selling tissue-cultured banana plants. The plants were
propagated from field collected banana plants that tested negative
for BBTV and have not been genetically modified.

[BBTV is the only member of the genus _Babuvirus_, family
_Nanoviridae_. It only affects _Musa_ spp. causing chlorosis,
stunting, and death of the host plant. The name abaca bunchy top
disease is used for BBTV affecting _Musa textilis_ (abaca, Manila
hemp) in the Philippines. BBTV is spreading in Africa, Australasia,
and the Pacific Islands.
BBTV is transmitted by the aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ (banana
aphid) in a persistent manner. The vector is itself a pest of banana
and many other tropical and subtropical food and ornamental plants,
including ginger, cardamom, tomato, taro, and ornamental heliconias
and alpinias. The aphids are found in all banana growing areas
worldwide. The insects remain infectious for life, even after feeding
on BBTV non-host species, and may spread the virus traveling on plant
material. BBTV cannot be transmitted by mechanical inoculation.
Disease management includes vector control, removal of inoculum
(infected plant material), the use of clean planting material, and
frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Planting tolerant varieties will
enable some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars
may still serve as virus reservoirs.
Panama disease (wilt) is caused by the soil-borne fungus _Fusarium
oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_ and has been a major problem for banana
cultivation worldwide for over a century. For more information see
ProMED-mail 20071024.3451.
A number of nematode species are known to cause disease on banana,
including for example members of the genera _Radopholus_,
_Meloidogyne_, _Pratylenchus_, and _Helicotylenchus_. It is not clear
which pathogens are being referred to here.
Tissue culture will provide both virus- and nematode-free planting
stock. Use of this clean planting material will prevent the spread of
the pathogens which will occur when planting material from infected
areas is used for replanting elsewhere. For BBTV, re-infection in the
field may be delayed by phytosanitary measures and vector control.
For the nematodes, re-infection appears unavoidable if the pathogens
are already present in the soil of the new plantings.
