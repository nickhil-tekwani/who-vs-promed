Anthrax, human, cattle; confirmed in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia
-----------------------------------------------
A case of anthrax has been confirmed in the Gafurijskiy district of
the Republic of Bashkortostan. A 74-year-old inhabitant of the
village of Kovardy was hospitalized with this diagnosis in the local
hospital. The management of Veterinary Science of Bashkortostan
reported on Tuesday [18 Oct 2005] that the source of her infection
was the [meat] of a cow which the woman [had bought in the market].
Suspicions of anthrax appeared in Gafurijskiy district on 12 Oct
2005. Veterinary examination in the local market revealed signs of
changes in lungs and in lymph nodes, typical for this dangerous
infection, in the carcass of one of the cows brought there for sale.
The carcass was immediately burnt. In the village from where the cow
came, counter-epidemic measures, including disinfection of the
ground, have been carried out, and quarantine has been established.
Physicians later discovered the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ in
the owner of the cow. Research has shown that the woman had fallen
ill with the cutaneous form of anthrax, which is curable.
According to the experts, contamination took place [through an open
wound on the woman's face after her handling of the contaminated
meat.] Now the woman is receiving medical treatment, and her
condition is satisfactory. In the village of Kovardy, vaccination of
the population against anthrax has been carried out. According to the
Management of Veterinary Science of Bashkortostan, "the focus of
disease has been liquidated, the reasons for the anxiety connected to
mass outbreak of people and animals by anthrax are not present." At
the same time, experts could not establish a source of infection for
the cow. The last single case of bovine anthrax had been registered
in Bashkiria in 1998.

[The total area of the Republic of Bashkortostan is 143 000 sq. km
(0.8 percent of the common area of Russia). The capital of
Bashkortostan is the city of Ufa. Bashkortostan occupies the largest
part of Southern Ural, and adjoining it are plains. In the north,
Bashkortostan borders the Perm and Sverdlovsk regions; in the east,
the Chelyabinsk region; in the southeast, the south and southwest,
the Orenburg region; in the west, the Republic of Tatarstan; and in
the northwest, the Udmurt Republic. - ProMED-mail Russian correspondent]
[This poor lady, going home from the market with her bloody package
of cow beef, scratched or rubbed her face and infected a cut with the
result that we see. Being elderly, she was probably victim to a
minimal dose. She and the putative owner of that cow were apparently
the only 2 victims. Suspicions were aroused on 12 Oct 2005 when the
market veterinary inspectors found a carcass with suspect changes in
the bovine lung and lymph node and ordered "immediate incineration."
Yet our customer had been able to buy some meat from this carcass. At
best, the inspectors got to this carcass late. When one considers
that the incubation for cutaneous anthrax is some 3-5 days, minimum,
and then there are the problems of getting samples from human lesions
(at best 30 percent) and then the culture interval, it makes me
suspect that our lady got ill before 12 Oct 2005; the hospital
reported cutaneous anthrax; and then the inspectors descended on the
Kovardy market on the 12th, discovered this sick dead cow, and it may
have been sampled and cultured. Back tracing found the owner, who
seemingly had a skin lesion; whether old or new is not clear. I
suspect that there was an earlier sick cow which was butchered and
disappeared. For whatever reason, there is no account of the
livestock in Kovardy being vaccinated. This would have been far more
cost effective in disease control than any human vaccination, other
than annoying the locals because of the cow owner's stupidity. It is
one way through community pressure, I suppose, of persuading
livestock owners to vaccinate their stock. One can only wonder at how
much livestock anthrax occurs in Russia without human cases and thus
without public health reporting. I have yet to see any Russian
veterinary statistics on this disease. - Mod.MHJ]
