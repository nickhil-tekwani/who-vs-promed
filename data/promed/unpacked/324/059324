["To have timely sharing of information and a good, coordinated approach among the countries in the Southeast Asia region, and thus to more effectively prevent and control LSD in the region, the OIE Sub-Regional Representation for South-East Asia organized an 'LSD Coordination Meeting for South-East Asia' on [11 Jun 2021]." Presentations and useful links are available at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/events/lumpy-skin-disease-lsd-coordination-meeting-for-south-east-asia/.

The objectives of the meeting were to:
1. Provide updates on the LSD situation in the South-East Asia region;
2. Provide an update on the preparedness of the countries at risk of LSD incursion;
3. Provide a platform for Members to discuss various issues related to LSD prevention and control;
4. Provide a platform for technical discussions on LSD prevention and control measures for their practical implementation in the field;
5. Share tools and resources made available by FAO and the OIE for LSD prevention and control.

An update on the lumpy skin disease outbreak situation in Cambodia was presented in this meeting. See presentation at https://rr-asia.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_cambodia_tum.pdf. - Mod.CRD
