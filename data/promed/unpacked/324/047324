Dog owners in Dorset are being warned about the deadly disease Alabama rot [cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy, CRGV] after a vet has confirmed another case in the Bournemouth area.

A cocker spaniel died from the disease -- known as CRGV -- after being walked in Bearwood and the Canford Heath area. Her owner has said she is "utterly heartbroken" and is warning other dog owners to be vigilant.

A statement from Hampshire vets Anderson Moores said: "Sadly more cases of Alabama rot have been confirmed. The new case is in Bearwood, Dorset.

"In total the UK has seen 86 confirmed cases since 2012, with 9 cases in Dorset."

Alabama rot causes damage to blood vessels of the skin and kidney. An early sign of the disease is unexplained redness, sores, or swelling of the skin -- particularly on the paws or legs -- but they can also be found on the body, face, tongue, or mouth. The disease can go on to cause fatal kidney failure and signs include vomiting, reduced hunger, and tiredness. It is not known what causes the disease so vets encourage owners to wash their pets after muddy walks.

People are urged to seek advice if they have any concerns. For more information contact your local vet or visit http://alabamarot.co.uk [where the typical lesions can be viewed].

[Similar cases in dogs from various locations in England, some of them referred to as the "new forest disease," have been addressed by ProMED-mail in several postings since September 2011, initially referred to as "undiagnosed." In 2015, the disease was designated "cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy" (CRGV or Alabama rot), close to a condition which had been seen in the USA in greyhounds for almost 30 years (ref 1). None of the 30 cases in the UK, covered in the said paper, were greyhounds; evidence of the disease was found in 15 different breeds of dog.

In a (January 2016) letter to the Veterinary Record (ref 2), the authors addressed the need for an early decision if an erosive or ulcerative skin lesion of unknown cause is the result of CRGV or of a different cause, as azotaemia [abnormally high levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as urea, creatinine, various body waste compounds, and other nitrogen-rich compounds) in the blood] is typically absent at initial presentation, and urine-concentrating ability may be retained. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement may allow early detection of pre-azotaemic acute kidney injury (AKI) and thus direct appropriate management.

Veterinary surgeons presented with a dog with skin lesion(s) of unknown cause were invited to contact <medicine@andersonmoores.com> (phone 01962 767920) to discuss GFR measurement. "Samples can be collected in their practices, and laboratory testing will be performed at the Royal Veterinary College; results will be available within 24 hours, thus aiding clinical decision making. Aside from blood sampling, all costs will be covered."
