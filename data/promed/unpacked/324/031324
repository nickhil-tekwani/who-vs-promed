Researchers investigating the outbreak of so-called seasonal canine
illness (SCI) say there is no sign that green algae, non-native
plants, or fungi are behind the deaths.

A report by Animal Health Trust (AHT) found there were 95 cases of the
illness in 5 woodlands across the country this year [2011]. The areas
included Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire and Thetford Forest,
Norfolk, as well as Sandringham [also in Norfolk].

Two dogs walked on the royal estate are known to have died this year
[2011], while 6 died last year. No new cases of SCI have been reported
for a month.

Since the outbreak, Dr Mark Spencer of the Natural History Museum, has
visited Sandringham and concluded there was "no obvious evidence of
any plants which would cause the clinical signs of SCI in dogs through
contact alone."

The botanist's research discovered "nothing unusual" in the woodlands
and found all plants had probably been growing there for more than 50
years.

Dr Richard Newton, of the AHT, said: "As with any investigation, this
is a process of elimination. Whilst we're not ruling plants and these
other toxic causes out completely, we are now focusing our efforts on
looking at other natural sources, such as animal related factors."

The AHT is now enlisting the help of other scientists to help track
down the cause of SCI. In October 2011, the trust added the additional
site of Rendlesham Forest, near Woodbridge, Suffolk to its list of
research areas.

It stresses that dog owners should remain vigilant and access
veterinary treatment if their dog vomits, has diarrhoea, or is
excessively tired within 24 hours of walking in woodland.

Buckingham Palace has refused to say whether the Queen has stopped
walking her dogs on the estate because of the outbreak. A spokeswoman
said: "The Sandringham estate is taking the reports of sick dogs very
seriously."

[It seems at present that the earlier suspicions of blue green algae
being involved in SCI cases could not be confirmed. Information on the
actual etiology of the syndrome, which has gained public attention
mainly because of its relevance to the Queen's Sandringham estate and
her dogs, is awaited. - Mod.AS
