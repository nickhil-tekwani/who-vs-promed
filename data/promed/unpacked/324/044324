First report of Pepino mosaic virus in tomato in Italy
------------------------------------------------------
Pepino mosaic, caused by pepino potexvirus (PepMV), was originally reported
in pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) from Peru in 1980. It has subsequently been
reported to occur in tomato crops in the UK (1999), and in France, Germany,
Spain, and the Netherlands in 2000. Diseased plants were observed in
February and March 2001 in glasshouse tomato cultivars Camone and Cronos
which had been grafted onto rootstocks of tomato cv. Beaufort obtained
from an Italian propagator before transplanting in late summer 2000. Typical
symptoms were observed in October on a few plants, but by March 2001
about 40% of the crop was affected. Typical potex virions were observed in
leaf extracts. Identification of the virus as PepMV was independently
confirmed by ISEM in 2 laboratories using reference antisera to isolates
from Peru and the Netherlands. A DAS-ELISA using a PepMV antiserum reliably
detected virus infected tomato plants in 3 glasshouses.
This is the first report of the disease in Italy. Although easily spread
under glasshouse conditions, it is not known how it spreads within European
countries.
