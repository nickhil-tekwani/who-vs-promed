The total number of zoo animals now confirmed to have died since 24 Jan
2004 from sodium fluoracetate poisoning [also referred to as 1080 poisoning
] had reached 56, with another 12 suspected.
They include 2 rare golden-faced tamarin monkeys, a pygmy anteater, and 37
porcupines. Confirmation was from Sao Paulo State University at Botucatu.
No deaths from poisoning have occurred since 15 food handlers were
dismissed a week ago. 40 people -- zoo employees and others -- are under
investigation.
44 animals have died from natural causes since 24 Jan 2004, out of
approximately 4000 in the zoo. This is considered by the zoo authorities
to be a normal rate of attrition. [1 percent per month = 12 percent a year,
which seems a bit high for normal, but many of those are probably small
rodents, amphibians, and insects that have short lifespans. - Mod.JW]

[This is interesting in that earlier there were hints of anticoagulant
rodenticides found in the carcasses. This article tends to indicate that
1080 is the cause of death. Regardless, the fact the deaths have stopped is
worthwhile. - Mod.TG]
