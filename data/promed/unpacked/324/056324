Asymptomatic carriers -- Ten avian H5N1 Influenza infection cases in South Korea, 2003 and 2006
--------------------------
South Korea has been found to have seen cases of human infection with avian influenza. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed that 10 people who took part in culling birds during the outbreaks of bird flu in 2003 and 2006 had antibodies for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus. The fact that antibodies were found in the 10 people signifies that the 10 people had been infected with the virus. The disease control agency categorized the 10 people as "asymptomatic carriers", as they displayed no symptoms.

The agency said that it had announced before that there were no human infection cases, as asymptomatic carriers are not regarded as patients under the World Health Organization standards.

[These findings are an extension of previous observations. Previously, it was reported in ProMED-mail in September 2006 that 5 people had developed antibodies to the lethal H5N1 strain of avian influenza as a result of taking part in the slaughtering and disposal of infected chickens and ducks. The 5 people tested positive for bird flu antibodies, but none of them [had] shown symptoms of the disease as defined by WHO, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention stated.

Retrospective analysis established that beginning in mid-2003, HPAI H5N1 virus began to cause outbreaks of poultry disease in Asia which were unrecognized at that time. In December 2003, 2 tigers and 2 leopards in a Thai zoo died as a result of consuming H5N1-infected chicken carcasses. Later in the same month, South Korea confirmed that HPAI H5N1 virus infection was the cause of poultry deaths at 3 farms. In early 2004, H5N1 virus infection was reported from Viet Nam, Japan, and Thailand. The 1st laboratory-confirmed cases of H5N1 human infection were reported in Thailand and later sporadically throughout East Asia (all symptomatic). Just as in Hong Kong in 1997, the outbreaks in South Korea and Japan were rapidly contained and eradicated by a combination of early detection, extensive culling, and continued surveillance. No human cases of infection were reported at that time, but later a small number of those involved in poultry culling experienced asymptomatic infection and developed immune responses.

The virus responsible for the outbreaks in South Korea and Japan belonged to the V genotype of H5N1 avian influenza virus, whereas the predominant virus in East Asia at that time belonged to the Z genotype. It has not been established whether this is a relevant factor in the human pathogenicity of the virus. - Mod.CP
