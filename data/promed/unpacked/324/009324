The Pennsylvania Departments of Agriculture and Health today, 29 May 2013, advised consumers to discard raw milk produced by The Family Cow in Chambersburg, Franklin County, because of potential bacterial contamination. Agriculture and Health Department laboratory tests and several recent illnesses indicate the raw milk may contain campylobacter bacteria.

The Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of confirmed campylobacteriosis in people who consumed milk from the farm at 3854 Olde Scotland Road. Based on the reported illnesses, the Department of Agriculture collected samples of raw milk during an investigation of The Family Cow, on 17 May 2013. Positive tests for campylobacter were confirmed on Tue 28 May 2013.

The packaged raw milk is sold under The Family Cow label in plastic gallon, half-gallon, quart, and pint containers. It is labeled as "raw milk". Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized.

The Family Cow sells directly to consumers in an on-farm retail store and at drop off locations and retail stores around Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and the Lehigh Valley, as well as south-central Pennsylvania. Agriculture officials ordered the owners of the farm to stop the sale of all raw milk until further notice.

Nearly 1300 confirmed cases of campylobacter [infection] are reported each year in Pennsylvania.

[This dairy was linked to a larger multistate outbreak in January 2012.

Despite many reports of a variety of human infections directly linked to unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, its production and distribution continues. Indeed, a number of state legislatures in 2013 have or had been pursuing legalizing (or have already done so) the practice of selling unpasteurized milk, something that has never been suggested by the FDA, CDC, or any state health department:
