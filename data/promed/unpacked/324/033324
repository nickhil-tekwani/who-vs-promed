Overall conclusion: Early specific antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 include IgG, IgM and IgA, but IgA may neutralize virus and control infection to a larger extent.

Abstract: Humoral immune responses are typically characterized by primary IgM antibody responses followed by secondary antibody responses associated with immune memory and comprised of IgG, IgA and IgE. Here we measured acute humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the frequency of antibody-secreting cells and the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in the serum, saliva and broncho-alveolar fluid of 159 patients with COVID-19. Early SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses were dominated by IgA antibodies. Peripheral expansion of IgA plasmablasts with mucosal-homing potential was detected shortly after the onset of symptoms and peaked during the 3rd week of the disease. The virus-specific antibody responses included IgG, IgM and IgA, but IgA contributed to virus neutralization to a greater extent compared with IgG. Specific IgA serum concentrations decreased notably one month after the onset of symptoms, but neutralizing IgA remained detectable in saliva for a longer time (days 49 to 73 post symptoms). These results represent a critical observation given the emerging information as to the types of antibodies associated with optimal protection against re-infection, and whether vaccine regimens should consider targeting a potent but potentially short-lived IgA response.

Conclusions: ...In conclusion, our findings suggest that IgA-mediated mucosal immunity may be a critical defense mechanism against SARS-CoV-2 at the individual level that may also reduce infectivity of human secretions, and therefore viral transmission. This finding may also inform the development of vaccines that induce specific respiratory IgA responses to SARS-CoV- 2.

Overall conclusion: Human dimeric IgA antibodies are potent neutralizers of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. Serum neutralizing antibody responses are variable and generally low in individuals who suffer mild forms of COVID-19. Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 convalescent individuals following diagnosis with COVID-19. IgA responses in plasma generally correlated with IgG responses. Further, clones of IgM-, IgG-, and IgA-producing B cells were derived from common progenitor cells. Plasma IgA monomers specific to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were demonstrated to be 2-fold less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form of antibody in the nasopharynx, were on average 15 times more potent than IgA monomers against the same target. Thus, dimeric IgA responses may be particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.

Discussion: Neutralizing antibody titers are the best correlates of protection in most vaccines (43 [see source URL for all references]). Among antibody isotypes, secretory IgA, which is found at mucosal surfaces, plays a crucial role in protecting against pathogens that target these surfaces (44). Serum IgA monomers are produced by the same cells that produce secretory dimers, and we find that serum IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 correlate with IgG responses. Although the monomeric form of IgA found in serum is on average 2-fold less potent than IgG, the dimeric, secretory form of IgA found in mucosa is over one log more potent than their respective monomer forms against authentic SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that dimeric IgA is a more potent neutralizer than IgG. The difference in neutralizing activity between the isotypes in serum could be due to differences in the developmental kinetics of the 2 isotypes during the immune response to this pathogen.

The increased potency of the dimeric form of IgA suggests that crosslinking the S protein on the viral surface enhances neutralizing activity either directly or simply through increased apparent affinity. This observation is consistent with the finding that monovalent Fab fragments of serum IgG antibodies are far less potent than the intact antibody (40). In addition, our findings are in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that influenza virus is more susceptible to neutralization by IgA dimers than monomers (27-29). Whether the effect we observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 is due to inter- or intra-spike crosslinking is not known, but it indicates that antibodies or drugs designed to block entry by binding to the RBD [receptor binding domain] could be made more potent by increasing their valency.

Limitations of our study include not having tested the native secretory form of IgA in saliva or feces. In addition, we are unable to explain why the monomeric forms of IgG are more potent in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 than monomeric IgA. We speculate that this might be due to differences in the precise mechanisms of selection for entry into the IgG or IgA memory or plasma cell compartments (45). Future studies will be necessary to mechanistically evaluate these differences.

A number of different candidate vaccines to SARS-CoV-2 are currently being evaluated in the clinic, including mucosally delivered vaccines that typically produce more robust mucosal immune responses (46). Secretory IgA responses may be particularly important to these efforts in that potent dimeric forms of these antibodies are found at the mucosal surfaces where cells are initially targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, even vaccines that elicit modest neutralizing activity in serum may be protective because the secretory polymeric forms of antibodies in mucosa can neutralize the virus. Further, vaccines delivered via the mucosal route can elicit superior IgA responses (47-49). Whether vaccines that are specifically designed to elicit mucosal IgA responses will be particularly effective preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be determined (46).

"There is a lack of systematic study on IgA production in COVID-19 patients. Reported serology tests focus on IgM, IgG and total immunoglobulins although IgA is playing an important role in mucosal immunity. It is in fact the most important immunoglobulin to fight infectious pathogen in respiratory system and digestive system at the point of pathogen entry. As an immune barrier, secretory IgA can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 before they reach and bind the epithelial cells (Fig. 1)."

[2] UK: Interleukin-6 receptor agonists

Two rheumatoid arthritis drugs that suppress the immune system may help critically ill patients survive COVID-19, providing a benefit even on top of the steroids that have been doctors' main tools in treating the most serious cases of illness, according to a new study released Thursday [7 Jan 2021] before peer review.

British regulators cited the new results as they promptly approved the 2 drugs, tocilizumab and sarilumab, for use in patients in intensive care units. The relative risk of death was reduced by 24% when given to people within 24 hours of admission, the data showed.

"Today's results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armory of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus," Matt Hancock, health secretary for the United Kingdom, said in a statement.

"These are encouraging preliminary results," said Jonathan Parr, an infectious-diseases physician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who was not involved with the clinical trial. Because the results represent patients in dozens of sites across 6 countries, he suggested they could be generalized to other locations.

David E. Leaf, a Harvard Medical School associate professor and Brigham and Women's Hospital physician, said the data were game-changing: "For ICU patients, I think it is a slam dunk that they should be given tocilizumab if it can be given early on."

The results had an unusual path into the public domain. A week before Thanksgiving [26 Nov 2020], one arm of a large clinical trial called REMAP-CAP [Randomised, Embedded, Multi-factorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia] was halted, through an announcement on Twitter, after a board monitoring patients in the trial had found that the drugs were so effective that it would be unethical to continue giving placebo to critically ill patients.

The clear finding came as a surprise to one of the investigators running the trial, after conflicting evidence on the utility of the drug tocilizumab from other trials. Most of the patients in the trial had already been on steroids, the inexpensive treatment that had shown to be successful at reducing deaths for people who require oxygen.

"We're currently live in 290 sites around the world, and so there was no way to quietly whisper to 290 sites: 'Stop randomizing to control in the immune modulation arm, but don't tell anyone,'" said Derek Angus, chair of critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and one of the investigators of the trial.

"We realized that we had to sort of make one sort of statement, even though damned if you do, damned if you don't -- we totally get people were frustrated," he said. "We didn't know all the data, but we did promise we'd get on top of the data as fast as possible."

The data published Thursday [7 Jan 2021] showed that patients were given tocilizumab, sarilumab or usual treatment within a day of requiring organ support in the ICU -- most typically patients who were on high-flow oxygen or a ventilator. Tocilizumab is manufactured by Roche under the label Actemra, and sarilumab is sold as Kevzara by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. The drugs, which block certain immune molecules from triggering inflammation, are far more expensive than the cheap steroids already being given to those patients.

The list price of the dose of Kevzara used in the trial is about USD 3600. The maximum dose used in the trial of Actemra currently carries a list price of USD 4600, but the dose varied by patients' body weight and could be given either once or twice. Bob Purcell, a spokesman for Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, said that the drug was not approved for use in COVID-19 and the pricing might differ if it were approved to treat the illness.

The trial measured the success of the drug by the number of days patients didn't need organ support but found that much of the benefit came from preventing death, Angus said.

About 36% of patients died in the hospital who received standard care, while 28% died on tocilizumab and 22% died when given sarilumab. Patients treated with the drugs spent about a week less in the ICU, on average.

Angus said that earlier this week, when the final analysis of the results was ready, there was a discussion about what to do with them. "We had this extensive conversation Monday [4 Jan 2021] night: Should we put the results on the preprint server? The National Health Service of the United Kingdom felt like it's time to give these drugs to patients -- we can't wait for this to go to a journal and peer review," Angus said.

But he expects physicians in the USA may be more conservative, at least waiting for a formal publication -- especially given that official treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America currently recommend against giving tocilizumab to patients.

Clinical observations early in the pandemic suggested this class of drugs could curb the immune reactions in critically ill patients with COVID-19 that sometimes led to fatal disease. Later, smaller clinical trials found mixed evidence in favor of using tocilizumab to reduce mortality. Two of them published in October [2020], one conducted in France and the other in Italy, reported little clear benefit to patients.

"Other published randomized trials primarily enrolled hospitalized patients with less severe disease," Parr pointed out, which may explain the difference between those results and these in intensive care patients.

And a large observational study of about 4000 people, also published in October [2020], suggested that tocilizumab helps critically ill patients. That study compared patients who received tocilizumab within 48 hours of being admitted to an intensive care unit against those who did not. Consistent with the new clinical trial, people treated with the drug were less likely to die.

Leaf, the senior author on the observational study, said the hospital where he works does not advise giving tocilizumab to any patient -- but he has "been jumping up and down" to overturn that recommendation for the sickest patients. Leaf will be giving a presentation to the hospital in 2 weeks in favor of treating those patients with the drug. He said his "job just got a lot easier" with the release of these trial results.

The results may increase interest in a number of drugs that tweak the immune response by acting on different pathways. Angus said he envisioned that future trials could compare tocilizumab against multiple other immune modulating drugs, to see if any work better. The results highlight that while the virus has gotten most of the attention, fine-tuning the immune response may be the key to saving the lives of those facing the worst cases.

Epub 7 Jan 2021. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.21249390 (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.07.21249390v1.full.pdf for full text), and its abstract follows:

"Background: The efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear.

"Methods: We evaluated tocilizumab and sarilumab in an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial. Adult patients with COVID-19, within 24 hours of commencing organ support in an intensive care unit, were randomized to receive either tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) or sarilumab (400 mg) or standard care (control). The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. The trial uses a Bayesian statistical model with pre-defined triggers to declare superiority, efficacy, equivalence or futility.

"Results: Tocilizumab and sarilumab both met the pre-defined triggers for efficacy. At the time of full analysis, 353 patients had been assigned to tocilizumab, 48 to sarilumab and 402 to control. Median organ support-free days were 10 (interquartile range [IQR] -1, 16), 11 (IQR 0, 16) and 0 (IQR -1, 15) for tocilizumab, sarilumab and control, respectively. Relative to control, median adjusted odds ratios were 1.64 (95% credible intervals [CrI] 1.25, 2.14) for tocilizumab and 1.76 (95%CrI 1.17, 2.91) for sarilumab, yielding greater than 99.9% and 99.5% posterior probabilities of superiority compared with control. Hospital mortality was 28.0% (98/350) for tocilizumab, 22.2% (10/45) for sarilumab and 35.8% (142/397) for control. All secondary outcomes and analyses supported efficacy of these IL-6 receptor antagonists.

"Conclusions: In critically ill patients with COVID-19 receiving organ support in intensive care, treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonists, tocilizumab and sarilumab, improved outcome, including survival."

Leaf et al. (Ref 3 below) wrote a letter to the editor stating: "Stone et al. ([10 Dec 2020] issue) [Ref 1 below] report that tocilizumab had no significant effect on the risk of intubation or death in moderately ill patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These results should not be extrapolated to other populations of patients with COVID-19, particularly the critically ill. Our multicenter cohort study involving 3924 critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed that early administration of tocilizumab was associated with prolonged survival (2). The patients enrolled in our study were fundamentally different from those in the trial by Stone et al. (Figure 1), which may account for the divergent findings.

"The trial by Stone et al. was also severely underpowered. In the placebo group, the percentage of patients with a primary outcome event (i.e., intubation or death) was 12.5%, far lower than the anticipated 30%. A post hoc power calculation reveals that with this event rate and the number of patients enrolled (243), it would have been nearly impossible for the trial to have shown a significant effect: The risk of the primary outcome would have had to have been more than 80% lower with tocilizumab than with placebo. Therefore, the trial results cannot be interpreted as being definitively null, since the imprecise estimates are also compatible with either benefit or harm."

Researchers hope that their double-blinded clinical trials will have to be halted when it is clear one cohort (hopefully the cohort receiving the intervention) is doing significantly better than the other (placebo) cohort. This has not been the norm for clinical trials related to management of COVID-19 -- probably not unrelated to the different pathophysiologies of illness at different stages. Some interventions may work better if administered early in the clinical process when the ongoing process is related to viral load and viral cell entry via receptor sites (see convalescent plasma study posted in yesterday's [8 Jan 2020] update: COVID-19 update (09): immunity, convalescent plasma, asympt transm, WHO, global 20210108.8083368). The use of anti-inflammatory agents at this stage might even worsen disease, by eliminating the inflammatory response that attacks the virus, thereby leaving an open field for the virus to attack cells. In contrast, the later, more severe stage is often related to an over-response on the part of the host's immune system, so the use of anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone or the interleukin-6 receptor agonists may help intervene in the over-response process. One hopes these results can be duplicated, opening the window to reducing fatal outcomes in those with serious disease.

[3] China: (Hebei) lockdowns
Date: Fri 8 Jan 2021 17:03 GMT+1

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/8/china-seals-off-two-cities-to-contain-coronavirus-outbreak


China has sealed off 2 cities south of Beijing, cutting transport links and banning millions of residents from leaving, as authorities move to stem the country's largest COVID-19 outbreak in 6 months. The pandemic has so far broadly been brought to heel by Chinese authorities since its emergence in Wuhan in late 2019, with small outbreaks swiftly snuffed out using mass testing, local lockdowns and travel restrictions.

But Hebei province in northern China has seen 127 new COVID-19 cases, plus an additional 183 asymptomatic infections, in the past week. The vast majority were found in Shijiazhuang, a city of millions in Hebei province whose surrounding areas take the total population to 11 million. Nine confirmed cases were in the neighbouring city of Xingtai, whose area covers 7 million people.

Residents of both cities were banned from leaving unless absolutely necessary, Hebei authorities announced on Friday [8 Jan 2021]. Officials resolved to "strictly control the movement of people and vehicles," with all residential estates placed under "closed management" -- a euphemism for lockdown.

Hebei residents were also banned from entering Beijing or leaving the province unless absolutely necessary. "The outbreak was imported from abroad, but the exact origins are currently under in-depth investigation by state, provincial and municipal experts," said Li Qi, head of the Hebei Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press briefing on Friday [8 Jan 2021]. Chinese officials have repeatedly tried to link recurrent domestic outbreaks to strains of the virus circulating overseas, suggesting that it has been brought back into China by returning travellers and contaminated imported food packaging.

There are mounting fears travel plans for hundreds of millions of people for the Lunar New Year may be ruined as virus controls tighten. Officials are starting to signal a low-key new-year holiday -- which will run from 11-17 Feb 2021 -- nixing the prospect of banquets, parties and public celebrations.

"Mass celebrations, gatherings and fairs are forbidden," said Kang Sen, of Beijing's agriculture and rural affairs authority, adding even funerals should be "brief" and all public events would need prior approval. His comments, carried over state media, appeared directed at villages in areas around the capital rather than the city itself.

In the 2 Hebei cities under the spotlight, restrictions were tightened on Friday [8 Jan 2021]. Long-distance passenger vehicle transport in both cities was suspended and highways closed.

Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed residents being swabbed by medical workers in hazmat suits at community centres in Shijiazhuang while queues outside stretched around the block. Virus control staff stood guard at highways entering the city, which had mostly been blocked by barricades, the images released on Thursday [7 Jan 2021] showed.

Hebei province reported 33 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Friday [8 Jan 2021] in addition to 51 from the day before -- pushing the nationwide daily total to the highest figure since July [2020]. So far, both cities have tested about 6.7 million residents in total, officials said on Friday [8 Jan 2021].

Staff were filmed giving injections of China's recently approved Sinopharm vaccine, which has a 79% efficacy rate.

Three officials from Shijiazhuang's worst-hit Gaocheng district have been disciplined for apparent negligence in virus control, a sign of the pressure on local authorities to squash the virus wherever it emerges.

[Checking the daily China National Health Commission reports on daily confirmed cases, since the 1st report of cases in Hebei on 2 Jan 2021, there have been a total of 141 confirmed symptomatic cases. Reading the media report, I have somewhat of a deja vu sense here with concerns focused on the coming Chinese New Year celebration and the tradition of mobilization and movement of people to gather with family...similar to how the Western countries mobilize for Christmas and New Year. Unfortunately, the Western countries are now beginning to see major increases in daily caseloads and deaths associated with this tradition. The immediate lockdown in the 2 involved cities in Hebei may avoid these increases.

Hebei Province is contiguous with Beijing, surrounding most of the capital region. Both Shijiazhuang and Xingtai are to the south of Beijing, with Xintai more southerly (see https://www.chinadiscovery.com/assets/images/travel-guide/maps/Province-and-city-map.jpg). - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (324 857), Brazil (68 053), and the UK (54 247) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 15 365 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (7-8 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (17 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, Germany (25 833), Spain (25 456), Russia (23 652), South Africa (21 980), France (19 814), India (18 482), Colombia (18 221), Italy (17 529), Czech Republic (14 861), Mexico (14 362), Argentina (13 346), Turkey (11 479), Indonesia (10 617), and Portugal (10 176). A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 29 of the 58 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 20.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 13.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 30.7% increase in daily reported cases and a 19.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are just shy of 860 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 48 hours and over 89.4 million cumulative reported cases with over 1.92 million reported deaths. With daily counts over 860 000, the global caseload is approaching one million new cases per day. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Sobering data show that the comparative 7-day averages are reflecting renewed significant increases of newly confirmed cases and deaths both globally and in the USA, where transmission continues to be out of control, probably indicative of the Christmas and New Year's holiday travel and gatherings. - Mod.MPP]
