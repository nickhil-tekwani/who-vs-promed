Rift Valley fever [RVF] cases have hit 80 in Wajir county since the outbreak on 7 Jun this year [2018].

In an interview with the Nation, Wajir health minister Abdihakim Billow said that the death toll remains at 6. New cases have been reported in Wajir East and Tarbaj, but the hotspots are in Eldas and Wajir West.

Four patients are currently receiving treatment at Wajir Referral Hospital and Eldas dispensary. Mr Billow said hundreds of camels, sheep, and goats have died since the disease outbreak. No cases involving cattle has been reported since the outbreak.

The county extended a ban on meat and milk to Thu 5 Jul 2018 as it seeks to contain the disease. The county has also set up 4 isolation centres in the hotspots, including at Wajir Referral Hospital and Basir in Eldas sub-county.

Isiolo, Marsabit, Mandera, and Meru counties have been on high alert after the virus spread. According to the Ministry of Health's disease surveillance and response unit, at least 26 people have died from the disease.

[According to the above report, which addresses the situation in the Wajir county (in the former North Eastern province), "hundreds of camels, sheep, and goats have died since the disease outbreak" (reportedly, Thu 7 Jun 2018), while "no case involving cattle has been reported since the outbreak."

To assess the severity of the disease in animals or their mortality rate, in each of the 4 species named, the size of the susceptible populations of each has to be taken into consideration. This information has not become available in the recent reports.

The mortality rate may reach 70-100 percent in newborn lambs and kids, while estimated mortality in calves, older lambs, and kids varies from 10-70 percent, depending on various factors including their breed and bodily condition. Overall, the mortality rate is estimated to be 10-30 percent in adult sheep and less than 10 percent in adult cattle. Deaths are most common in pregnant ewes that abort. The disease in adult goats is generally regarded to be less severe than in adult sheep, though data are scarce. During the 1930 epizootic in Kenya, no outbreaks in goat herds were reported, though abortions were suspected. During an experimental trial in goats, virus levels in blood were significantly lower than those recorded in lambs of comparable age when exposed to similar doses. According to observations from Sudan (1981), mortality in goats was reported as 50 percent, compared to 90 percent in young lambs, around 70 percent in adult sheep, and 20 percent in calves.

Notably, during the 1930 epizootic in Kenya and the 1960 major epizootic in South Africa, 4 RVF disease forms were recorded in sheep. The highest mortality rate (up to 100 percent) was observed in per-acute cases affecting newly born lambs. After an incubation period of about 12 hours, collapse and death followed within 36 hours. In young lambs, and to a lesser extent in adult sheep, an acute RVF form was noted, with mortality in lambs being high while not exceeding 20-30 percent in adult sheep. The most common RVF form in adult sheep was sub-acute, where a febrile reaction of 40-41 degrees C, lasting 24-96 hr, was accompanied by anorexia and general weakness. Abortions in pregnant ewes were a prominent symptom, some of them occurring during the convalescent phase of the disease. The least-pathogenic RVF form noted in sheep was mild or inapparent, seen in adult sheep. There was only slight febrile reaction, and the disease was usually detected only by serological examination.

During the mentioned 2 epizootics, the RVF cases observed in cattle were significantly milder than those recorded in sheep, with lower morbidity and mortality rates. A febrile reaction that lasted 24-96 hr was accompanied by anorexia and general weakness. Abortions were numerous and occurred during the acute or convalescent phases of the disease. Mortality was lower than 10 percent, abortion being in many cases the only clinical manifestation of the disease.

During the major outbreak in Zimbabwe in 1978, 15 percent of all cows in the affected areas aborted, the average mortality being less than 5 percent. In a closely inspected herd, 28 of 1000 cows died, and 85 percent of the remainder aborted. - Mod.AS]

[The RVF outbreak continues in both humans and animals. The number of deaths is unclear. The minister of health said that there are 6 fatal cases, whereas the ministry of health's disease surveillance and response unit indicates at least 26 people have died. The prolonged rains mentioned in earlier reports have doubtless provided breeding sites for RFV virus vector mosquitoes. The advice to the public to only consume inspected animal products is prudent. The loss of hundreds of camels, sheep, and goats is a significant economic and cultural loss for their owners, many of whom depend on these animals for their livelihoods. - Mod.TY]

The [Samburu] county will vaccinate 250 000 livestock against Rift Valley fever in the next 2 weeks to prevent its spread. Governor Moses Lenolkulal said the county's borders are susceptible to Rift Valley fever. "Due to the wet conditions, our neighbours have been affected by RVF. That is why we have raised an alarm," he said, adding that the county had improved surveillance as well as committing to vaccinate all the livestock.

[Samburu county, in the former Rift Valley province, Kenya, covers an area of roughly 21 000 sq km (8000 sq mi). The Samburu, a sub-tribe of the Maasai, are semi-nomadic pastoralists who herd mainly cattle but also keep sheep, goats, and camels. See map at https://tinyurl.com/ybnvtlhf.

While cattle may clinically present a relatively mild form of RVF infection (see above), its role as source of human infection may be regarded significant. During several experimental infection trials in cattle, virus levels in blood were found comparable to those in sheep. Furthermore, the public-health hazard is increased by abortions being a main component of the disease presentation in cattle, similar to sheep.

The said data underline the importance of preventive vaccination in Samburu, where the disease has not yet been recorded. Live-attenuated vaccine should not be applied in pregnant animals.

In the meantime, an update of the situation in Rwanda is pending. The most recent information from this country was published by its Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources on [Thu 21 Jun 2018] (https://tinyurl.com/yarlfknv). The press release stated that the disease outbreak was linked to the adverse rains and floods that hit the country between March and May 2018 "fueling the reproduction of mosquitoes that fueled other livestock diseases like the tick-borne diseases in some parts of the country." "Figures indicate that 99 cows died of the disease, and it caused abortion among 452 cows. The virus has infected 1638 cattle, which are receiving treatment, while more than 1202 cattle have recovered. No human cases have been reported so far in Rwanda." According to the said information, the mortality rate in cattle was about 6 percent.

Official notification to the OIE, including updated information on the epidemiology and statistics of the disease, and of the diagnostic tests applied, is pending. - Mod.AS

Dr Yusuf Baseke, the district health officer, says that samples taken from a suspect of the fever tested positive to Rift Valley haemorrhagic fever. The victim, a butcher, was last week found dead in his house in Kanyatsi Village Munkunyu sub county.

According to WHO, Rift Valley fever [virus] can be transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. Those infected with the fever present with symptoms such as muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, and sore eyes.

Dr Baseke warned residents against eating any type of meat and drinking raw milk. In January, the ministry of health confirmed 3 cases of the RVF from Kiboga, Buikwe, and Mityana districts.

[Given the Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Kenya, it is not surprising that there is a human case in neighboring Uganda. A Sun 24 Jun 2018 report from a meeting of 11th meeting of the Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security (SCAFS) that just concluded in Dar es Salaam has directed the East African Community (EAC) secretariat to address the issue of Rift Valley fever promptly. I stated that this year's [2018's] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.

The RVF virus is endemic in the EAC region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths and significant economic loss.

The RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness, and bleeding from gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births, treating the animals, and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses. - Mod.TY
