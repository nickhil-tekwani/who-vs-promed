UNDIAGNOSED HEMORRHAGIC ILLNESS - SUDAN: (KASSALA) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

In Kassala, 2 people reportedly died from haemorrhagic fever last week.

A medical source told Radio Dabanga that 2 people suffering from haemorrhagic fever died at Kassala Hospital last week. "This brings the total number of deaths to 3 in a month."

He said that 5 haemorrhagic fever patients were being treated at the hospital on Saturday [4 Nov 2017]. "Dozens of other patients are being treated at home after being seen by doctors in their private clinics."

The source criticised "the silence of the health authorities in the state." He said that "the state government does not want to disturb the inter-schools competition that will start in mid-November [2017]."

Haemorrhagic fever reportedly appears in Sudan each year. In 2014, a political activist reported the "alarming spread" of the infectious disease in eastern Sudan's Red Sea state, while "the state government and health authorities have imposed a blackout on the disease."

In 2015 and 2016, few reports about haemorrhagic and dengue fever cases in eastern Sudan reached this station, while the disease widely spread in Darfur. In April this year [2017], however, medical sources warned of a possible outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Red Sea state's Tokar locality.

Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of illnesses caused by 4 families of viruses. These include the Ebola and Marburg, Lassa fever, and yellow fever viruses. VHFs have common features: they affect many organs, damage the blood vessels, and affect the body's ability to regulate itself.

[It is urgent that the etiological agent(s) responsible for these hemorrhagic fever cases be identified so that surveillance in the areas where the patients acquired their infections can be determined, preventive measures implemented, and community education initiated.

Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses can be transmitted between an infected and a susceptible individual. Yellow fever virus is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and has caused outbreaks in Sudan in the recent past. Other viruses such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever and the bacterium that is the cause of louse-borne relapsing fever should be included in laboratory diagnostic tests. ProMED would appreciate additional information about these cases and their etiologies as it becomes available.

There have been undiagnosed outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in the region before. In 2016, there was an outbreak in neighboring South Sudan. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. Several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests. In 1999, an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease occurred in the southern part of Sudan due to infections with the bacterium _Borrelia recurrentis_, the cause of louse-borne relapsing fever. - Mod.TY
