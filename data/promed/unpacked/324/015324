a ProMED-mail member, so that she could reply if she wishes. Graciously

Since Dr Roeder has opened a discussion on the Rift valley fever outbreak
in Kenya, let's make some responses to his comments.
First, as to the molecular epidemiology, there is no doubt that the
phylogenetic tree is composed of three main branches and this was confirmed
by analyzing other regions of the genome. What may be discussed is the
designation: in our previous paper (Sall et al. J. Gen. Virol.,1997,78
2853-58) the lineages were called Ia, Ib and II. These clusters were
renamed later from the origin of the majority of the strains which compose
them and the unexpected presence of certain strains in some lineages was
discussed in that paper.
Secondly, as to the biological features of the strains, we did refer to the
Egyptian strains, the biological properties of which helped to distinguish
them from other strains. Some of them reacted with different monoclonal
antibodies and were more virulent in rodents. This has been well documented
by Anderson and Peters (see Microb. pathogenesis, 1988,5 241-50).
Thirdly, as to the occurrence of the epidemic in Kenya, Somalia and
Tanzania, we may have over interpreted different reports on this East
African outbreak, by writing « .. has spread to Somalia and Tanzania .. »,
but it was not the purpose of our letter to describe the outbreak. We do
know that a detailed description can only be done by scientists who went
there. This letter was written with the aim to point out the close
relatedness of one Kenyan strain (kindly provided by Dr Swanepoel) with a
strain from Madagascar, collected in 1990,which suggested that this strain
is endemic in East Africa.
What we pointed out also is the fact that another strain with a different
origin circulated in Madagascar in 1979 and this led to a general agreement
that a programme of surveillance for Rift Valley fever is strongly needed.

[This reply by Michele has been forwarded to Peter Roeder in Rome. As he is
on holiday until the 4th January there will be an unavoidable delay before
he is able to reply, if he so wishes. To keep the discussion going and
provide sharing opportunities for those who know the reality and would
otherwise sit silent, one might point out that with vertical mosquito
virus-transmission and that the reservoir dhambos (sloughs, shallow
temporary ponds) only fill up enough, from excess rains, every 5-10-15
years there is the opportunity for the various endemic RVFv to be
epidemiologically conservative in the face of the admixture(s) of virus
importations from epidemic areas. Or is what we are seeing just the first
and opening scene in an unfolding PCR mystery play, and we have two more
acts to go before the denouement? - Mod.MHJ
