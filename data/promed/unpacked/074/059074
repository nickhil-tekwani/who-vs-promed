Two more people may be infected with the virus of sylvatic yellow fever in
Rio Grande do Sul. The Adolfo Lutz Institute is testing the material
collected from patients who are hospitalized in the interior of the state.

This Wednesday (14 [Jan 2009]) the secretary of health of the state, Osmar
Terra, has appealed to municipalities to make an "active search" in homes
located in rural areas of 109 municipalities in the central and north west
areas of the state.

According to Osmar Terra, experts in yellow fever in Ministry of Health are
assisting in diagnosis and screening of patients with symptoms of the
disease, such as high fever, chills, pain headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and
muscle pain.
