Chikungunya has been reported several times for the last weeks in
Indonesia, mainly in rural areas.

In our clinic at the German Embassy in Jakarta we have seen now
several cases of Chikungunya in 'expats' living in Jakarta, which is
new compared to previous years. [Apart from the] typical clinical
findings the cases were all confirmed by PCR [polymerase chain
reaction] and antibody screening. As the rainy season has not yet
really started we can predict higher numbers in the following weeks,
especially in the urban area of Jakarta.

[Dr Klinnert provides additional information about chikungunya cases
scattered across Indonesia (see the report below and previous
ProMED-mail archived reports for 2008). As Dr Klinnert suggests, the
onset of the rainy season may well bring an increase in outbreaks as
the chikungunya virus vector _Aedes_ mosquito populations increase.
ProMED thanks Dr Klinnert for this first-hand report. Reports
directly from the field from health providers are particularly
valuable.

Although not yet causing deaths, chikungunya [virus] was recorded as
infecting as many as 40 residents of the Pajagalan Village [Kampung],
RT 03 RW 07, Sukamentri District [Kelurahan], Garut City Subdistrict,
Garut Regency, West Java.

"This illness emerged last 17 Sep 2008, attacked a 48-year-old
resident of the Pajagalan Village. The illness continued to spread up
until today [25 Oct 2008] and as many as 40 sufferers have been
recorded," said the Area Head of Eradication of Infectious Diseases
of the Health Service of the Garut Regency, Dede Rohmansyah, on
Saturday (25 Oct 2008).

The official of the Health Regency of Garut has said that the number
of cases of chikungunya in Garut, remembering the Luar Biasa
outbreak, at this time was high. "Indeed the number of [chikungunya]
sufferers this time is higher than the previous number," explained Dede.

Generally, chikungunya virus this time attacked residents aged 14-44
years. All the chikungunya sufferers received medical attention at
the Community Health Centre of Guntur Garut, and 8 residents have
recovered.

"We have taken 15 samples of blood to be tested at the Development
Hall of the Laboratory of Health, Bandung," said Dede.
