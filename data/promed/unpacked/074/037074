[Viewing the 24 locations on the map kindly provided by OIE in the
report is instructive. The disease appears to have a checkerboard
pattern across the northern half of the country. Since this is a
vector-borne disease, local variation in rainfall might provide an
explanation. However, an integrated map of the disease in all the
countries in the North African region would provide additional
insight into the epidemiology of this newly emerging disease, as will
field epidemiologic studies of these outbreaks. Certainly, the
status of orbivirus infections in ruminants in this region has been
full of surprises this year.
ProMED-mail wishes everyone a year of relative peace on the emerging
disease front. Happy and Healthy New Year to all. - Mod.PC]
