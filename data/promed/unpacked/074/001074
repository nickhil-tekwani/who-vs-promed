Mexico City- Mexico has detected the severe H5N1 strain of avian influenza at a 60 000-bird commercial farm in Nuevo Leon state on the border with the United States, the government said on [Sun 30 Oct 2022].

The discovery at the chicken farm comes just over a week after Mexico reported its first-ever case of H5N1 avian influenza, or bird flu, to the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).

The disease was detected when Mexico's agri-food health service tested samples from a farm in Montemorelos, Nuevo Leon, after a producer there raised concerns, Mexico's agricultural ministry said in a statement.

A quarantine has been declared and an unspecified number of birds will be euthanized to control the outbreak, the ministry said. It did not say how many birds were infected.

Mexico's first case of the virus was detected in a wild bird in the Metepec district to the west of capital Mexico City.

Another H5N1 case was found in a wild bird in Tijuana in Baja California state, Mexico's agriculture ministry said, as well as in a 186-chicken, family-run farm in Chiapas in the country's south.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu, has killed poultry in the United States and Europe, with experts concerned the virus did not abate this year as it has previously done during the northern hemisphere summer.

The Mexican authorities indicated an outbreak of avian influenza was already expected, after the recent cases in the United States and Canada.

After detecting the cases of avian influenza, the poultry production units were depopulated, cleaned and disinfected to start the period of sanitary vacuum and later sentinel birds were introduced. (EFE).

According to information from the National Service for Food Health, Safety and Quality (Senasica), 296 000 birds affected by avian influenza classified as HPAI AH5N1 were located in 3 of 8 focal points.

The Mexican authorities detailed these birds managed to affect 3 technical poultry production units: 2 in the state of Sonora and 1 in Nuevo León , both in northern Mexico.

In addition, the Senasica ordered the internal quarantine in both states, so poultry products not having the permission of the Mexican health authority in the 2 affected states cannot be mobilized.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Sader) also explained the technicians of the General Directorate of Animal Health, attached to its charge, installed a quarantine in the affected commercial farms and applied the indicated sanitary measures.

With this, the depopulation, cleaning and disinfection of the poultry production units were carried out to start the period of sanitary vacuum and later to introduce sentinel birds, which can verify the absence of the virus before restarting the production processes.

Likewise, the United States-Mexico Commission for the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Other Exotic Animal Diseases of the Senasica reported that in all cases it applied the corresponding anti-epidemic measures, which include tracking the virus within 15 km [approx. 9 mi] around the findings.

In order to resume the mobilization and placing on the market of their birds, producers must demonstrate the birds in their production units are free of any avian virus, as well as having a registration with the Sader and a certificate of minimum biosecurity measures that guarantee the health of animals.

The Mexican Agriculture Agency stated the entry of this virus was foreseeable due to its recent presence in the US and Canadian markets.

Finally, he reported he is analyzing the effectiveness of the available vaccines and is working on the design of a vaccination strategy to protect Mexican poultry.

https://phys.org/news/2022-11-bird-flu-infects-iowa-egg.html


Iowa agriculture officials said on [Mon 31 Oct 2022] that another commercial egg farm in the state has been infected with bird flu, the first commercial farm case identified since April [2022] when a turkey farm was infected. The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa, housing about 1.1 million chickens.

The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa about 80 mi [130 km] north of Des Moines housing about 1.1 million chickens.

Iowa has had 15 commercial farms infected this year, [2022] including turkeys, egg-laying hens and other chickens. In addition, 5 backyard flocks have been infected. Because the virus is highly contagious, all birds on an infected farm are killed and disposed of to avoid the spread of the disease.

Iowa has been hardest hit with bird losses at more than 13.3 million this year [2022] before the latest farm was found infected.

Nationally more than 47.7 million birds have been affected in 43 states, including 251 commercial flocks and 328 backyard flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show.

Most of the Iowa cases were during the spring migration of wild birds in March and April [2022] with 1 reported in early May [2022]. The virus hadn't been detected again until a backyard flock was infected on [20 Oct 2022] and then the latest infection was confirmed on Monday [31 Oct 2022].

Federal and state agriculture officials had been concerned it could return with the fall migration of wild birds, which often carry the virus but aren't sickened by it. The virus can spread through droppings or the nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil.

"We have been preparing for the possibility of additional outbreaks and are working closely with USDA and producers to eradicate this disease from our state," said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. "With migration ongoing, we continue to emphasize the need for strict biosecurity on poultry farms and around backyard flocks to help prevent and limit the spread of this destructive virus."

[4] Arizona, South Carolina, mixed flocks (H5N1)
Date: Fri 4 Nov 2022
Source: US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) [edited]
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-az-sc


The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in 2 non-commercial backyard flocks (non-poultry) in Yavapai County, Arizona and Beaufort County, South Carolina.

Samples from the Arizona flock were tested at the Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Center and samples from the South Carolina flock were tested at the Clemson Veterinary Diagnostic Center, both part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. The cases were confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.

APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in Arizona and South Carolina on joint incident responses. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the public health risk associated with these avian influenza detections in birds remains low. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degF [74 degC] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at:
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to WOAH standards and minimize trade impacts. WOAH trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. WOAH trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.

APHIS will continue to announce the first case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a State but will not announce subsequent detections in the State. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at:
https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible, to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at
http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains which circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high)--the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

https://1190kex.iheart.com/featured/portland-local-news/content/2022-11-06-bird-flu-detected-in-yamhill-county/


On [Thu 3 Nov 2022] the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) confirmed the state's first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial flock in Yamhill County. The affected flock included approximately 100 birds, including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and emu.

Because the owners sold their eggs to the public, the USDA classifies the birds as a poultry flock rather than a backyard flock, meaning federal and international disease control protocols require the state veterinarian to issue a regional quarantine. The purpose of the quarantine is to prevent the movement of poultry and poultry products from within the affected area giving state and federal officials time to conduct surveillance to ensure no additional cases of HPAI exist. The quarantine also applies to importing all birds from states where a state or federal quarantine is in place. An interactive map of the quarantine area is available at https://bit.ly/3NUzi9w.

ODA personnel, in partnership with the USDA humanely euthanized the birds on the property to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system. There is no immediate public health concern due to the avian influenza virus detection. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the public health risk associated with these avian influenza detections in birds remains low. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degF [approx. 74 degC] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

ODA advises commercial poultry farms and backyard flock owners to be vigilant with biosecurity measures and surveillance. Reducing or eliminating contact between wild birds and domestic flocks is the best way to protect domestic birds from this disease.

Death or illness among domestic birds should be reported to ODA. Please contact the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) for wild birds. Do not collect or handle the birds but report the incident directly to ODFW by telephone or <Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov

https://eu.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2022/11/07/hens-killed-bird-flu-hits-wright-county-iowa-commercial-egg-facility/69627954007/


Bird flu has hit a second commercial egg-laying facility in north central Iowa's Wright County, forcing producers to destroy 1 million hens to contain the highly contagious disease, the Iowa Department of Agriculture said on [Mon 7 Nov 2022].

Last week, another 1.1 million chickens were destroyed at a different Wright County commercial egg facility. Iowa losses to the fall resurgence of highly pathogenic avian influenza now exceed 2 million birds.

Also Monday [7 Nov 2022]., the state reported bird flu had been found in a backyard flock with 17 birds in Louisa County in southeast Iowa.

Altogether, bird flu has hit 17 Iowa commercial operations and 6 backyard flocks in a wave of infections beginning in the spring. Nearly 15.5 million chickens, turkeys and other birds have been killed across the state to contain the virus, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is working with Iowa and other states to respond to the outbreaks.

Monday's [7 Nov 2022] reported outbreaks brought to 4 the number in the state tied to the fall migration. The first, in October [2022], was in a Dallas County backyard flock with 48 birds.

Officials say the outbreaks are tied to the seasonal migration of wild birds, which can carry the disease without showing apparent symptoms. "Migration is expected to continue for several more weeks and whether you have backyard birds or a commercial poultry farm, bolstering your biosecurity continues to be the best way to protect your flock from this disease," Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said in a statement.

The virus can spread to domestic flocks from the droppings of wild birds. It isn't a public health threat and none of the birds nor any poultry products from flocks where avian influenza is detected will reach U.S. food supplies, officials say.

[7] Hudson valley, New York (Sullivan County)
Date: Tue 8 Nov 2022

https://wpdh.com/outbreak-of-virus-lethal-to-humans-detected-in-hudson-valley/


The department of health is warning residents that an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Influenza has been discovered in the Hudson Valley.

Over 100 birds in the Hudson Valley have been infected with the H5N1 influenza strain and officials are concerned that the virus could make its way to local residents. The infection has forced health workers to kill the remaining birds in a flock that includes chickens, ducks, geese and guinea fowl. Officials believe the animals came in contact with wild waterfowl that wound up infecting the birds with the virus, more commonly known as the avian flu.

Where did it come from?
-----------------------
In early February [2022], the Department of Agriculture confirmed the first U.S. case of avian flu since 2020. Since the outbreak at a commercial turkey facility in Indiana, there have been cases found across the country. Here in the Hudson Valley, the avian flu had already been detected in commercial and backyard flocks in Ulster and Dutchess counties.

The latest outbreak has occurred in Sullivan County. The department of health says signs of avian flu in birds include "diarrhea, malaise, loss of egg production and/or misshaped eggs, anorexia, discolored combs, wattles, hocks and skin around the eyes, neurological changes (discoordination), death with no other apparent cause and swelling."

Concern over transmission to humans
-----------------------------------
Luckily, humans have not been affected yet but Sullivan County Public Health Director Nancy McGraw says it may change.

No documented human cases have occurred within this particular HPAI outbreak among local fowl, but historically, pandemic influenza outbreaks have started in animals and spilled over into the human population, so we're keeping a very close eye on the situation with the NYS Department of Health.

The World Health Organization says that H5N1 does not easily jump to humans, but close contact with sick animals can cause infection. The CDC says that most human cases are fatal. The mortality rate appears to be the highest in people aged 10-19 years old and in young adults. While it's rare for humans to pass the avian flu to each other, scientists are fearful that a mutation could occur that would make the virus easily transferable.

Clinical signs and warning signs
--------------------------------
McGraw is asking anyone who has had contact with an ill bird and exhibits symptoms such as conjunctivitis, upper respiratory symptoms, fever, body aches, or symptoms consistent with any flu-like illness to contact the public health department at (845) 292-5910.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/11/three-states-report-their-first-high-path-avian-flu-outbreaks-poultry


Three states--Arizona, Mississippi, and South Carolina--recently reported their first highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks in poultry flocks, part of expanding activity involving the Eurasian H5N1 strain that has now affected poultry in 46 states, with poultry losses soon to pass a record set in 2015.

In a [Fri 4 Nov 2022] statement, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said the outbreaks in Arizona and South Carolina involved backyard flocks. In Arizona, the outbreak struck 2 backyard flocks in Yavapai County, located in the central part of the state near Prescott.

The Arizona Department of Agriculture said today [Mon 7 Nov 2022] it is working closely with APHIS and officials have quarantined the affected locations, where depopulation is under way. The virus had been previously detected a few times in waterfowl found dead in Arizona, according to APHIS.

In South Carolina, the outbreak occurred in a backyard flock in Beaufort County in the south near Hilton Head. H5N1 has been detected several times in the state's wild birds, dating as far back as January [2022].

Meanwhile, in a [Sat 5 Nov 2022 statement], APHIS said the virus was found at a commercial breeder chicken flock in Lawrence County, Mississippi, located in the south central part of the state. The agency did not specify the size of the flock. The virus had been found previously during sampling from hunter-harvested birds.

More outbreaks in other states
------------------------------
Meanwhile, in updates over the past few days, APHIS reported more outbreaks in 10 states, all involving backyard birds, except for Minnesota, which reported the virus again at a commercial turkey farm.

Of states reporting outbreaks in backyard birds, Oregon reported 2 events. Others included California, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania.

In Minnesota, the virus struck a turkey farm housing 8500 birds in Stearns County, located in the central part of the state.

Since the outbreaks in poultry began in February [2022], the events have led to the loss of more than 49 million birds in 46 states. The number will soon pass the record 50.5 million poultry lost during the nation's largest avian flu outbreak in 2015.

Human risk low, but prevention needed
-------------------------------------
In a [Thu 3 Nov 2022] advisory, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the number of affected states this year is more than double the states affected in the 2015 outbreaks. It said though the overall risk to people remains low, those who are exposed to infected or potentially infected birds should take steps to prevent the spread of the virus to themselves, other poultry, or to pets and other animals.

"This applies not just to workplace or wildlife settings but potentially to household settings where people have backyard flocks or pet birds with potential exposures to wild or domestic infected birds," the CDC said.

Avian flu infections in people are mostly likely to occur from prolonged, close, and unprotected contact with sick or dead birds. When contact can't be avoided, people should wear personal protective equipment, avoid touching their mouth, nose, or eyes after contact, wash hands with soap and water afterward, and changing clothes before handing healthy birds and after handling other birds.

The CDC said it has tracked the health of more than 5190 people who were exposed to the virus in the United States this year [2022], with 1 person who tested positive. The patient is a Colorado prisoner who worked on a poultry culling team.

A total of 3 other human H5N1 infections have been reported this year [2022], 1 from the United Kingdom and 2 from Spain.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture has identified new cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza in backyard flocks in Marathon and Waukesha Counties.

State animal health officials say all the birds at both sites have been depopulated to prevent spread of the disease.

Since the beginning of the year [2022], 26 flocks in 18 counties have been confirmed with HPAI, according to state animal health officials. All infected flocks are depopulated to prevent spread of the disease.

HPAI viruses are highly contagious and often fatal to domestic poultry. The disease can be spread by contact with infected birds, equipment, or clothing worn by anyone working with the animals.

[The autumn migration of birds is once again spreading its dreaded avian influenza in its wake as the birds move southward.

Whether you are a commercial producer, a backyard enthusiast, or an avian advocate, increasing your biosecurity is critically important. Remember to keep your birds from any wild bird or from sharing a pond or yard with a wild bird. Protect your birds from flying migration birds, which means keeping them in the barn or some sort of enclosure to prevent dropping from flying birds. Do not let your birds share a water source with wild birds. Be sure to wear clean boots into the barn so you are not tracking anything into your birds. Blow your nose both before you enter the barn and again when you exit the barn. Wear clean coveralls when you enter and exchange them for other clean coveralls and boots if entering another barn. The essential bottom line is, you cannot be too careful! - Mod.TG
