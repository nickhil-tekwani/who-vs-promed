In the Kadamazhai district of Batken region, 3 residents have been admitted to the hospital with suspected infection of anthrax.

According to the head of the district's veterinary department, a resident of Uch-Korgon slaughtered a sick cow, gave meat to butchers for sale and from there the disease spread. "Three people contracted a disease similar to anthrax. On 9 Oct 2022, a resident of Uch-Korgon bought 6 cows from Tektek pasture in the Nookat region. They killed one of them, who was sick, and the meat was handed over to the butchers.

"On 19 Oct 2022, an ulcer appeared on the hand of one of the butchers, and they tried to heal it themselves. The ointment and nasvay were mixed, and the resulting mixture was applied to the wound. By this action, they only increased the wound.

"With such symptoms, a livestock owner and another resident who took part in butchering the sick cow are [currently] in the hospital. We suspect anthrax. All patients are under medical supervision", the veterinarian said. The owner of the sick cow was fined.

[This oblast is part of a southwest wing of Kyrgyzstan surrounding the Ferghana Valley of Uzbekistan, a region of ongoing anthrax outbreaks in the livestock there. The stress of purchase and transportation of the 6 cattle may well have facilitated the expression of a latent infection, if the herd of origin had suffered an anthrax outbreak sometime in the previous 12-18 months.

From the very brief description, this was a typical outbreak arising from the butchering of an animal dying of anthrax. It is very fortunate that there were no fatal gastroenteric cases of anthrax, only cutaneous cases from handling the meat. Being at constant risk, it is a pity that the Kyrgyz districts bordering Ferghana do not routinely vaccinate their cattle, but as outbreaks can be sporadic, the reluctance of the cattle owners is understandable.

"Batken is a region (oblus) of Kyrgyzstan. Its capital is Batken. It is bounded on the east by Osh Region, on the south, west and north by Tajikistan, and on the northeast by Uzbekistan. The northern part of the region is part of the flat, agricultural Ferghana Valley" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batken_Region).

"Kadamjay is a district in Batken region, in southwestern Kyrgyzstan. The administrative seat lies at Kadamjay. The district area is 6146 square kilometres (2373 sq mi), and its resident population was 201 457 in 2021.The largest town of the district, Kadamjay, is located between the cities of Aydarken (Khaidarkan) and Kyzyl-Kyya. The district is thought to have the 2nd largest mercury-antimony deposit in the world. Kadamjay Antimony Factory is one of the biggest factories in Kyrgyzstan. Khaidarkan Mercury Plant, built in 1942, was reported, as of 2005, to produce 300 to 600 metric tons of mercury per year. Ak-Suu (white river) is the river that passes through Kadamjay. Jiydelik Lake is a favorite picnic spot" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadamjay_District).

"Uch-Korgon is a large village in the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan. It is part of the Kadamjay district. With the population of 14 708 (2021), it is the largest village in the region. Under Soviet rule, the village was named Molotovabad. There is a river named Isfayram Soy. Isfayram Soy gives its water to the residents of Uch-Korgon, Kyzyl-Kiya and to other villages around Uch-Korgon and flows further to Quvasoy, a town in Uzbekistan" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cch-Korgon). - Mod.MHJ
