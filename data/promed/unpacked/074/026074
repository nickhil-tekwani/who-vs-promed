Review of disease infested til [sesame] crop
--------------------------------------------
Asserting that interests of the farmers are the top agenda of the
Madhya Pradesh government, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has
said that it will not allow any loss to them.

Mr Chouhan said this after seeing the damaged Til crops due to a
disease called Corynespora at Sheopur district. He said that the
government will treat it as 100 percent damage and assured to provide
relief to the affected farmers and that the farmers will get compensation.

The Chief Minister said that for changing farming into a profitable
venture, the cost of production should be brought down and at the
same time efforts should be made to increase production.

[Leaf blight caused by the fungus _Corynespora cassiicola_ is a
serious disease of sesame (_Sesamum indicum_). It has been reported
from India, the USA and some countries in South America. Symptoms
include dark specks on leaves, stems and seed capsules which develop
into large spots, as well as leaf curl and defoliation. The pathogen
is seed and soil borne and survives in soil and infected crop
residues. Disease management may include methods to reduce inoculum
(removal of weed reservoirs and crop residue), adjusting planting
times, crop rotation (for example with millets), and fungicides as
seed treatments and foliar sprays.

_C. cassiicola_ has a wide host range including cucurbit (cucumber,
squash) and solanaceous (tomato, capsicum, aubergine) vegetables,
soybean, papaya, cowpea, okra, cotton and ornamental species. The
pathogen is found worldwide, but different strains may be restricted
to certain hosts or areas.

Sesame is an important crop in many tropical areas. It is a source of
high value edible oil and also used as a spice and for medicinal
purposes. The oil cake provides high protein animal feed.
