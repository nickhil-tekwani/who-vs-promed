A doctor who survived Ebola after contracting the virus while treating patients in Liberia has quietly returned to practicing medicine in Fort Worth (USA: Texas).

According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram (http://bit.ly/2iApPbH) he returned to practicing medicine about a year ago. He now practices medicine and teaches young doctors at JPS Health Network, where he says some patients recognize him and bring up his battle of more than 2 years.

[It is good to read that this doctor has been able to resume normal activities. Many Ebola survivors are facing serious challenges following recovery from acute infection.

Seeking Clearer Recommendations for Hand Hygiene in Communities Facing Ebola: A Randomized Trial Investigating the Impact of Six Handwashing Methods on Skin Irritation and Dermatitis.

Abstract
--------
To prevent disease transmission, 0.05 percent chlorine solution is commonly recommended for handwashing in Ebola Treatment Units. In the 2014 West Africa outbreak this recommendation was widely extended to community settings, although many organizations recommend soap and hand sanitizer over chlorine. To evaluate skin irritation caused by frequent handwashing that may increase transmission risk in Ebola-affected communities, we conducted a randomized trial with 91 subjects who washed their hands 10 times a day for 28 days. Subjects used soap and water, sanitizer, or 1 of 4 chlorine solutions used by Ebola responders (calcium hypochlorite (HTH), sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), and generated or pH-stabilized sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)). ... Each handwashing method has benefits and drawbacks: soap is widely available and inexpensive, but requires water and does not inactivate the virus; sanitizer is easy-to use and effective but expensive and unacceptable to many communities, and chlorine is easy-to-use but difficult to produce properly and distribute. Overall, we recommend Ebola responders and communities use whichever handwashing method(s) are most acceptable, available, and sustainable for community handwashing.

Abstract
--------
Objective: The outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in different countries, especially the West African nations, has been ravaging human lives and the economy. ...
Methods/Statistical Analysis: This paper proposes the queuing technique as a promising and efficient mathematical approach for the study of EVD transmission and control. It highlights the queueing theory governing equation and applies the theory to EVD problem.
Findings: The application of the technique to the Guinea 2014 EVD outbreak indicates that the use of 2 quarantine centers to combat the outbreak would have served as an adequate control measure. This technique can be used to manage the manpower and material resources in the combat against EVD outbreak.
Applications/Improvements: This approach brings to fore the possible use of queueing technique in the analysis of EVD outbreak. Transmission and control in other countries ravaged by EVD could be studied using queuing network models.
...Results show that the spread of EVD follows an irregular and random distribution pattern. The technique adopted in this paper indicates that for Guinea 2014 EVD outbreak, two quarantine centers were enough to control the disease...

On [Fri 30 Dec 2016], state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) cited a report by the country's Academy of Military Medical Sciences (AMMS), the developer of the "rAd5-EBOV" [recombinant adenovirus type 5 - Ebola virus] vaccine, as saying that tests show that the vaccine is both safe and protective.

According to AMMS, in Phase II trials, 1 single injection is capable of producing an antibody against Ebola virus 14 days after inoculation with the amount reaching the peak resistance at 28 days [after which immunity declined in the Phase 1 trial, which employed a boost vaccination d28 to improve longevity of immune response. - Mod.LK]

The rAd5-EBOV vaccine has been reportedly successful in clinical trials in 500 cases of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] infection in Sierra Leone. [This seems surprising as no cases of EVD have been identified in Sierra Leone since the end of the outbreak there in Feb 2016. It would be helpful to be able to read a publication on the details and results of the trial if indeed this is a Phase II. - Mod.LK]

[A Phase I trial, described below, was completed and just published, testing individuals who were healthy uninfected people from Sierra Leone, i.e., not cases of EVD. It is not clear if that is actually the trial being reported here.
For healthy adults from Sierra Leone, the recombinant type-5 adenovirus vector-based Ebola vaccine [rAd5-EBOV] is safe and immunogenic, according to a study published online on 21 Dec 2016 in The Lancet (Li JX, Hou LH, Meng FY et al. Immunity duration of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine and a homologous prime-boost immunisation in healthy adults in China: final report of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial. Lancet Glob Health. 2016. pii: S2214-109X(16)30367-9. doi: 10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30367-9. http://thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langlo/PIIS2214-109X(16)30367-9.pdf).

Feng-Cai Zhu, from the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Nanjing, China and colleagues, recruited healthy HIV-negative adults aged 18 to 50 years, with no history of Ebola virus infection and no previous immunization with other Ebola candidate vaccines. A total of 500 participants were randomized to receive high-dose vaccine (1.6x10^11 viral particles; 250 participants), low-dose vaccine (8.0x10^10 viral particles; 125 participants), or placebo (125 participants). The researchers found that at least one solicited adverse reaction was reported by 53, 48, and 43 percent of participants in the high-dose, low-dose, and placebo groups, respectively, within 7 days of vaccination; most were mild and self-limiting. ...more

"The recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector-based Ebola vaccine was safe and highly immunogenic in healthy Sierra Leone adults, and 8.0x10^10 viral particles was the optimal dose," the authors write. Of the authors, 2 are employees of Tianjin CanSino Biotechnology, a co-developer of the vaccine (http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)32617-4/abstract).

Whether the vaccine is protective against EVD will only become clear when it is used during an outbreak, but it is good news that it is safe and immunogenic. - Mod.LK]
