PORCINE REPRODUCTIVE & RESPIRATORY SYNDROME - VIET NAM (05): HUMAN NOT

[On Wed 26 May 2010, ProMED-mail published the posting 'Porcine
reprod. & resp. syndrome - Viet Nam (02), human fatality suspected'.
It was based upon a report titled "Pig disease feared to claim 1st
fatality" which was published in VietnamNet Bridge, an English online
newspaper in Vietnam, at
<http://english.vietnamnet.vn/social/201005/Pig-disease-feared-to-claim-first-fatality-912419/>.

Following the above ProMED-mail posting and 2 subsequent responses,
the text in the original report from which 'VietnamNet Bridge' derived
its information, namely Vnexpress.net, has been scrutinised by
ProMED-mail's MBDS Vietnamese-speaking moderator. His results follow.
- Mod.AS]

Below are 2 articles in Vietnamese in Vnexpress.net.

The 1st article [No 1 in commentary] quoted Nguyen Xuan Man saying
that the death might be due to _Streptococcus suis_.

The 2nd article [No 2 in commentary] said that the fatality rate among
_S.suis_ patients is 7 percent.

I guess The Vietnamnet Bridge mistakenly translated _S. suis_ into
PRRS, then copied exactly one paragraph about PRRS from the pig site
<http://www.thepigsite.com/diseaseinfo/97/porcine-reproductive-respiratory-syndrome-prrs> [See No 3 in the commentary], inserting it into that controversial article. [See commentary
further].

[The following provides additional information on the sources, 2 in
Vietnamese and 1 in English, as forwarded by Nguyen Cuong Quoc, and
upon which the controversial Vietnamnet Bridge report of 26 May 2010
was based.

1. Vnexpress.net (in Vietnamese), dated 24 May 2010, dealt with a
youth suspected as a fatal case of swine streptococcus bacteria. The
article included the sentence: "On the afternoon of 24 May, Mr Nguyen
Xuan Men, deputy director of Quang Ngai Department of Health,
confirmed this young [man] (at Nghia Chanh Ward, Quang Ngai City) died
of suspected swine streptococcus." See at
<http://vnexpress.net/GL/Doi-song/2010/05/3BA1C323/>.

2. Vnexpress.net (in Vietnamese), dated 26 May 2010, dealt with a
hospitalised 52-year-old female from Duc Thang commune, Tien Lu
District, Hung Yen province, who nearly died of swine Streptococcus.
The article included the passage: "Streptococcus is a disease [it is a
bacterium] transmitted from pigs to humans, causing septicemia,
meningitis or a combination of both. The disease has become epidemic,
scattered throughout the year, but can be fatal if treated late. The
death rate is about 7 percent." See at
<http://vnexpress.net/GL/Doi-song/2010/05/3BA1C3C6/>. (A picture of
the patient is included).

3. The web-site page
<http://www.thepigsite.com/diseaseinfo/97/porcine-reproductive-respiratory-syndrome-prrs>, dealing with PRRS, includes the following passage: "The virus of PRRS has a particular affinity for the macrophages particularly those found in the lung. Macrophages are part of the body defences. Those present in the lung are called alveolar macrophages. They ingest and remove invading bacteria and viruses, but not in the case of the PRRS virus. Instead, the virus multiplies inside them producing more virus and kills the macrophages. Once it has entered a herd it tends to remain present and active indefinitely." This passage was copied into the Vietnamnet Bridge article, with an added suffix "The fatality rate is at 7 percent; thus, it can do harm if patients are not timely hospitalized". (derived from source No
2).

The findings of Nguyen Cuong Quoc and his suggested conclusion clearly
indicate that the article in the Vietnamnet Bridge of 26 May 2010 was
erroneous and misleading: in fact, not even a suspicion of PRRS
infection in a human patient has been raised in Viet Nam. The 2 cases
involved were infected, or suspected to be infected, by _S. suis_. -
