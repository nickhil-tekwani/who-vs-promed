Agriculture officials have confirmed that black sigatoka, a dangerous
fungal disease, has been discovered in St Lucia and threatens the
struggling banana industry.

Agriculture Minister Ezekiel Joseph said the dreaded disease was
discovered on a banana plantation in the southeast of the island and
that government officials will be verifying the extent of infestation
across the island.

"We are now embarking on a comprehensive survey island-wide to
determine the extent of the problem, and, from that, we will know the
measures we need to undertake to either eradicate or control," he said.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by
the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species and
hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf
diseases of bananas, with yield losses of 50 percent or more. It is
present in the Americas, China, South East Asia, and parts of Africa.
Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant; older leaves are
not readily infected.

BS seriously affects photosynthetic ability, and fruit can ripen
prematurely during commercial shipment causing further losses. It is
spread by water, wind, and contaminated materials including suckers
for planting. Disease management includes frequent applications of
fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, and cultural
practices, but the high costs of these measures make them essentially
unavailable to smallholder farmers.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS) with
similar symptoms. YS causes less damage because symptoms appear mainly
on older leaves. There are more crop cultivars with degrees of
resistance to YS than to BS.

BS (and also YS) has been causing serious crop losses in the Caribbean
region and has recently also been confirmed in neighbouring Guyana
(ProMED-mail post 20090928.3392). St Lucia has attempted to prevent
introduction of BS by quarantine measures (see ProMED-mail post
20071010.3322), and this appears to be the 1st time the disease has
been detected there.
