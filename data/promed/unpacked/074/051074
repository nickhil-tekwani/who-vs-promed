A total of 6941 flu cases were confirmed among inbound passengers in December and January [2018], according to the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. It marked a yearly increase of 81.9 percent, the administration said.

Chinese inspection and quarantine authorities require inbound tourists to notify symptoms such as fever and cough. Unlike cases of serious infectious diseases such as cholera, inbound passengers with flu do not require mandatory quarantine at places designated by authorities, Liu Maohua, an official with the administration was quoted as saying by China Daily.

The inspection and quarantine officers may give a note to inbound passengers suspected of having the flu, suggesting they get an official diagnosis, Liu said.

The upcoming Spring Festival holiday [16 Feb 2018] and winter vacations have brought an increasing number of Chinese travelling abroad. The administration also warned that travellers should take flu precautions before heading to countries and regions with high flu infections.

Flu outbreaks have been reported worldwide including the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy, North Africa, Japan, and South Korea since winter last year [2017]. In the United States, 14 000 people were hospitalized for treatment as a result of flu.

Chinese authorities will follow and evaluate flu outbreaks in these countries and regions and intensify disease prevention and control at the ports.

As many as 180 patients in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad have so far tested positive for influenza virus (swine flu) [influenza A(H1N1) virus] while at least 2 patients had reportedly died from the virus. The National Institute of Health (NIH), which tested samples of patients for influenza, said that 78 of the patients who tested positive for the virus hailed from Islamabad while over 100 belong to Rawalpindi.

According to sources in NIH, they have received over 7000 samples of blood from across the country suspected of being infected with influenza. Hospitals and clinics in the twin cities had sent in around 1000 blood samples, of which over half or 550 were sent by health centres in Islamabad. Of these, the virus was confirmed in 78 samples. Rawalpindi sent in around 600 blood samples of which around 100 had tested positive for the virus.

On the other hand, influenza patients are facing problems owing to a shortage of relevant medicine in the market. Dr Naseem Akhtar, an assistant professor on infectious diseases at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), told Roznama Express that as many as 17 patients, who had tested positive for influenza, were currently under treatment at the hospital. Of these, one patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), another in the surgical ICU while the remaining 15 had been kept in an isolation ward. Blood samples from these patients have been sent to NIH for testing, he added.

Acknowledging that at least 2 patients have died of influenza, Dr Akhtar said that to ensure an adequate supply of medicine, PIMS had submitted an application to the World Health Organization (WHO) upon which the global health body provided the tertiary hospital with 200 Star-flu capsules -- sufficient for 40 patients.

Meanwhile, Dr Masood Ghani, a senior doctor at the government-run Polyclinic Hospital, shared that they had sent 3 applications to the WHO in the past 3 weeks to procure 1200 capsules for influenza to treat 240 patients. He added that despite having fewer patients, Dr Ghani was confident the Polyclinic had sufficient medicines to treat patients. Initially, the WHO had provided Polyclinic with medicine for 40 patients.

It knows no international boundaries and kills more people than war or terrorism and this year's [2018] flu outbreak is among the deadliest in a century.

We are talking about the flu and this year's [2018] strain is particularly nasty. Across the northern hemisphere hundreds are dying every week with many more weeks of the flu season left. Here in the US, hospitals from California to Georgia have been setting up special flu tents to cope with the influx of patients.

The CDC reports over 4000 US deaths a week from flu and pneumonia. Pneumonia is a common secondary infection following a bout of the flu.

And it's not just the young and old that are getting very sick.

A flu patient in California said from his hospital bed, "...I was throwing up all night, I thought it was something more serious than the flu because I've never had flu like this before. I've never had to throw up or even come into the hospital for the flu."

In Japan, the 1st week of February saw more than 2.8 million new cases.

In Hong Kong, schools were shut for Chinese New Year [16 Feb 2018] early after the outbreak claimed over 120 lives.

This year's especially virulent flu strain, H3N2, is not entirely new, but is different enough that vaccines only give about 30 percent protection from the virus in the US. In Canada last month, it proved even less effective.

Many countries in North Africa and the Middle East are also seeing an increase of the H1N1 strain of flu that spread across the globe in 2009 killing thousands.

The World Health Organization says cases in Europe are well above normal and China is seeing the highest levels of flu cases in 4 seasons.

This particularly nasty flu season falls on the 100th anniversary of the biggest flu pandemic in history. The 1918 outbreak is estimated to have killed between 20 and 50 million people worldwide.

It's a reminder that one of the world's most common diseases is also one of its deadliest.

A 52-year-old NRI (non-resident Indian) from Saudi Arabia [MCS] died of swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] in Dharpur Medical College of Patan [Gujarat] on [Mon 12 Feb 2018]. His wife [SS], who was suspected to be infected with [influenza A/H1N1] virus, died at a private hospital in Patan last [Fri 2 Feb 2018].

The couple had come to their native in Patan about 3 months ago along with their son and were residing at Kali Bazaar in Patan. The couple was to return to Saudi Arabia later this month [February 2018].

"While [M] tested positive for H1N1 virus on [Mon 12 Feb 2018] before his death, his wife died of suspected swine flu at a private hospital last [Fri 2 Feb 2018]," chief district health officer (CDHO) of Patan Bharat Goswami said. "Son of the deceased couple is also suffering from the cough and cold and is under treatment. A medical team is reviewing the 1st swine flu case of the season," Goswami added.

Goswami further said, "We are taking all possible preventive measures on a war-footing. 3 survey teams are now conducting the surveillance work in the affected area and medicines are being provided to affected people. We have so far surveyed about 158 houses and found 12 cases of cold and cough."

[5] Far ultraviolet C (far-UVC) light: virucidal gent

The flu season in 2018 is one of the worst we've experienced in recent years. In fact, health officials confirmed this past [Fri 9 Feb 2018] that we're on track to break several records before the 2018 flu season is through. Representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that hospitalizations related to the flu have already surpassed earlier records, and doctor visits from people with flu-like symptoms haven't been this high since the H1N1 "swine flu" pandemic back in 2009. 63 children have died from the flu so far this season, quickly approaching last year's total, when the flu killed 110 children. The flu shot is also not terribly effective this year [2018], though health officials are still encouraging people to vaccinate themselves.

The flu is a serious problem each year, especially for very young children and the elderly. Officials say the 2017-2018 flu season is also particularly dicey because it's slamming the entire country at once, rather than hitting different regions across the United States in waves. Some hospitals have grown overcrowded due to the influx of patients with severe flu symptoms, and all signs suggest things will get worse before they get better. While all this is going on, however, researchers have made what could be a groundbreaking discovery that helps shape the way we fight the flu in the near future.

Recognizing flu symptoms early on and getting to the doctor as quickly as possible are really the only ways to combat the flu. Nothing can stop it once someone has been infected though, which is why researchers put a great deal of time into studying ways to stop the spread of the flu virus.

The bad news is that recent studies have found that the flu is even easier to catch than we previously expected, with some flu viruses capable of lingering in a room for as long as 2 hours after an infected person has left. The good news is that scientists may have discovered a simple and effective way to kill the flu virus, and the discovery could potentially have a dramatic impact on cutting the spread of the flu in the near future.

Researchers at Columbia University found that a special type of ultraviolet light kills the flu virus. Of course, normal UV light kills germs as well, but it has also been found to cause cataracts and even cancer in humans. But the researchers found that a different type of UV light called far ultraviolet-C (far-UVC) kills the flu virus just as effectively as normal UV light, and it poses no known threats to humans.

"Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges," the researchers wrote in their abstract in a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. "A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin."

The abstract continued, "This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light inactivating more than 95 percent of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases."

Special far-UVC lamps could be set up in public spaces such as hospitals, potentially having a huge impact on the spread of the flu and other airborne contagions. And according to David J Brenner, the lead author on the paper, such setups would be completely safe for humans.

"Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard," Brenner said in a press release. "But because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them."

A promising research that can perhaps be piloted, keeping in mind the risk associated with human exposure to UV light. - Mod.UBA]
