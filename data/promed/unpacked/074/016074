Investigations are underway at a dairy farm in Jersey where more than 100 cows fell ill and died within a 4-day period. The deaths at the [L] family's [farm] near St Helier were all in the unit's "A group" of 120 high-yielding cows. Animals began to show signs of illness on Thursday [15 Dec 2022].

Officers from the Jersey government, vets, local farmers and staff from the Jersey Dairy co-operative all tried to help over the weekend. But almost all of the high-yielding group died. Surviving high-yielders are still being treated by vets while cattle in a separate part of the herd have been unaffected.

Veterinary officials have so far focused on a specific batch of feed as a potential cause, and samples have been sent to the UK for analysis. Test results are not expected until the end of this week.

He [Jonathan Renouf, Jersey's deputy minister for the environment] confirmed that although officials said the cattle deaths were an isolated incident, as a precaution Jersey Dairy would dispose of more than 33 000 litres [~8700 gallons] of milk collected from the island's farms last Friday [16 Dec 2022]. "My thoughts are with all those at the farm having to come to terms with what's happened," Mr Renouf added.

Jersey Dairy managing director Eamon Fenlon said the situation was heart-breaking and added his support for the [L] family. Mr Fenlon said Jersey Dairy had been working with the Public Health office to ensure there was no risk to consumers, adding that none of the company's products contained milk from the affected farm.

[This sad event, reportedly affecting specifically/only dairy cows of the "A group," has likely been caused by an ingredient in the feed, which has not been included in the ration of other cattle on the same affected farm. Toxicological agents, organic or nonorganic, deserve being considered, including botulism. The fatality rate seems very high. In the absence of clinical data, not much more can be said at this stage on the possible etiology and of health hazards to consumers. The measures undertaken to protect public health are precautional and justified.

It is hoped a diagnosis is established at the earliest. - Mod.AS
