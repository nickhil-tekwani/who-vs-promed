[Ref: Enserink M: Questions abound in Q-fever explosion in the
Netherlands. Science 2010 Jan; 327(5963): 266-7]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the United States, Q fever is classified as a "Category B"
bioterrorism agent because it would be relatively easy to use and
because, although not as deadly as anthrax or plague, attacks could
still create widespread disease and panic. The US Army exposed human
volunteers to it as part of its biowarfare program in the 1950s; the
Soviet Union experimented with it as well, as did the Japanese cult
Aum Shinrikyo, known for its 1995 sarin attack. Bioterror worries
brought more attention to it in the 1990s and prompted the United
States to make it reportable in 1999. This increased awareness --
along with better diagnostic tests -- may explain the rising number of
reported outbreaks of Q fever over the past 10 years worldwide, says
epidemiologist Didier Raoult of the Universite de la Mediterranee in
Marseille, France, the foremost expert in human Q fever. "Once you
start looking for Q fever, you'll find more and more of it," he says.

But what is going on in the Netherlands now is not just better
detection but something new and different, says epidemiologist Roel
Coutinho, head of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control in
Bilthoven. When 182 human cases were detected in and around a town
called Herpen in the summer of 2007, it seemed like a one-off
outbreak. But in 2008, a new wave erupted, quickly filling up
intensive-care units in the province of Noord-Brabant. A thousand
cases were reported that year. In 2009, the number of new cases jumped
to almost 2200, and the disease was found across the country. It is
still unclear what is behind the massive spread. Part of the reason
has to be the recent expansion of high-intensity goat farming in the
densely populated country, says Coutinho. The number of goats has
quadrupled in Holland to more then 350 000 since 1995, and the number
of them per farm has tripled; the country is now home to some of the
biggest goat farms in the world. (In a sad twist of fate, some farmers
switched to goats after a devastating swine flu outbreak ruined the
Dutch pig industry in the 1990s.) Farms are often close together, and
animals are frequently transported between them, presumably
facilitating spread, says Coutinho. Bacteria released during abortions
end up in manure, which is often spread onto farm fields; the wind may
have carried them to the many surrounding towns and cities.

But Hendrik-Jan Roest, a scientist at the Central Veterinary Institute
of Wageningen UR in Lelystad, says the sudden increase could be linked
to a more virulent subtype of the microbe that started spreading in
about 2005. Genetic typing by Corne Klaassen at Canisius Wilhelmina
Hospital in Nijmegen has shown that all Dutch farms and patients are
infected by a single subtype of _C. burnetii_. That suggests that the
strain is somehow better at propagating itself than others, Roest
says. He plans to compare strains in a collaborative study with Annie
Rodolakis of the French National Institute for Agricultural Research
in Tours, who has developed a mouse model of Q fever.

A more urgent question is how to bring the outbreak under control. In
2008, veterinary and public health authorities hoped that hygienic
measures, such as a ban on distributing manure on farm fields, would
help reduce human exposure. Now, the hope is that an animal vaccine
produced by CEVA, a French company, can help bring the microbe under
control. In short supply in 2008 and 2009, the vaccine will be
plentiful this year [2010], says Christianne Bruschke, chief
veterinary officer at the agriculture ministry. The vaccine does not
prevent all infections, but it does prevent most abortions, which
should help curtail the spread of the disease. The vaccine does not
work in infected animals, however, which is why an expert panel
recommended in early December [2009] the emergency slaughter of all
pregnant goats at affected farms. (There is no reliable way to quickly
distinguish infected goats from healthy goats.) Bruschke says the cull
is a one-time measure to prevent another massive release of microbes
in the spring of 2010, when the goats would normally give birth. Then
from 2011 on, the effects of the vaccine should start kicking in.

The impact on some farmers could be devastating, says Van Lokven. The
Dutch government reimburses farmers for the current value of the goats
but doesn't do so for the loss of income while they rebuild their
flocks. How well the measure will work is unclear as well. The huge
numbers of _C. burnetii_ already in the environment may persist for
months or years; there is no good way to measure their numbers or to
assess the threat they pose, says Roest. And there are many other
questions. Although there is little doubt that goat farms are key
amplifiers in the current outbreak, the role of cattle farms is unclear.

For now, most experts say another surge of human cases this spring
[2010] is inevitable -- they just hope it will be smaller than that of
2009.

[Ref: Enserink M: Humans, animals -- It's One Health. Or is it?
Science 2010 Jan; 327(5963): 266-7]
---------------------------------------------
A "holistic approach" and "synergism" working for the health of all
species. Those are the buzzwords of the One Health movement, which
aims to bring veterinary and human health closer together. Because
people and animals form such a close-knit ecosystem -- and most new or
re-emerging diseases come from animals -- the classic divide between
veterinarians and doctors is hampering disease control, 3 scientists
argued when they began promoting the concept 3 years ago (Science, 15
Jun 2007, p. 1553).

But the Dutch Q-fever outbreak provides a vivid example of how those 2
worlds often don't get along, especially when the stakes are different
for each. Public health officials have complained that the veterinary
community didn't properly inform them and that the outbreak spiraled
out of control in part because economic interests trumped human
health. "Sure, One Health, it's a nice concept, but we clearly have a
long way to go," says Roel Coutinho, head of the Centre for Infectious
Disease Control.

What makes Q fever tricky is that the vast majority of animals are
healthy and asymptomatic, says French epidemiologist Didier Raoult of
the Universite de la Mediterranee in Marseille, France. The disease
does trigger some abortion and premature birth, but the economic
damage is limited, so there's little incentive to do anything about an
outbreak. "The vets don't care about it," says Raoult -- and human
health suffers as a result.

Animal health authorities were slow to investigate suspected farms
even as human cases started pouring into hospitals in 2008, says Jos
van de Sande, a doctor at a regional health service in Noord-Brabant,
the hardest-hit province. To protect farmers from stigmatization, van
de Sande and his colleagues weren't told the exact location of
contaminated holdings, only the general area. "You can't fight an
epidemic like that," he says. Coutinho adds: "We just weren't able to
get across how serious the human problem was getting."

Christianne Bruschke, the country's chief veterinary officer,
dismisses those claims. From the onset, policy was set by a working
group with members from both the agriculture and the health ministries
-- and it included Coutinho and other scientists. "They should have
spoken up before if they disagreed," says Bruschke. She says the
government had to strike a balance between farmersÂ’ interests and
public health in the face of insufficient data about how Q fever
spread: "You can't impose draconian measures on farmers if you have no
idea whether they will have an effect."

The Dutch government plans to investigate how the epidemic was
handled. Coutinho says one lesson is already clear: Veterinarians
should notify their colleagues in public health anytime a zoonotic
disease starts spreading in animals -- as Q fever did in 2005, 2 years
before the human explosion began.

[For the Dutch criteria for an outbreak, see further down in the cited
Eurosurveillance paper.

Reportedly, Q fever was diagnosed in 2005 as a cause of abortion at 2
dairy goat farms. The numbers of outbreaks since 2005, reported to
EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH)
on 12 Jan 2010, is as follows (for URL, see further):

Section / 2005 / 2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009 / total
Dairy sheep / - / 1 / - / 1 / - / 2
Dairy goats / 2 / 6 / 7 / 7 / 4 / 26

The following description of the Q fever situation in Dutch goat and
sheep, as of May 2009, is derived from the Eurosurveillance review,
written jointly by public and animal health experts, covering both
aspects (Ref 1). The article was included in ProMED-mail's posting
20090814.2889.

"Veterinary situation
---------------------
The total number of registered small ruminant farms in the Netherlands
is 52 000, of which 350 are professional dairy goat farms with more
than 200 adult goats, and 40 are professional dairy sheep farms. In
2005, Q fever was diagnosed for the 1st time as a cause of abortion at
a dairy goat farm, using immunohistochemistry on sections of placenta.
A 2nd case was diagnosed later in 2005. In 2006, 2007 and 2008, 6, 7,
and 7 new cases at dairy goat farms were confirmed, respectively,
mainly in the same area where human cases occurred. In the same
period, 2 cases of abortion caused by _C. burnetii_ were confirmed at
dairy sheep farms, one in the southern and one in the northern part of
the country, but these 2 cases do not seem to be related to human
cases. Analyses of abortion outbreaks showed that the average number
of goats per farm was 900, of which 20 percent aborted, ranging from
10-60 per cent. The average number of sheep on both infected sheep
farms was 400, and the abortion rate was 5 per cent.

Abortion outbreaks before June 2008 were reported on a voluntary basis
to the Animal Health Service and also confirmed by
immunohistochemistry. Since June 2008, notification of Q fever in
goats and sheep is mandatory in the Netherlands. There is a legal
requirement for farmers and their private veterinary surgeons to
notify the occurrence of abortion in small ruminants held in deep
litter houses. For large farms (greater than 100 animals), the
notification criterion is an abortion wave defined as an abortion
percentage higher than 5 per cent among pregnant animals. For smaller
holdings, a criterion of 3 or more abortions in a 30 day period is
used. From January to April 2009, this new regulation has led to
notification of 3 dairy goat farms with clinical cases of Q fever. One
farm is located in the province of Overijssel (notified in February
2009), one in the south of the province of Limburg (notified in March
2009), and one in the province of Noord-Brabant (notified in April
2009). This veterinary notification can potentially facilitate the
detection of related human cases or clusters. Veterinarians,
physicians, and the public are informed through targeted mailings,
publications, and the media. The exact location of animal farms with
clinical Q fever is now reported to the municipal health service. In
February 2009, a nationwide stringent hygiene protocol became
mandatory for all professional dairy goat and sheep farms, independent
of Q fever status."

The evolution of the Q fever situation in the Netherlands since 2005
is unprecedented in its public health implications. _C. burnetii_ has
reportedly been spreading by air, affecting thousands of humans,
including city dwellers who had not got closer than 1000 meters (0.6
mi) or even more to the animals which are suspected to be the
reservoir and amplifiers of the agent. In hindsight, investigators may
now suppose that active surveillance covering all goats, sheep (why
exclude cattle?!) farms in North Brabant and Gelderland should have
started in 2007, when the 1st human cases were reported. To the best
of this moderator's knowledge, no such measure has been undertaken
globally elsewhere, in situations such as the one seen in 2007 in the
south of the Netherlands; there are several descriptions of such
scenarios. Q fever is known to cause abortions in small and large
ruminants globally (New Zealand is the known exception); human
infections with _C. Burnetii_ , allegedly of animal origin, have been
recorded in the past in various countries, but did not lead to
wide-scale, compulsory, meticulous, active surveillance encompassing
whole regions or countries. In the unfortunate absence of
clairvoyance, no such surveillance was undertaken before the epidemic
took its eventual dimensions. This, in difference with another,
"classical" zoonosis, namely brucellosis, where "test and slaughter"
policy, or "modified stamping out", sometimes combined with or
replaced by vaccination, were the prescribed modus operandi. The
background to this difference, and lessons to be learned, may be
included in the shortly expected investigation of this exceptional
event.

Should active surveillance be contemplated (selectively?) whenever
animals are suspected to harbour or spread a disease agent with
zoonotic potential? An interesting question, with a broad spectrum of
theoretical and practical ramifications and far-reaching economical
implications. OIE's requirements re animal health surveillance are
included in chapter 1.4 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code,
available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.1.4.htm>.
