China tracks down missing Taiwan TB patients
---------------------------------------------------
China has tracked down 2 Taiwanese tuberculosis (TB) patients who
defied a flight ban, Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control said on
Saturday [28 Jul 2007]. The patients, a 55-year-old man suffering a
drug-resistant form of tuberculosis and his 57-year-old wife who has
standard tuberculosis and is infectious, were found in the eastern
province of Jiangsu on Friday [27 Jul 2007], the CDC and China's
official Xinhua news agency said.
The couple, who took a flight from the Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung to
Hong Kong and then boarded a plane to Nanjing in mainland China on
Wednesday [25 Jul 2007], have been transferred to hospital, Xinhua
quoted China's Ministry of Health as saying.
Health authorities in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China launched a hunt for
the couple and passengers who sat near them on the flights.
"The family members of these patients have been uncooperative,
providing inconsistent information regarding the patients
whereabouts, and later proved to be misleading," Taiwan's CDC said in
a statement on its Web site:
. "Therefore, they will be subjected to legal
liabilities in view of the aforementioned," said the CDC.
Xinhua did not say why the couple had broken rules against air travel
for infectious tuberculosis patients, but Taiwanese officials said
earlier that the man and wife had gone to stay with relatives in
Nanjing. Taiwan prohibits people with multi-drug resistant
tuberculosis from any air travel and those who flout the rules can be
fined T DOL 150 000 (US DOL 4560).
The couple's flight comes after a U.S. lawyer set off international
alarms in May [2007] for fleeing across borders when he was thought
to be infected with the most dangerous form of TB, or extensively
drug-resistant TB, which is extremely difficult to treat. TB is a
highly infectious disease that is spread by coughing and sneezing. It
kills about 1.6 million people a year. One in 3 people worldwide is
infected with dormant TB bacteria but it is only when a person's
immunity is low that the TB bacteria becomes active and symptoms show.

see the moderator's comments of the prior ProMED posting
(Tuberculosis, MDR, airplane exposure - multicountry 20070727.2418.)
The above news release says that health authorities in Taiwan, Hong
Kong and China have launched a hunt for passengers who sat near the
husband with MDR TB and his wife with contagious
antibiotic-susceptible tuberculosis on the flights. However the
Taiwan CDC previously stated that since the duration of each flight
was less than 8 hours, they believed that risk to other passengers
was negligible (see:
<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/index_news_info.asp?data_id=2369>),
and consequently the Taiwan CDC "does not recommend the passengers
and crew to immediately undergo medical examination or X-ray
examination." (see:
<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/index_news_info.asp?data_id=2373>). - Mod.ML]
