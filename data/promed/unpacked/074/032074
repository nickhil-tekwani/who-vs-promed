Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which has been linked with pediatric COVID-19, may pose higher risks to children in lower socioeconomic statuses or who are minorities, according to a Pediatrics study today [28 Apr 2021].

The study compared MIS-C patients with those who had COVID-19, those who were evaluated for MIS-C but found without, children with febrile illness, children with Kawasaki disease, and healthy children in the state. Everyone included in the cohort was under 21 years and in Massachusetts.

In total, 43 patients had MIS-C. Most (58.1%) were boys and of non-White racial or ethnic descent (44.2% Hispanic, 25.6% Black). The median age was 9.7 years at diagnosis. About 2/3 (67.4%) of children with MIS-C had a positive antibody test for COVID-19, and 19 (44.2%) had preexisting comorbidities, with the most common being obesity (17) and asthma (6).

A little more than half of MIS-C patients were in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile (51.1%) or in the highest social vulnerability index (SVI) quartile (53.5%). The researchers calculated that, compared with the general Massachusetts population, both groups had more than double the risk of MIS-C (SES OR, 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.4, and SVI OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.5-4.1). SES and SVI values were similar between the MIS-C and COVID-19 groups, but patients in the other groups tended to have higher household income.

Black and Hispanic children were independently associated with greater risk. The researchers report that children in the lowest SES quartile who were Black had between an 8.7- and 10.8-fold higher risk of MIS-C compared with White, non-Hispanic children in the same neighborhood. In the same SES group, Hispanics of any race had an OR of 8.7 to 49.8.

"Steps to ameliorate risk for exposure to COVID-19 are key to limiting incidence of MIS-C," write the researchers. "Identifying neighborhoods in which children are most likely to have COVID-19 exposure can inform public health efforts and may allow for proactive protection of at-risk populations."

Abstract
Objectives. To characterize the socioeconomic and racial and/or ethnic disparities impacting the diagnosis and outcomes of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).

Methods. This multicenter retrospective case-control study was conducted at 3 academic centers from 1 Jan to 1 Sep 2020. Children with MIS-C were compared with 5 control groups: children with coronavirus disease 2019, children evaluated for MIS-C who did not meet case patient criteria, children hospitalized with febrile illness, children with Kawasaki disease, and children in Massachusetts based on US census data. Neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and social vulnerability index (SVI) were measured via a census-based scoring system. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between SES, SVI, race and ethnicity, and MIS-C diagnosis and clinical severity as outcomes.

Results. Among 43 patients with MIS-C, 19 (44%) were Hispanic, 11 (26%) were Black, and 12 (28%) were White; 22 (51%) were in the lowest quartile SES, and 23 (53%) were in the highest quartile SVI. SES and SVI were similar between patients with MIS-C and coronavirus disease 2019. In multivariable analysis, lowest SES quartile (odds ratio 2.2 [95% confidence interval 1.1-4.4]), highest SVI quartile (odds ratio 2.8; 95% confidence interval 1.5-5.1), and racial and/or ethnic minority background were associated with MIS-C diagnosis. Neither SES, SVI, race, nor ethnicity were associated with disease severity.

Conclusions. Lower SES or higher SVI, Hispanic ethnicity, and Black race independently increased risk for MIS-C. Additional studies are required to target interventions to improve health equity for children.]

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/news-scan-apr-28-2021#:~:text=All%2Dcause%20weekly%20pediatric%20hospitalizations,a%20JAMA%20research%20letter%20yesterday


All-cause weekly pediatric hospitalizations in the United States decreased 48.3% in the spring and 23.5% in the summer 2020 pandemic months when compared with the median volumes in 2017-2019, according to a JAMA research letter yesterday [Tue 27 Apr 2021].

The researchers looked at 1 699 911 pediatric hospital admissions from 42 freestanding children's hospitals and found that the weekly median dropped from 12 830 in spring 2017-2019 to 7033 in 2020 and from 11 697 in summer 2017-2019 to 9178 in 2020. Decreases in hospitalizations occurred in all demographics and clinical subgroups.

The smallest percentage change per week was in summer 2020 among teenagers 15-18 years (-9.6%), and the largest was among children with low illness severity in spring 2020 (-56.4%). Regarding condition-specific hospitalizations, the largest decrease was found in patients with respiratory failure during spring 2020 (a 2017-2019 median of 296, dropping down to 87 in 2020; -167.7%).

The researchers also note that the smallest percentage change per week was in summer 2020 for diabetic ketoacidosis (-0.7% from 2017-2019 to 2020), though the change was statistically insignificant. Suicide/intentional injury was the only cause of hospitalization that increased in summer 2020 compared with previous years (+11.8% from 2017-2019 to 2020), but that change was likewise not statistically significant.

Potential reasons for the lower hospitalization numbers could be due to social distancing and higher symptom monitoring in children, the researchers conclude.

Measures to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic affected children's access to health services and their physical and mental health. Reductions in hospitalizations for children occurred in 2020 compared with prior years. Little is known about the reasons for the decline and whether it varied by patient characteristics.

Children's hospitals provide inpatient care for the most diverse, high-severity, and complex illnesses and are located in large urban areas, which were particularly affected by COVID-19 outbreaks. Centralization of pediatric inpatient care into children's hospitals was urged to free beds in non-children's hospitals for adult COVID-19 patients. We compared hospitalizations in US children's hospitals before and during the pandemic....[more; not open access]

[With children confined to their homes during COVID lockdown, transmission of infectious diseases would be dampened. It is concerning that suicide/intentional injury increased, but the difference between years was not statistically significant. The pandemic has been particularly stressful for teenagers who may feel isolated from their peer group at a critical time in their social and intellectual development. - Mod.LK]

[1C] Neonates
Date: Tue 27 Apr 2021

https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210427/Neonates-exposed-to-SARS-CoV-2-can-sustain-adverse-health-outcomes.aspx


The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from mothers to newborns appears low and may be linked to biological as well as social factors. However, studies focusing on the factors associated with neonatal viral testing outcomes.

Recently, researchers from the US conducted a study in a cohort of 255 neonates born to women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 14 days before and 72 hours after delivery. The multicenter cohort study was conducted across 11 community or academic hospitals in Massachusetts in mother-newborn pairs whose delivery and discharge happened between 1 Mar and 31 Jul 2020. Eligible mother-newborn pairs were identified at participating hospitals using local COVID-19 surveillance and infection control systems.

Their main objectives were to determine 1) the percentage of newborns born to mothers who were SARS-CoV-2 positive during birth, 2) the sociodemographic and clinical factors linked to neonatal virus positivity, and 3) the virological as well as clinical outcomes for newborns during their time in the hospital and 30 days after discharge.

Maternal risk factors in newborn virus positivity included maternal COVID-19 symptoms, rooming-in practice, vaginal delivery, zipcode-based social vulnerability index, and Black race or Hispanic ethnicity. The burden of viral exposure on newborn health was strongly associated with preterm delivery, driven by worsening COVID-19 disease in the mother.

The primary outcomes for newborns were (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity, (2) adverse health indicators, and (3) clinical symptoms and testing. Test result positivity was defined as a minimum of one positive result on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen using the RT-PCR method. Clinical and testing data were obtained from electronic health records within 30 days of discharge from the hospital.

Out of the 255 newborns in the study cohort, 62 [24.3%] had low birth weight or preterm delivery. Out of the 250 mothers in the cohort, 121 [48.4%] were Hispanic.

The results of this study show that newborns who were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 perinatally can experience adverse health outcomes. This can be direct outcomes as shown by higher SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in neonates born to socially vulnerable mothers or indirect outcomes as evidenced by preterm birth in SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers.

[According to the study,] "Maternal social vulnerability was associated with an increased risk for neonatal test result positivity, whereas individual-level maternal race/ethnicity and language status was not."

A total of 225 (88.2%) neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 5 (2.2%) tested positive during hospitalization. High maternal social vulnerability was linked to higher neonatal viral positivity adjusted for maternal delivery mode, COVID-19 symptoms, and rooming-in practice.

"Newborns with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results appeared to have minimal burden of illness that was directly associated with a viral infection."

The study's findings highlight the significance of both the biological and social factors influencing perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes.

Interestingly, adverse outcomes in mothers at the time of hospitalization were linked to preterm delivery, which was indicated by worsening COVID-19 symptoms of the mother. A total of 151 newborns were followed up, and based on the data obtained, 28 had nonroutine clinical visits, 7 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 testing, and one had a positive result.

The study shows that neonates who were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were at risk for both direct and indirect adverse health outcomes. This supports ongoing viral surveillance and long-term follow-up.

"Newborns who had exposure to SARS-CoV-2 were at risk for both direct and indirect adverse health outcomes, whereas preterm delivery owing to worsening maternal COVID-19 illness was associated with substantial neonatal morbidity," [the study concluded].

Ref.: Tu TM, Seet CYH, Koh JS, et al.: Acute Ischemic Stroke During the Convalescent Phase of Asymptomatic COVID-2019 Infection in Men. JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(4): e217498. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.7498.

Key points
Question. Is the risk of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) elevated in patients in the convalescent phase of an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection?

Findings. In this case series of 18 male adults aged 50 years or younger who presented with AIS during the convalescent phase of an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 serological (antibodies) test result, the median onset of stroke was 2 months after the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Meaning. Results of this study suggest a persistent increased risk of AIS in individuals with asymptomatic COVID-19 months after serological diagnosis, warranting stroke units to be on alert and use SARS-CoV-2 serological testing.

Abstract
Importance. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a known neurological complication in patients with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 infection. However, AIS has not been described as a late sequelae in patients without respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.

Objective. To assess AIS experienced by adults 50 years or younger in the convalescent phase of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.

Design, setting, and participants. This case series prospectively identified consecutive male patients who received care for AIS from public health hospitals in Singapore between 21 May 2020 and 14 Oct 2020. All of these patients had laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 infection based on a positive SARS-CoV-2 serological (antibodies) test result. These patients were individuals from South Asian countries (India and Bangladesh) who were working in Singapore and living in dormitories. The total number of COVID-19 cases (54 485) in the worker dormitory population was the population at risk. Patients with ongoing respiratory symptoms or positive SARS-CoV-2 serological test results confirmed through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swabs were excluded.

Main outcomes and measures. Clinical course, imaging, and laboratory findings were retrieved from the electronic medical records of each participating hospital. The incidence rate of AIS in the case series was compared with that of a historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched national cohort.

Results. A total of 18 male patients, with a median (range) age of 41 (35-50) years and South Asian ethnicity, were included. The median (range) time from a positive serological test result to AIS was 54.5 (0-130) days. The median (range) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 5 (1-25). Ten patients (56%) presented with a large vessel occlusion, of whom 6 patients underwent intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular therapy. Only 3 patients (17%) had a possible cardiac source of embolus. The estimated annual incidence rate of AIS was 82.6 cases per 100 000 people in this study compared with 38.2 cases per 100 000 people in the historical age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched cohort (rate ratio, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.36-3.48; P less than  .001).

Conclusions and relevance. This case series suggests that the risk for AIS is higher in adults 50 years or younger during the convalescent period of a COVID-19 infection without respiratory symptoms. Acute ischemic stroke could be part of the next wave of complications of COVID-19, and stroke units should be on alert and use serological testing, especially in younger patients or in the absence of traditional risk factors.

[It is critical that AIS be treated immediately. "The main treatment for ischemic stroke is intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which breaks up clots. 2018 guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Stroke Association (ASA) state that tPA is most effective when it's given within 4.5 hours from the start of a stroke. It can't be given more than 5 hours after the start of the stroke. Because tPA can result in bleeding, you can't take it if you have a history of hemorrhagic stroke, bleeding in the brain, recent major surgery, or head injury. It also can't be used by anyone taking anticoagulants. If tPA doesn't work, clots can be removed through surgery. A mechanical clot removal can be performed up to 24 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms" (https://www.healthline.com/health/stroke/cerebral-ischemia).

It is important to alert doctors to this possible complication during the convalescent phase of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection. - Mod.LK]

[3A] Role of variants

COVID-19 cases in India last week made up 38% of the global total, and circulation of different variants -- not just the B1617 variant that was first detected in the country -- appears to be partly fueling the nation's massive surge, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday Tue 27 Apr 2021] in its weekly pandemic snapshot.

India today [Wed 28 Apr 2021] reported more than 300 000 cases for the 8th day in a row, reaching a new single-day high of 379 459, with 3647 more deaths, putting its fatality count over the 200 000 mark, according to the country's health ministry.

Though cases rose for the 9th week in a row, virus spread shows different patterns in world regions and even among countries. Of the 5 countries that reported the highest case numbers last week, all but India reported a decline, with the United States, Brazil, Turkey, and France all reporting falling numbers.

India reported the biggest increases in cases, with a 52% rise. Other countries that reported spikes of more than 10% include Malaysia (27%), Japan (22%), and Pakistan (17%).

At a briefing today [Wed 28 Apr 2021], officials from the WHO's Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said many health systems in South and Central America are still struggling with an influx of patients, against the backdrop of rising infections in younger people who have longer hospital stays. For example, Costa Rica's hospitalizations are at an all-time high, and Guatemala's hospitals have reached capacity. And for the 1st time, Canada's infection rates have passed those of the United States.

PAHO Director Carissa Etienne, MBBS, MSc, urged countries to plan for sudden spikes in use of oxygen, intubation drugs, personal protective equipment, and infusion pumps.

Meanwhile, the WHO said that for global deaths, a lagging indicator, the level last week rose for the 6th week in a row, with the region that includes India reporting the biggest fatality rise.

The WHO's report also included its latest assessment of SARS-CoV-2 variants and what scientists know so far about B1617, which was first detected in India.

B1617 shares several mutations associated with clinical impacts in other variants, including increased transmissibility, reduced neutralization by some monoclonal antibody treatments, and a moderate reduction in post-vaccination sera. However, early lab studies on a small number of samples suggests India's homegrown vaccine Covaxin is able to neutralize the variant.

Regarding spread of B1617 in India, health officials are reporting different patterns in different regions, with the variant circulating alongside others. Taken together, this may be fueling India's COVID resurgence, with spread that is faster and bigger than the country's 1st wave.

Scientists told the New York Times that different variants seem dominant in different parts of India, with B1617 detected in many samples from Maharashtra state and B117 expanding quickly in New Delhi [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/28/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases#is-a-variant-to-blame-for-indias-deepening-covid-19-crisis].

The WHO said other drivers include challenges with implementing and sticking to social measures, as well as cultural, religious, and election-related mass gatherings.

In another step to boost supplies of oxygen for hospitals experiencing scarce supplies, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi today [Wed 28 Apr 2021] approved a plan to buy 100 more portable oxygen concentrators and fund 500 more oxygen plants, according to CNN.

Alongside the many nations that have answered India's calls for help, global corporations and big companies in India are also stepping up to leverage the power of their logistics networks, according to Reuters. For example, Amazon yesterday said it would ship 100 ventilators from the United States, which followed its actions with partners to deliver oxygen concentrators and ventilators from Singapore.

In the country's vaccine developments, officials have opened vaccination to everyone over age 18, with mass vaccinations set to begin in May [2021], though it doesn't yet have enough doses to cover the 600 million people who are becoming eligible, according to Reuters.

In a related development the Serum Institute -- which produces the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine -- said it would reduce the COVID vaccine price for Indian states, according to CNN.

More global headlines
- Sri Lanka's government is tightening COVID restrictions due to rising cases in the wake of new year's celebrations earlier this month [April 2021], according to CNN. Officials shuttered schools, banned private gatherings, and have asked employers to limit the number of people at work. Elsewhere in the region, Bangladesh took steps to divert industrial oxygen to hospitals and clinics as a precautionary measure due rising COVID activity.

- One dose of COVID vaccine has the potential to cut household transmission by half, according to a report today [Wed 28 Apr 2021] from Public Health England. The vaccines included in the study are ones in use in the United Kingdom: Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford. [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/one-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-can-cut-household-transmission-by-up-to-half]. In other UK developments, a survey of vaccine attitudes found a drop in enthusiasm for the AstraZeneca vaccine due to rare reports of blood clots, though overall acceptance is high. And the country announced plans to incorporate a vaccine passport into its National Health Service phone app as a way of easing international travel this summer, according to Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-travel/swipe-my-phone-uk-to-use-health-service-app-as-vaccine-passport-idUSKBN2CF0KU].

- The US State Department this week eased COVID-related travel restrictions on students from China and other countries, which applies to those with plans to begin or continue study on 1 Aug [2021].

-The global COVID total today passed 149 million cases and is at 149 011 839, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html]. For deaths, the number reached 3 140 970.

[3B] India: variants
Date: Wed 28 Apr 2021
Source: Time [abridged, edited]
https://time.com/5959057/india-covid-19-variants/


As the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India continue to mount, public health officials are carefully watching yet another looming threat: the appearance of mutations that could be making the virus circulating there more infectious or more capable of causing severe disease.

Scientists believe that the variants of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for this 2nd wave of cases in India already include at least 2 mutations that make them more dangerous. These mutations are already familiar to COVID-19 experts. One is found in a variant first identified in South Africa, while the other is part of a variant believed to have emerged from California. Researchers believe that these 2 mutations may, respectively, make it easier for the virus to infect human cells, and to evade the protection provided by immune cells like antibodies. According to the latest data from the public genome database GISAID, 38% of genetically sequenced samples from India collected in March [2021] contain the 2 mutations; scientists have labelled this the B.1.617 variant.

"It's taken us by surprise," says Dr. Ravindra Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge who has studied the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants, including the one emerging from the UK, B.1.1.7. that appears to spread more easily among people, and is now the dominant strain of virus causing new infections in the UK and the US "The steep, rapid increase in cases is really quite startling. It's probably the result of relaxed social distancing, a lot of social gatherings including religious gatherings, also combined with new variants."

Sumit Chanda, director of the immunity and pathogens program at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in San Diego, Calif., describes the situation in India as a sort of perfect storm. "People became complacent, and politicians were declaring victory over the virus: a mission-accomplished mentality," he says. "They decided to have one of the biggest religious ceremonies and mass gatherings of humans in the world. I saw pictures, and no one was masked, and it was happening in highly dense population centers. Then you have the emergence of a variant, and that's what is really driving what is happening over there."

Chanda says it's likely that the mutations evolved from the excessive replication that's occurring among the burgeoning infections in India. With every new person the virus infects, it has a new opportunity to frantically copy its genome. And in its rush to duplicate its genome, the virus makes mistakes -- repeatedly -- and those mistakes sometimes end up making the virus fitter and stronger. Those "mistake" versions become variants that start to outcompete and dominate other, less fit viruses.

For the people the virus infects, that could also mean a viral variant that causes more severe, and even deadly, disease.

Following India's 1st wave of COVID-19 in the spring of 2020, health officials locked down the country, but it turned out that people who were infected didn't get that sick; in fact, the case fatality rate was low. That led to a proportion of the population developing some level of natural immunity to the virus. But that proportion wasn't enough to provide anything close to herd immunity, so when social restrictions were lifted in May 2020 and people began congregating again, it created the perfect conditions for the virus to mutate. "Once you let your guard down, these variants basically have more field to play on," says Chanda. "When you have unmitigated spread, then that's more fuel you give to the virus to make these mistakes, and the stronger viruses will pop out."

Chanda, Gupta, and others are also investigating whether another phenomenon might be at work driving the severe disease in India. It's possible that people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, but who did not have a severe case of COVID-19, might get even sicker if they are reinfected, a dynamic seen with some other disease-causing viruses, like dengue.

Researchers refer to this phenomenon -- in which people are infected and only partially successful in fighting the virus, so they continue to harbor the infection for months rather than days -- as "suboptimal protection." In one such patient, who was infected for about 4 months, Gupta documented the steady changes the virus made as it mutated to become better and better at evading any immune responses directed against it. "Some people can't clear the virus -- they get infected, and they can't get rid of it -- so they have some immunity to the virus, but the virus learns to live with their immune system and makes mutations to adapt. And those same mutations adapt again when they infect someone else."

It's not clear if this is happening in India, but it could explain why so many people are getting sick so quickly. In any case, from a public health perspective, it makes sense to assume this is what's going on; the response should be to urge people to take preventive actions like wearing masks and social distancing even if they have been infected in the past, which would be beneficial during an epidemic whether or not the virus is spreading among the previously infected. "We should be planning for the worst-case scenario and assume people are being reinfected. There's not much lost by over-calling it, since the rate of infection is already so high," says Gupta.

As countries including the UK and US start to send supplies and aid, India's experience should serve as a warning for the world. The Indian variant has already been reported in the UK and Japan, and samples from the US also appear to contain the variant's genetic fingerprint, so building up immunity quickly through mass vaccination is more critical than ever.

"India is a cautionary tale that if we open up bars willy nilly, this could happen to us," says Chanda. "We are at the point now [in the US] where we have suboptimal immunity because people are still being vaccinated." That is, this is exactly the time that the virus has enough room to maneuver, and genetically adapt to evade vaccines. The key to preventing that from happening? Get more people vaccinated.
