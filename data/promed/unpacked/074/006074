Re: Mosquito-borne diseases in Australia
----------------------------------------------------
Regarding Murray Valley encephalitis, at least twelve mosquito-borne
viral diseases are reported in Australia -- most of which are found
only in that country. In the following graph, I've summarized
reporting rates for the most common diseases in this group:
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Australia-mosqvirus.png (a
drop-down menu in Gideon allows creation of user-selected charts from
a file of 28 417 base graphs).

Sporadic infection by six additional viruses are also encountered in
Australia: Sindbis, Stratford, Edge Hill, Gan Gan, Kokobara and
Trubanaman viruses.

[Barmah Forest virus, Ross River virus and Sindbis virus are
alphaviruses. Edge Hill virus, Kokobara virus, Murray Valley
encephalitis virus and Stratford virus are flaviviruses. Gan Gan
virus and Trubanama virus are bunyaviruses. The common feature is
mosquito- borne transmission. - Mod.CP
