The most-feared disease affecting canola spread faster than expected in
2009, reducing the number of acres that can grow Canada's No. 2 crop, a
government official said. In total, roughly 500 Alberta fields are infested
with clubroot. Local county governments have banned many of those fields
from growing canola for between 3-6 years.

Officials confirmed 50 more fields with clubroot last year [2009] in the
western province, which is slightly less than found in the past few years.
But they had expected severe drought to all but halt the spread of the
disease, said Murray Hartman, oilseed specialist for the Alberta
government. But July rains improved conditions for the disease. "We were
surprised," he said. Earlier estimates have put the number of infested
acres in the thousands.

Canada is the world's top exporter of canola. Clubroot has ravaged European
crops for centuries and was 1st detected in 2003 in Alberta, the main
Canadian province affected by the crop disease. Last summer [2009],
researchers in the top crop-growing province of Saskatchewan found the
pathogen that causes clubroot but not the disease itself.

The 1st clubroot-resistant canola variety will be widely available for the
1st time this upcoming spring [2010] planting season, Hartman said. Alberta
has had a lot of snow this winter, which could mean wet spring conditions
that would help clubroot spread further, he said.

[Clubroot of _Brassicaceae_ is caused by the fungus _Plasmodiophora
brassicae_. It is a destructive soilborne disease, which affects nearly all
cultivated as well as many wild and weed members of the cabbage family. It
is found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and tropical
highlands. The fungus enters root hairs and wounded roots and multiplies
rapidly, causing abnormal enlargement of the underground stem, taproot, or
secondary roots. These roots often decay before the crop has matured,
releasing many resting spores which can survive for a decade or more in the
absence of a susceptible host plant. Affected plants are stunted and may
have discoloured purple leaves. Due to the distortion of the root, plants
may wilt in dry weather and then recover at night.

Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores and the
inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides. Raising soil pH
by addition of lime has been shown to be effective but is hardly
practicable on large fields. Use of clean planting material is essential.
The pathogen is composed of numerous pathotypes, which has hampered efforts
to breed cultivars with durable resistance. Several clubroot pathotypes
have been reported in Alberta.
