Hundreds of redfish and catfish are floating on the surface of Mobile Bay. Scientists say it appears they've been dead for several days, now they're starting to wash up along the Eastern Shore near Mullet Point.

"The 1st thing you worry about is if it's a major fish kill and is it affecting the entire bay," said a resident.

So, why are these fish dying? Some researchers say it's hard to tell because the fish have been dead for a while so they're not easy to test.

Dr Bob Shipp, who teaches marine sciences at the University of South Alabama, has his own thoughts about what's happening in Mobile Bay. "Normally these fish kills are associated with low oxygen levels, especially in the summer when the water gets hot and it loses its oxygen," Shipp says.

But, right now Dr Shipp doesn't believe that's what's causing the deaths.

In the meantime those living near Mullet Point are having to deal with the problem. One homeowner tells News 5 more than 15 redfish washed up at her home Saturday [11 May 2013].

While the answer is unclear, Dr Shipp believes it could be a virus that's killing the fish.

[It would be interesting to know whether there are some tests being carried out to achieve a diagnosis.
