Another Kentucky horse has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), E.S. Rusty Ford, equine operations consultant for the Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office, said in a [Fri 5 Oct 2018] statement. There are now 9 confirmed cases of WNV in Kentucky horses this year [2018].

The 6-year-old Standardbred mare from Todd County presented on 26 Sep 2018 with ataxia (incoordination) and hyperexcitability. Ford said the mare's condition worsened, and she ultimately became recumbent (unable to rise). She was euthanized on 29 Sep 2018.

Ford said the mare had no WNV vaccination history.

In 2017 there were 16 reported cases of WNV in Kentucky horses, Ford told The Horse.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit

- Flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- Fine and coarse muscle and skin twitching;
- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- Changes in mentation, when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- Occasional drowsiness;
- Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness;and
- Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).

West Nile has no cure, but some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40 percent.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV-prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3-6-week period. It takes several weeks for horses to develop protection against the disease following complete vaccination or booster administration.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and to limit horses' mosquito exposure by

- Removing stagnant water sources;
- Dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- Keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening);
- Applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use; and
- Using fly sheets, masks, and boots/leggings on pastured horses.

[Regardless of the time of year, please vaccinate. Even in the autumn time, the rains can cause mosquitoes to hatch. These things want a blood meal, from you or your horse. You can vaccinate and spray with appropriate topical sprays for your horse, and you can spray yourself with mosquito repellent.

Remember both you and your horse are susceptible to West Nile virus. You can prevent it. Vaccinate your horse, and spray yourself as well as wearing long sleeves and long pants. - Mod.TG
