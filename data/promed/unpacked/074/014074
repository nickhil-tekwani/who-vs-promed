An illness that has ravaged hundreds of pigs across Burma appears to
have spread to cattle and other domesticated animals, including cats
and dogs.

A pig breeder in Pegu division's Nattalin township said that his
stock had stopped eating around 10 days ago and died shortly after.
"We tried giving the pigs some medication when they stopped eating,
assuming it was only normal illness. Some of them looked healthy, but
then we found out they were dead the next morning."

He said that although the cause of death has not been identified, it
was likely an outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome virus (PRRSV), or "blue-ear disease," that has rocked Burma's
livestock industry over the past 4 months.

"People fear that it might turn into an epidemic, as some of the pig
owners, unable to manage the large number of animal carcasses, are
dumping them in drains on the side of the road," another man said.

According to the India-based Mizzima website [see item 2], however,
government officials were this week questioning whether PRRSV was
behind a recent spate of pig deaths in Rangoon. It quoted Dr. Soe Win,
head of the Rangoon Region Animal Husbandry and Veterinarian
Department, who claimed a bacterial infection was the cause, rebutting
assumptions that the pigs had died from blue-ear disease [caused by a
virus. - Mod.JW].

A resident of the Pegu division township of Paungde told DVB that
cats, dogs and cows were also succumbing to illness in alarming
numbers, and carcasses were being spotted on the sides of streets
[this unusual information is in need of confirmation from professional
sources. - Mod.AS].

Despite warnings about the illness, he claimed that farmers were
slaughtering pigs at the 1st sign that something was wrong and then
selling their meat in local markets, sparking concern among meat
eaters. This was despite a warning by the government's Health
Administration Department that infected pigs should not be sold on the
market.

Burmese government health officials are investigating the cause of
death among pigs in Rangoon, according to Dr. Soe Win, head of the
Rangoon Region Animal Husbandry and Veterinarian Department.

An outbreak of pig deaths in the Rangoon area has officials
scrambling to learn the cause of death, after ruling out blue ear
disease.

Since May 2011, pigs on farms and in small-scale household farming
operations in Insein, Hlaingthayar and Hlegu townships have died.
Tests indicated they were infected with bacteria, but the exact cause
is unknown.

"According to laboratory results, they were not infected by blue ear
pig disease. They were infected by a bacterium," Dr. Soe Win told
Mizzima.

Blue ear disease (PRRS)
-----------------------
Recently, the blue ear pig virus has spread in the Pegu Region
adjacent to Rangoon. The authorities have banned transporting pigs and
pork from the Pegu Region since mid-May 2011. Checkpoints in Hlegu (45
km northeast of Rangoon) and Htandapin stop trucks to inspect their
animal cargo.

Meanwhile, health authorities have launched a public awareness
campaign and done prevention work in townships and surrounding rural
areas. The medicine which can treat the blue ear pig virus is not
available in Burma, according to Dr. Soe Win.

"Pig farm owners need to obey our instructions," he said. "They
should not let other animals enter their farms. And their pigs should
not be moved to other farms."

The price of pork dropped by 1500 kyat (USD 1.75) per viss (1 viss =
1.6 kg) in the past 2 weeks.

"Two weeks ago, the price of pork thigh was 6000 kyat [USD 7.00] per
viss. Now, the price is just 4500 kyat [USD 5.25]. The buyers are
afraid to buy pork because of the disease," a butcher at Thingangyun
Market told Mizzima.

Only pork from legal slaughter houses is allowed to be sold in
markets, said an official at the Rangoon Municipal Department.

"In the markets, health workers and market authorities are inspecting
the meat shops," he said.

Blue ear pig disease, which affects the reproductive organs and
respiratory tract, was 1st found in the Mandalay Region in February
2011. The disease has [now] been found in Naypyitaw, Sagaing, Magway
and Pegu regions [see archived post 20110427.1307].

[Myanmar's 1st official report on PRRS was submitted to the OIE on 4
Mar 2011, addressing an outbreak which reportedly had started on 15
Feb 2011 and was confirmed on 28 Feb 2011, killing 210 out of the 559
susceptible pigs in the holding at Mandalay. The report, including an
interactive map, is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10318.

The above information on an unidentified disease, allegedly not PRRS,
is in need of confirmation; laboratory diagnostic results, clarifying
(or denying?) the alleged "bacterial" etiology of these cases, are
requested. - Mod.AS]
