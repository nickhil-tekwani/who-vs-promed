African Horse 'Flu Kills 300 horses in KZN
--------------------------------
Vets in KwaZulu Natal's southern Drakensberg and Eastern Griqualand
districts on Monday urged the cancellation of all equine sporting
events following an outbreak of the lethal African Horse Sickness.
The outbreak, in the Underberg-Loteni district, has killed over 300
horses since it was first detected last week.
Veterinary authorities confirmed on Mon 31 Mar 2003 they were
advising against all equine sports in the area, and were also
clamping down on the transportation of horses for fear of spreading
the disease to new areas.
Local vet Dr Gavin King said it appeared the virus has put at least
one local horse safari operation out of business, and is threatening
many more in a region which prides itself on some of the most scenic
horseback trails in the country.
"Many horse owners are desperately turning to homeopathic remedies,
including the use of dagga [either of the local herbs_Leonotis
leonurus_ or _L. orata_] and citronella oil, to either de-stress the
horses or to repel the midges. Many cannot afford the R30
vaccination," said Dr King.
"No horses that have not been vaccinated have survived. Some horse
owners from the townships have come to the surgery with news that
horses are dropping like flies in rural areas."
Local vets have sent samples to the Equine Research centre at
Onderstepoort and Allerton to determine exactly what virus is behind
the death and which serotype vaccination to use.
King added that often riders felt that something was wrong with their
horse, climbed off and had the horse drop dead at their feet.
Although the horse fever is endemic to all parts of Africa, except
the Western Cape, exceptionally good rains in the region have
boosted the virus' transport vector, the _Culicoides bolitinos_
midge, which lays its eggs in horse dung.
Symptoms include difficulty in breathing, swellings above the eyes,
and general stress and lethargy due to fluid build-up around the
heart and lungs.
Many horse owners have been forced to leave horse carcasses in the
fields for the vultures to clean up.
Springbok Polo captain Russell Watson, who has lost 20 horses valued
at over R400 000 [USD 51 000], said on Mon, 31 Mar 2003 local horse
owners were extremely concerned. "I have never seen the virus in
this area before. We cannot play unless our horses are 100 percent
fit. The first event is in 22 days, but it takes over 6 weeks to get
a horse fit," explained Watson.
Rainbow Adventures co-owner Mary-Anne Holt added that she had been forced to
close her horse safari business after losing 7 horses. Local syce [groom or
attendant] Sgwembe Duma, who manages over 100 horses belonging to Khotso
Trails, said Khotso Trails has lost 5 horses so far. "I can check them in
the evening before going to bed and they are fine. The next morning their
eyes have popped out and they are dead."
