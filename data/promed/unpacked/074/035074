The Wildlife Conservation Society, in collaboration with Dornod Aimag
(Province) Veterinary Laboratory and with the help from the Institute
of Veterinary Medicine and the Institute of Biology, Mongolian
Academy of Sciences, has been conducting serological surveys for FMD
in Mongolian gazelle and livestock populations on Mongolia's Eastern
Steppe since 1998.

While serology alone is insufficient to elucidate the epidemiology of
this virus in Mongolia, our findings along with other published
literature suggest the following:

- FMD occurred periodically in Mongolia from 1931-1973, but then was
absent until 2000 (Shiilegdamba et al. 2008). There were reports of
"high mortality" of gazelles dying of FMD in the 1960s (Sokolov and
Lushchekina, 1997).

- Serological testing of 59 adult gazelles on the Eastern Steppe in
1998/99 failed to detect antibodies to FMD (Deem et al., 2001),
suggesting that if FMD was present, seroprevalence was less than 6
percent (upper 95 percent confidence limit for 0/59; Nyamsuren et al. 2006).

- A high proportion of Mongolian gazelles (67 percent of 33) were
exposed to FMD after outbreaks in livestock in 2000 (Nyamsuren et al. 2006).

- From 2004 until the current outbreak, FMD-O had not been reported
in livestock on the Eastern Steppe. Serological surveys conducted by
WCS and the above Mongolian partners for FMD in gazelles and
livestock during the years 2005-2008 indicated a decline in
seroprevalence in gazelles. For example, none of 36 adult gazelles
sampled in 2008 [were] seropositive to exposure to FMD, indicating a
significant decline in seroprevalence from 2000 (Chi-square =3D
18.99; p under 0.001; df=3D; WCS unpublished data).

We interpret these findings as follows: While gazelles are most
certainly exposed to FMD during livestock outbreaks, the declining
seroprevalence in gazelles during periods of FMD absence suggests
that FMD is not sustained in the gazelle population alone (i.e.,
gazelles might not be a reservoir); periodic reintroduction of the
virus is likely necessary for FMD persistence on the Eastern Steppe.
Consequently, we propose that traditional control measures directed
at livestock populations will be most effective at controlling FMD in
Mongolia: vaccination of all susceptible livestock species, livestock
movement control, developing traceback histories for infected
individuals, and culling of infected livestock.

[We are very grateful for the above response to our RFI with the
important data accumulated until 2008. The declining seroprevalence
(to FMDV serotype O?) during the years 2005-2008 may mean that a
highly susceptible antelope population has been established.

The Mongolian veterinary authorities reported to the OIE during the
previous outbreak (February 2004) that the causative agent (FMDV-O)
"has also been confirmed in nomadic wild antelopes in the affected
area" and that the "origin of infection was suspected to be due to
the migration of wild antelope" while "the source of agent was under
investigation" (see archived 20040213.0485). As the above authors
rightly state, this does not necessarily mean that the gazelles are
an FMDV reservoir; however, they may play the role of disseminators,
particularly during migration.

Renewed/intensified surveillance in Mongolian antelopes is required
to assess their current FMD status. The FMDV serotype O, SEA
topotype, Mya-98 lineage, which has spread during 2010 in eastern
Asia (e.g. China, S. Korea, Japan, Russia) demonstrated its
pathogenicity and its potential to infect multiple species. In the
past, certain strains of FMDV-O were recorded to be highly pathogenic
for certain antelope species (e.g. Kazakhstan, late 1960's, Israel 1985, 2007).

The WRLFMD at Pirbright has, reportedly, received on 12 Oct 2010 a
batch of 18 FMD virus isolates from Mongolia; genotyping is
anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
