2 horses on the Eastern Shore of Maryland have tested positive for eastern
equine Encephalitis (EEE), the first time in 7 years that the often-deadly
mosquito-borne disease has been found in animals or humans in Maryland, state
officials announced.
The confirmation of equine encephalitis near Pocomoke City in Worcester
County sparked serious concern among both agricultural and health officials,
who said the infection poses far more danger than West Nile virus.
"This has a very high fatality rate in human cases, and it is very fatal in
horses," said Dr. Tracy DuVernoy, the Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene's acting state public health veterinarian. "Other animals are very
susceptible, too." In addition to horses, equine encephalitis frequently
infects ratites -- flightless birds that include ostriches and emus. Signs in
both horses and ratites include apprehension, depression, listlessness,
paralysis, lack of coordination, weakness, head-pressing, circling, and
stumbling, according to state agricultural officials.
Spread by bites from infected mosquitoes, equine encephalitis can cause brain
swelling. Up to half the people who are infected and develop neurological
symptoms die from the illness, compared with fewer than 10 percent of people
who suffer a West Nile virus neurological infection, according to state
officials.
Already in 2003, a Georgia man died of an equine encephalitis infection, and
many cases have been reported in horses in 4 southeastern states. The last
reported human case of equine encephalitis in Maryland was in 1989, DuVernoy
said. The Dorchester County man died.
While mosquitoes carrying the equine encephalitis virus have been captured
occasionally in Maryland, the last time a horse was found to be infected was
in 1996, said Sue duPont of the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA).
The 2 horses in Worcester were found on separate farms outside of Pocomoke
City that are about 6 miles apart, duPont said. After displaying neurological
symptoms, both were euthanized. Tests of their brain tissue confirmed the
diagnosis.
Additional aerial spraying for mosquitoes is already being planned for the
areas around the 2 farms said Cyrus Lesser, chief of the state Department of
Agriculture's mosquito control division. Final approval is being sought from
the local government officials and the Federal Aviation Administration, and
then the state must notify the community of the planned spraying. "This is
something we want to spray for as soon as we can," Lesser said. It is not
believed that an equine encephalitis infection in horses can be spread
[directly, without a mosquito bite] to humans, so no additional steps are
being taken for the people who live on or near the 2 farms, DuVernoy said.
But local health officials have been reminded to be vigilant for the
infection's symptoms. Symptoms in humans include fever, headache, mental
confusion, vomiting, extreme fatigue, muscle aches and -- in extreme cases --
seizure and coma, according to state health officials. Suspected cases are
required to be reported to the state.
Officials also renewed their warnings to Marylanders to take precautions
against mosquitoes, particularly for people older than age 50. Those steps
include eliminating standing water where mosquitoes breed, as well as wearing
long sleeves, long pants, and mosquito repellant when outdoors. Windows and
door screens should be checked to ensure they're intact, and outdoor activity
should be avoided at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are more active.
Although human vaccines haven't yet been developed, vaccines exist to protect
horses from both equine encephalitis and West Nile virus. State agricultural
officials could not say yesterday what percentage of Maryland horses have
been protected, but they have recently been encouraging horse owners to take
advantage of the vaccines.
