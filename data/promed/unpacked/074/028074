Emmons County is between Bismarck, the state capitol in central North Dakota
(Burleigh County) and the South Dakota border. Its west edge is the Missouri
River. So, south-central North Dakota would be a good geographical
description.
We did not have any cases this far west during the summer of 2005, so I
don't know what to say about the location. I would make the observation that
many of the South Dakota cases from the summer of 2005 tracked along the
Missouri River going north, and this most recent occurrence might be seen as
a continuation of that trend.
In checking the lab history, we have not had a reported case in this region
before.
The animals were not vaccinated, but I will have to call the practitioner to
get further info.

[One constant in the epizootiology of this disease is the
unreported/unobserved cases in ranches adjacent to known outbreaks. For
whatever reason, the rancher may get away with it that season, but the
following year new cases (plural) declare themselves when stock have not
been (re)vaccinated. And as we suspect there is the potential risk from
wildlife cases in deer and elk which then spread to nearby livestock, this
gives rise to the belief that vaccination programmes should err on the broad
-- not the narrow -- estimate of risk. Of course for all one knows at this
stage, there may be cases in nearby South Dakota. - Mod.MHJ]
