"Global Climate Change and Emerging Infectious Diseases" in JAMA 1996
275:3:217-223 by Patz et al includes a discussion of the climate on
malaria /mosquitoes in various parts of Africa (but not other parts of the
world like Papua New Guinea). These authors quote a reference about
increased incidence of malaria in Rwanda associated with local climate
change. (Loevinsohn M. Climate warming and increased malaria incidence in
Rwanda. Lancet 1994;343:714-718).
