An outbreak of human trichinellosis has been registered in the
village of Novoselitse in Chernovitskaya oblast [Chernivtsi region]
according to the state service of veterinary medicine.

An outbreak investigation team has been established by the regional
authority of veterinary services. The team is in place now to clarify
the source of infection and measures for control.

State Research Institute of Veterinary-Sanitary Diagnostics and
Expertise and the Police Forces for Veterinary Quarantine Measures.

Three people in the Novoselytsia Kelmetskoho district of Bukovina
were taken to the infectious disease department of the local hospital
with a diagnosis of trichinosis. Their condition is satisfactory.

In the Novolselytsya Kelmenetsky district, where the detected cases
of trichinosis live, employees of the State Board of Veterinary
Medicine of Ukraine have taken blood samples from pigs, dogs, and
cats to try and determine the source of infection.

According to the State Veterinary Medicine Committee, on 6 Jan 2011,
laboratory testing was conducted on blood samples from injured dogs
and hunters in the village. Nobody was found infected.

Veterinary and laboratory workers with veterinary and sanitary
expertise are working to ensure that animal products are allowed into
markets only after a veterinary-sanitary examination for trichinosis.
