The Texas Department of State Health Services is reminding Texans to avoid sick or dead wildlife after 18 recent animal deaths in Uvalde County, including 2 which were confirmed anthrax-related cases.

The 1st anthrax case of the year [2019] in Texas was confirmed in a captive antelope on a premises in Uvalde County on 19 Jun 2019 -- in a triangular area of southwest Texas where anthrax is historically found in the soil. Since then, another anthrax-related case has been confirmed, and officials reported 18 recent animal deaths.

[I am presuming, based solely on my previous experience with this disease in Uvalde County, that there were an additional 17 animal deaths on the index ranch, and not on some newly affected other ranch.

The previous outbreak on this exotic deer ranch, Ranch B in the 2004 account, is described in Anthrax, bovine, deer - USA (TX) (02) 20040829.2415. "In all, from 27 Jul to 16 Aug 2004, Ranch-B lost 18 animals: Aoudad sheep and white-tails, Kudu, Axis, Eland, Scymitar oryx, Fallow, and Black buck deer. A bull Scymitar, dying on 30 Jul 2004, was laboratory-confirmed to have died of anthrax, and, in spite of claims of only 2 females dying, in fact, roughly equal numbers of males and females died. All carcasses were burnt. The ranch has 2000 acres and 600 deer of various species, domestic and foreign, in 5 high-fenced sections. Deaths occurred in all of the sections. The ranch is purposefully over-stocked, and the intention is to provide 'sport' trophy-animals." So these additional 17 animals dead on this ranch have been expected right from the 21 Jun 2019 TxAHC report.

For some reason, the news release for these subsequent deaths has yet to appear on the commission website (see https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/). But I have contacts. Our reason for wanting to know the identity of this recently afflicted ranch is based on science and forensic microbiology. We have been niche mapping this disease in many parts of the world, including the USA and Texas. The question arises whether this is a new outbreak in an area not previously considered to be at risk or is it just the same old, same old. This is an important question if one has a policy of disease control. The same question arises out of the identity of the genomic strain involved. And as this ranch has enjoyed an apparent gap of 15 years with no cases, these questions increase in relevance. It would not be illogical to suspect that there might have been prior anthrax deaths on other ranches in that area. - Mod.MHJ
