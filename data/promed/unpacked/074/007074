_Exobasidium_ leaf and fruit spot has been reported from numerous locations in North Carolina this year [2019]. The disease, caused by the fungus _Exobasidium maculosum_, is visible now on leaves, but will also infect berries. On leaves, spots are pale green on the upper surface but pure white below, with a thin, dense layer of fungal growth on the underside of the leaf [which] can also occur on infected berries. On berries, infection produces a green spot, berries do not leak or decay, but the green spot is an unsightly defect.

It is too late to prevent this disease in 2019. Treatment consists of spraying in late winter to kill the fungus overwintering on the surface of the stems. Control is also possible using a protectant fungicide repeatedly from budbreak through green fruit stage. Most commercial growers treat routinely for this disease where [it] is known to occur. This disease can be severe in one year, and nearly absent the next.

[_E. maculosum_ (Em) was only described as a new species in 2014 from the Americas (see link below) when it was distinguished from other species in the genus previously known to affect blueberries (_Vaccinium_ species) and related hosts. Unlike other _Exobasidium_ species, it is not systemic, but has to re-infect the host every year. Little is known about the epidemiology of Em, but it has been suggested that spores may be dispersed from infected spots on leaves or berries.

The fungi are obligate parasites. Host ranges and species delineation in the genus have so far not been clearly defined and the different species cannot be distinguished by symptoms, but molecular diagnostic methods are needed. They generally cause spots on leaves and berries, with economic losses mainly due to loss of quality of fruit making the produce unmarketable. Disease management usually includes timely fungicide applications and reduction of moisture in the cultures to limit fungal growth.

Another species in the genus, _E. vexans_, causes blister blight of tea (_Camellia sinensis_) which is the most important leaf disease of the crop in Southeast Asia (ProMED-mail post 20071209.3975).
