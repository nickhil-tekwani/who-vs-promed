Kingdom Lifts Ban on Livestock from Kenya
-----------------------------------------
Saudi Arabia, along with other Middle Eastern countries, has lifted a ban
on livestock imports from Kenya. The government had imposed the ban 3 years
ago after cases of Rift Valley Fever [RVF], a deadly livestock disease that
can be transmitted to humans, were reported in Kenya. The country's
director of veterinary services, Dr. William Chong, told the African press
that his country would immediately resume export of live camels, sheep and
goats to the Middle East. "The government will now go into full-scale
exportation," he said.
The Kenyan government, he said, had in the past few months been holding
negotiations with the Saudi government, and the lifting of the embargo
marked a successful end to these efforts. The ban on the African livestock
was put in place in September 2000.

Abdullah Orders Steps to Prevent RVF Outbreak
--------------------------------------
Crown Prince Abdullah, deputy premier and commander of the National Guard,
has instructed the authorities to take precautionary measures to prevent a
renewed outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in the southern Jizan region,
which has already been hit by torrential floods.
The crown prince's order to take precautionary measures comes after a major
RVF outbreak [in 2001] killed more than 125 people in Jizan. The killer
virus affected more than 900 people in the region.
Saudi authorities fear that the recent heavy rainfalls in Jizan could
trigger a new outbreak of infectious diseases including RVF as the rains
have created a large number of swamps, possible breeding grounds for
virus-carrying mosquitoes.
Health Minister Al-Manie announced plans to dispatch a team of doctors and
specialists as well as adequate amounts of medication to Jizan. Special
vehicles and equipment for spraying insecticides will also be sent to the
region.

Ban on Livestock Import From Ethiopia Lifted
------------------------------
In a move to cut reliance on a handful of Asian and European countries for
import of livestock, Saudi Arabia has lifted a ban on Ethiopian livestock
and meat products. Ethiopia, an African state rich in cattle population, is
the only African country besides Sudan now allowed to export its livestock
to the Kingdom.
An Ethiopian diplomat said the Kingdom's ban on Ethiopian livestock was
imposed because of the spread of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in his country. He
said Saudi nationals own 2 major abattoirs in Ethiopia, which have a total
of 5 facilities with a capacity to slaughter 1000-2500 sheep and goats and
100-150 oxen daily.
He said the Kingdom, Kuwait, the UAE, and Yemen had been major importers of
Ethiopian live sheep, goats, frozen meat, and meat products in the past.

Ministry Takes Steps to Prevent RVF Outbreak
-----------------------------------
Agriculture Minister Dr. Fahd Balghaneim said his ministry had taken a
number of precautionary measures to prevent a renewed outbreak of Rift
Valley Fever (RVF) in Jizan, where a previous appearance of the disease
killed more than 100 people.
"We have supplied adequate amounts of vaccines for various contagious
diseases, especially RVF, and deployed veterinarians and other staff to
carry out the vaccinations," the minister told Al-Watan Arabic daily.
Balghaneim said insecticide continued to be sprayed at swamps created by
recent floods in Jizan. "We are also testing mosquitoes in the region to
discover what viruses they are carrying."

[The last major outbreak of RVF in East Africa (Kenya and Somalia) occurred
during 1997/98. According to OIE's Handistatus data, Kenya reported 14 RVF
outbreaks in cattle in 1999 but no outbreaks during 2000 or 2001. Saudi
Arabia reported the presence of RVF during 2000 and the first quarter of
2001; the number of outbreaks in animals was not specified.
It seems that Saudi Arabia's main concern relates to the possibility that
RVF, after its initial introduction, might have become endemic in certain
regions such as Jizan, with a risk of spreading to other generally less
receptive regions, during certain seasons or under particular climatic
conditions.
Saudi investigators have recently discussed the speculation that the RVF
virus had been introduced into the Arabian peninsula in 1997/1998 during
the RVF epidemic in East Africa via introduction of infected imported
livestock or via windborne infected mosquitoes, and that climatic
conditions have promoted sufficient vector populations to support
transmission in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. (See A. Madani et al, "Rift Valley
Fever Epidemic in Saudi Arabia: Epidemiological, Clinical and Laboratory
Characteristics". Clinical Infectious Diseases 2003;37:1084-1092).
The annual influx of over 2 million pilgrims for the Hajj (annual
pilgrimage for Muslims) in Saudi Arabia, as well as the large migrant
population in this region, generates high human and animal traffic that
presents a challenging agenda for public health. The potential risks within
this period as well as other peculiar ecological factors have been
discussed in the paper "The evolving transmission pattern of Rift Valley
fever in the Arabian peninsula" by Shamsudeen F. Fagbo, Ann.N.Y.Acad.Sci.

The Lesser Bairam (Id al-fitr), a 3-day festival of breaking fast, is due
in 2003 during the last week of November, at the end of the Ramadan fasting
month: a season of relatively intense vector activity in this part of the
world. - Mod.AS]
