A dog walker developed life-threatening meningitis after he was bitten by a tick which he believes happened in the UK.

[TV], from the Lake District, was rushed to hospital with an extreme headache and near paralysis of his limbs. Doctors diagnosed him with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a potentially fatal infection spread by tick bites found in woodland habitats.

Officials say the disease is not found in the UK, but there's risk of getting it in other parts of Europe -- where it is endemic in 27 countries -- and Asia.

The 33-year-old had travelled to Sardinia before he got ill -- however, doctors were left baffled because TBE typically emerges 1 to 2 weeks after a bite and [the man] only became symptomatic 6 weeks after his trip, raising the possibility he caught the disease after a bite in the UK. If so, this would make him the 1st such case in the UK.

There have been fears TBE could become a problem here after vets previously warned British pets are catching deadly diseases from foreign ticks after travelling to Europe on pet passports.

The sous-chef, who lives in Ambleside, said: "In Sardinia we were on the coast. I was never in an environment where I would come into contact with ticks. In England, I've been exposed to them almost daily by taking my dog out. "I can't say with 100 per cent certainty, but I'd be amazed if the TBE hasn't been contracted here in the UK."

An expert has told iNews that one possible diagnosis for [the patient] could be louping ill, a tick-borne TBE-like illness that is found in the UK. The viral infection of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) affects sheep and grouse in the UK and has been found in humans, although this is very rare. A 2014 research paper reports there have been 45 people who've had it and Public Health England confirmed it has seen just 2 laboratory-confirmed human cases in the UK since 2010.

[The man] visited Sardinia in the 2nd week of May [2018], and became suddenly ill in the middle of June. "I started experiencing extreme lethargy and headaches," he said. "The pain felt like my eyes were on fire, as if they'd been replaced by 2 pieces of red-hot charcoal, melting my sockets."

He also suffered a stiff neck and extreme light sensitivity. After being sent away by his GP with paracetamol and ibuprofen, he was taken to A&E when his symptoms deteriorated. "At this point I couldn't move my eyes and it felt like my body was paralysing," he explained.

[TV] who originally hails from Hungary, was treated with antibiotics. Because he'd returned from a holiday to Africa (where TBE is not reported) in February this year [2018], he was kept in isolation for 6 days, with hospital medics fearing he had a contagious tropical disease.

Doctors also considered and tested him for HIV. But following a battery of tests -- including lumbar puncture, CT scan, X-ray and blood tests -- he was diagnosed with TBE, which often manifests as meningitis (inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain itself), or both.

The initial symptoms of TBE usually occur 1-2 weeks after a tick bite and include fever, headache, and general flu-like illness followed by 2-10 days of no symptoms, before inflammation of the central nervous system occurs with fever, headache, and signs of meningitis and/or brain inflammation. An incubation of up to 28 days has been described, according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

TBE is endemic in many parts of Europe, as well as Russia, northern China, and Japan.

The number of human cases in Europe has increased by almost 400 percent in the last 30 years, according to ECDC. It is predicted that the areas affected will grow due to global warming.

But so far, "TBE virus has never been present in the UK; the cases of TBE in the UK are those who travelled in the endemic areas," said Professor Tom Solomon, chair of neurological science from the University of Liverpool.

But veterinary surgeon Iain Booth, from vetuk.co.uk, is warning pet owners in particular to be vigilant. He said: "More and more vets are reporting increased numbers of parasites in the UK, including ticks and tick-borne diseases. "One possible reason for the rise is the fact more dogs have pet passports to travel in Europe, as well as an increase in dogs being imported to the UK from rescue centres abroad. "We already know that new pathogens, such as _Babesia canis_, have manifested in existing UK tick populations.

Meanwhile infestations of brand new ticks - such as _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ - have also been reported in the UK. "It was always the fear that tick-borne encephalitis could enter the UK and infect ticks here."

He urged people to avoid being bitten by wearing trousers and long sleeves and get into the habit of checking yourself and pets for ticks.

[Mr TV] says he he's been bitten by a tick in the Lakes last year [2017] and his exposure to them here is high. He said: "I've recently been spending a prolonged period of time on the fells as I've been attempting to 'bag' all 214 of the Lakeland fells documented by famous fell walker Alfred Wainwright. "My girlfriend also goes fell running with the dog and we often find them crawling on the dog. "We have a lot of ticks here in the Lake district. They're a common sight for me, so much so that I end up picking them off the dog once a week. The dog often sleeps in our bed, too. "I'm 95 percent recovered now, I get the odd shock-like sensation in my head but it's been a scary experience."

Dr Nick Beeching, senior lecturer in clinical infectious diseases at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said TBE and louping ill virus (LIV) are 2 closely related tick-borne viruses. He said: "There are rare cases of louping ill in the UK, which is the UK variant of TBE.

TBE is common in central Europe and is an underestimated risk for those going into forest areas. It is transmitted by tick bites and/or drinking unpasteurised milk. "Cases have been rising in these countries so much that Switzerland, for example, is considering introduction of universal immunisation for the whole population, similar to Austria.

"A few cases are imported to the UK each year by returning visitors and tourists. It is often a severe illness which can cause long-term brain damage and people visiting these areas, especially if hiking and similar activities, should consider being vaccinated against it and taking measures to reduce risk of tick bites. Louping ill is generally regarded as a much milder version of TBE."

[Louping ill (LIV) virus seems the most likely etiological agent involved in this encephalitis case. LIV is present in the UK and can cause encephalitis in humans. Tick-borne encephalitis virus, although a frequent cause of encephalitis in humans in Europe, has never been detected in the UK.

Louping ill virus (LIV) is a tick-borne flavivirus that is part of the tick-borne encephalitis complex of viruses (TBEV). LIV has economic importance by causing illness and death in livestock, especially sheep (_Ovis aries_), and red grouse (_Lagopus lagopus scoticus_) an economically valuable gamebird. The virus occurs predominantly in upland areas of the UK and Ireland. This distribution is closely associated with the presence of its arthropod vector, the hard tick _Ixodes ricinus_.

The advice to wear light-colored clothing to more easily see ticks, use repellants, tuck pantlegs into socks, and carefully inspect oneself and one's dogs for ticks after being outdoors is prudent to avoid bites of ticks and the pathogens that they can transmit. - Mod.TY
