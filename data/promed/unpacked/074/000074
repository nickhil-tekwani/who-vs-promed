We are responding to ProMED archive no. 20080808.2446 posted on 8 Aug
2008. An imported dengue case from Cote d'Ivoire was diagnosed on 26
Jun 2008 in Japan. Chikungunya virus was negative by PCR.

The patient was a 65-year-old man who stayed in Abidjan from 19 May
2008 to 17 Jun 2008. He arrived in Japan on 19 Jun 2008 and was
hospitalized for 8 days because of high fever, myalgia,
thrombocytopenia (38000/L) and hemorrhagic tendency.

Dengue virus type 3 was detected by real-time PCR and isolated by
cell culture. The E gene of the isolated virus was sequenced, and the
virus was shown with 99.4 percent homology to the isolate (GenBank
AM746229) of Saudi Arabian (Jeddah) in 2004.

The sequence was registered with GenBank on 18 Jul 2008. The GenBank
accession number is AB447989. IgM and IgG antibodies were positive
for dengue in the convalescent serum sample. We believe the patient
was the 1st exported case infected with DENV-3 in Cote d'Ivoire.
There is a possibility of both a yellow fever and a dengue fever
epidemic in Cote d'Ivoire.

[This is another example of long-distance movement of a
dengue-virus-infected person, probably viremic, from Cote d'Ivoire,
in this instance, to Japan. In addition to illustrating how disease
agents can be moved, it also indicates that dengue virus is being
actively transmitted in Cote d'Ivoire, although no reports of a
dengue outbreak have been received from that country or elsewhere in
West Africa.

Recent reports of yellow fever (YF) cases indicate that _Aedes_
mosquitoes are sufficiently abundant in Cote d'Ivoire to transmit YF
virus (see ProMED archive no. 20080814.2532).

As Mod.JW pointed out in ProMED archive no. 20080809.2449, Abidjan,
the capital of the country, has a population of 3.5 million,
certainly large enough to sustain a major dengue outbreak, assuming
that Abidjan was the location where these dengue virus infections
were acquired.

ProMED hopes that these reports of dengue virus infection acquired in
Cote d'Ivoire will stimulate issuance of further information about
the current status of dengue and mosquito vectors in Cote d'Ivoire as
well as in other West African countries. - Mod.TY]
