A St John woman who was transferred last week [week of 16 Aug 2010]
to a Miami hospital with possible dengue fever symptoms died there 20
Aug [2010] from complications, her husband said. VI [Virgin Islands]
Health Department epidemiologist Eugene Tull said earlier this week
[week of 23 Aug 2010] that he had no information about a possible
death from dengue fever.

Health Department spokeswoman Eunice Bedminster said Thursday [26 Aug
2010] that the department was not aware of any deaths from the
territory's dengue fever cases but had been investigating since
receiving inquiries from reporters Monday [23 Aug 2010].

Tull said earlier this week that so far this year [2010], there have
been 8 confirmed, laboratory positive cases of dengue fever in the
territory, 3 probable cases with lab results pending, and 15
suspected cases. All of those were in the St Thomas/St John District,
except for 2 of the suspected cases, which were on St Croix, he said.

The death toll from an outbreak of dengue fever in the French
Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe about [within the
last] 6 months has risen to 18, local media reported on Tuesday [24
Aug 2010]. About 26 000 people have been infected with the
mosquito-borne disease [virus] in Martinique and 13 of them have died.

Some 33 000 cases have been reported in Guadeloupe and 5 have died,
with the 5th victim, a 16-year-old teenager, having also suffered
from sickle cell anemia, an inherited blood disease, said Patrick
Portecop, director of the local emergency department. He said
patients who have sickle cell anemia or diabetes must be given
special care if they were infected with dengue fever [virus].
Portecop added that no cases of DHF, which is much more dangerous
than the classic type, had been reported yet in Guadeloupe.

Army troops were called out Monday [23 Aug 2010] to join an
anti-mosquito campaign.

Dengue fever has left 57 dead in Honduras so far this year [2010],
but the epidemic has begun to abate because there is less influx of
patients into hospitals, an official commission reported on Tuesday
[24 Aug 2010]. The National Commission on Certification of Dengue
released its latest statistical report, which stated that the death
toll [from the disease] had risen to 57, with the addition of 2 new
victims. It said there have been 5557 cases of DHF while cases of
classic dengue 50 028. A 6-year-old child in the Social Security
Hospital who died on Sunday [22 Aug 2010] is the last fatal victim of
the disease that raged since June [2010] and caused the collapse of
[service in] the 3 public hospitals in the capital.

So far, the campaigns to destroy breeding sites of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits the disease [virus], have been
unsuccessful, mainly due to constant winter [rainy season] rains in
Central America that will culminate in November.

On 22 Jun [2010], authorities decreed a "national emergency", when
there were 9 dead, and they have complained that the population
remains indifferent, despite the rapid progression of the disease
transmitted by the mosquitoes.

Dengue continues to be the cause for alarm among the citizens of
Santa Marta [Magdalena Department], although officially there are no
figures showing the increase, but the number of patients and the
health centers confirm that the situation is worsening.

The winter season, the stagnation of rain water, sewage and the lack
of prevention (measurers) by the Ministry of Health, are the
predominant factors for the presence of the mosquito [dengue virus]
vector around Santa Marta.

More than 3000 new dengue cases are reported each week. The Ministry
of Heath admits that up to 30 Jul [2010] there were 68 753 cases and
30 deaths [of which] 25 are confirmed and 5 are under study.

According to the analysis carried out by the Network of Medical
Science Societies of Venezuela, 49.8 percent of the dengue cases
occurred in the last 10 weeks, during which the most weekly cases in
9 years were reported. The network, in its Epidemiological Alert 146,
reported that these numbers indicate that "the epidemic is active"
and that the numbers reached in 30 weeks of 2010 are more than the
total number of cases in 2009, when 65 869 were recorded. Of the
total [dengue] cases, 6418 are DHF, 24.6 percent more than in 2009.

They noted that the analysis does not mention that the greatest
prevalence of hemorrhagic [dengue] is observed in children less than
a year of age, with an incidence of 68.9 per 100 000 population, 3
times more than the incidence in the rest of the age groups, which is
22.3 per 100 000 population.

Technical note: isolation of dengue virus serotype 4 in Roraima, Brazil
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 30 Jun 2010, the Roraima Secretariat of Health notified the
Secretariat of Health Surveillance of a suspected case of dengue
virus serotype 4. The case was locally acquired in Boa Vista, capital
of the state, and was detected by a sentinel virus monitoring unit.
The initial diagnosis was made by RT-PCR and virus isolation
techniques, processed in the Roraima Central Laboratory and confirmed
by tests at the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC). Subsequently, 19
samples were sent to IEC where 2 more cases and one suspected cases
were confirmed as dengue virus 4, all locally acquired in Boa Vista.

In synthesis, to date 3 cases have been confirmed in Boa Visa and 9
continue as suspected [cases], 8 of which were locally acquired in
Boa Vista and one in the Canta municipality [35 km/22 mi] from the capital].

The number of dengue cases in the country continues to surge with the
figure already nearing 55 000 based on the figures released by the
Department of Health (DOH)-National Epidemiology Center (NEC)
Tuesday, 24 Aug [2010]. In its Disease Surveillance Report from the
period of 1 Jan-14 Aug [2010], the NEC noted that there are now 54
659 cases reported in hospitals in the Philippines. "This is 74.9
percent higher compared to the same time period last year [2009],
which was only at 31 248," the report added. The deaths due to dengue
were also higher with 429 recorded compared to the 327 in 2009 during
the same period.

The DOH had repeatedly stressed that the most effective way to fight
dengue is by practicing their 4-S strategy -- Search and destroy,
Self-protective measures, Seek early treatment and Say, no to
indiscriminate fogging.

Officials have declared a dengue fever outbreak with the increase in
number of people being afflicted by the mosquito-borne disease
[virus]. August [2010] has not even ended yet but figures from the
city (Zamboanga] health office showed that 314 dengue fever cases
have been registered since the start of the month. The city health
office said 20 patients in this city have died of the disease since
January [2010]. Dr Rodelin Agbulos, city health officer, said from
January-24 Aug [2010], a total of 1584 dengue cases had been
reported. He said half of the city's 20 villages were responsible for
the surge in dengue cases. Mayor Celso Lobregat said the city
government has decided to resort to fumigation to control the spread
of the disease.

Health workers have been conducting dialogues with residents on how
to clean up their surroundings to prevent the breeding of
dengue-causing mosquitoes. Other preventive measures have been
undertaken by providing public schools, situated in so-called endemic
areas, with anti-mosquito-treated curtains. Parents were also advised
to ensure that their school children were protected by insect
repellent lotion and enjoin them to wear long pants and long
sleeved-shirts when possible.

The Taipei City Department of Health on Tuesday [24 Aug 2010]
announced the 1st reported case of indigenous dengue fever in the
city for 2 years. The department does not yet know how the patient,
who has not recently traveled out of the country or even Taipei City,
was infected with the mosquito-born disease [virus], the officials
added. So far this year [2010], 31 cases of confirmed dengue fever
infection were reported in Taipei City, 30 of which were determined
to be imported cases, the department said.

Citing data from the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under
the Department of Health, the officials said dengue fever cases in
Taiwan occurred earlier than usual this year [2010] due to global
warming that led to a suitable climate for mosquito breeding.
According to CDC statistics, the number of recorded indigenous dengue
fever cases in the country has risen to 30 since March, mostly in
Taiwan's southern areas of Kaohsiung and Tainan. CDC Deputy
Director-General Chou Chih-hao warned that as 18 of the cases were
reported last week [week of 16 Aug 2010], it appeared that the
outbreak was accelerating.

Recently, temperatures in Taiwan have hovered around 25-30 deg C
[77-86 deg F]. With afternoon showers common in the summer, it is
easy for the mosquitoes that can spread dengue fever to reproduce if
people allow stagnant water to remain in containers, Chou said.

of some 60 000 dengue fever patients this year [2010], Public health
minister Jurin Laksanawisit said Monday [23 Aug 2010].

Two of the dengue fever deaths last week [week of 16 Aug 2010] were
in Krabi, while Chiang Rai, Phetchabun, Lop Buri, Chachoengsao, and
Nakhon Si Thammarat reported one death each. As the dengue fever
outbreak is so severe this year [2010], Jurin has instructed all
provincial health chiefs to monitor and control the disease as well
as urging people with suspicious symptoms of dengue fever to see
doctors immediately.

The situation so far this year [2010] is 83 per cent higher than last
year's [2009], with an average of 230 new cases detected per day.

The Southern region had 14 361 cases, Northern region 8843 cases,
Central region 15 871 cases, and Northeastern region 15 517 cases. Of
these, 7 patients were less than 28 days old, and 409 cases were over 65 years.

At least 7 persons died and about 50 others were affected in an
outbreak of dengue in Orissa's tribal-dominated Malkangiri district
in past 3 weeks, official sources said today [27 Aug 2010]. The
deaths were reported from Padia, MV-67, and Materu villages under
Padia block of the district during the period, chief district medical
officer (CDMO) Rabindra Kumar Nath said adding 5 of the deaths took
place in last week alone.

Though most of the patients, showing symptoms of high fever, had
undergone treatment at the local primary health centre (PHC)
initially, several had to be shifted to Visakhapatnam in neighbouring
Andhra Pradesh later, he said. Blood tests of the patients at
Visakhapatnam detected dengue [virus or antibodies?], Nath said
adding about 50 persons suffering from the disease were currently
undergoing treatment at various hospitals and health authorities took
steps to deal with the situation.

A team of experts and doctors visited the affected areas to ensure
proper treatment of patients besides taking preventive steps against
the disease through mosquito control, sources said. An awareness
drive has also been launched to check spread of the disease.
