Ebola virus: hemolytic determinant identified
---------------------------------------------
Researchers have identified the [component of Ebola virus that causes the
massive bleeding, the frightening hallmark of the deadly disease that has
begun appearing periodically in Africa. Although Ebola [virus is not
common or widespread, [Ebola virus-associated disease has received much
attention since first reported in 1976 because of the fear generated by the
heavy bleeding and the disease's 90 percent death rate. Researchers
studying Ebola virus at the National Institutes of Health have been
characterizing the functions of the glycoprotein (a sugar-containing
molecule) which constitutes the spikes protruding from the surface of the
virus. In test tube experiments, they discovered that a portion of this
protein is responsible for destruction of endothelial cells. Endothelial
cells line blood vessels, and by [damaging them the protein caused the
vessels to leak. When they made forms of the protein that lacked the
sugars, the protein no longer destroyed blood vessels. The team, led by
Drs. Zhi-Yong Yang and Gary Nabel of the NIH Vaccine Research Center in
Bethesda, Maryland, reported their findings in the August issue of the
journal Nature Medicine, published on Tuesday. [The study results were
released on Sunday.
No vaccine or specific treatment exists for Ebola, but the researchers'
finding may help point the way toward development of new drugs or vaccines
aimed at reducing or preventing the disease. So far, Ebola [has occurred
in remote regions of Africa. The outbreaks included one in 1995 in Zaire
that claimed 245 lives. The virus is named for the Zairian river flowing
through the region where it first appeared. Strains of Ebola found in
Zaire, Sudan and the Ivory Coast have been fatal to humans. A separate
strain [Reston affects monkeys.
