Wild birds likely caused HK H5N1 outbreak: official
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus at a Hong Kong farm
last year [2008] which led to the slaughter of 90 000 chickens was
likely spread by wild birds, an investigation found Thursday [5 Mar 2009].

The December 2008 outbreak was the 1st to be discovered at a Hong
Kong poultry farm in 6 years, and raised fears about the city's
biosecurity measures or whether the deadly H5N1 virus had mutated.
Thomas Sit, the head of the government's investigation team, said
they could not be totally sure what had caused the outbreak. "As with
many epidemiological studies of this nature, it is difficult to
determine the exact cause of the outbreak," Sit told reporters. But
he said the virus was "most likely to have been introduced to the
farm by wild birds."

The dust and dirt near the entrance of one of the 2 affected chicken
sheds could have been contaminated by the droppings from infected
wild birds, and then blown into the shed area by wind, Sit said. Sit
said the farmer, who ran one of the city's major poultry farms, had
been warned to improve biosecurity measures, but would not face any
further action.

Hong Kong was the scene of the world's 1st reported major bird flu
outbreak among humans in 1997, when 6 people died. Since then, H5N1
has killed more than 250 people worldwide. Scientists fear the virus
could mutate into a form which is much more easily transmissible
between humans, triggering a global pandemic that could kill millions.

[According to the previous posting on this outbreak (20081210.3879)
the birds had been vaccinated and still came down with HPAI. In that
same posting it was stated: "In June [2008], a routine inspection of
an outdoor food market turned up 5 cases of avian influenza, spurring
officials to slaughter chickens and suspend supplies of live chickens
from local and Mainland Chinese farms for 3 weeks. An investigation
was launched to determine the source of that outbreak, but a
government spokeswoman said Tuesday [9 Dec 2008] that the source of
June's outbreak had "posed some difficulties" and wasn't yet
determined." The Hong Kong authorities take the risks of this disease
very seriously -- for their regulations and surveillance see the
moderator's remarks in that posting; for government information go to
Hong-Kong's website: "Prevention of Avian Influenza," available at
<http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/index.htm> All influenza viruses
have minor differences and it would be interesting to know who has
seen very similar or identical virus strains latterly. This would
give some guidence as to possible source(s).

A starling H5NI infection was reported in June 2007 (20070602.1786);
a corvid infection was reported in October 2008 (20081019.3312) and
on preliminary analysis H5 was suspected. There has not been a
confirmation reported. Police actions to deter the illegal import of
poultry and birds were reported, which reflects a recognised ongoing
problem. Dr. Sit's conclusions stated above must presume that the
police were 100 percent effective. On the other hand infected egrets
have been picked up (20071126.3827), black-crowned night heron
(20080206.0488), oriental magpie robin (20080213.0574 and
20080308.0951), poultry in Hong Kong street markets and nearby
Guangdong in mainland China (20080607.1814 and 20080617.1900).
Problems with the Hong Kong vaccine were reported in July 2008
(20080711.2121).

In total there has been a lot of recent H5N1 activity in Hong Kong in
poultry and in wild birds. Unfortunately we only get Dr. Sit's
cautious conclusions as to source and not the evidence supporting it,
which I am sure it does. Either way, this is a difficult
epidemiological situation. - Mod.MHJ]
