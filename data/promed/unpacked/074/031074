1st report of _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ in Australia
------------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Australia has
recently reported the occurrence of bacterial canker of kiwifruit,
caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (EPPO Alert List),
on its territory.

The bacterium has been detected on 2 properties in southeast Victoria
during the surveillance activities which followed the 1st detections
made in New Zealand at the end of 2010 [ProMED-mail post 20101111.4088]. The growers indicated that the disease symptoms had
been present for a number of years, but were thought to be caused by
_Pseudomonas viridaflava_, which is endemic in Australia. For the
moment, no economic losses have been observed.

The results of specific PCR testing and DNA sequence analysis have
confirmed the identity of the Australian isolates as _P. syringae_ pv.
_actinidiae_ haplotype 2 (corresponding to the 'Asian' strain which is
considered to be a 'mild' one). Recent studies have also confirmed
that a stored sample from an earlier survey conducted in Western
Australia in 1992 belonged to be the same strain.

This is the 1st record of bacterial canker of kiwifruit in
Australia.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids)
caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ was originally
described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain.
Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf
spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate,
fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is
favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are
usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to
occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected
to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including
animal and human activities), and infected planting material. Spread
with infected fruit and/or pollen cannot be excluded until conclusive
data become available.

Generally, disease management of bacterial diseases may include
cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread,
use of clean planting material and resistant crop varieties, but
specific control strategies for kiwi canker are being developed.
Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used in Japan, but
resistant pathogen strains have emerged.

A recent outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) affecting
25 percent of the Zespri Gold variety vines was found to be due to the
emergence of a new, very virulent strain which is now spreading in the
country. In New Zealand, 2 separate pathogen strains have been
identified including the virulent Italian strain. For outbreaks
reported recently from France, Chile, and Portugal strains still
remain to be identified. The risk associated with, and origin of the
strain reported from Australia above, as well as whether the Victorian
detection is due to spread from WA or a separate incursion, appears to
be as yet unclear.
