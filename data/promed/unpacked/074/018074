Case of Ebola virus disease in Uganda
------------------------------------
- The 1st confirmed case of Ebola in Uganda, a 5-year-old boy, passed away on the morning of Wed 12 Jun 2019. His dignified and safe burial will be on Thu 13 Jun 2019 in Kasese, the district where he resided with his parents.
- Laboratory tests have confirmed that of the 6 family members who have crossed the border, 2 others are also infected with Ebola. This is the 50-year-old grandmother and the 3-year-old brother of the deceased boy. Of the 6 family members left in Kasindi and transferred to the Beni Ebola Treatment Center, 5 were tested positive. Around this family, about 50 contacts were listed in Kasese on the Ugandan side and 80 contacts in Kasindi on the Congolese side. Kasindi's vaccination ring was opened on [Wed 12 Jun 2019].
- On Wed 12 Jun 2019, the Congolese and Ugandan health authorities also held a meeting in Kasese, about 140 kilometers [about 87 mi] from Beni, to discuss mechanisms for cross-border collaboration. The Ugandan Minister of Health, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, led the Ugandan delegation while the Congolese side was led by Dr Gaston Tshapenda, coordinator of Beni.
- The main decisions taken are:
- strengthen surveillance at ports of entry, especially secondary roads;
- maintain continuous information sharing in real time between the two countries;
- start vaccinating the contacts as soon as possible. The DRC has already donated 400 doses of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine to Uganda. The DRC is willing to send vaccination teams to Uganda to vaccinate all contacts more quickly if needed;
- repatriate all family members in the DRC after obtaining their informed consent. Since the father of the deceased child was Ugandan, the family was free to choose the place of hospitalization. Living family members have all agreed to return to the DRC for further medical treatment and 21-day follow-up. The advantage of continuing medical treatment in the DRC is the possibility of benefiting from new therapeutic molecules that are not yet available in Uganda;
- finalize the Memorandum of Understanding between Uganda and the DRC that will define the procedures for in-depth health collaboration between the 2 countries.

The grandmother of a 5-year-old boy who died of Ebola [12 Jun 2019] has also passed on. The late reportedly died ‪at around 6pm‬ at Bwera General Hospital where an isolation facility was established for Ebola patients to be treated.

"She will be buried tomorrow by our team after identifying a place," a source among the Ministry of Health team which travelled to Kasese today [12 Jun 2019] told Daily Monitor. He however declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press.

Health Ministry Spokesperson Mr Emmanuel Ainebyoona was hesitant to comment on the matter while Dr Jane Ruth Aceng the Health Minister did not pick our calls to confirm the case.

The Ebola outbreak which has ravaged the neighbouring DRC for the last one year was [Tue 11 Jun 2019] confirmed in Uganda in the western border district of Kasese.

The 1st case to be confirmed on [Tue 11 Jun 2019] was that of a 5-year-old boy, who tested positive and later died [12 Jun 2019]. The others cases include the deceased's [grandmother and] 3-year-old young brother, who also tested positive and was admitted at the isolation facility that was established at Bwera General Hospital.

[Since the last ProMED-mail Ebola update (53) containing the 1st reports of cases in Uganda ex Congo DR, the number of identified contacts on both sides of the border has risen sharply. Surveillance, contact tracing, and vaccination efforts appear to be proceeding apace. Interestingly, despite the Ugandan origins of the affected family in question, all of the surviving members have elected to be treated in ETC's in the DRC, where they may have access to experimental Ebola therapeutics available under MOH-approved protocols -- although these may be of limited benefit regardless, because of the relatively advanced stage of infection in these family members, who were already symptomatic when initially intercepted in Kasindi on 10 Jun 2019. - Mod.LXL]

Ebola in Uganda; data as reported Wed 12 Jun 2019
-------------------------------------------------
On 11 Jun 2019, the Ugandan Ministry of Health confirmed an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Kasese district, at the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The index case in this outbreak is a 5-year-old boy who fell ill after a visit to Mabalako health zone in [North Kivu] Democratic Republic of the Congo to attend the burial of his grand-father, a confirmed EVD case, who died in the community on 1 Jun 2019. The boy and his mother re-entered Uganda (where they reside) through the Bwera border on 10 Jun 2019 and presented to Kagando hospital (the same day) with a bleeding diathesis (nose bleeding, vomiting blood, blood in stool, and urine) in addition to other symptoms, which included muscle pain, headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Because of a high index of suspicion of a viral haemorrhagic disease, the case-patient was immediately referred to Bwera Hospital, where a designated Ebola treatment centre (ETC) has been established as part of EVD preparedness. Blood specimens were obtained and transported to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on 10 Jun 2019. Test results released by UVRI on 11 Jun 2019 showed that the sample was positive for Ebola Zaire on the 1st polymerase chain reaction (PCR) run. Additionally, the sample was positive on Ebola rapid diagnostic testing. A 3rd confirmatory test (using EboZai NP primers and probe) was also positive for Ebola Zaire. The Uganda Minister of Health and the WHO Representative in Uganda, in a joint press conference held at 9:00 pm on 11 Jun 2019, formally declared the EVD outbreak. The child died in the early hours of 12 Jun 2019.

Two family relations to the index case (the mother and a sibling) developed symptoms and were isolated in Bwera ETC on 11 Jun 2019. Blood specimens collected and shipped to the UVRI on 11 Jun 2019 tested positive for EVD on 12 Jun 2019. Another suspected case has been admitted to the ETC and the test result is pending. A total of 8 contacts have been identified and are being closely monitored.

The Ugandan Ministry of Health, WHO and partners have deployed a multisectoral rapid response team to the affected district. Further update on this event will be provided as information comes in.

Ebola in Democratic Republic of the Congo; data as reported Mon 10 Jun 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo the EVD outbreak continues to show a decrease in the number of new cases, with 54 new confirmed cases reported in the past week, compared to 88 cases reported per week during the last 2 weeks. While a relatively lower incidence of new cases continues to be seen some hotspots such as Katwa, Beni, and Kalunguta health zones [North Kivu], elsewhere the situation appears more tenuous. Active transmission is ongoing in communities within 11 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

In the 21 days between 20 May to 10 Jun 2019, 68 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces. During this period, a total of 218 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the [North Kivu] health zones of Mabalako (29%, n=64), Butembo (22%, n=47), Katwa (16%, n=35), Mandima [Ituri] (11%, n=24), and Beni (8.2%, n=18). One new confirmed case was reported from Rwampara health zone [Ituri] following a prolonged period since the last reported case. This latest case was linked to a confirmed case within Beni health zone [North Kivu].

As of 10 Jun 2019, a total of 2071 EVD cases, including 1977 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1396 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1302 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2062 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1187) were female, and 29% (598) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 115 (6% of total cases).

- Wed 12 Jun 2019. Uganda has 2 more Ebola cases as WHO reconvenes experts
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/uganda-has-2-more-ebola-cases-who-reconvenes-experts


In quickly evolving developments today [12 Jun 2019]in an Ebola outbreak that now straddles 2 countries, Uganda's health ministry reported 2 more infections -- both involving family members of the imported case-patient reported yesterday -- and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it would reconvene its emergency committee on [14 Jun 2019].

Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [12 Jun 2019] announced it has activated its emergency operations center (EOC) to support efforts to battle the DRC's Ebola outbreak, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) yesterday reported nine more cases.

Two of boy's family members infected
------------------------------------
The 2 newly confirmed cases in Uganda are both part of the family from the DRC that was stopped at a health checkpoint at the Ugandan border, some of whom escaped to Uganda. Health officials reported yesterday that they detected the virus in one of the them, a 5-year-old boy.

In its statement today [12 Jun 2019], Uganda's health ministry said the boy died this morning.

One of the new cases is the boy's 50-year-old grandmother, and the other is his 3-year-old brother. They had several Ebola symptoms, including vomiting blood and bloody diarrhea, and they are being treated in isolation at Bwera Hospital Ebola treatment unit (ETU), located in Kasese district near the DRC-Uganda border.

In a weekly situation report today [12 Jun 2019], the World Health Organization (WHO) said another suspected case has been admitted to the Bwera ETU [Ebola treatment unit], and test results are pending.

The Ugandan health ministry said 8 contacts have been identified and are under monitoring. It also added that top health officials are in Kasese district and rapid response teams are on the ground to assess the situation and help district officials with response steps such as contact tracing, case management, surveillance, and risk communication.

Uganda's health ministry and the WHO will conduct ring vaccination of patient contacts and unvaccinated health workers beginning on [14 Jun 2019].

Emergency panel to meet for 3rd time
------------------------------------
The WHO today [12 Jun 2019] said Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, has reconvened the Ebola emergency committee for [14 Jun 2019] to discuss the latest developments, assess if changes warrant declaring a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations, and to update any earlier recommendations.

The upcoming event marks the emergency committee's 3rd meeting to discuss the DRC's latest Ebola outbreak. At its last meeting on [12 Apr 2019], the group said lack of international spread was one of the reasons it held off on recommending a PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern] declaration. WHO emergency committees typically meet every 3 months, or more often, based on outbreak developments.

In a statement sent to journalists, the WHO said it would hold a media telebriefing after the emergency committee meets to announce the group's recommendations.

CDC steps up support
--------------------
In a news release today [12 Jun 2019], the [US] CDC said its EOC [Emergency Operations Center] activation is at level 3, the lowest level, but it paves the way to increase support for the CDC's expanded response team deployed in the DRC.

CDC Director Robert Redfield, MD, said in the release, "Through CDC's command center we are consolidating our public health expertise and logistics planning for a longer term, sustained effort to bring this complex epidemic to an end."

Yesterday [11 Jun 2019] in a press release on Uganda's 1st imported case linked to the DRC outbreak, Redfield said, "This is a sobering development that everyone has been working to avoid and highlights the complexity of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."

Since August [2018] when the DRC's latest outbreak began, the CDC has been helping the DRC government with the outbreak response and has deployed experts on epidemiology, case management, infection control and prevention, laboratory science, border health, risk communication, community engagement, information technology, emergency management, and logistics. And since September the CDC has been helping the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and the American Embassy in Kinshasa.

As of [11 Jun 2019[, 187 CDC staff have completed 187 deployments, not only to the DRC but also to Uganda, other neighboring countries, and WHO headquarters in Geneva.

DRC cases reach 2071
--------------------
In its daily update yesterday [11 Jun 2019], the DRC health ministry announced nine new cases in 6 locations, all of them among the current hot spots.

One of the latest cases involves a member of a burial team in Musienene [North Kivu] who had not been vaccinated. He had cared for his brother who died from Ebola. When he was recruited for the burial team, he told his superiors that he had already been vaccinated.

The latest illnesses boost the overall outbreak total to 2071 cases, which include 1977 confirmed and 94 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 284 suspected cases. The WHO's online Ebola dashboard suggests the DRC's health ministry will likely announce 13 new cases today [12 Jun 2019].

Another 6 people died from Ebola, 2 in community settings and 4 in Ebola treatment centers. The new developments put the fatality count at 1396.

WHO: 115 health workers infected
--------------------------------
In its weekly situation report, the WHO said the boy identified as Uganda's 1st patient and his mother are from Uganda and had been in the DRC's Mabalako health zone, where they attended the burial of the boy's grandfather, who had died from Ebola in the community on [1 Jun 2019].

The WHO said it and Uganda's health ministry have deployed a multisector rapid response team to the affected district.

Meanwhile, in the DRC, the number of new cases shows a decline, with 54 reported over the past week, compared with 88 the week before. Though some areas are seeing fewer cases -- such as Katwa, Beni, and Kalunguta [North Kivu] -- the situation is more tenuous elsewhere. "Active transmission is ongoing in communities within 11 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces," the WHO said.

Cases continue to rise among health workers, with 115 reported so far, which makes up 6% of the outbreak total. The DRC yesterday [11 Jun 2019] reported 113 cases among healthcare workers.

The WHO said the decline in cases in the 2 affected DRC provinces is encouraging, affirming the commitment of local, national, and international partners. It added, however, that Ebola's appearance in Uganda is of grave concern, highlighting the region's vulnerability to the spread of the disease.
