Preliminary data in New Zealand found 36 percent flu vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing primary care visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and 50 percent against hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), according to a report today [07 Jan 2016] in Eurosurveillance.

The study included 1197 outpatients with ILI and 754 hospitalized patients with SARI from 27 Apr to 26 Sep [2015], the Southern Hemisphere's flu season, in Auckland. Among those with ILI, 573 tested positive for influenza by polymerase chain reaction (93 of whom were vaccinated), compared with 180 of the SARI patients, of whom 47 had received flu vaccination.

Using a case test-negative design, the researchers found a 36 percent VE in the ILI patients and a 50 percent VE in the SARI patients. VE against hospitalized H3N2 was 53 percent, which was higher than the previous season, the authors reported.

They concluded, "We are encouraged by our interim observation of positive VE point estimates for influenza A (H3N2) virus-associated ILI (22 percent; 95 percent CI [confidence interval]: -23 to 51) and SARI (53 percent; 95 percent CI: 6-76), which may indicate that VE improved with the change in [H3N2] vaccine strain [i.e., changed from influenza A(H3N2) IIV3 component to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus]."

[The Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness, Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) study has been conducted since 2012 to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) in patients presenting with influenza illness to general practice (primary care) and against hospitalized influenza patients. In 2015, influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses (including both B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages) were most prevalent. The authors conclude that inactivated influenza vaccines provided moderate protection against influenza illness.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States of America had an interim estimate of vaccine effectiveness for the northern hemisphere 2014-15 seasonal influenza vaccine as 23 percented. During seasons when most circulating influenza viruses are closely related to the viruses in the influenza vaccine, the vaccine effectiveness estimate has ranged from 50-60 percent among the overall population. Most patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus were infected with the A(H3N2) subtype. Characterization of A(H3N2) influenza viruses from patients showed differences between viruses infecting people and the A(H3N2) subtype that was included in the seasonal influenza vaccine.
