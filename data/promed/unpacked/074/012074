There are several reports dealing with the issue of emergence of
non-vaccine serogroups after use of group A and C meningococcal vaccines.
Routine use of the group C vaccine in US Army recruits has not been
associated with an increased incidence of group B disease. [Artenstein M,
et al. Milit Med 1974; 139:91-5. Since that report covering the first 6
years of studies of the group C vaccine in the US Army, there has not been
any significant increase in group B incidence. The predominant serogroups
causing meningococcal disease in the military remain, as before use of
vaccine, determined by the predominant carrier strains brought to training
camps by new recruits. However, when group A vaccine was used in army
recruits during a group A epidemic in Finland, an increase in group B
disease was observed. [Mäkelä P, et al. Lancet 1975; ii:883-6
In Quebec, there was no significant increase in group B disease incidence
after mass use of the group A/C and A/C/Y/W135 vaccine in the population 6
months-21 years of age. Less extensive use of the vaccines in Ontario has
also not been associated with changes in group B incidence.
There is reason to be concerned about the potential of the vaccine to lead
to emergence of non-vaccine serogroups. Both the group A and group C
vaccines have been shown to reduce the rate of acquisition of carriage of
vaccine groups. Moreover, the group C vaccine only reduces carrier rates in
army recruits by about 50% [Artenstein MS et al. J Infect Dis 1970;372-7
and is not seen in those with low antibody responses to the vaccine.
However, the carrier rate of group C strains is very low in the general
population, even during outbreaks of group C disease, (unlike the situation
in military recruits). Therefore, it is less likely that the vaccine will
have much effect when used in the general population.
The situation may change when the much more immunogenic protein conjugate
meningococcal vaccines become available and are used because they are
likely to have a much more substantial effect on acquisition of group A and
C strains than the pure polysaccharide vaccines. The lack of a group B
vaccine effective against all serotypes of group B remains are major
problem in control of meningococcal disease.
