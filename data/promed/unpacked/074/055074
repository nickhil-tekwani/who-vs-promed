"Misuse of antiviral on poultry must stop"
------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) plans to dispatch inspection teams
nationwide to stop the antiviral drug amantadine, which is meant for
humans, from being used on poultry.
An MOA official spoke out yesterday [20 Jun 2005] after reports, denied by
the government, that some farmers are being encouraged to illegally use
amantadine on their chickens to curb the spread of bird flu. Researchers
fear using the drug on animals and humans could lead to drug resistance.
Drug-resistant forms of H5N1 have already been found in Thailand and Viet
Nam, according to reports.
The government has never permitted farmers to use amantadine to treat bird
flu, said Xu Shixin, MOA's division director of the veterinary bureau. But
he did not identify where the drug misuse had taken place. "We'll take
measures soon to curb the action," he said, without elaborating.
Xu refuted a report by the Washington Post on Saturday [18 Jun 2005] that
the Chinese Government had encouraged farmers to use amantadine on their
chickens to prevent bird flu. "The report was groundless," Xu said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) have both expressed concerns over the issue. The WHO
spokesman in China, Roy Wadia, said his organization will seek more
information from the Chinese Government.
Zhang Zhongjun, an assistant representative of the China office of FAO,
said his organization and the Chinese Government have already set up a
channel to report developments on the fight against infectious diseases in
animals. "We haven't received any reports so far that the Chinese
Government has allowed the use of the drug on chickens," said Zhang.
China has made breakthroughs in vaccine research against H5N1 and H5N2,
highly lethal strains of bird flu, and they work effectively in combating
poultry disease, he said.
MOA's Xu said the government would supply farmers with cheaper and more
effective vaccines to replace the use of amantadine by some farmers. He
also said that the bird flu outbreak in China has already been brought
under control.

[It is not clear where and how amantadine is applied in poultry. This seems
an uneconomical, and most probably inefficient drug for mass
protection/treatment of commercial poultry against highly pathogenic avian
influenza. Is it possible that the application is undertaken to protect
selectively expensive birds, such as fighting cocks, or that some financial
interests of suppliers/professional advisers are at the background
exploiting the misery and trust of naive farmers?
On top of that, the efficacy of such treatment is doubtful. According to
information included in posting 20050309.0697, the WHO Collaborating Center
for Reference and Research on Influenza and the WHO H5 Reference Laboratory
in the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan found that all 9
tested viruses isolated from specimens collected from confirmed and
suspected H5N1 human cases in southern Viet Nam between 24 Dec 2004 and 29
Jan 2005 showed genetic resistance to amantadine. Previously, several avian
influenza virus strains of hemagglutinin subtype 5 were found to exhibit
resistance against amantidine (Wainright, et al Avian Dis 1991; 35(1):
31-9). - Mod.AS
Amantadine was developed by Du Pont more than 30 years ago and has not
proven to have much application in control of human influenza. (But Webster
and colleagues have described a possible strategy for employing amantadine
in conjunction with vaccine).
The target of the drug is known now to be the M-2 protein (which forms a
transmembrane ion channel transporting protons). Amantadine blocks ion
transport in the case of all influenza A viruses, but not influenza B
viruses because influenza B virus does not express a M-2 protein. Mutation
to amantadine-resistance occurs at appreciable frequency and this has
limited the use of amantadine in human medicine. Another factor limiting
its use in humans is that it must be administered 24 hours before exposure
to infection and it must be maintained at high concentration for at least
10 days. Side effects are common, particularly those affecting the CNS.
Amantadine survives as a therapeutic drug, not because of its
anti-influenza A virus activity, but because it has some beneficial use in
treatment of Parkinson's disease. A methylated derivative -- rimantadine --
was developed in Russia which does not cross the blood-brain barrier and
consequently has fewer neurological side-affects. - Mod.CP]
