Brazilian scientists have proven that it is possible for people to be infected simultaneously with 2 different lines of the new coronavirus. It was the 1st time that specialists have attested the possibility of co-infection by Sars-CoV-2.

The final version of the study (full version - 3 MB) was published in the scientific journal Virus Research on 22 Feb 2021.

The researchers did the genetic sequencing of the viruses present in 92 people. In 2 women in their 30s, 2 different strains were found simultaneously.

In one case, the 2 variants have been circulating in Brazil since the beginning of the pandemic. In the other, in addition to an older strain of the virus, the P2 variant was detected, identified for the 1st time in Rio de Janeiro.

The 2 women did not develop severe forms of the disease. With mild symptoms, they were not hospitalized.

According to the research, the concern with coinfection is not due to the worsening of the disease but to the possibility of recombination of the genome of the different strains, which can generate new variants of the coronavirus.

"Although there are some reported cases of reinfection, the possibility of coinfection adds a new factor to the complex interaction between immune response systems and Sars-CoV-2 mutations," says the study.

The scientists warn that "ongoing efforts to determine the frequency of co-infections and surveillance of recombination events in clinical samples should be considered crucial."

Genomic Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection Involving E484K Spike Mutation, Brazil
-----------------------------
Abstract
Uncertainty remains about how long the protective immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 persists, and suspected reinfection in recovered patients has been reported. We describe a case of reinfection from distinct virus lineages in Brazil harboring the E484K mutation, a variant associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies.

[Previous reports have documented co-infection of SARS-CoV2 with other respiratory pathogens; most common co-infections were rhinovirus/enterovirus (6.9%), respiratory syncytial virus (5.2%), and non-SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae (4.3%) [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2764787]. We know that infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to a detectable immune response, but the susceptibility of previously infected individuals to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in generation of neutralising antibodies in patients.1 However, the degree to which this immune response indicates a protective immunity to subsequent infection with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been elucidated. In studies of immunity to other coronaviruses, loss of immunity can occur within 1-3 years. Cases of primary illness due to infection followed by a discrete secondary infection or illness with the same biological agent can best be ascertained as distinct infection events by genetic analysis of the agents associated with each illness event. Reports of secondary infection events with SARS-CoV-2 have been published from Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Belgium, and Ecuador, the US, and Poland. Recently, Pedro et al reported a dual infection in a young patient which the authors postulated resulted in increased severity of disease and prolonged hospitalization [https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/2/300/htm].

Tillet et al published a case report of an individual who had 2 distinct COVID-19 illnesses from genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 agents [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science /article/pii/S1473309920307647#cesec10]. The implications of co-infection and/or reinfections would be highly relevant for vaccine development and application. From a public health perspective, all individuals -- whether previously diagnosed or not -- must continue to take similar precautions to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Global and Regional Adaptive Evolution of SARS-CoV-2

Abstract
Understanding the trends in SARS-CoV-2 evolution is paramount to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed more than 300 000 high quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the nuclear localization signal (NLS) associated region of the nucleocapsid protein are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements. These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals 4 distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region-specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March-July 2020, during a period of stasis in terms of inter-regional diversity. Finally, beginning in July 2020, multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing regional diversification, which might be indicative of speciation.

Significance
Understanding the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to control and ultimately end the pandemic. We analyzed more than 300 000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of January 2021 and demonstrate adaptive evolution of the virus that affects, primarily, multiple sites in the spike and nucleocapsid protein. Selection appears to act on combinations of mutations in these and other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Evolution of the virus is accompanied by ongoing adaptive diversification within and between geographic regions. This diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required. The epistatic network will continue to evolve through the entirety of the pandemic, and indeed, all emerging variants at the time of this writing are defined not by a single mutation but by an ensemble of signature mutations. Moreover, in addition to the apparent widespread intra-protein epistasis, there seem to exist multiple epistatic interactions between the N and S proteins. In particular, S/N501Y and N/S235F are both signature mutations for variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.7_E484K, and this pair is in the top 25% of co-occurring pairs in our network ranked by lowest probability of random co-occurrence.

As with early founder mutations, when a new variant emerges with multiple signature mutations, it is unclear which, if any, confer a fitness advantage. Although it is natural to focus on substitutions within the RBD, we emphasize that all emergent variants contain substitutions in the vicinity of known NLS motifs. In fact, the most statistically significant signature mutation (based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence) for vAfrica (consistent with variant B.1.351, see below) is N/T205I. As we suggest for S/D614G, these variant signature mutations are likely to exert a greater influence through multiple epistatic interactions than in isolation, and each signature mutation can be a member of multiple epistatic ensembles beyond the group of signature mutations within which it was originally identified. Indeed, signature mutations are shared among defined variants, and we find evidence for an additional 18 putative epistatic interactions between variant signature mutations and other events throughout the tree which are not identified as signature mutations for any defined variant (Table S4, List 3). The growing ensemble of signature mutations that appear to be subject to positive selection and the existence of a robust network of putative epistatic interactions including these signatures, suggest that ongoing virus diversification is driven by host adaptation rather than occurring simply by neutral drift.

Conclusions
Virus evolution during a pandemic is a fast-moving target, and unavoidably, aspects of this analysis will be outdated by the time of publication. Nevertheless, several trends revealed here appear general and robust. Although it is difficult to ascertain positive selection for individual sites, the overall adaptive character of SARS-CoV-2 evolution involving multiple amino acid replacements appears to be beyond reasonable doubt. As expected, there are multiple positively selected sites in the S protein, but more surprisingly, N protein includes several sites that appear to be strongly selected as well. The involvement of these adaptive substitutions in the nuclear localization of the N protein appears likely. Importantly, some of the mutations, for which positive selection was inferred, co-occur on multiple occasions and seem to form a robust epistatic network. Most likely, the effect of positive selection is manifested primarily at the level of epistatic interactions.

Clearly, despite the dramatic reduction of global travel, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is partly shaped by globalizing factors, including the increased virus fitness conferred by S/D614G, N/R203K&G204R, and other positively selected substitutions. However, we obtained strong evidence of both continuous virus diversification within geographic regions and "speciation," that is, formation of stable, diverging region-specific variants. This ongoing adaptive diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required.

[3] T Cell Response

[A] Variant Recognition
Date: 5 Mar 2021
Source: Nature [edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00502-w


Emerging coronavirus variants do not seem to elude important immune-system players called T cells, laboratory studies suggest.

Some recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 variants can partially evade antibodies generated in response to vaccination and previous infection, raising fears that vaccines will be less effective against the variants than against the original strain of the virus. Alessandro Sette and Alba Grifoni at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California and their colleagues looked at whether these variants' mutations might also help them to evade T cells, a component of the immune system that is particularly important for reducing the severity of infectious diseases (A. Tarke et al. Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/gh6tkp; 2021).

The team collected T cells from volunteers who had either recovered from infection with the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain or had received an mRNA coronavirus vaccine. The researchers then tested the cells' ability to recognize protein snippets from 4 emerging variants, including the B.1.351 variant 1st identified in South Africa.

Most of the volunteers' T cells recognized all 4 variants, thanks to viral protein snippets that were unaffected by the variants' mutations. The results suggest that T cells could target these variants.

[Current estimates of population immunity rely solely on seroprevalence studies; however, in the context of evidence for cellular responses in seronegative exposed individuals, and the potential waning of antibody responses over time, current surveillance methods are likely to be underestimating both exposure and immunity. Understanding the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to vaccine development, epidemiological surveillance, and disease control strategies. In a systematic review of 61 studies by Shrotri et al; the authors noted that "A complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies, as well as a striking lack of research in asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic individuals. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the T cell response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised."

A more in-depth understanding of the role of T cells in long-term protection will be helpful to policy makers in terms of predictive modelling where population-level immunity lies and informing long-term surveillance and immunisation strategies. - Mod.UBA]

The 1st test for a T-cell response to the virus behind Covid-19 has received emergency approval for use in the US, creating another option for people to discover whether they have had the disease. Adaptive Biotechnologies, a Seattle-based biotech company, worked with Microsoft to create the blood test, which can be more accurate than some of the antibody tests on the market. As well as creating antibodies, the immune system produces T-cells in response to an infection. T-cells are white blood cells that can directly kill infected cells or help B-cells stimulate the production of antibodies.

Lance Baldo, chief medical officer at Adaptive, said T-cells were important because they have a "very long memory," appearing to remain in the body for at least 6 to 9 months. Given how the pandemic has only been around for a year, they could remain even longer. Baldo said this could be particularly useful for people suffering from "long Covid" -- with symptoms that persist over months -- who may not have had a positive test at the time. It could help shape their care, and in the US, it may influence what insurers will pay for. "You have these people with long-term Covid; they're not sure if they were ever really infected; their antibodies are definitely gone; they're not going to have a positive PCR [diagnostic test], and they're just calling us saying, 'I want to know whether 3 months ago, 6 months ago, 9 months ago, I actually had the coronavirus,'" he said.

Adaptive's lab tests, which have already been available from concierge medicine practices, can now be ordered by doctors across the US. The emergency use authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration comes after a study showed that T-cells could play an important role in the immune response to new variants. Researchers at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and the University of California said they found that T-cell responses in the vaccinated, or previously infected, were just as robust with the variants 1st identified in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and California. Adaptive says its research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, showed its test detects 97 per cent of people who have had the disease, compared with antibody tests that vary between 77 to 97 per cent. The proportion of false negatives was less than one per cent. There has not yet been enough research into whether the discovery of these T-cells mean people are immune to the Sars-Cov-2 virus.

But Adaptive is hoping patients who take the test will opt into research, which will allow the company to follow them and see whether any develop Covid-19. Adaptive is also working with vaccine developers, which have so far focused on whether their shots elicit an antibody response, to see whether they achieve a T-Cell reaction, too. Microsoft's machine learning tools helped Adaptive map the body's immune system. Adaptive also plans to create tests for T-Cell response to other infectious diseases, such as Lyme disease, and autoimmune disease.

[Diagnosis of COVID-19 is routinely achieved by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs via quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR); however, even symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections frequently remain unrecognized. When symptomatic, COVID-19 can range from a mild, common flu-like sickness in around 85% of cases to a severe respiratory disease in around 15% of affected patients.

Currently available tests for prior exposure to coronavirus rely on the detection of antibodies, which tend to diminish in titers within a couple of months after being infected with the virus. Previously identified T cells in patients recovering from COVID-19 have shown that they do not cross-react to other seasonal coronaviruses.

There are other T cell detection assays under development in the UK and the US that can provide a more reliable way to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over a much longer period following infection. Furthermore, if the presence of antiviral T cells can be linked to protection from future infections, these tests can provide valuable information on the course of the pandemic and a safe return to normal life. - Mod.UBA]

Osaka Prefecture announced on 4 Mar 2021 that it was confirmed that a total of 64 people had been infected with a mutant strain of the new coronavirus since January 2021 in the prefecture. The number is not fixed because it will be tested again at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, but the prefecture is calling on people to "be careful as the infection may have spread."

The positive results were confirmed by screening tests at research institutes in the prefecture. Some of the specimens have already been sent to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, and a total of 12 mutant infections have been confirmed. The laboratory's tests will determine whether the mutant strain is from the United Kingdom, South Africa, or Brazil.

According to an examination by a medical institution in the prefecture, 46 out of about 80 people infected with the new coronavirus from late January to early March 2021 were mutant strains. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, 234 people (including those in airport quarantine) were confirmed to be infected with the mutant strain by 4 Mar 2021. Of these, 38 are in Saitama prefecture and 36 in Hyogo prefecture.

More than 60% of all new coronavirus infections registered in France are linked to the variant 1st detected in Britain, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thu 4 Mar 2021.

"The circulation of the virus has accelerated over the past 2 weeks, and that is clearly linked to the UK variant," Castex said at a weekly COVID-19 news conference.

While the virus is not rising exponentially, the health system remains under massive pressure, he added.

Around 6 percent of COVID-19 cases in France are from the more contagious variants 1st found in Brazil and South Africa, French Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Fri 5 Mar 2021.

Veran also told BFM TV that France was doing all it could to avoid a new national lockdown, although the government would keep all options open, and that there were reasons to believe France's COVID situation would improve in 4-6 weeks as more of its population gets vaccinated against the virus.

On Thu 4 Mar 2021, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said around 60% of French COVID-19 cases were from the variant 1st discovered in England.
