First Report of West Nile Virus in Arkansas: Dead Blue Jay
----------------------------------------------------------
LITTLE ROCK: The Arkansas Department of Health and the Livestock and
Poultry Commission are reporting that one dead Blue Jay in El Dorado, Union
County, has tested positive at the USGS National Wildlife Laboratory in
Madison, Wisconsin for West Nile virus. This is the first time that the
disease has been identified in Arkansas. No human cases of West Nile virus
have been reported in Arkansas.
The Arkansas Department of Health is continuing its surveillance for
mosquito-borne viruses in Arkansas and is testing dead birds and mosquitoes
for West Nile virus. Horses and other animals are also tested for West Nile
virus if they show signs of encephalitis. Human blood samples are being
taken from patients with viral encephalitis and viral meningitis.
Dr. Tom McChesney, state epidemiologist, says, "Arkansans should report
dead crows and blue jays to the local health unit, so that pick-up or
delivery and testing of dead birds can be arranged. Folks in the eastern
and southeastern parts of the state are encouraged to be especially alert
to this problem, since Memphis is reporting West Nile virus in birds and we
now have a confirmed positive bird in El Dorado."
