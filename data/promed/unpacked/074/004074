A week after health officials in Trashigang declared that the rabies
outbreak was under control, 5 children, an adult, and 10 cows were
bitten by a rabid dog on the morning of 1 Feb 2006 in Yonphula, Trashigang.
While post-treatment of the 'directly infected' was underway, the
community had killed the rabid dog and disposed of it before the
livestock officials could take brain samples for investigation.
"Since we couldn't determine if any dogs were also bitten, which we
believe is the case, we are speculating one or 2 more outbreaks,"
said the dzongkhag's [administrative district] livestock officer, Tenzin Dorji.
Since the 2 Jan 2006 outbreak in Khaling, 136 people and 34 cattle
had been exposed to the infection in the dzongkhag. 17 people were
bitten by rabid dogs while the rest were infected from the saliva of
the infected animals and from consuming dairy products from infected
domestic cattle. A total of 107 people in Khaling were suspected of
infection during the 2 Jan outbreak. 7 cows and 5 dogs were also
bitten and infected with the disease. By 26 Jan 2006, the number of
people suspected of being infected by the virus had increased to 129
although health officials in the dzongkhag maintained that the
situation was under control.
A mass anti-rabies vaccination (ARV) campaign was launched
simultaneously in the dzongkhag's 16 gewogs [sub-district]. Besides
cattle, ARV was also administered to over 2000 dogs out of a total of
estimated 3371 canine population in the dzongkhag, according to Tenzin Dorji.
"Post-treatment activities are also being carried out in the affected
areas," he told Kuensel. "We are trying to control future outbreaks.
We have enough vaccines and the extension agents in the gewogs are
carrying out vaccination." The livestock officer also dismissed the
rumours that there were also outbreaks in Rongthong and Rangjung.
However, he pointed out that the origin of the outbreak had been
traced to neighbouring Trashiyangtse dzongkhag which had an outbreak
in February 2005. It was followed by an outbreak in Pam, Trashigang,
in April where only one case was reported.

[The Kingdom of Bhutan lies between India and China (geographical
coordinates: 27 30 N, 90 30) E. The country is divided into 18
districts (dzongkhag, singular and plural); Bumthang, Chhukha,
Chirang, Dagana, Geylegphug, Ha, Lhuntshi, Mongar, Paro, Pemagatsel,
Punakha, Samchi, Samdrup Jongkhar, Shemgang, Tashigang, Thimphu,
Tongsa, Wangdi Phodrang. Information on the kingdom and a map can be
accessed at <http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bt.html>
An unusual aspect of this outbreak, apart from its extent, is
transmission of infection as a result of consumption of dairy
products from rabies virus-infected cattle. According to the CDC
web-site
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/news/cow_oklahoma_122305.htm>)
transmission by this route is rare but not impossible. Most persons
who consume raw milk or cream prepared from rabies virus-infected
cows are at minimal risk for rabies exposure. Infants and persons
with certain medical conditions may be at higher risk. Medical
conditions that would place a person at higher risk are those that
suppress the immune system, cause abnormalities of the palate, or
cause open sores, erosions, or ulcerations in the mouth, throat, or esophagus.
Human cases of rabies due to non-bite exposures to rabies virus are
very rare. Scratches, abrasions, open wounds, and mucous membranes
contaminated with saliva or other potentially infectious material
(such as brain tissue) from a rabid animal constitute non-bite
exposures. Inhalation of aerosolized rabies virus is also a potential
non-bite route of exposure, but other than laboratory workers, most
people are unlikely to encounter aerosolized rabies virus.
There are no published studies that have demonstrated the presence of
rabies virus in cows' milk. Although transmission of rabies virus
from consuming unpasteurized milk from an infected animal is
theoretically possible, no human has ever been reported to develop
rabies via this route -- apart from the cases described in the
preceding report, that is. Milk that has been heat-pasteurized
presents no risk for rabies virus transmission. - Mod.CP]
