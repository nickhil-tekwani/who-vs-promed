Authorities have culled about 8000 chickens in a poultry farm in
China's eastern Shandong province after 400 chickens died there last
week, a Hong Kong newspaper reported on Tuesday [18 Apr 2006].
The South China Morning Post said the farmer, identified only by his
surname Chen, was ordered by officials not to talk about the cull as
"it was a state secret". He and his wife were given injections on
Sunday, but they did not know what they were for.
Over 400 chickens died at Chen's farm in Laixi city last week [maps at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/25/Laixi.html> and
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=36.854&lon=120.5342&scale=2000000&icon=x>].
The farmer reported the deaths on Saturday to the city's animal
husbandry bureau, which sent staff to collect samples of the dead
chickens on the same day.
But Chen said he was not told of any test results before about 30
workers dressed in protective garments moved in to kill and bury the
remainder of his chickens on Sunday.
The newspaper cited a Shandong Bird Flu Control Office official as
denying there was an outbreak of bird flu, saying authorities were
still determining the cause of the deaths.
The chicken deaths come as a deadly strain of the H5N1 avian flu
virus is spreading quickly around the world, with more than 30
countries reporting outbreaks of the disease. It has spread across
Asia, into parts of the Middle East, Africa and Europe since 2003.
Although only 194 people are known to have been infected so far and
109 of them have died, scientists fear the virus could mutate into a
form that jumps easily between people and trigger a global flu pandemic.

[According to OIE summarised data (see graph "Outbreaks of Avian
Influenza (subtype H5N1) in poultry from the end of 2003 to 31 Mar
2006", the world's 10 most affected countries (in brackets, number of
outbreaks) are: Viet Nam (2312), Thailand (1078), Indonesia (209),
Turkey (168), Russia (121), China (79), Nigeria (60), Romania (57),
Ukraine (22), and South Korea (19).
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Graph%20HPAI/graphs%20HPAI%2031_03_2006.pdf>
In view of the fact that China was the first H5N1-infected country,
while taking into consideration its size and its huge poultry
industry, China's reported figures seem strikingly low. According to
the FAO, China, with about 12 billion chickens and 3 billion domestic
waterfowl (ducks and geese), has the world's largest poultry
population, with 20 percent of the global total.
Details on the above reported suspected outbreak, particularly lab
tests results, will -- hopefully -- become available soon. - Mod.AS]

[2] WHO, evaluation of global situation

Thailand and Vietnam are doing "excellent work" preparing for a
possible bird flu pandemic, paying attention to the threat at the
highest levels but also helping local communities get ready, the
United Nations bird flu coordinator said on Monday [17 Apr 2006].
The U.S. government has been a strong leader, despite considerable
political risks -- not least the possibility of being accused of
crying wolf, Dr. David Nabarro said.
"I saw excellent work being done by Thailand," Nabarro told the World
Health Care Congress in Washington. "In the Thai case we have seen
the prime minister ask one of the deputy prime ministers to head an
inter-ministry group," Nabarro told the meeting of health care
representatives. "The high level of political attention is key." The
governor of each Thai province was given responsibility for preparing
for a possible pandemic, Nabarro said.
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread to 20 new countries in just
6 weeks, Nabarro said. "We think it probably went into Cote D'Ivoire,
or Ivory Coast, in the past few days," he said. [So far, the
outbreak in Ivory Coast remains to be confirmed; see further also
about suspected outbreaks in Sudan, Africa's largest country. - Mod.AS]
"It's a most extraordinarily rapid movement that we have seen," he
told the conference. The virus seems to be carried partly by the
poultry trade and partly by migrating birds, Nabarro said.
It mostly affects birds but it can occasionally infect humans. It has
been diagnosed in 194 people -- almost all had been in close contact
with infected birds -- and has killed 109 of them, according to the
World Health Organization. [These are WHO's official figures,
updated 12 Apr 2006].
Just a few mutations would give the virus the ability to pass easily
from human to human. This could spark a pandemic that could kill
millions in the space of a few months, and experts believe H5N1 is
closer to doing this than any strain of flu seen in more than 30 years.
The WHO has been urging countries to prepare relief personnel, ready
hospitals as best they can and educate people about basic hygiene
when handling poultry, Nabarro said.
The United States has prepared a comprehensive plan and held pandemic
"summits" in more than 40 states. The White House said on Monday that
an implementation plan is close to being presented to President
George W. Bush for his signature.
Thailand has run several exercises, Nabarro said. He said countries
like Thailand, which were hit by the devastating tsunami in 2004,
realized the importance of preparing for devastating emergencies.
Vietnam, he said, had mobilized 100 000 workers to vaccinate poultry
against the virus and assigned local government officials to be in
charge of preparations.
Thailand and Vietnam had also mobilized community groups and used
mass media to inform the public, Nabarro said.
He singled out Egypt, where the virus has spread to 12 people, as a
country not well prepared, saying, "Right now they have got a lot of
serious problems there."
The virus has killed 3 people in Egypt so far, WHO says. The country
has a weak public health and veterinary system, it is likely the
virus could spread easily in birds without being detected, experts
have said. [WHO's update on the situation in Egypt is available at
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_04_13/en/index.html>. In the
meantime, the media reported a 4th death but this has not yet been
included in WHO statistics. - Mod.AS]

[3] Sudan, suspected

Cases of bird flu have been found in the capital Khartoum and nearby
Jazeera state, an official of the Sudanese Ministry of Animal
Resources announced on Tuesday [18 Apr 2006].
"Laboratorial tests have confirmed the existence of bird flu cases in
Khartoum and Jazeera," Ahammed Mustafa, undersecretary of the
ministry, told reporters.
Both Khartoum and Jazeera are known for large-scale agricultural and
animal enterprises in the largest African country. [Map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/sudan.pdf>; both
Khartoum and Jazeera (Gezira) are located along the Nile river, at
mid-north Sudan. - Mod.AS]

[As long as no lab confirmation is available, the status of H5N1 in
Sudan has to be regarded as "suspected". However, it will be
surprising if the disease is absent from Sudan, a country where human
infections might occur as well. If confirmed, the question might be
whether it has been introduced before or after its detection (in
February 2006) in Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbour, situated on the
same Eastern Mediterranean major bird flyway. More crucial: Is the
virus also present in the Horn of Africa and Eastern Africa? - Mod.AS]
