A 32-year-old Pakistani, who had been working as a driver in Saudi
Arabia, returned to Islamabad on Friday [9 Oct 2009] with symptoms of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The patient, who had been
under treatment in a private hospital in Saudi Arabia, got himself
admitted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), where
he was driven straight from the Benazir Bhutto International Airport.

According to PIMS spokesman Dr. Waseem Khwaja, the patient is
suspected as suffering from CCHF and has been moved to the isolation
ward, where barrier nursing protocols are being strictly adhered to.
Relevant samples of the patient have been dispatched to the National
Institute of Health (NIH). "The patient is bleeding from the nose and
gums and has high fever and body rash," Dr. Waseem said, terming him
"critical."

An endemic tick-borne viral disease, CCHF is transferred to humans
through tick bite or through direct contact with blood or other
infected tissues from livestock infected with the virus. Symptoms
include fever, aching muscles, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness,
backache, headache, sore eyes and sensitivity to light. Other
clinical signs that may emerge include fast heart rate, dramatic drop
in platelet and white blood cell counts, bleeding from the upper
bowel, blood in the urine, nosebleeds, and bleeding from the gums.
The severely ill may develop liver and kidney failures after the 5th
day of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins
on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness.

[Although Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has not been
confirmed by laboratory analysis, CCHF is treated frequently in
Pakistani hospitals, and it is likely that the preliminary diagnosis
will be confirmed.

Information on the likely place and time of exposure in Saudi Arabia
would be welcomed. In view of the critical condition of the patient,
there could be some risk of transmission of infection to the
patient's fellow travellers during transit from Saudi Arabia to
Pakistan if the patient was already hemorrhaging during that time. - Mod.CP]
