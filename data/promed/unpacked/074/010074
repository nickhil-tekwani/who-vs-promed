I am confused by the lack of some key information in your report on
hemorrhagic disease in Russia (Samara). You don't actually say which
hantavirus is causal here [at least to those of us who are not fluent
speakers of Russian, and the reference in the article as to the virus being
"transmitted by mice" is unclear also. Do we have gangs of rogue vampire
mice cruising the Russian steppes, or is exposure to dusts contaminated with
infective urine/feces the transmission route?
The reference to Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever is confusing, since it is
not clear if this virus is the agent here, but, if so, would the tick vector
not be
inactivated by weather at this late stage of the year?

[Sorry it wasnÂ´t clear. The hantavirus involved is Hantaan virus -- see
ref. (02) above.
Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is a nairovirus, not a
hantavirus, & was *not* involved in Samara. But since both cause
hemorrhagic fevers & the symptoms are similar, the population connected the
two outbreaks in their minds.
You are correct; hantaviruses are transmitted by exposure to dusts
contaminated with infective urine or feces, whereas CCHF virus is
transmitted by ticks, which would not be active in the cold season. -
