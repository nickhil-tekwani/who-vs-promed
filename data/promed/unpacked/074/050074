[1] Liberia: UNICEF SitRep No. 25

Update on Ebola outbreak No. 2*
-------------------------------
Since the last SitRep [No. 24, 17 Jun 2014], 4 new suspected cases were reported in Foya, Lofa County [Liberia]. Samples were taken from all 4 patients and were sent to the lab in Gueckedou, Guinea, for testing.

The total number of suspected, probable and confirmed EVD cases reported during the 2nd outbreak now stands at 26, including 18 cases in Lofa County and 8 cases in Montserrado County. The exact breakdown of cases is as follows:
- 8 suspected cases, all from Lofa County;
- 6 probable cases, including 2 from Lofa County and 4 from Montserrado County;
- 12 confirmed cases, including 8 from Lofa County and 4 from Montserrado County.

The total number of Ebola-related deaths still stands at 16, including 8 of the 18 patients in Lofa County and all 8 patients in Montserrado County. The latter includes the 1st child fatality connected to Ebola in Liberia.

The case fatality rate for this outbreak is over 60 per cent (16/26 cases). This includes deaths in 8/12 confirmed cases and all 6 probable cases.

The cumulative number of Ebola cases from both the 1st and 2nd outbreaks is being reviewed, as some cases from the 1st outbreak appear to have been discarded out upon deeper analysis.

Foya, Lofa County, and New Kru Town, Montserrado County, remain the epicentres of this EVD outbreak.

*The index patient for Outbreak No. 2 was admitted into Foya Borma Hospital in Lofa County on 23 May [2014], but her case was not officially reported by the MoHSW [Ministry of Health and Social Welfare] until 29 May [2014]. The Ministry is therefore considering 29 May [2014] its starting point for tracking the 2nd outbreak. Similarly, the 1st confirmed case of Ebola in Montserrado County was reported in New Kru Town on 12 Jun [2014], although the onset of symptoms in the patient likely predated this. Unless otherwise stated, all figures reflect totals for the 2nd outbreak of Ebola, which began on 29 May [2014].

[2] Liberia: hospital closure
Date: Wed 18 Jun 2014
Source: AllAfrica, FrontPageAfrica report [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201406181674.html


"It was unfortunate; a nurse died from Ebola. She came down with the virus, we do not know where it came from, but you know Liberia has been having cases of Ebola," said Dominic W. Rennie, Administrator, Redemption Hospital, New Kru Town, Monrovia. On a sunny Tuesday afternoon [17 Jun 2014] the scene at a normally busy Redemption Hospital is eerie and quiet, the patient waiting area is empty and the drop of a pin can easily be heard. The hospital seems like a church during weekdays where the congregation only gathers on Sundays.

Though not officially shut down, the hospital is not taking patients, and many of the nurses and health workers cannot be found at the facility. FrontPageAfrica [FPA] later learned from a reliable source at the hospital that many of the nurses decided to boycott work due to fear for their lives, as a result of the death of a nurse last weekend [14-15 Jun 2014] who worked at the facility.

"The nurses did not come today because of the other nurse's death from Ebola. Even I did not come for 2 days because I was afraid," said the source that cautioned FPA reporters not to touch anything [and to] be careful how they move about the hospital.

A resident of Jamaica Road who came to seek medical treatment at the hospital, which is the only government referral hospital in the area, was turned away after the woman accompanying him told the security guard at the entrance of the facility that she had brought him for urgent medical attention as he could hardly stand.

"The hospital closed, we not accepting patients here. All the nurses gone home," said the guard who barricaded himself behind the small entrance that looked like an iron cage. The man, who could hardly walk, struggled to sit near the entrance of the facility; after hearing what the security guard said, his jaw dropped and he did not know what to say or do. "I only came here to treat myself, but the security at the gate did not allow me to enter, and this is the 1st time for this thing to happen to me since I have been taking treatment here," he said in frustration. The patient, who said he had nowhere else to go, as he had already come a far distance from where he lived, said people in his community had been talking about EVD [Ebola virus disease] in New Kru Town but he was confused about it.

"I do not know whether it is the Ebola or not because the people at Redemption are not telling us why we should not enter the hospital. I [have] been there about 3 times and they cannot allow me in," he said. "I have been hearing about this Ebola business from people in my community, that it is in New Kru Town; but I do not know where they are getting this story from, I do not know whether people are leaving New Kru Town."

Tackling the Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa: why we need a holistic approach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immediate medical action is not enough to manage the disease. We need cross-sector collaboration and integrated research.

As the death toll from Ebola virus disease [EVD] in West Africa continues to rise, there is a growing awareness of the threat of diseases transmitted from animals to people. EVD, a hemorrhagic fever that causes uncontrolled bleeding, is dramatic in its manifestation and has a case fatality rate of up to 90 percent. Its emergence can be sudden and unexplained and, as the recent crisis shows, it can spread across communities and borders with alarming speed.

What the outbreak confirms is that if animal transmitted diseases such as EVD -- known as zoonoses -- are to be tackled effectively, the response must go beyond media focus and immediate medical action when an epidemic hits. There is a crucial need for multidisciplinary working over the longer term to gain a holistic understanding of the causes of these diseases.

This so-called One Health approach takes as its premise an understanding that human health, animal health and environmental health are all interlinked. It calls for collaborative efforts between natural and social scientists -- including doctors, veterinarians, environmental scientists, geographers and anthropologists -- at local, national and international levels.

Such a holistic understanding of health is not new. It is, however, increasingly gaining traction among those in the field, with the veterinary sector proving to be particularly quick to recognise the benefits of One Health. A recent joint research initiative from the Department for International Development (DfID) and the social science, natural environment, medical and bioscience research councils, recognises the benefits of the approach. It aims to fund multidisciplinary research that would, among other benefits, reduce the impact of zoonoses on vulnerable people and their livestock.

When natural and social scientists work together -- not just alongside each other, but meaningfully integrate their findings -- it can be very productive. However, breaking down the barriers between researchers is one thing. The real challenge is to persuade those with the funds and the power to make cross-sector action happen. One of the issues that urgently needs to be tackled is a reconsideration of funding models to help facilitate cross-sector working.

Over the past 40 years, more than 60 percent of emerging infectious diseases affecting people have had their origin in wildlife or livestock. Many of these zoonoses may cause death more slowly than Ebola, and remain unnoticed by anybody outside the immediate populations affected by them, but their effects are often devastating.

Trypanosomiasis is fatal when left untreated, and even when it is, it has a prolonged recovery period. As a result, it can ruin lives and livelihoods. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation says the disease probably threatens rural development and poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa more than any other disease.

Like EVD, a multidisciplinary approach to understanding trypanosomiasis is essential if it is to be controlled. Take Zambia, where trypanosomiasis has historically acted as a limitation on human settlement, with families keeping away from fertile but highly tsetse-infested areas. Land pressure is increasingly leading to colonisation of these areas. Land clearance for cash crops such as cotton is also thought to be having an effect on tsetse populations, and thus the spread of the disease.

In addition, there are likely to be social differences in vulnerability to trypanosomiasis, based on gender roles, livelihood patterns and the different ways in which people interact with their environment. These points are aside from other, 'macro' changes, such as climate change and urbanisation, which may be having an effect on tsetse ecology and disease transmission. Thus, it can easily be seen how medical research on its own is insufficient to understand and tackle the disease.

The stories behind a host of other zoonoses -- from Rift Valley fever to Ebola virus disease -- are just as complex. Only multidisciplinary research can help to reveal and unravel their complexity. Without a holistic understanding of all the inter-related factors affecting the emergence, transmission and spread of zoonoses, disease management or elimination will remain beyond our reach.

[This call for a One Health approach in tackling EVD is very timely, and reflected by WHO, which sent anthropologists earlier this month (June 2014) into the field to help with public communication.

To put EVD case numbers in perspective, malaria is the number one public health problem in Guinea. According to national health statistics, the morbidity rate for malaria is 148/1000 population (http://www.pmi.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/malaria-operational-plans/fy14/guinea_mop_fy14.pdf?sfvrsn=8) or 74 000 cases per year resulting in over 1000 deaths (based on an estimated number of deaths of 8.5/100 000 population (estimated population of Guinea in 2013 = 11 million) (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_gin_en.pdf).

There is an up-to-date map of the geographical spread of EVD in West Africa at http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/06/ebola-outbreak-spreads-as-toll-reaches-337-201461822534324796.html. - Mod.JW
