Treatment of affected animals: no.
Other details/comments:
Magaria district is situated 1000 km from Niamey. It is adjacent to the border
with the State of Kano, in Nigeria, where the presence of the virus H5N1 was
confirmed on 7 Feb 2006.
Since confirmation of the outbreak in Nigeria, the government of Niger has
been carrying out a vast awareness campaign in all regions of the country. All
the relevant sanitary measures are currently being implemented, with the help
of the country's development partners (FAO(1), WHO(2), AU-IBAR(3), OIE). An
Interministerial Committee on avian influenza control has been in place since
October 2005. A 12-month contingency plan has been prepared and has been
submitted to the development partners.

(2) WHO: World Health Organization
(3) AU-IBAR: African Union - Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources
[This report lists the affected species to be backyard poultry, but the
species tested in the OIE reference lab in Padua was ducks. Maybe something
is lost in translation, but such a discrepancy should be clarified given the
global importance of control of this disease in Niger. - Mod.PC]

[I am dividing up the OIE reports into domestic and wild bird postings this
week because of the volume. Furthermore, I am excluding a very long report
from Turkey which summarizes 39 outbreaks in 16 provinces, many of which have
come to an end. For details, please see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_29.HTM#Sec3>.
Stepping back from the large number of OIE reports this week, the picture we
see is an ongoing pandemic of avian influenza in domestic species worldwide in
addition to the reports in wild birds in Europe.�
First, we have confirmed reports of H5N1 in domestic species including
backyard poultry, commercial poultry and backyard chickens, geese and perhaps
ducks (see Mod. comment on Niger, poultry above). Second, as indicated from
the reports from Romania and others including Turkey, outbreaks in commercial
poultry continue. We hope that the turkeys infected in France are an
exception but we won't know that for a few weeks.
Are we developing the same 'patchwork but endemic' situation with periodic
outbreaks in poultry as is now the case in Southeast Asia? The situation in
Africa is of particular concern in this regard. There is no new Nigerian
update, but reports in the press and otherwise indicate continuing spread, and
it appears as if the same situation may be occurring in Egypt. Ongoing reports
in Romania, Turkey, and Russia do not indicate progress in stamping out this
disease -- in fact they indicate the opposite.�
The bottom line here is that this disease is becoming endemic in significant
and widespread poultry populations outside of Southeast Asia. Furthermore, we
should not forget the significant economic effects, which range from severe
slumps in commercial markets in Europe and elsewhere to real threats of
starvation in Niger. Every once in a while, it is useful to summarize in
words, not in numbers. - Mod.PC]
