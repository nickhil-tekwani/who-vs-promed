[2] Study suggests existing RT-PCR assays can detect Ebola virus in semen
Date: Sat 19 Sep 2015

https://www.genomeweb.com/pcr/study-suggests-existing-rt-pcr-assays-can-detect-ebola-virus-semen?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&u


A study by investigators from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases suggests that existing RT-PCR assays can pick up the presence of Ebola virus in semen samples from survivors who are otherwise deemed disease-free. In the Journal of Infectious Diseases this week the researchers reported how they spiked half a dozen semen samples and half a dozen whole-blood samples with serial dilutions of EBOV. They then looked at whether the virus could be detected using RT-PCR-based assays that are already being using with Emergency Use Authorization for finding EBOV in whole-blood or plasma samples.

The team found EBOV RNA in the semen samples using the TaqMan EZ-1 real-time RT-PCR assay -- originally designed to detect the Ebola Zaire virus -- and the Minor Groove Binding (MGB) quantitative RT-PCR assay, suggesting such tests may be useful for identifying individuals who may be at risk of unwittingly passing on the virus.

"The assumption that performance of these assays is the same for spiked versus authentic samples is reasonable but should be monitored in the field," corresponding author Peter Jahrling, who is with NIAID's integrated research facility division of clinical research, and his colleagues wrote.

"This study now opens the door to test semen from EBOV survivors for the presence of residual viral RNA," they explained, "as well as to facilitate epidemiological investigations to rapidly identify sources of new cases as well as potential at-risk contacts."

[3] Liberia: PREVAIL launches Ebola natural history study at C. H Rennie hospital
Date: Tue 15 Sep 2015
Source: AllAfrica [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201509151992.html


The Liberia-United States Joint Clinical Research Partnership, known as PREVAIL, today launched the Ebola Natural History Study at the C. H. Rennie Hospital in Kakata, Margibi County. The C. H. Rennie Hospital is the 3rd facility to join the study nearly 4 months after it began at the JFK Medical Center and the Duport Road Health Center on [17 Jun 2015] and [22 Jul 2015], respectively.

The Hospital will enroll [Ebola virus disease, EVD] survivors into the study from nearby counties, including Grand Bassa and Bong Counties, while plans are being made to open additional sites in Liberia, including the Phebe Hospital in Bong County, which will accommodate survivors from Lofa, Nimba and Grand Bassa Counties.

The study [PREVAIL III] will investigate the variety of health problems faced by people who have survived EVD and provide participants with referrals to other healthcare facilities in Liberia that have been designated by the Ministry of Health. The study also will help to determine whether people who survived Ebola are immune or protected from getting EVD in the future. In addition, the researchers will examine whether those who survived Ebola can transmit infection to their household contacts or sexual partners.

[4] After Ebola, Africans shun herbal medicines
Date: Sat 19 Sep 2015
Source: USA Today [edited]
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/09/19/after-ebola-africans-shun-herbal-medicines/72415924


Bauyuku Mansaray used to believe in the healing powers of herbs, but not after the Ebola crisis. Traditional medicines couldn't stop the deadly virus from killing 50 people -- 1/3 of the population -- in Kumala, Mansaray's small village in the north. "I used to believe that Ebola was something that can be cured by our herbalists here," said Mansaray, 50, a farmer. "But when I saw what Ebola did in Kumala village ... I changed my thought all together." He said the victims included 1 of the herbalists and his wife, a secret society chief.

Secret societies that preserve ancient African traditions have been a pillar of Sierra Leone's culture, but are losing credibility because doctors have convinced people like Mansaray that modern medicine, not ancient rites, will conquer Ebola. The shift is an example of how Ebola has changed Sierra Leone, which continues to record new cases -- 5 in the week through [13 Sep 2015], according to the World Health Organization. About 13 800 people in the country have been afflicted with the virus since the crisis began in March 2014, and nearly 4000 have died, according to WHO's latest figures.

Abandoning traditional African beliefs about healing methods could be the most radical social shift wrought by the virus. Herbalist Pa Musa Magba, 60, has converted his plot of herbs into a vegetable garden in the northern village of Diang. "I have destroyed all my herbalist instruments because I don't want to be tempted to treat any sick patients," said Magba, who added that the herbalists' union, the Association of Traditional Healers, has urged an end to traditional practices until Ebola is vanquished.

Sidie Tunis, communications director for Sierra Leone's National Ebola Response Center [NERC], said the shift in the religious leaders' views has been instrumental in combating the scourge. "We are happy that religious leaders who were very reluctant have now joined us in the fight," said Tunis. "They now realize that the disease has nothing to do with religion or tradition, that it's a virus which can only be controlled by accepted health practices. This is making a big impact because people listen to them a lot."

17 Sep 2015: Sierra Leone announces USD 1000 reward for information on Ebola suspect
http://en.starafrica.com/news/sierra-leone-announces-1000-reward-for-information-on-ebola-suspect.html
[Sierra Leone's National Ebola Response Centre (NERC) has said that any person with information that leads to the apprehension of an [Ebola virus disease, EVD] suspect in hiding since last month [August 2015] will be rewarded with the equivalent of USD 1000 in Sierra Leonean currency (SLL, or Sierra Leone leone 5 million), The NERC said in a statement on Wed [16 Sep 2015] that it was concerned because "Despite our efforts and the support of the Sierra Leone police, Kadiatu Sinneh Kamara, a 32-year-old niece of the index EVD case recorded on 28 Aug 2015, is still [unaccounted] for." She was niece of the 67-year-old woman who died in the Kambia district and was confirmed EVD-positive. More than 900 people were quarantined in the village of Sella Kafta where the incident occurred. According to the NERC, Kadiatu is a primary contact who was on a visit to her village when her aunt fell ill. "NERC wishes to emphasize that Kadiatu is not a criminal. It is very likely that she is scared, confused and maybe sick. It is also possible that she does not understand how vital she is to the response and in breaking the chain of Ebola transmission," the center said.]

<http://en.starafrica.com/news/press-focuses-on-risk-of-flooding-non-registration-of-births-during-ebola-outbreak.html
[Nearly a week of incessant rainfall in the capital Monrovia and its environs has rendered hundreds of residents homeless in the northern suburb of Somalia Drive, including Gardnersville and Samuel Doe Community as well as Bushrod Island in western Monrovia, among others. The report said that the flood waters on roads occasioned by lack of drainage have made them impassable, causing traffic jams in almost all parts of the capital. Due to the rejection of pregnant women by health workers during the Ebola outbreak in the country, many women delivered their babies at home. Health officials say because of that, tens of thousands of children in the country have not been officially registered... - more]

[Strides made in building systems to collect data on infectious diseases and track outbreaks will only endure with long-term commitment, said Athalia Christie, the deputy for global health at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. She told a panel that such systems had to be created from scratch in Ebola-affected countries. "I'm extremely concerned, even after a year-plus of this activity, [whether] this is something we're going to be able to maintain and, frankly, build upon," Christie said on 10 Sep 2015 at the Global Disaster Relief Summit 2015 in Washington D.C., USA. "Every piece of the chain needs work." Christie mentioned challenges related to standardizing data collection, doing biomedical research, maintaining health information systems and setting up emergency operations. Maintaining momentum in these areas will be especially important as Ebola-affected nations such as Liberia now try to focus health efforts on other diseases, such as malaria and measles, she said. ... - more]

http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/ebola-drug-zmapp-gets-fda-fast-track-n429156
[ZMapp, an experimental drug being tested against Ebola, has won fast-track status to get quicker Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approval. The drug is being tested in Liberia, where there haven't been any cases of Ebola in months, as well as in Sierra Leone and Guinea. ZMapp is best known as the drug given to the 1st US Ebola patient, the medical missionary air-evacuated from Liberia for treatment in the USA. He survived, but doctors say they don't know whether ZMapp helped. The case created a clamor for the drug, but Mapp Biopharmaceuticals, the small, California-based company that makes it, didn't have much on hand and it was slow stepping up demand so it could be tested. Now the company is testing the drug in Liberia, where there have been no new cases since July [2015], and in Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Only 5 cases were confirmed in the last week, all of them in Sierra Leone. "Guinea recorded its 1st Ebola-free week in over 12 months," WHO said. That makes it difficult to test ZMapp... - more]
