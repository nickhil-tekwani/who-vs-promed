[1] BTV-8 in Belgium, whole country declared restriction zone

Following a detection of bluetongue [BT] in a cattle farm near Paliseul (Luxembourg province), the FASFC has organized an increased monitoring plan for this outbreak. The 1st results of this increased surveillance have confirmed the presence of the disease in Belgium. The country is now classified as a "restricted zone." This disease, which already occurs in various European countries (e.g., France, Germany, Cyprus), is not contagious to humans and is not transmitted to humans. It also does not pose any risk to public health. Finally, it is not necessary to slaughter animals due to their infection with the virus.

During the winter screening by the FASFC, the agency determined the presence of the bluetongue serotype-8 virus in some animals from a farm in Paliseul. The FASFC has therefore introduced a stricter monitoring plan in all cattle and sheep farms within a radius of 5 km [3.1 mi] around the infected farm to check whether the virus has actually circulated. Initial results have revealed additional infected animals at 4 other livestock farms around Paliseul for the time being. The whole of Belgium is now a "restricted zone."

The virus can only be transmitted through infected vectors (culicoids; these are small flying insects), not through contact between ruminants. It is also not transmitted to humans and does not present any risks to public health.

From 28 Mar 2019 the FASFC will apply all [BT-related] measures provided for in European legislation. Conditions apply for the intra-community movement of animals, and the FASFC will certify only animals that meet these conditions. In concrete terms, this means that there are no restrictions on the movement of ruminants on Belgian territory. Vaccination against serotype 8 is a possibility and remains highly recommended by the FASFC.

Updated outbreak assessment: Bluetongue virus (BTV-8) in Germany and Belgium
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since our last outbreak assessment on 21 Jan 2019, Germany has reported a further 22 outbreaks of BTV-8 in southwestern Germany, now totalling 52 outbreaks since 1 Dec 2018 [map at source URL]. These were identified as part of a surveillance programme in this region. Outbreaks in the southwestern regions along the borders with France and Switzerland were not unexpected, given the circulation in those countries in the past few months, but the more recent reports from Germany encroached on the Luxembourg, Belgian and Netherlands borders (https://www.fli.de/de/aktuelles/tierseuchengeschehen/blauzungenkrankheit/).

In a new development, 4 outbreaks of BTV-8 have been reported in southern Belgium in the Luxembourg region. Belgium had been declared officially free of BTV-8, after the 2006-2009 epizootic in northern Europe, in February 2012. The cases were detected as a result of winter surveillance and confirmed that virus circulation has occurred around this region.

Both Germany and Belgium have in place BTV-8 restriction zones [map at source URL]. Live ruminants (in particular cattle, sheep and goats) may be moved from these restriction zones to free areas (not under restriction for BTV-8) only if the animals have been vaccinated against BTV-8 at least 60 days prior to movement or vaccinated and tested for BT with a negative result in accordance with Annex III of European Commission Regulation 1266/2007/EC.

Situation assessment
1. Germany
The outbreaks since the previous outbreak assessment in January 2019 are all within the same Landers, and in this respect the virus does not appear to have spread further north or east within Germany since January 2019. Post-import testing is in place for consignments of ruminants entering the UK from the restriction zones.

2. Belgium
One outbreak of BTV-8 was detected on 14 Feb 2019 in a cattle holding (in 2 of 111 cattle) in the Luxembourg region of southern Belgium, as a result of winter surveillance. Following intensified surveillance in a 5-km [3.1-mi] area around the premises, disease was confirmed in 3 more holdings. This secondary spread was reported as being caused by vector transmission, although still early in the vector season for much of Europe.

3. France
Since October 2018, France has reported just 10 outbreaks to the European Animal Disease Notification System. These were in the regions of Vosges, Rhone, Cote d'Or, Puy de Dome and Loire. Of these, 8 were reported in cattle and 2 in sheep. Five of the outbreaks were reported as clinical cases. No cases of BTV-4 have been reported in this period.

Of note, an increase in transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in cattle in France has been reported. Since mid-December 2018, cases of calves born blind, small and dying at a few days of age have been reported in different departments in France [20190312.6363735]. These cases started to appear in mid-December 2018 with the number reported increasing considerably since January 2019. Positive PCR of blood and calves' spleen confirmed BTV-8 infection while tests for Schmallenberg virus were negative, suggesting these clinical signs were attributable to BTV-8. When tests were carried out on PCR-positive blood samples from calves (less than one week old and born during the vector inactivity season) in affected farms, 2% to 15% of newborn calves were infected. As of 11 Mar 2019, the national reference laboratory received and analysed 418 blood samples from such calves and 94% of these were positive for BTV-8 by RT-PCR.

The 2006/9 BTV-8 strain also showed some transplacental transmission and increased numbers of abortions and dummy calves were reported in Belgium by the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008. Vercauteren et al. [Transbound Emerg Dis 2008;55:293-8 https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2008.01034.x] described 29 cases of hydranencephaly (the complete absence of cerebral parenchyma) in bovine foetuses and calves in Belgium associated with the 2006/9 BTV-8 infection very early in gestation. However, the rate of transplacental transmission in the current re-emerging strain in France appears much higher than for the previous strain. Thus, with regards to the current re-emerging strain, it appears that the circulating virus strain causes fewer clinical signs in the adult cows but gives rise to more clinical problems in calf foetuses. This is consistent with the results of studies in adult sheep. Flannery et al. [Transbound Emerg Dis 2019 (Epub ahead of print) https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13131] reported that the re-emerging BTV-8 strain produced reduced viraemia and pathogenicity in infected sheep and showed reduced _Culicoides_ vector competence compared with the 2006/9 strain. This suggests a phenotypic difference between the 2006/9 BTV-8 strain and the re-emerging strain.

Transplacental transmission is of interest as a possible mechanism of overwintering of the virus in the absence of midges in northern Europe, but this increase also means the economic impact of BTV-8 may be underestimated.

Conclusion
We are now approaching the start of the _Culicoides_ biting midge vector season in northern Europe and the UK. In this respect, the month of March (and early April) presents a negligible risk of introduction of BTV-8 from the trade of cattle or sheep from northern Europe that have sufficient residual viraemia (from infection in late autumn 2018) to infect UK midges and hence infect UK cattle. However, given the Belgian and German cases suggest there is virus circulation occurring presently, by late April, some livestock may be sufficiently viraemic to infect UK midges if moved to the UK. The restriction zones currently in place across the whole of Belgium and France and parts of Germany will minimise risk of importation of infected cattle to the UK, and post-import testing is now applied to cattle from those unrestricted regions in the Netherlands and Luxembourg within 150 km [93 mi] of outbreaks. The risk of entry of BTV-8 to the UK is thus considered to be LOW for April and May [2019].

The role of increased transplacental transmission of the re-emerging BTV-8 strain in northern Europe in terms of an "overwintering" mechanism and risks of introduction from importing in-calf cattle needs to be kept under review. The 1266/2007 regulation requires cattle to be vaccinated prior to being serviced, and this should prevent transplacental transmission. However, given the spread that has occurred over the past few months, there may be cattle serviced in regions that were not under restriction at the time.

Livestock owners and field vets in the UK should note that the re-emerging BTV-8 strain in northern Europe may cause transplacental transmission and infection of foetuses in cattle and should consider BTV-8 as a possible cause of abortion or malformed calves, in addition to Schmallenberg virus. The weaker pathogenicity of the re-emerging strain of BTV-8 in adult sheep and cattle may result in fewer clinical signs (compared with the 2007 strain), so that infection may be missed.

We would like to remind all livestock owners that they should source animals responsibly by working with their private veterinarians and livestock dealers to make sure animals are correctly vaccinated and protected prior to travel. This means that animals must be correctly vaccinated against BTV-4 and BTV-8 or be naturally immune to both virus serotypes, prior to leaving the restriction zone.

We would also like to remind keepers that if they wish to take animals for show purposes to a restriction zone and then return to a free area, they will need to make sure the animals are vaccinated against both virus serotypes (BTV-4 and BTV-8) prior to travelling into the restriction zone.

We will continue to monitor the current situation in Germany, Belgium and France and will report any further updates from the relevant authorities.

[OIE's WAHIS global map addressing bluetongue outbreaks reported since 1 Nov 2018 will present the recent spread of BTV-8 in Germany, Switzerland, and (southern) Belgium, on top of its earlier circulation in France. Please go to https://tinyurl.com/y44s6v53, click on the eastern France/Bavaria cluster and zoom in.

The circulating BTV-8 strain is assumed to be similar to the one that had earlier re-emerged in France, signified by an increased rate of transplacental transmission, compared with the 2007 strain. As indicated in DEFRA's assessment, this virus strain is expected to cause fewer clinical signs in adult cows and more pathological changes/clinical problems in calf foetuses.

The recent re-emergence of BTV-8 in (western) Switzerland started in early October 2018; since then, 90 outbreaks have been reported (see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000029402_20190204_183442.pdf).

Cattle breeders and practitioners in the said and neighboring countries (e.g., Netherlands, Luxembourg) should be alert to such animal health hazard, and consider timely vaccination of cows against BTV-8 prior to their next pregnancies. - Mod.AS
