TRYPANOSOMIASIS - AFRICA
========================

A MILLION HOSTAGES

Hostages, not refugees but hostages. Perhaps a million
altogether. Yet the world is unaware of their presence, for they
are scattered in thousands of villages in the fields and forests
of central Africa. Sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) is their
prison, and they are held hostage there by conflicting forces in
the northern hemisphere.

In former centuries, sleeping sickness was the scourge of
much of Africa, killing millions of people. The disease is
caused by trypanosomes, microscopic parasites that infect blood,
lymph glands, and eventually the brain. Without treatment the
disease is fatal, but if treated in the early stages of the
infection, the cure rate surpasses 90%. The tse-tse fly is the
vector. The fly feeds on the blood of humans and cattle, and
carries the parasites from an infected person to a healthy one.

The colonial regimes in Africa engaged in highly successful
campaigns to control the disease and almost succeeded in
eradicating it. However, since the independence era of the
sixties, control measures have deteriorated or disappeared in
many African countries. Since 1990, the rate of infection has
risen ten-fold and now surpasses a million new cases per year.

But why call sleeping sickness victims "hostages?" There
are several reasons.

1. The principal medicine for treating it, discovered in the
1920s, is a drug called Melarsoprol of which arsenic is the
basic element. The arsenical molecule is manufactured in
Germany by the chemical firm Hoechst. Rhone Poulenc, a
French pharmaceutical company, purchases the molecule from
Hoechst to manufacture ampoules of Melarsoprol. This is an
expensive process requiring high standards of quality.
Sleeping sickness victims, however, are extremely poor and
cannot begin to pay for the medicine they need. They are
hostages to their poverty.

2. The pharmaceutical firm produces Melarsoprol at a loss and
cannot continue to do so with its own resources. No agency
is willing to provide the funds necessary to treat the
rapidly increasing number of dying Africans. So sleeping
sickness victims are hostages of neglect.

3. Furthermore, the residue from the production of the
arsenical molecule is toxic and could contaminate rivers and
subterranean waters. Environmentalists in Germany are
putting pressure on their government to ban the production
of the molecule. After all, Germans do not suffer from
sleeping sickness. Why should German waters be contaminated
to save Africans? So sleeping sickness victims are hostages
of environmentalists and geo-political groups.

4. Research for new medicines is done primarily by the
pharmaceutical industry and is very expensive. No European
firm is willing to invest millions of dollars is search of a
more effective and less toxic medicine to treat poor
Africans. So they are hostages of indifference.

5. At the moment, no Melarsoprol is available in central
Africa. The batch produced in January 1996 in France did
not pass quality control and was destroyed. The next batch
will be produced in March. If it passes quality control, it
will require up to 2 months to reach the hospitals and
clinics in Africa where it is needed. Sleeping sickness
victims are hostages of delay.

Last week in Nairobi, a group of physicians from several
African countries discussed this critical situation with Dr.
Felix Kuzoe, the WHO Coordinator of Research on African
Trypanosomiasis in the Special Program for Research and Training
in Tropical Diseases (TDR).
Dr. Kuzoe believes there are more than a million unreported cases
in countries like Angola, Zaire, and other central African
countries. One physician in northwest Zaire reports 500 new
cases per month and she has had no Melarsoprol since December
1995. Tears of frustration and anguish flowed freely when she
learned she could expect none before the end of April.

Not only will thousands die untreated, but the tse-tse fly
bites the untreated victims and carries the parasites to
thousands of healthy persons around them. So this is not a
simple case of holding current hostages. It is rather a rapidly
escalating taking of thousands and thousands of more hostages,
hostages to poverty, neglect, geo-politics, indifference and
delay. How long will the world stand idly by and permit this?
