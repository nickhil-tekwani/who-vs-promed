Mobile County [Alabama] Health Department Officials say since 1 Apr 2015, at least 200 people have been treated in Mobile County emergency rooms for serious health complications related to synthetic drugs typically identified with the street name "spice."

The Mobile County Health Department has been made aware of the high numbers in recent days from hospital officials, following an announcement by the Alabama Department of Public Health of an upsurge in the number of patients reporting to emergency rooms statewide from drug overdoses linked to products containing poison known as spice and a host of other names.

"The public must understand the overwhelming danger associated with spice and other poisonous substances like it," said Dr Bernard Eichold, Health Officer for Mobile County. "It's causing people to become seriously ill, including creating potential kidney damage in some.

Because of the risk to public health, Eichold said the Mobile County Health Department (MCHD) is considering civil litigation against stores and their owners who sell such products: "We fully support local law enforcement and federal agency efforts to prosecute those who possess and sell this product."

Last year, MCHD staff tracked spice-related emergency room [ER] visits. Between 11 Apr and 23 Apr 2014, Mobile hospitals reported 52 drug-related ER visits. One ER visit resulted in the death of a 60-year-old man who had taken spice, health officials said.

Also last year, a snapshot of drug-related ER visits taken between 1 May and 13 May [2014], showed that 44 people were treated at Mobile hospitals for issues related to illicit drugs. The ages of the patients ranged from 14 to 58 in May [2014], according to information provided by area hospitals.

[Marijuana contains THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. However, synthetic marijuana contains other ingredients and goes by a variety of names; among them are K2, spice, mexxy, black mamba, fake weed, Yucatan fire, skunk, moon rocks, and others.

Some of these synthetic compounds are promoted as herbal products, with label claims that they contain "natural" psychoactive material taken from a variety of plants. Spice products (and the others as well) may contain some dried plant material (not necessarily natural cannabis), but chemical analyses show that their active ingredients are synthetic (or designer) cannabinoid compounds. However, tests have shown that it is not a single product. For example, black mamba contains synthetic cannabinoid AM-2001 and oleamide, an oleic acid.

The synthetic cannabinoids are not THC, but the body reacts to them as if it were reacting to the cannabinoids in cannabis. However, the synthetic variety can cause long-term problems, including long-term psychotic disorders.

The variety of synthetic cannabinoids is large and apparently constantly shifting to avoid detection and regulation by law enforcement. Consequently, it also makes it much harder on the physicians to stabilize and treat an individual who has had an overdose, or even a reaction to a synthetic hallucinogen.

The UK and the US have regulated a number of these substances, including cannabicyclohexanol, JWH-018, JWH-073, or HU-210. These substances are illegal to possess or use and are considered banned substances with jail terms of varying lengths, depending upon which country's laws are examined.

These synthetic products produce a longer lasting response, potentially in some people unexpected psychotic episodes for the remainder of their life, and apparently can "hook" people within seconds, despite near-death experiences.

Some states in the US have legalized the use of natural cannabis products. Therefore, in an effort to extend the natural product, and produce a desirable and longer lasting "high," the synthetic product may be added to the natural product and unsuspecting customers may suffer untoward effects and even death.

The sad commentary is that more people are likely to try this potentially more lethal synthetic version believing it may be safer, which is based on hype, not reality.
