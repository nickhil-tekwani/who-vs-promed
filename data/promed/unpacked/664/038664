The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [10 Jul 2014] a laboratory confirmed case of tularemia in a 65-year-old woman from Bernalillo County.

The cause of the woman's illness was confirmed at the Department's Scientific Laboratory Division. The woman was hospitalized but has recovered and gone home. "We will be following up with a case investigation later this week in an effort to prevent future infections," says Dr. Paul Smith, Urban Biology Division manager for the City of Albuquerque's Environmental Health Department.

There have also been 7 pet cases of tularemia in 2014, 4 dogs and 3 cats from Santa Fe, Bernalillo, and Los Alamos counties.

"Tularemia can cause serious illness in both people and pets, so I would encourage people around the state to follow precautions similar to reducing risk to plague," said Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Retta Ward, MPH. "Don't handle sick or dead rodents; don't allow pets to roam and hunt; get an appropriate tick and flea control product for pets, and take sick pets to a veterinarian. Since tularemia can be fatal in a small percentage of cases, it should be treated with antibiotics following an evaluation by a physician."

Tularemia is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits and hares. Tularemia can also make dogs and cats sick, and they can give the disease to people. Symptoms of tularemia in people usually develop 3 to 5 days after exposure, but onset can vary from 1-14 days.

Tularemia symptoms are similar to plague infection, including sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscle aches and joint pain. Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria, and can include pneumonia and chest pain, ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.

"Many areas of the state have seen a large increase in the rabbit population this year [2014], and now some of those rabbits are getting sick and dying from both tularemia and plague," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. "Oftentimes, there is a rabbit or rodent die off in an area due to tularemia, and deer flies or ticks can become infected from these animals and then pass it on to pets or people when they bite them."

People can get tularemia in different ways: handling infected animal carcasses; being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect; eating or drinking contaminated food or water or by breathing in the bacteria. Dogs and cats are usually exposed to tularemia when they are allowed to roam and hunt sick rodents and rabbits or when bitten by an infected tick.

In 2013, there were 4 human cases of tularemia identified in New Mexico, a 45-year-old man from Santa Fe County, an 88-year-old woman from McKinley County, a 62-year-old woman from Santa Fe County, and a 75-year-old woman from San Juan County. Three of the human cases were hospitalized, and all recovered.

[The manifestations of _Francisella tularensis_ infection and the potential source of the infection are not stated.

Tularemia is caused by _F. tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States, an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.

_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.

Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.

The clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness.

The number of reported cases of tularemia in the USA as reported by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/year.html) has dropped from over 900 cases in 1950 to about 100 cases per year over the past 2 decades, although in the early 1980s, there was a several-year blip of numbers around 300.

State-specific statistics from CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/state.html) for 2001-2010 report a total of 55 cases from New Mexico for an average of 2.2 per year. The highest number in a year was 7. During the decade 2003-2012, the states with the most cases were Missouri (236), Arkansas (198), and Oklahoma (123). - Mod.LL
