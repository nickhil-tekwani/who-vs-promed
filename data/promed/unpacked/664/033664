Potentially deadly eastern equine encephalitis found in horse in
Massena
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A confirmed case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been found
in a horse in Massena, according to the New York State Department of
Health. The St Lawrence County Public Health Department was notified,
and the horse was euthanized on 22 Aug 2011.

Although the EEE virus is rare, it is one of the most serious
mosquitoborne diseases. About a third of people infected with the
virus die. Most survivors suffer significant brain damage. An Oswego
County resident died of EEE about 2 weeks ago. St Lawrence County
public health director Susan J Hathaway advises people to take steps
to reduce their chances of being exposed to mosquitoborne viruses.

People should avoid areas where mosquitoes concentrate and limit
outside activity between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most
active, Hathaway says. There is no need to spray in St Lawrence County
as mosquito populations are much lower than they were last year [2010]
at this time because of this summer's dry weather. [Hurricane Irene
may have changed that statement now. - Mod.TG]

Other precautions recommended by public health include:
- wear shoes, socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when
outdoors for long periods of time and at dawn and dusk;
- use mosquito repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of
lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing;
- repair or replace broken screens in doors and windows;
- empty pails, swimming pool covers, flower pots, and other containers
of standing water around the home and yard to eliminate mosquito
breeding grounds;
- change water in water troughs at least twice a week to discourage
mosquito breeding.

EEE is a rare but serious viral disease spread by mosquitoes that can
affect people and horses. EEE can also cause disease in captive birds
such as the ring-necked pheasant, quail, and ducks. EEE infection and
disease can occasionally occur in other livestock, deer, dogs, and a
variety of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.

Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on infected birds. Infected
mosquitoes will then occasionally feed on horses, humans, and other
mammals. The virus that causes EEE is spread only by mosquitoes.
People and horses do not directly spread the disease to horses or
people.

People of all ages are at risk for infection with the EEE virus but
individuals over age 50, and younger than age 15, are at greatest risk
for developing severe disease.

There is no specific treatment for EEE. Antibiotics are not effective
against viruses, and no effective anti-viral drugs have been
discovered for the treatment of EEE. There is no human vaccine for
EEE. The best way to protect yourself is to keep mosquitoes from
biting you.

EEE virus vaccine is available for horses. Public Health recommends
that, in consultation with a veterinarian, owners vaccinate their
horses against this virus.

[Eastern equine encephalitis or EEE is transmitted by mosquitoes. The
disease affects, horses, birds, and camelids (llamas and alpacas), but
a horse or other animal acquiring the disease cannot transmit it to
humans. The mosquito is the vector.

Horse owners should be reminded to vaccinate their animals. EEE
vaccine is often combined with West Nile virus, another potentially
deadly threat to horses, humans, and other animals from the mosquito.
