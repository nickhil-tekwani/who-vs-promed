Some animal workers in southern China [Guangdong province], home of the 1st H10N8 avian flu infections, may have had asymptomatic or subclinical infections with the strain even before the 1st human case was recognized in November 2013, so surveillance should continue in this population as well as in healthcare workers, say the authors of a study today [27 Oct 2014] in BMC Medicine.

The researchers, from Guangzhou [Guangdong province], China, and Durham, North Carolina [USA], retrospectively studied archived serum samples from 720 animal workers and 107 non-animal workers from May through August 2013 during a surveillance program for novel zoonotic flu in occupationally exposed individuals.

Samples were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay; those with positive reactivity to H10N8 (defined as titer greater than 1:20) were further tested by microneutralization (MN) assay. Questionnaires given by the animal workers regarding risk factors for H10N8 were also evaluated.

Of the 827 samples, 21 (2.5 percent) tested positive, 3 with titers of 1:40. None of those who tested positive had flu symptoms during the 3 months before sampling was done. Of the 3 people with the higher titers, 2 had MN antibody titers of 1:40, evidence of possible previous H10N8 infection, and 1 had a titer of 1:80, indicative of a probable previous infection. All 3 were animal workers.

H10N8 virus was 1st identified in a duck in Guangdong province during 2012; the authors say the virus infected dogs in the area as well. They point out that the Guangdong province has been a hotbed of novel influenza virus generation, including the H7N9 strain that is the source of an ongoing outbreak that began in 2013 and has caused more than 450 cases.

The same group found serological evidence of H10N8 in feral dogs:

For pandemic influenza to occur, the strain must be new to humans without a vaccine available (true for H10N8), cause significant disease in people (true for H10N8), and, finally, be able to cause prolonged person-to-person spread, which has not occurred for H10N8, H7N9, or H5N1. Like the Meatloaf song, "Two out of three ain't bad." Indeed, 2 out of 3, for epidemic potential, is good (for humans)!

When the next pandemic strain of influenza A will emerge remains uncertain, but the pandemic influenza clock is ticking; we just do not know what time it is. - Mod.LL
