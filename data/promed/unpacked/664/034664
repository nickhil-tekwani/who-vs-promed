[One of my fellow moderators, MHJ, just returned from the IMED conference
in Vienna, where species variability in response to influenza virus
infection among birds was discussed. He reminded me that there is a great
deal of variation in how birds respond to the virus. In the case reported
here, with mixed chicken and poultry populations, it would be worthwhile
establishing the prevalence by species on the outbreak farm. - Mod.PC]
