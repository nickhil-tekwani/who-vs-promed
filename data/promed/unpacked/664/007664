[1] ECMO cohort study
Date: Mon 28 Sep 2020

Most patients who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe COVID-19 survive, according to an international registry.

Estimated 90-day in-hospital mortality was 37.4%, and mortality among those who completed their hospitalization (final disposition of death or discharge) was 39%.

"These data from 213 hospitals worldwide provide a generalizable estimate of ECMO mortality in the setting of COVID-19," wrote Ryan Barbaro, MD, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and colleagues reporting the findings in The Lancet. The data were also presented at the virtual Extracorporeal Life Support Organization meeting.

Early reports of ECMO use in COVID-19 suggested that mortality could be greater than 90%, leading some to recommend withholding it, the group noted. More recent reports have suggested higher success rates, albeit with small numbers.

"Considering the severity of hypoxemia in patients requiring ECMO, I'm intrigued by noting that at least 40% (if probably not more) had some reasonable recovery," commented Behnood Bikdeli, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard in Boston.

The findings were "consistent with previously reported survival rates in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, supporting current recommendations that centres experienced in ECMO should consider its use in refractory COVID-19-related respiratory failure," the researchers concluded.

However, there was no comparator data for outcomes in a similar cohort of patients who did not undergo ECMO, Bikdeli noted. "Such an analysis likely requires a 2nd data source, and exclusion of some patients (sickest of the sick) but could be informative."

The study included 1035 patients age 16 years and older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between [16 Jan 2020] and [1 May 2020], at 213 hospitals in 36 countries, as recorded in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry.

The median age of these patients was 49, most were men (74%), and 70% had been treated elsewhere before being transferred to the registry-participating hospital (47% of these had ECMO initiated before transfer).

Patients' status at data cutoff was 6% still hospitalized, 30% discharged home or to an acute rehabilitation center, 10% discharged to a long-term acute care center or to an unspecified location, 17% transferred to another hospital, and 37% deceased.

Fully 94% of the patients got venovenous ECMO support. Venovenous ECMO for acute respiratory distress syndrome patients had an estimated 90-day in-hospital mortality rate of 38.0%.

Independent predictors of mortality in ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 were: age, immunocompromised state, chronic respiratory disease, pre-ECMO cardiac arrest, degree of hypoxemia, presence of acute kidney injury, and use of ECMO for temporary circulatory support (venoarterial rather than venovenous ECMO support).

"Strengths of this study include the breadth of international participation and its use of experienced and trained Extracorporeal Life Support Organization site data managers to collect data," the researchers wrote. Also, the time-to-event analysis accounted for potential bias when not all patients have reached final disposition.

Limitations included the "self-selected" experienced centers that participated in the registry, which may not be generalizable to those inexperienced with ECMO. Also, the outcome 90 days after ECMO initiation was unknown for patients discharged to home or to an acute rehabilitation center, long-term acute center, or another hospital. But, the researchers noted, for patients who survived to hospital day 40 or beyond and remained there, "estimated in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 14.1%."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
"Background
"Multiple major health organisations recommend the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support for COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. However, initial reports of ECMO use in patients with COVID-19 described very high mortality and there have been no large, international cohort studies of ECMO for COVID-19 reported to date.

"Methods
"We used data from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry to characterise the epidemiology, hospital course, and outcomes of patients aged 16 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 who had ECMO support initiated between [16 Jan and 1 May 2020], at 213 hospitals in 36 countries. The primary outcome was in-hospital death in a time-to-event analysis assessed at 90 days after ECMO initiation. We applied a multivariable Cox model to examine whether patient and hospital factors were associated with in-hospital mortality.

"Findings
"Data for 1035 patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO support were included in this study. Of these, 67 (6%) remained hospitalised, 311 (30%) were discharged to home or to an acute rehabilitation centre, 101 (10%) were discharged to a long-term acute care centre or unspecified location, 176 (17%) were discharged to another hospital, and 380 (37%) died. The estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 37.4% (95% CI 34.4-40.4). Mortality was 39% (380 of 968) in patients with a final disposition of death or hospital discharge. The use of ECMO for circulatory support was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio 1.89, 95% CI 1.20-2.97). In the subset of patients with COVID-19 receiving respiratory (venovenous) ECMO and characterised as having acute respiratory distress syndrome, the estimated cumulative incidence of in-hospital mortality 90 days after the initiation of ECMO was 38.0% (95% CI 34.6-41.5).

"Interpretation
"In patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO, both estimated mortality 90 days after ECMO and mortality in those with a final disposition of death or discharge were less than 40%. These data from 213 hospitals worldwide provide a generalisable estimate of ECMO mortality in the setting of COVID-19."

This is a welcome follow-up to earlier reports of almost 100% mortality in patients supported with ECMO (Henry BM, Lippi G. Poor survival with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Pooled analysis of early reports. J Crit Care. 2020; 58:27-28. doi: 10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.03.011. Epub 2020 Apr 1. PMID: 32279018; PMCID: PMC7118619; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944120305426). This study goes through the beginning of May 2020. An interesting follow up would be the number of patients requiring ECMO after treatment with dexamethasone and the subsequent mortality. - Mod.MPP]

[2] USA: Prevalence of antibodies, dialysis patients
Date: Tue 29 Sep 2020

ref: Anand S, Montez-Rath M, Han J, Bozeman J, Kerschmann R, Beyer P, et al. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large nationwide sample of patients on dialysis in the USA: a cross-sectional study. Lancet. 2020. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32009-2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Background
Many patients receiving dialysis in the USA share the socioeconomic characteristics of underserved communities, and undergo routine monthly laboratory testing, facilitating a practical, unbiased, and repeatable assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence.

Methods
For this cross-sectional study, in partnership with a central laboratory that receives samples from approximately 1300 dialysis facilities across the USA, we tested the remainder plasma of 28 503 randomly selected adult patients receiving dialysis in July 2020, using a spike protein receptor binding domain total antibody chemiluminescence assay (100% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity). We extracted data on age, sex, race, and ethnicity, and residence and facility ZIP codes from the anonymised electronic health records, linking patient-level residence data with cumulative and daily cases and deaths per 100 000 population and with nasal swab test positivity rates. We standardised prevalence estimates according to the overall US dialysis and adult population, and present estimates for 4 prespecified strata (age, sex, region, and race, and ethnicity).

Findings
The sampled population had similar age, sex, and race and ethnicity distribution to the US dialysis population, with a higher proportion of older people, men, and people living in majority Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods than in the US adult population. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8.0% (95% CI 7.7-8.4) in the sample, 8.3% (8.0-8.6) when standardised to the US dialysis population, and 9.3% (8.8-9.9) when standardised to the US adult population. When standardised to the US dialysis population, seroprevalence ranged from 3.5% (3.1-3.9) in the west to 27.2% (25.9-28.5) in the northeast. Comparing seroprevalent and case counts per 100 000 population, we found that 9.2% (8.7-9.8) of seropositive patients were diagnosed. When compared with other measures of SARS-CoV-2 spread, seroprevalence correlated best with deaths per 100 000 population (Spearman's p=0.77). Residents of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods experienced higher odds of seropositivity (odds ratio 3.9 [95% CI 3.4-4.6] and 2.3 [1.9-2.6], respectively) compared with residents of predominantly non-Hispanic white neighbourhoods. Residents of neighbourhoods in the highest population density quintile experienced increased odds of seropositivity (10.3 [8.7-12.2]) compared with residents of the lowest density quintile. County mobility restrictions that reduced workplace visits by at least 5% in early March 2020, were associated with lower odds of seropositivity in July 2020 (0.4 [0.3-0.5]) when compared with a reduction of less than 5%.

Interpretation
During the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than 10% of the US adult population formed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and fewer than 10% of those with antibodies were diagnosed. Public health efforts to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread need to especially target racial and ethnic minority and densely populated communities.

[This study points out several observations that have been previously mentioned. The observation that only approximately 10% of seropositive individuals had been tested by PCR previously suggests either asymptomatic infection or possibly not able to access services. The other key finding was the higher seroprevalence among black and Hispanic populations, consistent with previously noted inequities both in the USA as well as in Europe.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 29 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept29_1601412930.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 37.3% of daily case numbers and 40.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 16.4 million cases. The USA and Brazil remain dominant, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Chile, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Signs of reduced reporting as part of weekend artifact.

- The European region reported 17.5% of daily case numbers and 15.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 5.7 million. Countries not reporting cases today (29 Sep 2020) include Spain, Israel, and Sweden. The dominant country is Russia followed by the UK, France, Ukraine, Netherlands, and Germany. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Romania.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.1% of daily case numbers and 11.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.3 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Lebanon, Libya, Jordan, Pakistan, UAE, Oman, and Palestinian Authority.

- The African region reported 1.5% of daily case numbers and 6.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.1 million cases. South Africa is again the dominant country, followed by Ethiopia, Mozambique, Botswana, Uganda, Reunion, Algeria, and Nigeria.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.6% of daily case numbers and 1.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.60 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 34.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 25.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 6.8 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar.

Today's report from Europe has weekend reporting artifact with key countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours. That being said, Europe is experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period. The Americas continue to have more countries reporting cases although there is a muting consisting with weekend artifact. Major transmission is also ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India, but other countries are following suit. - Cases are increasing in Nepal and Myanmar.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 29 Sep 2020 is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (80 500), followed by the USA (44 535) and Brazil (31 990) -- account for over half (54.4%) of all confirmed cases globally and 53.9% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 6245 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (29-30 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (13 477), Spain (9906), Russia (8232), France (8051), UK (7143), and Colombia (5839); 33 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 6 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 0.90%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.0%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India, and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
