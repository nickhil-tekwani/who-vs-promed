The head of the Civil Cabinet, Miguel Lopez Perito, admitted today [2
Jan 2012] the government is concerned about the possibility of a new
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the San Pedro area. He
said authorities will investigate whether there were failures in
vaccination of the animals if the outbreak is confirmed.

In response to a question as to why a much stricter control is not
implemented, Lopez Perito admitted that it [the control system] is
vulnerable, mainly due to smuggling. "We positively know that
smuggling from Argentina and Brazil bypasses essential controls. So,
if the mechanisms for control of smuggling are not strengthened, there
is danger that the control systems in place for FMD are violated," he
said.

On the other hand, when asked if the director of SENACSA [National
Animal Health Service] would be held responsible for this case, [he]
would not hold the service responsible. "This is for the President to
evaluate and make the appropriate decisions. I do not know the
circumstances, what is the origin [of the outbreak], specifically. But
I can assure you there will be an investigation into what transpired
and to determine if SENACSA has any responsibility [for the outbreak].
We have to know what it is [the etiology of the outbreak] before
accusing anyone."

[Paraguay has undergone a hard time recently where an outbreak of FMD
was related to a vaccine that was not inactivated correctly. That
outbreak has been contained and they are again cleared for exporting.
This new possible outbreak will certainly cause ruffled feathers as it
will likely put exports at risk of being stopped.

We look forward to more information on what the true situation is.
