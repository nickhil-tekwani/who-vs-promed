West Nile Virus-infected Birds in Louisiana Now Total Five
----------------------------------------------------------
NEW ORLEANS: Health officials have found 3 more dead birds which were
infected with West Nile virus. The new findings, confirmed by state
Department of Health and Hospitals on Fri 12 Oct 2001, brings the number of
dead birds found in suburban New Orleans to 5.
No human case of West Nile has been reported in Louisiana, but the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that 25 people
have been infected in Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Florida and Georgia
this year. One person has died. Nine other deaths in New York and New Jersey
have been blamed on West Nile virus since 1999, the first year it was
detected in the Western Hemisphere.
At least 69 people in the Monroe area have contracted St. Louis
encephalitis, [caused by a different encephalitis-associated virus, since 8
Aug 2001. Three have died.
Officials with Mosquito Control Inc., which contracts with Jefferson Parish
to spray insecticide, said the company has surveyed the East Jefferson area
where the birds were found for obvious mosquito breeding grounds, but none
was found. However, inspectors said mosquitoes may have been able to breed
in standing water that has pooled under buildings where the ground has
subsided. The company has already stepped up efforts to track populations of
[the species of mosquitoes that are known to carry the virus. It also is
using trucks to spray the highest concentration of insecticide allowed by
the Environmental Protection Agency within a 3-mile radius of where the
dead birds were found. "The entire parish is getting sprayed with a higher
concentration, but the area where the birds were found will get the
highest," Machado said.
Health officials recommend that residents use gloves or double plastic bags
on their hands to collect bird carcasses. Residents also should take
measures to avoid mosquito bites, wearing long sleeves and long pants when
outside, using insect repellent on exposed skin and staying inside at dawn
and dusk.
