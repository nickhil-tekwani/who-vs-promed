Viet Nam: 2 new suspected human cases of avian influenza
--------------------------------------------------------
2 people from Viet Nam's northern region have just been hospitalized on
suspicion of having contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. The
2 patients, one from Hai Duong province and the other from Nam Dinh province,
were admitted to the Tropical Disease Institute in Hanoi on Tue 1 Mar 2005
after suffering fever and breathing difficulty, the local newspaper Pioneer
reported on Wed 2 Mar 2005.
The institute is treating 3 confirmed cases of H5N1 infection: a 35-year-old
woman named from Hanoi, a 21-year-old man from northern Thai Binh province,
and the man's 14-year-old sister. [This patient was reported previously to
have tested H5N1-negative; see "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (38): Viet
Nam 20050228.062.9. - Mod.CP].
Besides the 2 new suspected cases, it is treating a 36-year-old man from Thai
Binh who is waiting for the final result of virus testing. Samples from the
man were tested positive to the virus on the 1st testing, but negative on the
2nd. Admitted to the Institute on 22 Feb 2005, the man is in a poor
condition, but 2 other avian influenza patients are showing signs of
recovery. 2 of these patients ate goose meat, while the 3rd has frequently
been present in live poultry markets in the city, working as a rubbish
collector, said local doctors.
In the most recent outbreak starting in late December 2004, Vietnam has
identified 21 local people [with confirmed avian influenza H5N1 virus
infection], of whom 13 have died, according to local media. The country's
Health Ministry, however, has confirmed only 12 fatalities. Vietnam has also
found that a Cambodian woman, who had received treatment in a Vietnamese
hospital near her hometown, died of bird flu on 30 Jan 2005.
Avian influenza, which has killed and led to the forced culling of more than
1.5 million fowls in 35 cities and provinces in Viet Nam, is subsiding. 14
out of the 35 localities have detected no new bird flu-affected spots for at
least 3 weeks, according to the Viet Nam Department of Animal Health.

Viet Nam; Death of patient reported incorrectly by health ministry
------------------------------------------------------------------
Doctors treating a 21-year-old Vietnamese man seriously ill with avian
influenza denied on Tue 1 Mar 2005 a statement from the Health Ministry
saying the man had died. Health ministry spokesman Pham Tuan Hung told Agence
France-Presse earlier on Tuesday that the man had died on Sunday at Hanoi's
Institute of Tropical Diseases. However the Institute's deputy director and
the doctor treating the patient both insisted the man was still alive on
Tuesday, albeit in a very serious condition. "He is still there, he is still
in his bed," Dr. Nguyen Tuong Van, the patient's doctor said. "I can confirm
that at the moment he is still alive. Cao Van Vien, the institute's deputy
director, said the Health Ministry's statement was "wrong."
In the past 2 months at least 14 people have died from the H5N1 virus in Viet
Nam. Since last week, Viet Nam has reported at least one new death and 2
contaminations [presumably new non-fatal cases]. It followed a 3-week lull
without any new human cases.

WHO concerned lack of avian flu reports from Vietnam impedes risk assessment
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A top World Health Organization official expressed concern Tuesday over
Vietnam's lack of official reporting on recent human cases of the dangerous
H5N1 avian flu strain, feared by flu experts as being poised to spark an
influenza pandemic.
Dr. Klaus Stohr suggested the absence of timely information from the country
is impeding the WHO's ability to do risk assessment on a potential pandemic.
The Vietnamese government has not reported a new human case to the agency
since 2 Feb 2005, Stohr revealed in an interview from Geneva. A number of
cases have been reported though a variety of unofficial channels in the month
since Vietnam last updated WHO.
The organization only uses government reports to tally its official case
counts for diseases such as SARS or avian influenza. "It's something that we
are certainly not satisfied with," Stohr, director of the WHO's global
influenza program, said of the lack of official information on the reported
new cases. "The situation is that WHO has a request by its member states to
provide proper risk assessment, to help other member states of WHO . . . in
assessing what's going on in Asia and provide advice to other member states.
And without this information, this is very difficult."
Stohr said WHO officials have issued several requests, in writing and in
person, to Vietnam's Ministry of Health for more up-to-date information. "We
understand that our country office and the Ministry of Health are discussing
better procedures for information sharing. And we are optimistic that this is
going to help things for the future," he said. "But again, for the last 30
days . . . we haven't had any official letter from the Ministry of Health,
any official update."
Vietnamese and international Media reports would suggest WHO's case count is
falling seriously behind what is happening on the ground. In the past week
alone, four human cases have been reported. WHO's most recent case count --
dated 2 Feb 2005 -- sets the number of human cases of H5N1 infection since
January 2004 at 55, with 42 deaths. But tallies kept by the Center for
Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota tell
another story [see ref. (40 below].
Staff there have taken to combing a variety of official and unofficial
sources to compile what they believe to be a more accurate count of the known
human cases of the disease so far. Their sources include ProMED, an
electronic forum on emerging diseases run by the International Society for
Infectious Diseases, and mainstream Media reports that cite government
officials. The centre -- known as CIDRAP -- suggests there have been 65 human
cases since January 2004 and 46 of those people have died.
"I think it has become so confusing to try to understand the reporting of
cases in Southeast Asia by both official and unofficial sources that we felt
it would be helpful for our readers to do it," said Dr. Michael Osterholm,
director of the centre. Osterholm said centre staff keep a meticulous list
of information on each case to try to ensure that they don't accidentally end
up counting cases twice.
The editor of ProMED, Dr. Larry Madoff, said there are a variety of ways for
organizations such as WHO to keep apprised of what is going with H5N1 in
Asia. In addition to ProMED, there is GPHIN -- the Global Public Health
Intelligence Network -- an Internet trolling program developed and maintained
by Health Canada. But while Madoff believes confirmed cases will come to
light, he said delays in official reporting can have repercussions. "I think
the fact that official agencies are . . . slow and careful in what they
report can sometimes lead to delays that are not ideal for public health
purposes," Madoff said from Boston.
For instance, WHO has stockpiles of anti-viral drugs in various locations in
Southeast Asia. Should it become apparent H5N1 is spreading from person to
person -- the remaining prerequisite for the strain to trigger a pandemic --
the agency hopes to use the drugs to slow the virus's emergence from the
region to give the world more time to prepare. But if the WHO isn't receiving
prompt information about cases, that plan might be impossible to put in
place. "One of the issues we have to really come to grips with is how would
you blanket an area once the cow's out of the barn door?" Osterholm said.
