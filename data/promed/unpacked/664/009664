Increase in transfusion-associated babesiosis in New York City
--------------------------------------------------------------
Seven cases of transfusion-associated babesiosis have been identified
among New York City (NYC) residents since September 2008; this is a
notable increase over baseline as previously an average of one to 2
transfusion-associated cases were reported annually.

The NYC Health Department is asking providers to consider babesiosis
in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever and/or hemolytic
anemia who have a history of transfusion or organ transplant within
the preceding 3 months; Suspected cases should be tested for
babesiosis (see below for details), and laboratory positive cases
should be reported to the NYC Health Department as well as the New
York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Blood and Tissue Resources
Program (see contact information below).

Reported cases of transfusion-associated babesiosis among New Yorkers
have increased during the previous 6 months. In the past, an average
of 1-2 reports of transfusion-associated babesiosis was received by
the Department annually; since September 2008, 7 cases have been
identified. Patients receiving transfusions often have underlying
illnesses, including immunosuppressive conditions, and providers may
not suspect babesiosis, especially during winter months when travel
to endemic areas is less common.

This alert reminds providers to consider babesiosis in the
differential diagnosis for patients with febrile illnesses and/or
hemolytic anemia who have received blood components or transplanted
organs in the preceding 3 months.

Babesiosis is a rare, sometimes severe or fatal tick-borne disease
caused by _Babesia microti_, a parasite that infects red blood cells.
Symptoms occur most frequently in elderly, asplenic, or
immunocompromised individuals and may include fever, hemolytic
anemia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, acute renal failure, DIC
[disseminated intravascular coagulation] and ARDS [acute respiratory
distress syndrome]. In healthy hosts, infection is often
asymptomatic, or causes mild illness with fever, headache, myalgia,
and malaise. Untreated infections can persist for up to a year or
longer.

Naturally acquired _Babesia_ is transmitted by infected _Ixodes
scapularis_, or blacklegged ticks, which are also known to transmit
_Borrelia burgdorferi_ (Lyme disease) and _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_
(anaplasmosis). The blacklegged tick is only rarely found in NYC;
however it is present in nearly all areas surrounding the City.
Highly endemic areas for _Babesia microti_ near NYC include Long
Island (especially Fire and Shelter Islands), Connecticut, New
Jersey, and Massachusetts. Transmission risk is greatest during
spring and summer, when nymphal ticks are abundant.

The number of cases of babesiosis reported among NYC residents has
gradually risen since 1989 when 2 cases were reported. This trend has
been seen in the surrounding region as well. This may in part explain
the increased number of transfusion-associated cases. In 2002, 16
cases were reported, and provisional data for 2008 has 39 cases
reported to date, see Table 1).

Transmission through blood transfusion can occur when blood
components collected from a parasitemic donor are transfused to a
susceptible recipient. To date, transmission has been reported only
with red blood cells (both fresh and frozen) and platelets.

According to the FDA, since 1979 over 80 cases of
transfusion-associated babesiosis have been reported in the US, the
majority of which occurred during the past decade. Currently, there
is no laboratory screening of the blood supply for evidence of
infection with _Babesia_. Donors are deferred if they have a fever at
the time of donation or report a history of _Babesia_ infection, but
this practice alone is unable to prevent asymptomatic individuals
with low levels of parasitemia from serving as donors.

Clinicians in NYC should consider transfusion-associated babesiosis
in any patient presenting with unexplained febrile illness and/or
hemolytic anemia who received blood components or organ
transplantation in the preceding 3 months. The incubation period for
tick-associated babesiosis can range from 1 to 4 weeks; for
transfusion-associated babesiosis, 2 to 9 weeks.

Diagnosis can be made by identifying ring forms (which closely
resemble _Plasmodium falciparum_) and tetrad forms within red blood
cells on a Giemsa or Wright stained blood smear. Babesia polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and serologic tests are available commercially
to assist with the diagnosis. Confirmatory testing, including review
of blood smears and submission to NYS for PCR, if deemed necessary,
is available through the NYC Public Health Laboratory. A request form
must be completed for specimen submissions. For more information,
call the Parasitology Laboratory at (212) 447-2972 during business
hours. Forms can be found online at
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/labs/labs_forms.shtml>.

Treatment is generally not recommended for asymptomatic or mild
self-limiting infections. For patients in whom illness is more
severe, combination drug therapy has been successful. While the
combination of clindamycin and quinine for 7 days was used
historically, side effects including tinnitus and gastroenteritis can
be problematic. More recently, the combination of atovaquone and
azithromycin has been favored as this regimen is equally effective
and results in fewer side effects.

In rare instances, an exchange transfusion may be indicated. For
additional information on treatment options, refer to the Medical
Letter, Drugs for Parasitic Infections. See

Please call the Bureau of Communicable Disease at 212-788-9830 with
any questions regarding testing, diagnosis, reporting, or management
of suspected cases of babesiosis. Cases of transfusion-associated
babesiosis must also be reported to the NYSDOH Blood and Tissue
Resources Program at 518-485-5341. A report must also be made to your
hospital's transfusion service so they can notify the blood center
that supplied the blood components.

Cases can be reported to the DOHMH by telephone (212-788-9830) or
facsimile transmission (212-788-4268) using the paper or electronic
Universal Reporting form (URF). The URF and instructions can be
obtained from your hospital's Infection Control Practitioner or
downloaded from the DOHMH website at
<http://home2.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/hcp/hcp-urf.shtml>.
Visit <http://home2.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/hcp/hcp.shtml> to join
NYC-MED in order to submit a URF online.

Pediatrics, Family Medicine, Infection Control, Infectious Disease,
Emergency Medicine, Critical Care, Hematology/Oncology, Pharmacy,
Blood Bank and Laboratory Medicine.

[Transmission of _Babesia_ by blood transfusion has mainly been
reported form the United States (see the recent review by Gubernot
DM, et al: _Babesia_ infection through blood transfusions: reports
received by the US Food and Drug Administration, 1997-2007. Clin
Infect Dis. 2009; 48(1): 25-30; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19035776>).

Infection with _Babesia_ is often asymptomatic in the immunocompetent
human host and asymptomatic carriers must exist which makes
prevention very difficult. One study found babesia antibodies in 0.9
percent of blood donors in Connecticut, USA, and half of these
seropositive donors were parasite positive by PCR (Leiby DA et al:
Demonstrable parasitemia among Connecticut blood donors with
antibodies to _Babesia microti_. Transfusion. 2005; 45(11): 1804-10;
abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16271108>).
