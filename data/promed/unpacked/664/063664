[2] Anterior uveitis
Date: Mon 1 Mar 2021
Source: Healio Infectious Disease News [edited]
https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20210301/anterior-uveitis-often-associated-with-zika-virus-infection


Anterior uveitis may be present in a high percentage of patients infected by Zika virus and is often associated with increased IOP [intraocular pressure], according to a study.

Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The 1st cases were reported in Uganda and Tanzania in the late 1940s, and in subsequent years, outbreaks were identified in several other African and Asian nations, Pacific islands, and, later, in several countries within Latin America and the Caribbean. Ocular manifestations reported in the literature were limited to conjunctivitis until 2016 when an outbreak affecting 1.3 million people occurred in Brazil. Since then, with the expanded understanding of the clinical manifestation of ZIKV, several cases of uveitis were reported.

At an island referral center in the French West Indies, the Pointe-à-Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe, the medical records of patients with confirmed ZIKV infection were reviewed. Patients who were referred for a red eye were included in the study. All patients underwent further virologic and serologic testing for ZIKV, best corrected visual acuity and IOP measurement, and slit lamp and fundoscopy examination. Uveitis was defined as active or inactive based on the standardization of uveitis nomenclature criteria.

Out of 62 patients with red eye, 30 (48%) had anterior nongranulomatous uveitis without synechiae [adhensions between the iris and other structures], which was bilateral in all cases. Ocular hypertension, defined as IOP greater than 21 mm Hg, was reported in 50 of 60 eyes (83%).

"Ocular hypertension is thought to occur when the cells of the ZIKV-infected trabecular meshwork trigger an inflammatory cascade, which in turn causes trabeculitis," the authors wrote.

Ocular pain was reported by 60% of patients. Visual acuity was rarely and only mildly affected. No case of posterior uveitis or retinal lesions was observed.

All eyes were treated with dexamethasone eye drops from diagnosis, leading to complete recovery after 1 year of treatment. However, despite the use of glaucoma medications, IOP was still high at 1 year in 50% of eyes. This led the authors to recommend a thorough clinical examination in any patient positive for ZIKV presenting with a red eye.

"Although the findings of this study suggest that anterior uveitis responds well to corticosteroid eye drops, it is often associated with raised IOP that, if left untreated, could be sight threatening. Therefore, clinicians attending to those with acute ZIKV infection should have a low threshold for considering ZIKV-associated uveitis and arrange slit lamp biomicroscopy and IOP measurement for any of their patients presenting with a red eye," they wrote.

ref: Salisch NC, Stephenson KE, Williams K, et AL. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 study of Ad26.ZIKV.001, an Ad26-vectored anti-Zika virus vaccine. Ann Intern Med. 2021. doi: 10.7326/M20-5306. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33587687
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Zika virus (ZIKV) may cause severe congenital disease after maternal-fetal transmission. No vaccine is currently available.

Objective
To assess the safety and immunogenicity of Ad26.ZIKV.001, a prophylactic ZIKV vaccine candidate.

Design
Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03356561)

Setting
United States.

Participants
100 healthy adult volunteers.

Intervention
Ad26.ZIKV.001, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector encoding ZIKV M-Env, administered in 1- or 2-dose regimens of 5 x 10^10 or 1 x 10^11 viral particles (vp), or placebo.

Measurements
Local and systemic adverse events; neutralization titers by microneutralization assay (MN50) and T-cell responses by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining; and protectivity of vaccine-induced antibodies in a subset of participants through transfer in an exploratory mouse ZIKV challenge model.

Results
All regimens were well tolerated, with no safety concerns identified. In both 2-dose regimens, ZIKV neutralizing titers peaked 14 days after the 2nd vaccination, with geometric mean MN50 titers (GMTs) of 1065.6 (95% CI, 494.9 to 2294.5) for 5 x 10^10 vp and 956.6 (595.8 to 1535.8) for 1 x 10^11 vp. Titers persisted for at least 1 year at a GMT of 68.7 (CI, 26.4-178.9) for 5 x 10^10 vp and 87.0 (CI, 29.3 to 258.6) for 1 x 10^11 vp. A 1-dose regimen of 1 x 10^11 vp Ad26.ZIKV.001 induced seroconversion in all participants 56 days after the 1st vaccination (GMT, 103.4 [CI, 52.7 to 202.9]), with titers persisting for at least 1 year (GMT, 90.2 [CI, 38.4 to 212.2]). Env-specific cellular responses were induced. Protection against ZIKV challenge was observed after antibody transfer from participants into mice, and MN50 titers correlated with protection in this model.

Limitation
The study was conducted in a nonendemic area, so it did not assess safety and immunogenicity in a flavivirus-exposed population.

Conclusion
The safety and immunogenicity profile makes Ad26.ZIKV.001 a promising candidate for further development if the need reemerges.

[Conduct of an extensive phase 3 trial of the vaccine will be difficult to accomplish without an ongoing outbreak in which to test it. Without a successful phase 3 trial, governmental health authorities are unlikely to approve its use. Not only would an approved vaccine be helpful in the face of an outbreak, but it would also be of significant value for travelers going to areas where there is a risk of virus transmission, especially for pregnant women and their partners concerned about the possibility of teratogenic effects on the developing fetus. Zika virus has not disappeared and concern about infection may continue to have adverse effects on tourism to areas where it has been a problem in the recent past, especially in the Americas. - Mod.TY]

ref: Koumavor CAK, Elguero E, Leroy EM. Potential association between Zika infection and microcephaly during 2007 fever outbreak, Gabon. Emerg Infect Dis. 2021; 27(2): 672-674. doi: 10.3201/eid2702.202987. PMID: 33496651; PMCID: PMC7853567
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Although Zika virus (ZIKV) circulates in sub-Saharan Africa, no case of ZIKV-associated microcephaly has thus far been reported. Here, we report evidence of a possible association between a 2007 outbreak of febrile illness and an increase in microcephaly and possibly ZIKV infection in Gabon.

[Background]
During April-August 2007, Gabon's capital, Libreville, experienced simultaneous outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue (5). A retrospective study of 4312 serum samples collected during this time found 5 ZIKV-positive cases (6). In addition, 2/137 (1.46%) pooled samples from _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes tested positive for ZIKV, a proportion similar to that observed for dengue virus. Given that 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic or subclinical, these findings suggest that an undetected ZIKV outbreak may have occurred in Gabon in 2007.

[Results]
Among 10 286 children born in the 14 months during May 2007-June 2008, a total of 20 microcephaly cases were recorded, compared with only 2 cases among 24 123 children born in the 20 months of the study period outside of the outbreak (OR 15.6, 95% CI 4.65-52.70; p = 8.8 x 10^-6; Figure, panel A). In contrast, we found no increase in newborns with other types of malformation, such as limb malformations, during that period (Figure, panel B). Of note, 18 of the 20 outbreak-associated children with microcephaly were born during September 2007-February 2008, corresponding to mothers in the 1st trimester of pregnancy during the outbreak, when the risk of microcephaly in fetuses or neonates is highest. To eliminate potential artifacts in the data arising from unspecified environmental incidents, we used the same method of analysis to examine other congenital birth malformations such as facial, upper limb, and lower limb malformations. No significant associations were found.

[Conclusions]
Despite limitations, our findings support that the 2007 febrile illness outbreak in Libreville was associated with an increase in infants with microcephaly. Although microcephaly may be due to many other causes that were not investigated in our study, the detection of 5 ZIKV cases in samples collected during the febrile illness outbreak suggests a temporal association between ZIKV and microcephaly in this country. Given the risk of microcephaly in infants is approximately 1% for mothers infected during the 1st trimester of pregnancy (8), the high number of microcephaly cases reported here indicates that ZIKV infections were likely prevalent during the outbreak. These observations highlight the need to provide specific priority care for pregnant women during future ZIKV outbreaks in Africa and to investigate possible ZIKV infections that have occurred in the past during the pregnancies of mothers of babies with microcephaly.

[Zika virus is known to circulate in Sub-Saharan Africa and cases of human infection there likely go undetected frequently. There is no reason to think that the fetuses of Zika virus infected women in their 1st trimester of pregnancy are not at risk of developing microcephaly and other teratogenic effects. - Mod.TY

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
After Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Costa Rica was confirmed in January 2016, the national surveillance system was enhanced to monitor associated birth defects. To characterize the ZIKV outbreak among live-born infants during March 2016-March 2018, we conducted a descriptive analysis. Prevalence of ZIKV-associated birth defects was 15.3 cases/100 000 live births. Among 22 infants with ZIKV-associated birth defects, 11 were designated as confirmed (positive for ZIKV) and 11 were designated as probable cases (negative for ZIKV or not tested, but mother was exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy). A total of 91% had microcephaly (head circumference >2 SDs [standard deviation] below mean for age and sex), 64% severe microcephaly (head circumference ≥3 SDs below mean for age and sex), 95% neurodevelopmental abnormalities, 82% brain anomalies, 41% eye abnormalities, and 9% hearing loss. Monitoring children for ≥1 year can increase identification of ZIKV-associated abnormalities in addition to microcephaly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Here we identify human Kinesin-5, Kif11/HsEg5, as a cellular target of Zika protease. We show that Zika NS2b-NS3 protease targets several sites within the motor domain of HsEg5 irrespective of motor binding to microtubules. The native integral ER-membrane protease triggers mitotic spindle positioning defects and a prolonged metaphase delay in cultured cells. Our data support a model whereby loss of function of HsEg5 is mediated by Zika protease and is spatially restricted to the ER-mitotic spindle interface during mitosis. The resulting phenotype is distinct from the monopolar phenotype that typically results from uniform inhibition of HsEg5 by RNAi or drugs. Additionally, our data reveal novel inter-organelle interactions between the mitotic apparatus and the surrounding reticulate ER network. Given that Kif11 is haploinsufficient in humans, and reduced dosage results in microcephaly, we propose that Zika protease targeting of HsEg5 may be a key event in the etiology of Zika syndrome microcephaly.

[7] Mexico: infected pigs and mosquitoes

ref: Nunez-Avellaneda D, Cetina-Trejo RC, Zamudio-Moreno E, et al. Evidence of Zika virus infection in pigs and mosquitoes, Mexico. Emerg Infect Dis. 2021; 27(2): 574-577. doi: 10.3201/eid2702.201452. PMID: 33496242; PMCID: PMC7853551
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Evidence suggests that pigs seroconvert after experimental exposure to Zika virus and are potential sentinels. We demonstrate that pigs are also susceptible to natural Zika virus infection, shown by the presence of antibodies in domestic pigs in Yucatan, Mexico. Zika virus RNA was detected in 5 species of mosquitoes collected inside pigpens.

[Background]
Pigs are susceptible to experimental Zika virus infection (1-4), but evidence of natural infection is lacking. Microcephaly has occurred in fetal piglets after in utero inoculation, and neurologic disease has occurred in neonates after intracranial inoculation, suggesting that pigs are a suitable animal model for the study of Zika virus. The 3-month-old pigs exposed to Zika virus through subcutaneous and intradermal injection produce antibodies but not viremias, indicating that pigs could be suitable sentinels. We performed a serologic investigation in the state of Yucatan, Mexico, to determine whether pigs are susceptible to natural Zika virus infection. Mosquitoes temporally and spatially associated with the pigs were tested for evidence of Zika virus infection to increase our understanding of the vector range of the virus.

[Results]
Serum specimens were collected from 297 pigs (20 from Tzucacab, 73 from Valladolid, 74 from Xkalakdzonot, and 130 from Xmatkuil). Of these, 38 (12.8%) pigs were positive for flavivirus-specific antibodies; 13 (4.8%) pigs were seropositive for Zika virus, 1 (0.3%) pig was seropositive for West Nile virus, and 24 (8.1%) pigs had antibodies to an undetermined flavivirus. Zika virus PRNT90 titers ranged from 40 to 320 (Table 1). Of the pigs seropositive for Zika virus, 11 were from Xmatkuil, and 1 each was from Tzucacab and Valladolid.

The entomologic investigation yielded 1870 mosquitoes of 8 species that were sorted into 190 pools. Of these, 381 mosquitoes were collected inside pigpens, and >50% were engorged (Table 2). Mosquitoes were tested for Zika virus RNA by reverse transcription PCR, and resulting amplification products were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Of the pools, 5, all of which contained ≥1 engorged mosquito, were positive for Zika virus sequence, and all consisted of mosquitoes collected inside pigpens in Xmatkuil (Genbank accession nos. MT309004-309008). One pool each of the following mosquito species tested positive: _Aedes aegypti_, _Ae. taeniorhynchus_, _Culex lactator_, _Cx. nigripalpus_, and _Cx. thriambus_. All sequences were identical and differed from the positive control, an isolate from the state of Chiapas, Mexico, in 2016 (Genbank accession no. KX446950.2) in 1 nucleotide position, a C-->T substitution at genomic position 1893.

Conclusions
We detected Zika virus RNA sequence in _Ae. aegypti_, _Ae. taeniorhynchus_, _Cx. lactator_, _Cx. nigripalpus_, and _Cx. thriambus_ mosquitoes that were temporally and spatially associated with pigs seropositive for this virus. The role of _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes in Zika virus transmission has been debated, but the consensus among the arbovirus community is that they are inefficient vectors (5,6). _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes and Zika virus were first linked after experimental infection studies demonstrated that the _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ mosquito is a competent vector of this virus (7). Many other studies have shown otherwise, including a study that demonstrated that _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes in the state of Jalisco, Mexico, were refractory to Zika virus (5,6,8).

Vector competence experiments have also evaluated mosquitoes from ≥6 other _Culex_ spp., although _Cx. lactator_, _Cx. nigripalpus_, and _Cx. thriambus_ mosquitoes are not among them, and none were able to transmit Zika virus (9). We add to the small number of studies that have detected Zika virus nucleic acid in field-collected _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes (7,10), but we did not isolate virus or provide evidence of disseminated infection. We cannot dismiss the possibility that the Zika virus RNA-positive Culex spp. mosquitoes had recently fed upon a viremic host but virus replication had not occurred within the mosquito. Therefore, the link between _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes and Zika virus remains tenuous. The _Ae. taeniorhynchus_ mosquito is also considered an inefficient vector of Zika virus (11). In contrast, the _Ae. aegypti_ mosquito is the principal urban vector of Zika virus in the Americas (12). _Ae. taeniorhynchus_ and _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes are not known to have a strong preference for porcine blood, although 2.4% of engorged _Ae. taeniorhynchus_ mosquitoes in the Galapagos Islands had acquired blood from pigs, and the _Cx. nigripalpus_ mosquito shifts seasonally to opportunistic feeding behavior (13,14). Porcine blood has occasionally been detected in _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes (15,16).

The mosquito infection rates in our study are high. All Zika virus RNA-positive mosquitoes and most seropositive pigs were sampled at the same site (Xmatkuil) on the same date (5 Jun 2018). We speculate that these pigs were infected with Zika virus just before our visit and that some mosquitoes then bit them, without virus disseminating from the midguts of _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes. Recent studies have demonstrated that pigs are susceptible to experimental Zika virus infection (1-4).

We provide serologic evidence that pigs are also susceptible to natural Zika virus infection. A high number of stillbirths occurred at 2 study sites before sampling, but none displayed malformations typical of Zika virus infection.

We provide additional evidence that pigs produce neutralizing antibodies upon Zika virus exposure and are potential sentinels. This information will be useful for investigators and public and veterinary health personnel conducting surveillance in Zika virus-endemic areas where pigs are common and usually raised outdoors. One limitation of our study is that pig farmers were not tested for evidence of flavivirus infection. Future studies should investigate whether those persons are at increased risk for Zika disease.

[The suggestion that pigs may serve as useful sentinels for the presence of Zika virus circulation in an area where the presence of the virus is suspected or proven is interesting. One hopes that these observations will be tested in other geographic areas where the virus is being transmitted.

There are far fewer cases of Zika virus infection than in recent years. Some of this may be due to the overwhelming attention paid to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, a few cases are confirmed currently. The virus has not gone away. Continued surveillance is warranted. - Mod.TY
