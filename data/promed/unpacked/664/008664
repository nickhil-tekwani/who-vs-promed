[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.

To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs, and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive second waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 58 cases and 0 new deaths compared with 79 cases in the previous day (27 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 54 consecutive days. Today's (28 May 2020) breakdown of cases: 55 cases were locally transmitted, and 3 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (19), Incheon (18), and Gyeonggi (18). Imported cases were 2 in Gyeonggi, and one in Seoul. Note that 14 provinces reported no newly confirmed cases, and only 3 provinces reported any cases.

From the English language page:
Notice 341 of 29 May 2020: there are graphics and tables giving more demographic information on the cases.

Notice 340 of 28 May 2020: there are descriptions of the major clusters:
- The Coupang logistics center had 46 new cases bringing the total number of cases since 12 May 2020 to 82 (63 workers and 19 contacts - Incheon 38 cases, Gyeonggi (27 cases and Seoul 17 cases).

- KB Life insurance call center in Jung-gu Seoul city center: a total of 7 cases

- Nightclubs associated outbreaks 261 cases in total, 2 new cases in preceding 24 hours. (96 club visitors, 165 contacts), cases in Seoul City (131), Gyeonggi (59), Incheon City (47), Chungbuk (9), Busan City (4), Daegu City (2), Gyeongnam (2), Jeonbuk (2), Daejeon City (1), Chungnam (1), Gyeongbuk (1), Gangwon (1), Jeju (1).

Since the lifting of the restrictions, the case count has been rising, especially related to business call centers and nightclub/karaoke bars. A challenge and a lesson to be learned by other countries on what should be opened and what perhaps shouldn't.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4824_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 88.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (382). 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (4 provinces reported no new cases), another 3 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, and 2 provinces (Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna) reported more than 50 but less than 100 cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

COVID-19 update 119 [data as of 28 May 2020 12:00 CET]
-----------------------------------------------------
[These data are changing daily and are hard to reconcile with data from previous dates. - Mod.MPP]

Situation in Spain:
After combining the data from both surveillance methods, in Spain, at present a total of 237 906 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 27 119 deaths have been reported to date (Table 1 Table 2, Figure 1 and Figure 2) ).

[Given the recent changes in disease reporting by Spain, it is difficult to draw trend comparisons at this time. Only to rehash, according to today's (28 May 2020) report, there were 182 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the confirmed cumulative total to 237 906, a 24-hour decrease from the 231 reported on 27 May 2020. A total of 27 119 deaths are reported as of today (28 May 2020), only one more death than reported yesterday (27 May 2020)

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 15.03 (a slight increase from 27 May 2020 when it was 14.59), against a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days.

Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times.

In terms of absolute numbers of cases Madrid has 68 451 cases followed by Catalonia at 58 427, Castile and Leon at 18 682, Castile-La Mancha at 17 068, and Basque Country at 13 489. In terms of population based rates (per 100 000 population) over the preceding 14 day period, Catalonia is 1st with 39.39 followed by Madrid with 25.33, Castile and Leon at 23.25, Navarre at 20.64, and Castile-La Mancha at 19.68.

According to Table 2, of the 237 906 cases, an additional 301 cases have been hospitalized over the preceding 7 days, and an additional 11 cases were admitted to ICU over the past 7 days. Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
