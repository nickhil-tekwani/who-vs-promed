[4] [2 Jun 2018]
New 18-1721
MERS in Najran city: 50-year-old male living in Najran city, Najran Region.
Date of onset: [26 May 2018]
Date of hospital admission: [31 May 2018]
Diagnosis: MERS URTI, stable

[5] [2 Jun 2018]
New 18-1722
MERS in Najran city: 33-year-old male living in Najran city, Najran Region.
Date of onset: [20 May 2018]
Date of hospital admission: [28 May 2018]
Diagnosis: MERS URTI, stable
Case classification: community-acquired/secondary (household to 18-1711)

Contact tracing of the family cluster has been completed and a total of 81 individuals have been listed for follow-up.

Camels owned by the family were put under quarantine and their initial MERS testing by PCR has been negative. Further testing is in progress.

Please note that 18-1719 is not related to the family cluster. He is classified as a community-acquired primary case with a history of direct camel contact.

[We would like to thank Dr. Abdullah Assiri for this updated information on the status of MERS-CoV surveillance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In our prior post confirming the household cluster in Najran, there was mention of 11 identified household contacts of the index case - a 45-year-old male with a history of direct contact with camels and raw camel milk ingestion. In the prior post, there was information confirming MERS-CoV infection with upper respiratory tract infections in 6 of the 11 identified contacts. (see MERS-CoV (19): Saudi Arabia (NJ) household cluster conf. 20180531.5830431) This current report confirms MERS-CoV upper respiratory tract infections in an additional 4 household contacts of the index case (case no 18-1711) raising the total number of secondary household contact cases in this family cluster in Najran to 10. While the initial number of household members identified for contact tracing was 11, the total number of individuals identified as contacts is now up to 81.

There is also a report of an additional primary case (case No. [2] above) in a 56-year-old male, also from Najran, with a history of direct contact with camels. This newly confirmed primary case presented with an upper respiratory tract in stable condition. As noted in Dr. Assiri's report, there was no relationship between this individual and the family cluster.

As of 31 May 2018, according to a communication with Dr. Assiri, the total number of confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported by the KSA since September 2012 was 1849 including 747 deaths (reported case fatality rate of 40.4 percent). This total includes 91 asymptomatic infections identified through contact tracing. With the addition of these 5 newly confirmed cases, this brings the cumulative total of MERS-CoV infections to 1854.

As a reminder on the geography, this cluster and 2nd primary case unrelated to the family cluster are occurring in Najran, the capital city of the Najran region, located in the southwest of Saudi Arabia. The region shares a border with Yemen.

Final results of the camel tests are anticipated with interest.

OIE's case definition of MERS in dromedaries is: "A dromedary camel with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, with or without clinical signs." A case may be laboratory confirmed by virus isolation or detection of viral nucleic acid. The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed by 1) a positive RT-PCR result on at least 2 specific genomic targets; 2) a single positive target with sequencing of a 2nd target; or 3) a single positive target with positive result in a rapid MERS-CoV Ag (Antigen) test. Serological investigations are of little value as high percentage of tested dromedaries possess antibodies to MERS-CoV.

In May 2016, OIE registered a "Rapid MERS-CoV Ag test kit", coined "BIONOT", for the qualitative detection of MERS-CoV antigens from nasal swab in dromedary camel (OIE Approval number: 20160212). The Kit's abstract sheet is available at https://tinyurl.com/ybbztxty. - Mod.AS]
