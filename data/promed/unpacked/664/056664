A Whitstable oyster company farm has been closed down as officials investigate multiple reports of people falling ill after eating the shellfish. It is believed more than 100 people have fallen ill with vomiting and diarrhea symptoms since eating the oysters. Officials stress that the batches of oysters affected have been identified and testing is ongoing.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA), Public Health England and Canterbury City Council have issued a joint statement stressing that there is no further risk to consumers. They said: "The oyster harvesting business linked to the outbreak ceased harvesting, no further oysters have been distributed since illnesses have occurred, and oysters distributed before they were aware of the illnesses have been withdrawn from the market. All oysters that were distributed are now passed their shelf life, there is no known further risk to consumers."

The FSA also advises that elderly people, pregnant women and very young children should avoid eating raw or lightly cooked shellfish to reduce their risk of getting foodborne illness.

[While norovirus could be considered here, diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) is a distinct possibility. DSP "is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_) and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_). The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins that also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins" (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.16.46.20020-en).

The term diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is often used for the illness, but this moderator prefers to use diarrheal shellfish poisoning to avoid any confusion between the almost homophones of diarrhetic and diuretic.

DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1 to 2 days. DSP diarrhea is the most commonly reported symptom (92%), closely followed by nausea (80%) and vomiting (79%), with onset 30 minutes to 12 hours from ingestion. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxin. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LL
