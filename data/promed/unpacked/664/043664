Two new outbreaks of H7N3 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been reported -- the 1st in a village flock of quails and the 2nd in a flock of commercial layers.

The Mexican veterinary authority has sent Follow Up report no. 10 dated 31 Aug 2013 to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

The report covers 2 new outbreaks of HPAI, later identified as the H7N3 sub-type.

The 1st outbreak started on 12 Aug 2013 in a small village quail flock in Valle de Santiago in the state of Guanajuato. The situation is described as "resolved".

On 19 Aug 2013, a 10 000-strong layer flock in the state of Jalisco -- at Lagos de Moreno -- was hit by the virus. The number of cases/deaths is not reported; the case is ongoing.

According to the report, control measures previously applied are still ongoing, including vaccination of birds at risk, as well as epidemiological surveillance at the national level.

[This disease seems to be smoldering, like a fire whose embers refuse to die. The veterinary force is likely working very hard to rid their country of this disease. It has serious economic consequences because of trade issues, and there is always the underlying worry of human health issues.
