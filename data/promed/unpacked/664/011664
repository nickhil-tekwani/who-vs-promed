2. Includes cases who are "discharged" or "recovered" as reported by
the national public health authorities.

3. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in
which local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas
are provided on the list of Affected Areas.

4. One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR occurred in a case medically
transferred from Viet Nam.

[B] The list of affected areas can be found at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsareas/2003_04_28/en/>. Since the last
update, VietNam has been removed from the list [see [2] below].

Viet Nam contains SARS
WHO has today removed Viet Nam from the list of affected areas,
making it the first country to successfully contain its SARS
outbreak. The change in Viet Nam's status follows 20 consecutive days
(the duration of 2 incubation periods) since the last new case was
detected. "It's a big day for all of us in Viet Nam and also
throughout the world," said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in
Hanoi. "WHO congratulates Viet Nam for being the first country to
succeed in containing the SARS epidemic."

The Vietnamese government first made the announcement this morning,
but added that the country needs to remain vigilant. The health
ministry affirmed its determination to work with WHO to guard against
the importation of the virus.

WHO believes Viet Nam should still maintain a high level of alert
since even a single new case of SARS could spark another outbreak.
Last week, the Vietnamese health ministry asked the Prime Minister to
authorize the closing of the country's land borders with China. Viet
Nam has currently heightened its border surveillance with China, but
has stopped short of closing the border.

More than 5000 cases worldwide
As of today, a cumulative total of 5050 probable SARS cases with 321
deaths have been reported from 26 countries. This represents an
increase of 214 cases and 28 deaths when compared with the last
report, issued on Saturday [26 Apr 2003]. The new deaths were
reported from China (9), Hong Kong SAR (17), and Singapore (2).

Due to time differences, today's figures include cases and deaths
from China for Sunday [27 Apr 2003], but not for today.

Viet Nam SARS-Free
-----------------
28 Apr 2003 -- The World Health Organization (WHO) is today removing
Viet Nam from the list of countries with local transmission of Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

This comes after careful monitoring of the country's current
situation, in which there have been no new reported cases of SARS
since 8 Apr 2003 and no cases of spread to other countries. "Viet Nam
has stopped the outbreak within its borders," says Dr Pascale Brudon,
WHO Representative to Viet Nam.

Viet Nam becomes the first country to be removed from the list of
countries with local transmission of SARS. The status change for Viet
Nam is especially significant because it was one of 4 countries
initially identified by the WHO on 15 Mar 2003 as having local
transmission of SARS. Viet Nam reported a total of 63 SARS cases and
5 deaths prior to 8 Apr 2003.

The absence of any new cases for a continuous 20-day (as of 28 Apr
2003) period is an encouraging indicator that appropriate detection
and protection measures, as recommended by the WHO, are able to
contain outbreaks and prevent their further spread. Viet Nam is one
of several countries affected by local transmission of SARS that have
conscientiously implemented detection and protection measures
including:

-prompt identification of persons with SARS, their movements and contacts;
-effective isolation of SARS patients in hospitals;
-appropriate protection of medical staff treating these patients;
-comprehensive identification and isolation of suspected SARS cases;
-exit screening of international travelers;
-timely and accurate reporting and sharing of information with other
authorities and/or governments.

"Viet Nam has effectively worked in partnership with other
governments, WHO, and WHO's partners to stop its outbreak of SARS,"
says David Heymann, the Executive Director of the WHO's Communicable
Diseases Cluster, adding, "we are pleased that other countries in the
region with local transmission of SARS are also following appropriate
detection and protection measures, and cooperating with each other to
do so."

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 28 Apr 2003

The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1PM 28 Apr 2003, there are an additional 14 patients confirmed
to have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals
earlier. They include 3 healthcare workers (2 from Tuen Mun Hospital
and one from Princess Margaret Hospital). The remaining 11 are other
patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.

A total of 710 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and
have been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 42 were
discharged today. There are also 103 recovering patients who are in
convalescence and preparation for discharge. 93 patients are
receiving treatment in intensive care unit.

5 male patients died in Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH),
Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH), and Tai Po
Hospital (TPH). This brought to 138 the total number of deaths
relating to atypical pneumonia. The deceased are aged from 43 to 82,
and 3 of them have a history of chronic disease. [One was an
otherwise health male under age 50 - Mod.MPP]

The cumulative figures for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 are as follows:

Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths

SARS Situation Update 28 Apr 2003

Today, 6 more patients have been discharged, bringing the total
number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 137. 39 patients
remained hospitalised, of whom 15 are in intensive care. There were
no new probable cases reported today.

There was one SARS death today: a 77-year-old man who had accompanied
his wife to the [Singapore General Hospital] SGH Radiology Centre on
1 Apr 2003. He became unwell on 9 Apr 2003. At the Radiology Centre
he had contact with the index case [?] of the SGH Ward 57/58 cluster.

Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market was closed on 20 Apr 2003 for a period
of 10 days. It has been decided that the closure of PPWM will be
extended for another 5 days till Sunday 4 May 2003. During this
period, nurses will visit those on home quarantine orders to check
that they and their family members have no fever or other symptoms.
This is an extra precaution to ensure that all those involved are
well when the quarantine is lifted. This cautious approach is
necessary because of the large number of people involved. There are
currently 12 suspect cases admitted in relation to PPWM. They consist
of 1 worker, 8 visitors to the market, and 2 family members and
friends. A total of 1917 persons who had frequented the Market
between 5 and 19 Apr 2003 were identified as possible contacts, and
they comprised 964 tenants and stall holders, 616 employees and
workers, and 337 regular customers.

Summary of SARS cases

A summary of the SARS cases to date:

Discharged: 137
Hospitalised: 39 (including 15 in intensive care)
Deaths: 22 + 1 (pending further post mortem test results)
Probable Cases: 198

Suspect Cases: 123 (including 9 children below 18)
Under home quarantine: 2807

[A] Latest Canadian Numbers on SARS 28 Apr 2003
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update42.html>

As of 28 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 344 probable
or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in
Canada. There have been 21 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission
has been limited to specific transmission settings such as
households, hospitals, and specific community settings.

The details of the cases to date are as follows:

Ontario is reporting 142 probable and 122 suspect cases.
British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 63 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 6 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.

Total no. of probables discharged: 75
Total no. of probables recovering at home: 2
Total no. of suspects discharged: 85
Total no. of suspects recovering at home: 70

These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 28 Apr 2003.

Health Canada Rescinds Routine Access to Ribavirin
Health Canada, through its Special Access Programme, will no longer
provide routine access to ribavirin for the treatment of SARS. This
decision stems from a recommendation by a working group advising
Health Canada, comprised of health experts and clinicians from across
Canada and representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in the United States. After reviewing the existing
anecdotal clinical experience with ribavirin, negative results from
in vitro testing with ribavirin against the SARS-related coronavirus,
and knowledge of reports of serious and unexpected adverse drug
reactions, the working group reached a consensus that there is no
data to support the continued use of ribavirin outside of clinical
trials at this time. On 27 Apr 2003, Health Canada notified
physicians that the continued access to the drug is contingent upon
the submission and review of data in the possession of physicians
with respect to the use, safety, and efficacy of ribavirin for the
treatment of SARS. Physicians currently treating patients with
ribavirin are also strongly advised to critically re-examine the
risk/benefit for each patient before continuing treatment.

[B] SARS Epidemiologic Summaries: 26 Apr 2003
Summary of SARS cases potentially exposed in Canada and diagnosed
internationally
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/pef-dep/sars-es-int20030426_e.html>

Health Canada is working with our international partners to
investigate reports of SARS cases diagnosed abroad who were thought
to have been exposed in Canada. This report covers cases reported
internationally in Australia, Germany, United States, and the
Philippines. Health Canada was notified 24 Apr 2003 of a reported
Bulgarian case of SARS; this is being investigated and information
will be provided when available.

Australia:
A family of five (2 adults, 3 children) residing in the Greater
Toronto Area departed Toronto on 28 Mar 2003 and arrived in Australia
on 29 Mar 2003. Child A had onset of influenza-like illness symptoms
on 31 Mar 2003 and was hospitalized on 3 Apr 2003 with high fever and
respiratory distress; a chest x-ray revealed infiltrates. Child A was
diagnosed as a SARS case according to the WHO case definition, which
differs from the Canadian SARS case definition by including Toronto
as an "affected area". Child B had onset of cough on 25 Mar 2003.
Child C had onset of cough 1 Apr 2003. Both Child B and Child C were
subsequently reported as probable SARS cases according to the WHO
case definition. All 3 children have since recovered. Both adults
remained well. No clear epidemiologic link to any known SARS cases in
Canada could be established. No secondary transmission was observed.

In Canada, none of the children would have met the case definition
for a probable or suspect case of SARS. Child A would have been
classified as GEO-linked, that is, a person with fever and symptoms
consistent with severe atypical pneumonia who has been in an area
with local chains of transmission of at least 3 generations, who does
not have an epidemiologic link. Children B and C would have been
classified as Persons Under Investigation (PUI).

Germany:
A 26-year-old woman was temporarily residing in Toronto. On 31 Mar
2003 she flew from Toronto to Germany. She was asymptomatic until 3
Apr 2003, when she developed headache, nausea, and vomiting. She
subsequently developed fever (maximum 37.8 C) and cough. She was
admitted to hospital on 7 Apr 2003 and diagnosed with pneumonia.
Chest x-ray revealed infiltrates. No clear epidemiologic link to any
known SARS cases in Canada could be established. No secondary
transmission was observed.

In Canada, this woman would not have met the case definition for
probable or suspect SARS. Rather, because of her sub-38 C temperature
and lack of epidemiologic link, she would have been classified as a
Person Under Investigation.

United States:
A 52-year-old man residing in Pennsylvania travelled alone by car to
Toronto on 28 Mar 2003. He drove back to Pennsylvania alone on 1 Apr
2003. On 3 Apr 2003 he became symptomatic with chills, fatigue,
myalgia, headache, and diaphoresis (excessive sweating). On 6 Apr
2003 a fever of 38.2 C was documented, and on 7 Apr 2003 he developed
respiratory symptoms and was hospitalized on 14 Apr 2003 with
pneumonia. Chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy infiltrates, and serum
was positive for coronavirus antibodies. He was diagnosed with
suspect SARS and would have been diagnosed as such in Canada. This
man was discharged from hospital on 21 Apr 2003. The suspected
exposure was thought to have occurred at a religious meeting he
attended in Toronto on 28-29 Mar 2003, where a symptomatic SARS case
was also present. Pennsylvania health authorities have reported that
a family member had symptoms consistent with the suspect SARS case
definition, but the onset of symptoms in the family member occurred
before having had contact with the 52-year-old man. Therefore, this
family member cannot be considered a transmission of any sort from
the case.

Philippines:
A 46-year-old woman residing in the Greater Toronto Area departed
Toronto on 3 Apr 2003 and arrived in Manila, Philippines on 4 Apr
2003 via Narita Airport in Japan. This case had onset of fever on 6
Apr 2003. On 11 Apr 2003 she developed diarrhea and cough; on 12 Apr
2003 she was admitted to a local hospital, at which time a chest
x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. She continued to deteriorate.
On 13 Apr 2003 5 family members drove her to a speciality hospital in
Manila where she was admitted and diagnosed with probable SARS. She
continued to deteriorate and died the following day. The suspected
exposure was thought to have occurred in Toronto on 1 and 2 Apr 2003,
when on each occasion, she spent a short period of time in the home
of a symptomatic probable SARS case. She did not have direct contact
with this SARS case; it is hypothesized she may have had contact with
fomites in the home of the case. The Philippines authorities have
reported secondary transmission to a health care worker, who has been
diagnosed as a probable SARS case. In addition, the father of the
woman, who was ill with cancer, died and is now being reported by the
Philippine Department of Health as a probable case of SARS. There is
insufficient information at this point to judge whether these 2 cases
of transmission would have been classified as such in Canada, but the
woman would have been classified as a probable case of SARS in Canada.

Summary
Of the 6 persons originating from Canada who were diagnosed abroad as
cases of SARS, 4 would not have met the case definition for probable
or suspect SARS in Canada. Only the case reported in Pennsylvania and
the case reported in the Philippines would have met the SARS case
definition in Canada.

[A] India from Reuters UK 28 Apr 2003 13:25:25 GMT
<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/DEL14232.htm>

India reported 2 new SARS cases on Monday, bringing the total number
of people hit by the virus to 9 since doctors detected the country's
first case in mid-April [2003].

Another 46 people are being tested for SARS, India's director general
of health services, Dr. S. P. Agarwal, told a news conference. The
number of SARS testing facilities was being increased to 6 from 2
after the laboratories complained of being overloaded. One of the
new patients was a Bombay taxi driver who drove a SARS victim who had
travelled from Indonesia, Agarwal said. The second had arrived from
Thailand. The first SARS case was detected in India on 17 Apr 2003
in the coastal resort state of Goa. 5 SARS patients are being treated
in Maharashtra, home state of the financial capital of Bombay, one in
New Delhi and 2 in the eastern state of West Bengal. Some doctors
fear SARS could reach epidemic proportions in India, where people
live cheek by jowl and medical facilities are poor. But government
officials have downplayed the risk, saying authorities can tackle any
outbreak.

[B] China from the Asian Tribune 28 Apr 2003
<http://www.asiantribune.com/show_news.php?id=3982>

With 6 SARS deaths being reported in Inner Mongolia, the province
followed Beijing's example and shut libraries, museums, cinemas, and
internet cafes to check the spread of the epidemic. A total of 7672
people had been quarantined, and quarantine measures were enforced at
a residential quarter of Renmin hospital, 3 dormitory buildings in
the northern Jiaatono university, and 2 dormitory buildings in
Beijing Science and Technology Research Institute. The quarantine
control was also taken in 24 designated SARS patient hospitals, and
in the SARS patient reception areas of 29 general hospitals as well
as the fever outpatient departments in 74 hospitals.

As the nation reeled under the SARS scare, Premier Wen said "I
believe the Chinese people will be even more united and the Chinese
nation will emerge from the SARS disaster stronger than ever".

As of 27 Ap 2003, Beijing had 1114 confirmed cases of SARS and 1191
suspected cases. A total of 56 patients had died.

From Reuters, UK
<http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsArticle.jhtml?type=scienceNews&storyID=2643104>

WHO's chief of communicable diseases, David Heymann, told Reuters in
Bangkok the spread of SARS had peaked in all countries known to have
outbreaks, except China, which by Monday had reported a total of 139
SARS deaths and more than 3106 cases. [note that today's WHO update
did not include case reports from China for today, 28 Apr 2003 -
Mod.MPP]

[C] Malaysia from The Daily Express, Malaysia
<http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=18551>

The Sentosa Mental Hospital in Kuching has been sealed, with some 500
patients and staff of the hospital placed under quarantine due to
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). "Nobody is allowed go in
or out of the hospital. About 200 staff, 80 support staff, and 262
patients of the hospital have been quarantined," Deputy
Director-General of Health Datuk Dr Ismail Merican said Monday [28
Apr 2003].

"We classified one case yesterday (Sunday) as pending (verification),
a 21-year-old man who is a patient of the [Senosa] hospital. He was
sent to the Kuching Hospital on Sunday for fever and cough. There
were also changes in his chest X-ray," Ismail told the daily media
briefing on SARS at the ministry here. Patients of the [Sentosa]
hospital have been in and out of the Kuching Hospital over the last
few days, after it was found that they were coming down with fever
and cough. No SARS case has been confirmed in the [Sentosa] hospital.

[As of 28 Apr 2003 the cumulative totals are 5050 probable cases of
SARS with 321 deaths reported to WHO. Since the last WHO update on
26 Apr 2003 (2 days ago) there have been 214 new cases reported. Of
note, in the past 24 hours there have been only 14 new cases reported
in Hong Kong SAR and no new cases reported from Singapore. Mainland
China continues to have the most numbers of cases reported. Today's
removal of Viet Nam from the list of affected areas is significant --
a demonstration that SARS transmission can be interrupted with
implementation of appropriate control measures. However, one must
keep in mind that the size of the outbreak in Viet Nam was not as
large as those in Hong Kong, China, or Singapore, and the chains of
transmission stayed primarily within the health care environment,
thereby facilitating the rapid implementation of infection control
measures. Of note, in the 26 Apr 2003 SARS update from the Taiwan
CDC (see ProMED-mail SARS - worldwide (73): cases 20030427.1038)
there was mention of a suspected case of SARS with travel from Hanoi
to Taiwan. Clearly clarification of the details surrounding this
suspected case is of interest and importance here.
<http://203.65.72.83/En/dpc/ShowPublication.ASP?RecNo=870>

Of continued concern are the newswire reports of new cases in India,
with the latest count being 9 "confirmed" cases, while the official
reports to WHO are current only through 21 Apr 2003. Given India's
large geographic and population size, these newswire reports are
disconcerting in the absence of official notifications. ProMED-mail
would appreciate receiving any official information on these reports.
