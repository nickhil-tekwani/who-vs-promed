Health Department Closes Lodge As Reports Of Illness Reach 64
-------------------------------------------------------------
CHEYENNE: The State Department of Health shut down a lodge near Dayton as
the tally of visitors from 5 states complaining of stomach illness reached
64. The Department issued a cease-and-desist order against the lodge last
Friday [9 Mar 2001] out of concern that the water supply [may be] tainted
with calicivirus, said Dr. Karl Musgrave, Health Department Director.
Caliciviruses are commonly spread through fecal-oral contact and can cause
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps. Symptoms usually last for
several days in healthy people but could be severe for the elderly, children
and people with weak immune systems,
Visitors who complained of illness included 8 from Minnesota, 12 from North
Dakota, 6 from Montana, 2 from South Dakota and 36 from Wyoming. They
reported illness between 1 Jan and 6 Mar 2001. The lodge was shut down
because it may be unable to comply with a boil order issued last Wednesday
by the Department of Health requiring only bottled or boiled water at the
lodge, including [water used] for dish-washing and cooking. The authorities
are uncertain of how the water became tainted. Possible sources include
sewage from the lodge or snow-melt tainted by wild animals carrying the
[presumptive] calicivirus. On Tue 13 Mar 2001 a team of officials from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the State Departments
of Health and Agriculture was visiting the lodge to determine whether the
20-room complex can comply with the boil order. Also, the team intends to
find out who visited the lodge in recent months and contact them to see if
they had stomach problems.
Visitors began complaining in the first week of February. A multi-agency
investigation looked at potential contamination at about 15 establishments
in the mountains, and narrowed its scope to the Big Horn Mountain Lodge
because 21 people who fell ill visited only that lodge. The water source is
the likely problem because some of the visitors to the lodge did not eat
there but drank at the lodge bar, officials said. The lodge has never
obtained the county or state permits it needs to ensure that its septic and
water systems are constructed properly, said Gary Beach of the Wyoming
Department of Environmental Quality's Water Quality Division (DEQ). The DEQ
has asked the lodge owners to contact the department immediately to seek the
permits, he said. The department will examine how systems are constructed,
he said. Last Friday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an
order requiring the lodge to chlorinate its water daily and monitor for
bacteria. The lodge has complied with the order, EPA officials said.
But the lodge may have violated the cease-and-desist order and allowed
visitors [back on] Saturday, Musgrave said. Will Cramer, co-owner of the
lodge, said on Tuesday that visitors were allowed at the lodge because was
angry about the shutdown, which he felt was unwarranted. "It's having a
huge impact. This is the busiest time of the year," he said. He and his
parents had bought the lodge last July and have no records of septic and
water system permits having been obtained,

[Water treatment practices seem so lax at this establishment that it is a
little unreasonable to single out caliciviruses (of which there is more than
one potential agent) as the sole culprits in this outbreak. - Mod.CP]
