[According to the Saudi MOH summary information, there have now been 483 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 142 deaths reported since September 2012.

The above report mentions 3 newly confirmed cases, all in stable condition, but there is additional mention of a single asymptomatic infection. No details are provided on the asymptomatic infection, so it is unclear whether the MOH has decided to not include asymptomatic infections detected as part of contact tracing as part of the surveillance information or whether this was just a clerical error (failure to remove extraneous information from a template used to prepare the update). Clarification would be greatly appreciated.

A map showing the geographic location of the newly confirmed cases and deaths can be found at the source URL. - Mod.MPP
