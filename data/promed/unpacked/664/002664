Abstract
--------
Background: The occurrence of transplacental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains highly debated. Placental positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in selected cases, but infection or virus-associated disease of fetal tissues or newborns remains to be demonstrated.

Methods: We screened for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein expression [in] placentas from 101 women who delivered between 7 Feb 2020 and 15 May 2020, including 15 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 34 tested negative, and 52 not evaluated as they did not meet testing criteria (32), or delivered before COVID-19 pandemic declaration (20). Immunostain for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) was performed in the placentas of all COVID-19-positive women. One placenta resulted positive for the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, which was further studied by RNA-in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for S transcripts, and by electron microscopy. A comprehensive immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis of the placental inflammatory infiltrate completed the investigations.

Findings: SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were strongly expressed in the placenta of a COVID-19 pregnant woman whose newborn tested positive for viral RNA and developed COVID-19 pneumonia soon after birth. SARS-CoV-2 antigens, RNA and/or particles morphologically consistent with coronavirus were identified in villous syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, in maternal macrophages, and in Hofbauer cells and fetal intravascular mononuclear cells. The placenta intervillous inflammatory infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages expressing activation markers. Absence of villitis was associated with an increase in the number of Hofbauer cells, which expressed PD-L1. Scattered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were identified by immunofluorescence.

Interpretation: We provide first-time evidence for maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely propagated by circulating virus-infected fetal mononuclear cells. Placenta infection was associated with recruitment of maternal inflammatory cells in the intervillous space, without villitis. PD-L1 expression in syncytiotrophoblast and Hofbauer cells, together with limited production of NETs, may have prevented immune cell-driven placental damage, ensuring sufficient maternal-fetus nutrient exchanges.

Evidence before this study: Several recent reports have addressed the question whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can be propagated from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy. Based on current data, evidence for vertical transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is missing. Whereas detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in placental tissue has been recently documented, mechanisms limiting the spreading of virus infection to the newborn remain unknown. Distribution, composition and activation status of immune/inflammatory cells in placenta of COVID-19 pregnant women remain undetermined.

Added value of this study: This study analyzed by immunohistochemistry the expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in 101 placentas (including 15 from COVID-19-proved positive women) collected in Brescia, Italy during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. A single case showed robust expression of the S protein, as well as the N (nucleocapsid) protein in the syncytiotrophoblast. In addition, in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 RNA demonstrated intense signal in the syncytiotrophoblast and in intervillous inflammatory cells, and ultrastructural analysis identified viral particles morphologically consistent with coronavirus localized in the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblast cells, in fetal capillary endothelium, fibroblasts, as well as in fetal intravascular mononuclear cells. Histopathological analysis of the immune/inflammatory cell infiltrate suggests that intervillous presence of activated monocyte-macrophages and neutrophils may represent a histological marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the placenta. This unique histopathological setting of the placenta coincided with early onset of COVID-19 disease in the newborn, consistent with vertical transmission of the infection.

Implications of all the available evidence: Together with previous reports, our study on 101 placentas from mothers collected in the COVID-19 pandemic stage documents that mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a rare yet documented event. The findings provided in this study reveal the passage of SARS-CoV-2 across the maternal-fetal interface to infect fetal-derived cells of the placenta.

[This is strong evidence demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 transmission across the placenta from mother to fetus. There is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in utero, highlighting the importance of caution by pregnant women in environments where virus exposure is possible. Fortunately, disease in neonates does not appear to be severe, unlike Zika virus. - Mod.LK]

Abstract: We present a preterm infant who developed a fever and mild respiratory disease on the 2nd day of life. Infant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal testing was positive at 24 and 48 hours of life. Placenta histopathology revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Further understanding of the risk factors that lead to in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed.

Discussion: This report represents a case of congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection in an infant born via vaginal delivery to a mother with COVID-19 presenting primarily with gastrointestinal manifestations. It is unlikely that the respiratory distress observed in this infant was due to prematurity because it did not start until the 2nd day of life. Although the infant had an elevated neutrophil count, the lymphocyte count was decreased, as has been described in adults with COVID-19. Viral hepatitis was excluded by the absence of elevated liver transaminases.

Early reports of obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy results in infants with no clinical features of infection and negative nasopharyngeal testing (9; see full list of references at source URL). However, there are now an increasing number of neonatal cases with possible congenital or intrapartum-acquired neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. To date, 8 infants with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection proximate to delivery have been reported (2-6).

Abstract: The COVID-19 outbreak has a growing impact on global health; vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still controversial. In this article, we describe a case of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a newborn with respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Introduction: Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus is still controversial. Chen et al. (3; see source URL for full list of references) described 9 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy: All women underwent caesarean section, with no evidence of vertical transmission. Zhu et al. (4) reported on 10 neonates of mothers with COVID-19 pneumonia, 2 of whom delivered vaginally: All these babies were symptomatic, but there was no demonstration of vertical transmission of the virus. In a case series, 3 babies of 3 women affected by COVID-19 pneumonia were reported negative for SARS-CoV-2 on oropharyngeal swab, umbilical cord blood, and serum (5). Two other case reports showed no evidence of mother-to-child transmission in utero or at delivery, either by caesarean section or vaginally (6-8). Dong et al. (9) reported a case of an asymptomatic infant born to a mother with COVID-19 pneumonia, with elevated immunoglobulin M antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at 2 hours of age, but negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs. Similarly, Zeng H et al. (10) describes the course of 6 mothers who gave birth to 6 infants; 2 of them had raised immunoglobulin M, but RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative on throat swabs and blood. Recently Zeng L et al. (11) reported 3 cases of early-onset neonatal COVID-19; those neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on day 2 of life on both nasopharyngeal and anal swab.

Case report: We report a case of early-onset neonatal COVID-19 infection in a male infant born at 38 weeks of gestation by induced vaginal delivery. A 29-year-old primiparous woman, with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia during the 1st trimester of pregnancy developed fever 9 days before delivery. Seven days later, she was admitted to our hospital with fever (38.0 deg C/100.4 deg F) and slight parenchymal thickening in the left retrocardiac region at chest roentgenogram. The SpO2 was 97%-100%. A nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at RT-PCR. She was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone. Since thrombocytopenia had become severe, intravenous immunoglobulins were also administered and labor induction started with dinoprostone vaginal pessary. Rupture of the membranes occurred during labor; after early cord clamping, the newborn was transferred by a midwife not involved in the care of the mother to a dedicated neonatal area. Apgar index was 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes; birth weight was 2840  g (6.26 lb). Skin-to-skin contact and breast-feeding were not possible immediately after delivery because of postpartum maternal hemorrhage. The newborn was admitted to the nursery, and the result of the 1st RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab was inconclusive (amplification of less than 3 genes). In the nursery, the baby was fed with formula.

Approximately, at 12 hours of life, he began to show signs of feeding intolerance with abdominal distension and hyporeactivity, which rapidly worsened. The newborn was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), enteral feeding was stopped, and total parenteral nutrition and antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamycin) were started via an umbilical venous catheter. A roentgenogram of chest and abdomen showed no pulmonary abnormalities and generalized intestinal dilatation and some air fluid levels. Blood cultures performed at birth and at NICU admission were negative; C-reactive protein was normal at 2 different times; blood count was normal at birth, but mild leukopenia (5170/mcL; normal values, 9000-30 000/mcL), significant increase of lactate dehydrogenase (1065 U/L; normal values, 290-775 U/L), and mild increase of troponin T were evident at 3 days of life. Nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, repeated at 36 hours of life, was positive. The baby's clinical condition and gas exchange worsened on the following day, with development of partially compensated respiratory acidosis and mild hyperlacticaemia. Oxygen saturation was normal. Low-flow nasal cannula (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.21) was administrated. Chest roentgenogram showed mild bilateral increased interstitial markings, and on physical examination abdominal distension was evident. A roentgenogram contrast study of the digestive tract was conducted, which showed normal progression of the contrast material to the rectum. During the night, the baby needed endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.21). A new chest roentgenogram showed further increase of interstitial markings on the base of the left lung. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on tracheal aspiration was also positive. The clinical condition of the baby gradually improved, a 3-day course of chloroquine was started, and mechanical ventilation was stopped 36 hours after intubation. Enteral feeding was gradually increased without further problems. A new RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal (at 17 days of life) and on anal swab (at 19 days of life) were positive. The infant was discharged in good clinical condition 18 days after birth. Two different control nasopharyngeal swabs repeated approximately at 1 month of life were negative.

Discussion: This case confirms the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the newborn. Maternal fever for 9 days, the absence of postnatal mother-baby contact, and the early onset of neonatal symptoms may suggest a transplacental transmission rather than birth canal infection.

The major limitation in our study was that serologic tests and RT-PCR on amniotic fluid, placenta, and vaginal secretions were not performed. This is, to our knowledge, the 1st case of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab at birth.

[2] Fido: Virus-sniffing dogs
Date: Fri 25 Sep 2020 11:10 EDT

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/25/any-breed-could-do-it-dogs-might-be-covid-testers-best-friend


It is simple and pain-free, could be used to test for coronavirus in care homes, airports and schools, and might just be more realistic than the UK government's GBP 100 billion (USD 127 billion) "Operation Moonshoot" mass screening plan. Its name? Fido.

Around the world -- from the UK to Finland, Spain, Brazil, Lebanon and Australia -- teams of researchers are training dogs to sniff out COVID-19. And some say the idea of training hundreds of thousands of canine noses to check for coronavirus is not as far-fetched as it may sound.

How do dogs do it? At Finland's Helsinki airport, where 4 COVID-19 sniffer dogs have begun work in a state-funded pilot scheme, passengers dab their skin with a wipe, which is placed in a beaker next to others containing control scents. If the dog detects the virus -- shown by yelping, pawing, or lying down -- the passenger takes a free swab test to verify its verdict.

Speaking to the Guardian, scientists said any breed could in theory be trained -- a process that takes between 2 and 10 weeks -- raising the prospect of pet canines joining an army of COVID sniffers. Professor Dominique Grandjean, of the national veterinary school of Alfort in France, who is leading a research team using bomb detection, cancer detection, and search and rescue dogs, said the canines were not sniffing the virus itself but rather tell-tale volatile chemicals produced when the virus infects cells, and released by the body. The chemicals should be produced whether or not an infected person has symptoms, and only if the virus is active -- suggesting that unlike current lab techniques, dogs are unlikely to pick up "dead" virus, Grandjean said.

Results from Grandjean and his colleagues, which are yet to be peer-reviewed, show sweat samples from COVID patients were correctly identified by 8 dogs at least 83% of the time, with some making a correct identification in 100% of the trials they underwent. The team say they have since validated their approach in 3 separate trials, although the results have yet to be published. Grandjean thinks the approach has potential to become widespread. "We can have one dog per retirement house that is trained and this dog would be able every single morning to check everybody, just by walking by," he said. His team plans to work with a French organisation to provide COVID-sniffing dogs to care homes.

Another research project is underway in Germany, using saliva rather than sweat samples. In a pilot study using 8 dogs and 1012 samples, the animals correctly spotted COVID-positive samples 83% of the time on average, and correctly identified COVID-negative samples 96% of the time. The lead author of the research, Professor Holger Volk of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hanover, said the current "have you got it" COVID lab test correctly identified the virus was present about 75% of the time, and correctly ruled it out almost 100% of the time.

Volk said his team was working on whether the dogs can distinguish between different viruses, and Grandjean was upbeat. "Different types of virus have different volatile organic compounds coming from cell cultures, meaning [these] compounds are specific to each virus," he said, although he noted this had yet to be proved for SARS-CoV-2. Dr. David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said the canine approach was likely to be hugely beneficial.

[The dogs trained to detect SARS-CoV-2 could be deployed to locations where screening of individuals is important. Even if the scent is not specific to SARS-CoV-2 and dogs also detect cold coronaviruses or other closely related viruses, it still could serve as an excellent screening tool, to be followed up by a molecular assay, especially a point-of-care rapid assay as has been championed by Michael Mina, among others. Any way that infectious individuals can be identified and separated out will help control spread of virus to susceptible individuals. Dogs have a history of being used to sniff out disease, and training them seems to be fast and not difficult. - Mod.LK]

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (85 468), followed by the USA (58 713) and Brazil (32 670) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 50.6% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5689 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (24-25 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (30 989), France (15 797), Argentina (12 969), Colombia (7494), Russia (7212), UK (6873), Israel (5784), Peru (5654), and Mexico (5401); 36 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. Eight of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 6 were from the Americas region (unchanged from yesterday).

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 1.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 0.40%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
