Assam poultry deaths mystery
----------------------------
More than 10 000 poultry have died in some villages in India's northeastern
state of Assam. The deaths have triggered panic among villagers, who fear
the dreaded bird flu has finally reached India's border region with
southeast Asia. But the authorities say it is too early to conclude that
the deaths were due to bird flu.
The deaths of the hens and chickens were reported from nearly 20 villages
of Assam's Dhubri district bordering Bangladesh. Dhubri's district
commissioner, Prashanta Barua, told the BBC that the majority of village
households in certain areas of the district had lost most of their poultry.
He said the birds would suddenly start to quiver and then die within a few
hours; more than 10 000 poultry had died in these villages during the last
10 days.
An owner of a poultry farm in Charakura, said he has lost all his 300 birds
to the mystery disease in the last 6 days.
A rickshaw puller in Birsinghpara and owner of a small poultry farm, said
all of his 200 birds had been lost to the mystery disease.
The Dhubri district authorities say they have asked the veterinary
authorities to investigate the bird deaths. District commissioner Prashanta
Barua said it would not be correct to say at this stage that the bird
deaths were caused by the deadly avian flu.
All of India's northeastern states are on high alert, because most of them
have borders with Burma and China, where the bird flu has spread. [neither
Burma nor Tibet, the Chinese province bordering India, have so far been
reported as infected. -Mod.AS]

For a 29-year-old proprietor of a 200-sq-ft Broiler Shop in suburban
Mumbai, business has been slow in the last week.
From selling 45-50 broilers a day, his business has dropped to half. His
little shop is packed with live chickens, and he doesn't know what else to
do except hope that things will change soon.
At this time of the year, post Bakri-Id [the Muslim feast of sacrifice,
Id-ul-Adha, in India pronounced Idul Azha and popularly known as Bakri Id],
his business usually slumps for 3 or 4 days as customers are finishing off
the mutton in their refrigerators. But soon after, clients flock back for
the white meat, and he is back to selling 45-50 broilers a day.
This time, however, that hasn't happened. It has long gone and he is still
waiting for things to normalise. Though he doesn't like to admit it, he
acknowledges that the news of bird flu (as avian influenza is also called)
spreading to 9 countries in Asia has driven some of his clients away for
the time being.
In India, the bird flu panic started only after the avian disease reached
Pakistan. Things quickly got so bad that smaller poultry farmers were ready
to sell the perishable commodity at any price possible.
Anuradha Desai, chairperson of Pune-based Venkateshwara Hatcheries
(Venky's) and chairperson of the National Egg Co-ordination Committee
(NECC) says that the worst-affected was the Delhi market, where traders
took full advantage of the panic and bought chicken from smaller farmers at
extremely low prices. Overall, in the last 2 weeks there has been a 10 -15
percent reduction in chicken prices from Rs 46 (USD 1.00) per kg for a live
chicken.
"The change in price and slump of domestic demand has been noticed only in
certain pockets like the north and west," says M B Desai, chairman (Mumbai
zone) of the NECC.
Clearly, it is a situation in which even larger players in the Rs
7500-crore (USD 1.66 billion) chicken market have been hit. An organised
player like the Rs 14-crore (USD 3.1 million) family-run Mumbai-based
Prabhat Poultry, which has been in the business for over 40 years, has seen
a 35 percent reduction in chicken sales in its 4 outlets across Mumbai.
Out of its total business, eggs account for 60 percent, broilers account
for 30 percent, and the remaining comes from fast food and the processed
division. Some others have seen volumes drop 5-6 percent. "Consumers have
been asking questions, and we've been telling them there's no need to worry
since there is no bird flu in India," says Sudhanshu Naik, general manager,
Prabhat Poultry.
What exactly is the cause for concern? Bird flu, as it is commonly known,
has been around for over 50 years. But the difference now is that it has
jumped species and people who have been in contact with infected birds have
caught the illness. Several deaths have already been reported from
countries like Vietnam.
In fact, the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak led to the culling of the entire
chicken population of 1.5 million birds in 3 days to bring the situation
under control. In the latest attack, the flu has spread to countries like
Vietnam, Thailand, and even Pakistan.
Customers in India are definitely worried. Even institutions like the Taj
group of hotels say customers have changed their eating patterns. At The
Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Mumbai, the food and beverage department has
noticed a 10 percent reduction in chicken consumption in the last 2 weeks.
So what happens to poultry companies? Most are optimistic that the
situation will improve by the end of this weekend as more consumers gain
confidence in the organised players. Also, players like Venky's, which has
the capacity to process 25 000-30 000 birds a day, is now looking at export
orders in a big way.
In some parts of the world, imports from bird-flu-hit countries like
Thailand have been banned and that, says Desai, presents a huge opportunity
for India. "Even if domestic demand slumps in the short term, export demand
is huge," she says. Chicken prices in the global market have shot up from
950 USD per tonne to 1400 USD per tonne, the highest-ever reported price.
All players -- big or small -- are keeping their fingers crossed that the
situation doesn't worsen. If that happens, the larger players will be able
to bear the brunt of a dip in the market. But the smaller, unorganised
players will be roasted.

[The above news items represent the current state of alertness and fears in
vast parts of Asia. Hopefully, in case of suspected HPAI spread to hitherto
unaffected countries, veterinary investigations and subsequent laboratory
tests will be carried out at an early stage. Transparency should be
significantly improved compared to that recently experienced in several of
the countries affected in Eastern Asia.
India's information to the OIE indicates status 0000, meaning "disease
never reported". According to the last update of OIE's Handistatus
database, the last monthly Indian report, indicating "no case", related to
October 2003. - Mod.AS]
