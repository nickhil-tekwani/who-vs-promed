2 Long County Horses Infected with Eastern Equine Encephalitis
--------------------------------------------------------------
Horse owners in the Coastal Empire should be on
alert, after 2 animals in Long County are
diagnosed with Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).
Officials from the Coastal Health District say
the 2 horses were not from the same farm, and both have been euthanized.

Norwood Stables in Savannah cares for about 2 or
3 dozen horses throughout the year. Co-owner
Linda Brown says they take extra steps to protect
their animals against illnesses like EEE. "We
have the vet inoculate twice a year for all the mosquito diseases," she said.

Brown said they check health certificates for all
animals that come to their stables. "It's very
important to know that they're healthy as they're
coming in, because you don't want your horses
that are healthy exposed," said Brown. They are
also careful about standing water so mosquitos
can't breed. "All our horse troughs are dumped everyday," she said.

Health officials say EEE in horses is fatal 70-90
percent of the time. Epidemiologist Robert
Thornton with the Coastal Health District says
the disease is preventable, so owners should have their horses vaccinated.

"When you think about humans, you know, we're
indoors and outdoors. But animals, in particular
horses, spend a lot of time, much more time than
humans, outdoors, so they're more vulnerable to
mosquito bites and thus more vulnerable to
mosquito-borne illnesses," said Thornton.

Horses aren't the only ones that need protection from the virus.

"The disease in horses is it lets us know as a
surveillance mechanism that the disease is
present in the area, and therefore humans should
take precautions," said Thornton.

Humans cannot get the disease from horses, but
they can get it from mosquitos. A Beaufort County
child died of the disease in August 2007. Even
though there is a vaccine for horses, there is no vaccine for humans.

To protect yourself and your family from
mosquitos, health officials want you to remember the 5 D's:
-- Dusk - Mosquitoes carrying West Nile Virus usually bite at dusk and dawn.
-- Dawn - Avoid outdoor activity at dusk and
dawn if possible. If you must be outside, be sure
to protect yourself from bites
-- Dress - Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to
reduce the amount of exposed skin.
-- DEET - Cover exposed skin with an insect
repellent containing the chemical DEET, which is
the most effective repellent against mosquitos.
-- Drain - Empty any containers holding standing
water because they can be excellent breeding
grounds for virus-carrying mosquitoes.

[It is very sad to lose a pet and companion
because of a preventable disease. This article
does not tell us if the animals were vaccinated.
But there is a combination vaccine of West Nile
virus and Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and
some other mosquito-borne viruses. EEE has the
shortest titer, of about 6 months. And for full
protection EEE must be give at least every 6
months. Generally a combination vaccine is
recommended, followed by a booster in 3 weeks.
With regards to EEE, the EEE portion should be repeated in 6 months. - Mod.TG]
