Tanzania suspends use of new malaria drug
-----------------------------------------
The Tanzanian Ministry of Health suspended [its plan to] offer a new
treatment to cure malaria as the preferred measure nationwide, local
newspaper Daily News reported on Thursday. Health minister Anna Adallah
said in the National Assembly in Dodoma on Wednesday that the department
had received reports of patients experiencing adverse side effects from
using the combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethanmine (SP)[Fansidar], a new
treatment [not that new, Roche's data sheet was copyright 1996. - Mod.SH]
to cure malaria. The government [is] reconsidering its decision to [list]
SP as the preferred treatment nationwide, [on account of] its adverse side
effects, the report quoted the minister as saying. Abdallah said a team of
researchers was looking for alternative treatment that could be used to
cure malaria, which kills an average of 100 000 Tanzanians a year, mostly
women and children, but she did not say how long the research would take.
Tanzania, like many other developing countries, is undergoing a crisis in
malarial drugs, and furthermore, a lack of ongoing research and development
makes the prospects for better medicines very dim.

Drug resistant malaria threatens control efforts in Kenya
---------------------------------------------------------
Drugs being used to treat malaria patients in Kericho and Kisii districts
[of Kenya] have become ineffective. A special team headed by the
coordinator of the National Malaria Control Unit, Dr Sam Ochola, yesterday
sounded an alarm after the experts recorded high levels of the disease's
resistance to sulfa pyrimethamine, the Ministry of Health's recommended
drugs. Dr Ochola said Kericho highlands were the worst hit, with more than
7000 patients being treated at various hospitals in the region. By the end
of last week, 4039 patients had been treated at the Kisii District
Hospital. Dr Ochola said medical authorities had been instructed to combine
drugs to contain the outbreak. "Individual drugs are proving a flop so we
urge all medics to adopt combination therapy system of treatment." He said
that drug resistance study centres at Chulaimbo and Bondo in Nyanza
Province had been put on alert to speed up research on resistance to the
drugs. The findings are expected to help the government formulate new
policies on malaria treatment.

[Tanzania was the third country (after Malawi and Kenya) to abandon
chloroquine as the first choice drug for treatment of malaria in the
national treatment guidelines. The main concern with SP (Fansidar) has been
rapid development of resistance, not side effects. The report above brings
in a new aspect without providing details on the observed adverse events.
Efficacy studies up to 2001 showed SP resistance in up to 25 per cent of
observed cases in the areas of Kenya, Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania
bordering Lake Victoria. A World Health Organization review of randomised
controlled trials of the clinical treatment efficacy of SP between 1998 and
2000 found that the failure rate at day 14 varied between 47 per cent
(Mozambique), 26 per cent (Kenya), and 42 per cent (Uganda). In comparison
the failure rate was 5 per cent in The Gambia. SP resistance seems to be an
imminent problem in East Africa. 足 Mod.EP]
