Mukwonago High School is among the schools in the state [Wisconsin] with reported cases of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) among athletes, according to Laura Heidelmeier, Mukwonago Areas School District nurse.

Heidelmeier said HFMD virus usually affects younger children and children in daycare and is not typically found at the high school level. It's considered a minor illness, like the common cold.

Families in the district were alerted after the cases of HFMD were confirmed.

In young children symptoms of HFMD are mild and usually resolve in 7-10 days, according to a fact sheet from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. HFMD usually starts with a fever, poor appetite and a sore throat. 1-2 days after the fever starts, painful sores usually develop in the mouth, beginning as small red spots that blister and often become ulcers. A skin rash also develops, usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

Symptoms usually appear 3-7 days after exposure. HFMD is spread by contact with discharges from the nose or throat or the feces of infected people, according to the fact sheet.

The best way to prevent the spread of illness is to wash hands often, Heidelmeier said.

Parents in the district were reminded that if their child is experiencing a fever or rash on their hands, feet, and/or mouth, they should be kept home from school until at least 24 hours after the fever breaks and exposed vesicles are dry. Students will be checked by school health assistants to make sure the lesions are dry before being allowed back at school, Heidelmeier added.

Little kids and nasty germs just seem to go together.

Local health officials say there is now some outbreaks of a common childhood ailment known as hand-foot-mouth disease, one caused by the coxsackie virus.

It is a fairly benign, yet easily transmittable, illness that occurs most often in preschool-age children.

The illness manifests itself in small blisters around the mouth, hands, and feet, and is usually preceded by a slight fever, usually not a high fever but one that can last for a few days, said local health officials.

There is no treatment for this ailment, but it rarely requires more than a few days home and some over-the-counter medications to lower the fever and treat any discomfort, health officials said.

"It is a fairly mild disease with fever, some blisters, and it is self-limiting. It goes away after a while; usually the incubation is 3-6 days," said Yavapai County Community Health Services Epidemiologist Stephen Everett.

He said his department has been advised by several local day care and preschools that they have some outbreaks. The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not require tracking of this illness because it is a common childhood ailment that tends to run its course without complications.

Of course, Everett said he always advises families to consult with their family physicians when a child is ill just to be certain that they get proper care, and if other symptoms arise they are attended to immediately. In rare cases, Everett said this can spread into the spinal cord and cause a mild form of meningitis.

As for prevention, Everett said the key to preventing contagious illnesses of this type are to keep children home from daycare or preschool when they spike any level of fever. The condition is most contagious when a child has a fever, he said.

Most preschool and day care administrators are aware when outbreaks occur to do thorough cleanings of all communal toys and gathering places, and to be cautious when changing diapers as the virus is also found in a child's stool, he said. Regular handwashing with young children is always advisable, he noted.

Yavapai Regional Medical Center Marketing and Communications Director Ken Boush advised on Tue 4 Oct 2016, that the hospital's PhysicanCare Ponderosa Pediatric practice reported a recent increase in this ailment among their young patients.

Everett said the condition is most common in summer, spring, and fall, with the virus typically becoming dormant come the winter months.

Outbreaks are "not unusual," Everett said. "We have them every year. What we try to stress, and some parents have a hard time with this, is do not send kids to school if they have a fever... they spread disease," Everett said, noting the flu can spread in the same way. "It's tough for parents because if their kid isn't in daycare, they're not at work ... But it's important. If a kid has a fever, don't send them to school!"
