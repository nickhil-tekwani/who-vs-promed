A surge in cases of hand-foot-mouth disease in Oldham and Rochdale [Greater Manchester] has prompted health professionals in our region to warn parents to look out for the signs.

It causes red spots on the tongue and mouth and a rash to the fingers and soles of the feet.

The illness is very contagious and common in children under 10. Most cases don't need medical attention, but mums and dads are being told if symptoms don't ease after a week to speak to a doctor.

There's been a recent spate of cases in Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale. The 1st signs are a high temperature, loss of appetite, a cough, and a sore throat. After a couple of days, spots can develop inside the mouth and on the tongue and they can become painful ulcers that make eating and drinking difficult. A rash can then develop on the hands and feet. They can become blisters, which are itchy and uncomfortable.

Health experts say the best way to treat the illness is to keep the child at home and keep them hydrated.

If ulcers in the mouth are painful, soft foods and paracetamol are recommended. Symptoms should last between a week and 10 days, and most cases won't need medical attention.

If symptoms last longer or children show signs of dehydration, have fits, a very high temperature, are unusually tired or unrousable, or if their skin is painful, red, swollen, or hot to the touch, then parents are being told to speak to the doctor.

To minimise the spread of the illness, health experts say you should wash your hands and disinfect contaminated surfaces.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is most common in children under 10, especially those under 4 years of age. HFMD is extremely contagious; it often spreads among groups of children, particularly in nurseries and schools. The viruses that cause the disease are usually spread in mucus or saliva droplets, when someone who has it coughs or sneezes. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with the fluid from the blisters of a person infected with the virus. An infected person can also spread the virus if they don't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, as the virus can be passed in faeces.

Patients are most contagious while they still have blisters and mouth ulcers, which is usually for up to 7 to 10 days. However patients can continue to pass the virus in their faeces for several weeks, and may still be mildly infectious during this time.

HFMD is spread very easily. There are some things you can do to reduce your risk of catching or spreading it:
- wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before you eat and after you go to the toilet;
- cover mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Use a tissue and wash your hands afterwards;
- clean surfaces that may have been in contact with saliva or faeces with cleaning products containing bleach;
- dispose properly of used tissues and nappies after changing your baby;
- wash soiled clothing, towels, and bedding at a hot temperature;
- don't share cups, utensils, or towels with people who are infected;
- don't deliberately pierce blisters.
- try to avoid contact with other people -- particularly pregnant women -- as much as you can while you have symptoms.
