_Onchocera lupi_, a round worm, has been isolated from a domestic dog in Albuquerque NM. This dog represents the 6th of recently diagnosed eye granulomas detected and treated by a local veterinary eye-specialist in Albuquerque NM. This is believed to represent a new emerging disease of domestic canines in the Southwest USA.

_Onchocera lupi_ was first isolated from a wolf in Europe. This helminth is thought to have a symbiotic relationship with an insect bacteria which aids in the adult worm's replication. After an insect bite, immature _O. lupi_ micrfofilaria are transferred from the insect to the dog and reside in the dog's skin, eventually migrating to its eye socket before replication.

An adult round worm nodule with multiple _O. lupi_ adult worms was found in this dog's eye. If left untreated, it could have caused blindness. This dog was treated with tetracycline antibiotic and prednisone for 3 weeks prior to surgical incision yesterday (1 Mar 2012) of the worm-filled granulomous nodule in his eye. Post surgery the dog is receiving more prednisone, antibiotics, and ivermectin (Heartworm preventative). If necessary the dog will also receive an anti-parasitic agent (immiticide), identical to the one given to humans for River Blindness in Africa to kill off any remaining adult worms. African River Blindness is caused by a different species of Onchocera but we think the same anti-parasitic agent will be effective in this case.

It is believed that the black fly was the insect vector for this round worm's transmission. Black flies nest in fast-running river waters and this particular dog had been swimming in the fast-running Jemez River in North Central New Mexico last fall. As of this date _O. lupi_ has not been confirmed in the black flies of this river.

DNA analysis of this dog's excised worms are currently being conducted. Future studies are currently being sought to determine if the black fly was indeed the carrier of this disease. In the interim I believe it is advisable that any canine pets that reside near fast-running river waters in mountainous USA regions receive preventative Heartworm medication year round, to deter the possibility of acquiring Dog River Blindness from _O. Lupi_.

[It will be interesting to learn if the insect link is the black fly. However, Heartworm preventative medication should be used year around regardless of your location. Your pets health is not worth the risk of the unpleasant discomfort and potential death in this manner. Even though you may live in a colder climate, mosquitoes like warm basement and other buildings. I have been the victim of a winter mosquito in a building in the northern US. Consequently, whether it is prevention of heartworms or O. lupi, dogs should be on treatment year around.

In the past decades, cases of canine ocular onchocercosis have been reported worldwide, particularly in the United States and Europe in human beings. Onchocerca lupi, originally described from a wolf, has been implicated in some of these cases, and its zoonotic role has been hypothesized on the basis of the reexamination of 2 cases of human ocular onchocerciasis. The nematode was identified as O. lupi based on its morphology and molecular phylogenetic analysis of partial cox1 and 12S ribosomal DNA genes. The results suggest that O. lupi should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other eye parasitic infections in humans. The role of dogs as natural hosts of O. lupi and the vectors of this zoonotic parasite need to be investigated.

Perhaps it is the black fly that should be examined as a means of transmission or even a potential link between hosts or as the vector.
