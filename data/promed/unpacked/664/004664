Two cases of an infection, which can be caught from rats' pee in waterways [rivers or canals], have been confirmed in the South West [England]. The UK Health Security Agency has revealed the cases in its quarterly report on animal-associated infections.

Two of the total of 4 confirmed cases of leptospirosis in England in the first 3 months of this year [2022] were in the South West, with one in London and one in the East of the country. The agency's report said all cases were in men aged between 28 and 69.

One was linked to canal water and 2 other patients reported exposure to rats, with one also exposed to farm animals. The agency said there were also 23 probable cases of the disease nationwide in the first quarter of this year [2022].

Leptospirosis is also known as Weil's disease, and the NHS [National Health Service] says it is rare in the UK. It is spread in the pee of infected animals -- most commonly rats, mice, cows, pigs and dogs.

The NHS warns people can be infected from soil or when freshwater containing infected urine gets in someone's mouth, eyes or a cut. That can happen during activities like kayaking, outdoor swimming or fishing. It can also be caught by touching an infected animal's blood or flesh, usually from working with animals or animal parts.

The NHS advises anyone who has been exposed to infected pee should contact their GP if they have a high temperature, feel hot and shivery, have a headache, feel sick (nausea), have diarrhoea, or have aching muscles and joints, red eyes, or loss of appetite.

The NHS website says: "It's very rare to get leptospirosis from pets, other people or bites."

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed worldwide. Although more common in tropical areas of the world, leptospirosis is also found in temperate areas such the United Kingdom with around 40-75 laboratory confirmed cases reported each year (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/577125/Leptospirosis_Enhanced_Surveillance_Protocol.pdf).

Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar-specific.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, swine, and perhaps river otters) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with _Leptospira_. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals. The risk of acquiring _Leptospira_ infection is increased with exposure to inland waterways in the UK and has been raised in several prior ProMED posts (see the See Also section below).

Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic those of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805) for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this. However, a Cochrane review of clinical research, testing whether taking doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis, found that data from trials, which "targeted different kinds of people -- travelers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students -- did not support the practice in all cases, though short-term travelers with a potential for high-risk exposure may be helped" (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007342.pub2).

Although vaccines are available for immunizing non-human animals against some serovars of _Leptospira_ and are available in some countries for humans, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans in the United States.

South West England is one of 9 official regions of England; South West England consists of the counties of Bristol, Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, Dorset, Devon, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire, and cities including Bath, Bristol, Bournemouth, Cheltenham, Exeter, Gloucester, Plymouth and Swindon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_England).
