Villagers in eastern India are continuing to eat chickens killed by bird
flu and there are signs the virus may be spreading among poultry, an
official said.

West Bengal animal resources minister Anisur Rahman told AFP the situation
in the affected areas was "horrible," and that more suspect cases had been
reported on the state's borders with Nepal and Bangladesh. "The ignorance
of villagers is one of the main hurdles. They are carrying the dead
chickens without any protective gear," he said. "Most villagers are not
aware of the disease. They are eating the dead chickens. Their children are
playing with the infected chickens in the courtyards. It's horrible,"
Rahman added.

So far, 6 districts in West Bengal state have reported outbreaks of avian
flu among poultry. People typically catch the disease by coming into direct
contact with infected poultry, but experts fear the deadly H5N1 strain of
the virus may mutate into a form easily transmissible between humans.

Rahman said there were fears it could be spreading further afield in the
state, with suspect poultry spotted in the hill resort of Darjeeling on the
border with Nepal, and in several villages in Cooch Behar bordering
Bangladesh, which is also fighting a bird flu outbreak. "Blood samples of
the dead poultry have been sent for tests. We are awaiting the report," he
said. The epicentre of the outbreak is Margram village, 240 km (150 miles)
from the state capital Kolkata. Rahman said authorities had so far killed
200 000 chickens and ducks, and were planning to cull 500 000 more in the
next 3 to 4 days.

The outbreak is the 3rd in India -- home to 1.1 billion people -- since
2006 but it has not had any human cases, although it is the worst so far
because it is more widespread, according to the World Health Organization
(WHO).

Some 30 million rupees (USD 770 000) has been set aside to compensate
poultry owners -- although farmers are reportedly opposing the slaughter of
their birds because they want the cash immediately.

Bangladesh, meanwhile, reported another outbreak of [avian flu] near the
border with India -- taking the number of affected districts to 26 out of
64. Bangladesh government spokesman Salahuddin Khan said nearly 5000
chickens have been destroyed around a farm in the northern district of
Natore. Authorities have slaughtered at least 355 000 chickens, ducks, and
pigeons since the 1st outbreak of the disease in February last year [2007].

But experts have said some outbreaks may not have been reported, as farmers
preferred to cover them up, fearing they might not be able to sell their
birds in the market.

Migratory birds have been largely blamed for the global spread of the
disease, which has killed more than 200 people worldwide since 2003.

Health workers struggled on Monday [21 Jan 2008] to contain India's worst
outbreak of bird flu as more than 500 000 backyard chickens in the
country's east awaited slaughter, an official said. Bird flu has been
confirmed in 6 districts of West Bengal state, said Anisur Rahman, the
state's animal husbandry minister. Some 100 000 poultry have died of bird
flu, and officials have slaughtered some 150 000 of 700 000 birds scheduled
to be killed as a precautionary measure, Rahman said.

Authorities were awaiting test results to determine whether it was the
virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu, which has been blamed for the deaths of
at least 218 people worldwide since 2003, according to WHO.

Officials were having trouble containing the outbreak because it has
largely struck poultry living in tens of thousands of homes rather than at
farms, Rahman said.

[The extensive spread of H5N1 in India, reportedly involving very large
number of small backyard holdings, is bad news, from the perspectives both
of disease control and of potential infection in humans. The Indian
authorities will have to make soon a decision between continuing the
stamping-out policy and the possible implementation of mass vaccinations. -
