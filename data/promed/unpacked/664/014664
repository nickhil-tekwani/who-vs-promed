Re: Nipah virus transmission
----------------------------
I would like to help clarify what is known about Nipah virus
transmission from bats and to identify some sources behind various
statements made in the news report from Reuters India ("Tainted fruit
blamed for Bangladesh Nipah outbreaks") included in the most recent
posting on Nipah virus in Bangladesh (Nipah virus - Bangladesh (04):
transmission 20080406.1263).

First, the exact mechanism of Nipah virus transmission from bats to
domestic pigs in Malaysia is unknown. On the index farm of that
outbreak, fruit trees were planted directly above pigs sties, and
transmission could have occurred via dropped fruit, as suggested in
the news report, or through contamination of the pig sties with urine
or feces from fruit bats feeding in the trees above. Virus viability
experiments suggest that Nipah virus remains viable for up to 4 days
in fruit bat urine at 22 deg C / 71.6 deg F (and up to one day at 37
deg C / 98.6 deg F) [1], so contamination of sties via urine from
infected bats is a plausible route of transmission. In Malaysia, the
virus has been isolated from swabs of fruit bat urine and partially
eaten fruit dropped by Island flying foxes (_Pteropus hypomelanus_) [2].

I do not know the status of virus isolation from bats in Bangladesh;
however, I am familiar with the literature on risk factors for human
infection in Bangladesh. The statement that: "In one outbreak in
Bangladesh, people became infected after contact with sick cows" is
most likely a reference to the finding that contact with sick cows
was identified as a significant risk factor in a case-control study
of an outbreak that occurred in 2001 in Chandpur village, Meherpur,
Bangladesh [3]. The role of date palm sap contamination in Nipah
virus transmission in Bangladesh was first suggested by Luby et al.
in relation to an outbreak occurring in Tangail District, Bangladesh
in 2004-2005 [4]. The article gives an interesting description and
discussion of date palm sap harvesting practices for anyone who is
interested in further details.
