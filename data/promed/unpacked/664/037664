[1] China (Dalian): spike in cases
Date: Fri 12 Nov 2021

A single city in northeast China was the source of 52 of the 79 new local COVID-19 symptomatic cases that the country's National Health Commission reported on Friday [12 Nov 2021].

The sudden spike in Dalian [the 7th largest city in China], which reported its first community case from the latest wave on [4 Nov 2021], has contributed to a marked increase in the overall national total.

Within a week, the port city's tally reached 215, according to data from the provincial health commission, which has blamed the rapid spread of the disease on the highly infectious delta variant.

On Friday [12 Nov 2021], China also reported 42 imported cases and 12 asymptomatic local cases, which are not counted towards the official tally.

Daily cases in Liaoning have now overtaken both the nearby province of Heilongjiang and its sprawling northern neighbour Inner Mongolia, both previous epicentres of the latest outbreak.

Heilongjiang has been reporting single-digit local symptomatic cases since Saturday [6 Nov 2021], while Inner Mongolia has announced only one such case this week.

At least 21 workers at a food company in Zhuanghe, a city under Dalian's jurisdiction, have been infected with the coronavirus along with 25 employees at a cold storage facility in the city.

The facility was a "designated first-stop" cold storage facility for Dalian, meaning it is one of the only entry points for frozen and chilled foods from outside the province.

Infected workers at the cold storage went on to transmit COVID-19 to their family members.

The local authorities have now suspended these companies' operations and stopped the trade in cold chain foods.

Chinese health officials have said the coronavirus may have originated outside China and carried into the country via frozen food ahead of the 1st major outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019, a theory that has been greeted with scepticism internationally.

Another cluster has also been found at a university canteen, which has spread among students living in Zhuanghe's university area.

"Central, provincial, city and county authorities are united ... and are simultaneously using big data, information technology and human-to-human monitoring to identify target groups to trace close contacts as soon as possible," Yi Qingdao, the secretary general of the Dalian government, said on Thursday [11 Nov 2021], without elaborating.

Local authorities have also launched mass testing for the city of 7.4 million. As of Thursday [11 Nov 2021], Zhuanghe had conducted 5 rounds of mass testing, while the rest of Dalian began its 2nd round of testing.

Since Tuesday [9 Nov 2021], Dalian residents have only been allowed to leave the city if they tested negative for the coronavirus within 24 hours and use apps from central and local governments that record their travel history.

Ma Xiaowei, the director of the National Health Commission, visited Dalian on Thursday [11 Nov 2021] to inspect isolation measures.

On the same day [11 Nov 2021], foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin did not respond directly to a question on whether China would ease border restrictions for foreigners.

"China will continue to organise control measures based on the development of the epidemic and on the basis of science," he said. "At the same time, China is willing to arrange for healthy, safe and orderly contact between Chinese and foreign nationals, so long as epidemic controls are safeguarded."

Last week, the anti-epidemic unit of the State Council, China's cabinet, doubled down on the country's zero-COVID policy, saying it conformed with the country's "national situation and scientific principles of control measures".

[2] Europe: rising cases in Western Europe
Date: Sat 13 Nov 2021

Not out of the woods: COVID cases rising in Western Europe
----------------------------------------
Santa won't be getting his traditional welcome in the Dutch city of Utrecht this year [2021]. The ceremonial head of Carnival celebrations in Germany's Cologne had to bow out because he tested positive for COVID-19. And Austria is planning a lockdown on unvaccinated people in 2 hard-hit regions.

Nearly 2 years into a global health crisis that has killed more than 5 million people, infections are again sweeping across parts of Western Europe, a region with relatively high vaccination rates and good health care systems but where lockdown measures are largely a thing of the past.

The World Health Organization said coronavirus deaths rose by 10% in Europe in the past week, and an agency official declared last week that the continent was "back at the epicenter of the pandemic." Much of that is being driven by spiraling outbreaks in Russia and Eastern Europe -- where vaccination rates tend to be low -- but countries in the west such as Germany and Britain recorded some of the highest new case tolls in the world.

While nations in Western Europe all have vaccination rates over 60% -- and some like Portugal and Spain are much higher -- that still leaves a significant portion of their populations without protection.

Dr. Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at Exeter University College of Medicine and Health, says that the large number of unvaccinated people combined with a widespread post-lockdown resumption of socializing and a slight decline in immunity for people who got their shots months ago is driving up the pace of infections.

Thanks largely to vaccination, hospitals in Western Europe are not under the same pressure they were earlier in the pandemic, but many are still straining to handle rising numbers of COVID patients while also attempting to clear backlogs of tests and surgeries with exhausted or sick staff. Even the countries experiencing the most serious outbreaks in the region recorded far fewer deaths per person over the past 4 weeks than the United States did, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The question now is if countries can tamp down this latest upswing without resorting to stringent shutdowns that devastated economies, disrupted education, and weighed on mental health. Experts say probably -- but authorities can't avoid all restrictions and must boost vaccination rates.

"I think the era of locking people up in their homes is over because we now have tools to control COVID -- the testing, vaccines and therapeutics," said Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. "So I hope people will do the things they have to do, like put on a mask."

Many European countries now use COVID passes -- proof of full vaccination, recovery from the virus or a negative test result -- to access venues like bars and restaurants. Pankhania warned that the passes can give a false sense of security since fully vaccinated people can still get infected -- though their chances of dying or getting seriously sick are dramatically lower.

But restrictions don't go much further these days, although the Dutch government is reportedly planning a partial lockdown and German lawmakers are mulling legislation that would pave the way for new measures. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg announced Friday [12 Nov 2021] that unvaccinated people in 2 regions will only be able to leave home for specified reasons starting Monday [15 Nov 2021], and he is considering implementing similar measures nationwide. But he has said he doesn't want to impose the restrictions on those who got the shot.

Austria is seeing one of the most serious outbreaks in Western Europe, along with Germany, which has reported a string of record-high infections in recent days.

"We have a real emergency situation right now," said Christian Drosten, the head of virology at Berlin's Charite Hospital, which has started canceling scheduled surgeries.

Duesseldorf's university hospital said earlier this week that its ICU is full, though many facilities are struggling more with staff shortages than bed space.

Drosten said Germany must increase its vaccination rate of 67% further -- and fast. But officials have balked at ordering vaccine mandates and want to avoid any blanket lockdowns.

Health Minister Jens Spahn indicated that Germany could improve its often lax enforcement of COVID pass requirements.

"If my vaccination certificate is checked more often in one day in Rome than it sometimes is in 4 weeks in Germany, then I think more can be done," Spahn said recently.

The Netherlands is in a similar bind: The country announced the highest daily tally of new cases since the pandemic began Thursday [11 Nov 2021], hospitals are warning the situation could get worse, but officials are reluctant to clamp down too hard. Amid these concerns, organizers in Utrecht said they couldn't in good conscience bring tens of thousands of people together to greet Santa at the annual Sinterklaas party beloved of children.

Cities in Germany, by contrast, went ahead with outdoor Carnival celebrations this week -- but the head of Cologne's party, Carnival Prince Sven I., canceled public appearances after testing positive.

In the United Kingdom, which lifted remaining restrictions in July [2021] and has seen big spikes as well as dips in cases since, Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists the country can "live with the virus." The government will only reimpose restrictions if the health service comes under "unsustainable" pressure, he says.

Spain, once one of Europe's hardest hit nations, perhaps offers an example of how the risks can be managed.

It has vaccinated 80% of its population, and while face masks are no longer mandatory outdoors, many people still wear them. While infections have ticked up slightly recently, Rafael Bengoa, one of Spain's leading public health experts, said that given the high vaccination rate, "the virus won't be able to dominate us again."

Several countries are hoping that pushing harder on immunizations will get them there. Germany plans to re-open vaccination centers across the country to speed booster shots. France is also pinning its hopes on booster doses while urging holdouts to get their first shots. Italy is also expanding its booster program as numbers edge higher.

Pankhania says that no single measure will control the pandemic.

"To really control it, it has to be multi-layered ... avoid crowds, avoid poorly ventilated places, be immunized, wear your mask," he said.
