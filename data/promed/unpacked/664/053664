99/178 Chino del tomate and pepper huasteco begomoviruses occur in Sonora,
Mexico
In Sonora, Mexico, tomato plants in commercial glasshouses showed two types
of symptoms: yellow mosaic, leaf curling and stunting, or chlorosis and
feathery appearance of leaves, in December 1997 and again in October 1998.
Molecular studies (PCR, comparisons of CP gene sequences) showed that
pepper huasteco and chino del tomate begomoviruses were present in diseased
tomatoes. This is the first report of these two viruses in Sonora, Mexico.
Their geographical distribution is now the following:
Pepper huasteco begomovirus: Mexico (Guanajuato, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa,
Sonora, Tamaulipas), USA (Texas).
Chino del tomate begomovirus: Mexico (Chiapas, Morelos, Sinaloa, Sonora,
Tamaulipas)

del tomate and pepper huasteco geminiviruses in greenhouse-grown tomato in
Sonora, Mexico. Plant Disease, 83(4), p 396.

[According to Judith Brown and colleagues (University of Arizona, Tucson),
comparison of the DNA sequences of chino del tomate virus (CdTV) and tomato
leaf crumple virus (TLCrV) indicates that the two viruses are closely
related strains of the same virus. Because CdTV was described first, TLCrV
has been designated as the leaf crumple strain of CdTV (CdTV-LCr). - Mod.DH
