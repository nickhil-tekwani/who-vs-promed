Fresh cases of scrub typhus infection were reported with the death of one person in Pangzawl village in south Mizoram's Lunglei district in early July [2018] and another 2 in Sawleng village in Aizawl district recently.

Officials of the state health department said at least 20 others are suffering from the disease at present in Sawleng village.

The state government sent a medical team to the village on Tuesday to take stock of the situation, state nodal officer of the integrated disease surveillance programme, Pachuau Lalmalswama told The Telegraph.

Sources from Sawleng village said an 11-year-old died of the infection on [12 Jul 2018], while [a] 45-year-old died on [Mon 23 Jul 2018] because of scrub typhus infection. The 2 were diagnosed with the infection in the 1st week of July [2018], sources said. Health department officials said at least 50 people from Sawleng village were examined at Darlawn hospital on [Mon 23 Jul 2018], out of whom 10 were found to be infected. They said scrub typhus infection was also found in neighbouring villages of Sawleng village.

Pachuau said the infection is spreading very fast in the state. Health department officials said over 107 scrub typhus cases were reported from Pangzawl village in Lunglei district and more than 30 cases from Mizoram in Aizawl district recently.

At least 161 cases of scrub typhus infection were also reported from Haulawng village in Lunglei district and 89 others from Phullen village and surrounding villages like Luangpawn, Thanglailung, and Zawngin in Aizawl district in January this year [2018], they said.

[ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past. In fact, ProMED-mail posted a report of one death and at least 47 others with suspected scrub typhus in Phullen village in Aizawl district in Jan 2018 (Scrub typhus - India: (MZ) susp 20180106.5541468). For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546.

We are not told in the news report above how the diagnoses of scrub typhus were confirmed in the current cases or if the diagnoses were just suspected, as they were in January 2018.

The Weil-Felix test is frequently used to diagnosis scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that can detect DNA of _O. tsutsugamushi_, the cause of scrub typhus, in a blood, eschar swab, or tissue sample, is the most rapid and specific diagnostic assay for scrub typhus, but also is unlikely to be available in this region of the Indian state of Mizoram.

Mizoram is a state in eastern India, bounded to the west by Bangladesh and the Indian sate of Tripura, to the east and south by Myanmar, and to the north by the Indian states of Assam and Manipur. A map showing the location of Mizoram's 8 districts can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunglei_district#/media/File:India_Mizoram_Lunglei_map_EN.svg.

Aizawl district (129 cases of scrub typhus), located in the north-central part of the Mizoram, is the most populous district, with a population of 404 054 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizawl_district). Aizawl City is the capital of Mizoram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aizawl_district). Sawleng is a village, with a population of 1452 residents, in Aizawl district (http://www.census2011.co.in/data/village/271206-sawleng-mizoram.html). A map showing the location of Sawleng can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sawleng,+Mizoram+796017,+India.
