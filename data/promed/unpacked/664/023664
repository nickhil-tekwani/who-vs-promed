USDA downgrades Minnesota TB-free status
--------------------------------------
Announcement has been expected since 5 herds were found to include
animals with disease. The feds made it official Monday: Minnesota no
longer enjoys the status of "TB-free," related to its cattle
population that it had since 1971.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday it downgraded the
state's bovine TB status to "Modified Accredited Advanced," the next
of about 5 rungs on the federal regulatory ladder. The announcement
has been expected since 5 herds were found to include animals with TB
since the first one was discovered in the summer of 2005 near
Wannaska, Minn., in Roseau County.
All 5 herds have connections through animals sold or bought, and
state and federal officials believe the TB infection is limited to
those herds. [And all had the same strain of organism; see previous
postings. -Mod.MHJ]
Under the new, downgraded status, all adult breeding animals shipped
out of state must be tested for TB within 60 days of shipment. Cattle
are exempt from the testing if they are being shipped directly to an
approved feedlot, or to slaughter, or if the animals are from a
TB-accredited herd, Hartmann said.
Other states also are requiring their own stepped-up testing for
Minnesota animals exported from the state because of the news of the
TB outbreak. Bill Hartmann, state veterinarian and executive director
of the state Board of Animal Health, said all producers planning to
ship cattle interstate need to contact their local veterinarian to
find out various state testing requirements. The added testing
requirements increase costs to producers and also can limit their
marketing opportunities.
The historically high prices for cattle and beef are helping
ameliorate the effect of the increased costs related to losing the
TB-free status, producers say.
Federal and state wildlife officials also are testing wild deer. A
buck shot by a hunter in the fall of 2005 near the first herd found
to be infected was found to have TB. It appears to be a limited
"spillover" effect from the cattle herd, a DNR official told the
Herald 2 weeks ago. But the DNR hasn't been determined yet if there
is a wider TB outbreak in the state's wild deer population, as was
found in Michigan several years ago.
