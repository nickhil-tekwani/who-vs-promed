[Translated by Mod.JW; original below]

Several dogs have been found with visceral leishmaniasis in
Aracatuba, in the west of Sao Paulo state. The disease has not been
found in humans in the state, but the sandfly vector, _Lutzomyia
longipalpis_, occurs there so the risk exists.
Control measures [unspecified] are being undertaken.
[Leishmaniasis is a debilitating febrile disease caused by a
protozoan parasite transmitted by sandflies. Its wild hosts are dogs
and rodents Mod.JW]
