Viet Nam: Avian Influenza Virus Infection Death Toll Rises to 39
---------------------------------------------------
A 73-year-old Vietnamese has died from avian influenza virus
infection, bringing the country's toll to 39, 19 of them since the
virus reappeared in December 2004, state-run media reported on Thu 30
Jun 2005.

The Hanoi resident, one of 4 people infected by the H5N1 virus being
treated in hospital, died on Tue 28 Jun 2005 after being admitted on
Thu 23 Jun 2005, the Lao Dong newspaper quoted hospital officials as
saying. It gave no further details on the patient, and doctors at the
hospital could not be reached immediately for comment. The Health
Ministry said avian influenza virus had infected 60 people since it
returned to Viet Nam in December 2004.

On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation repeated its warning that
the H5N1 virus could mutate into a form which could pass easily
between people and cause a global pandemic. "Because influenza
viruses are inclined to change frequently, WHO advises Viet Nam and
the rest of the world to remain vigilant in its influenza control
efforts," the WHO said in a statement.

"The risk of a pandemic remains, but with further research and
international collaboration, the possibility of lessening its impact
is a goal that may ultimately be realised," Hans Troedsson, WHO
Representative in Viet Nam, said in the statement. [Readers should
consult ProMED-mail "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (96)" for
another version of these statements. - Mod.CP]. Avian (H5N1)
influenza virus, which arrived in Asia in late 2003, has also killed
12 Thais and four Cambodians.

The Health Ministry has called on a campaign to raise public
awareness and clean up the environment between now and December to
combat the poultry virus, which seems to thrive best in the winter
but still jumps to humans in the hot months. It said there was a high
risk that outbreaks would turn into a large-scale epidemic in the
winter.

The Agriculture Ministry said chickens would be vaccinated in 2
provinces from 1 Aug 2005 on a trial basis after the vaccine for
poultry had been tested successfully.

[Temporal variations in the transmissibility of avian influenza virus
to humans and poultry have not been suggested previously. If true,
they might indicate differences in the routes of transmission of the
virus in the human and avian populations, or perhaps differences in
patterns of exposure. - Mod.CP]
