Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: August 2000
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Bluetongue virus
Serotype 16

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Karaoz, Karaoz, Aksu, Antalya
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 May 2010
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Species: sheep
Susceptible: 150
Cases: 2
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comments: disease notification was made due to
clinical signs as oedema, fever, and lameness. On 29 Jun 2010, an
outbreak investigation was performed. No findings specific to the
disease were observed. Blood samples were taken from the animals and
tested at the National Reference Laboratory. The result was disease
positive, but the samples were sent to the Experimental
Zooprophylactic Institute for serotype determination.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of arthropods; quarantine; movement control
inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s);
Administrative division: Antalya
Species: sheep
Total vaccinated: 1000
Treatment of affected animals (disinfections and antibiotics were
applied against the secondary infections.)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Veterinary Control and Research Institute
(VCRI), Etlik (National Reference Laboratory) (national laboratory)
Species: sheep
Test: antibody detection ELISA
Test date: 18 Jun 2010
Result: positive

Species: sheep
Test: antigen (Ag) detection ELISA
Test date: 3 Jun 2010
Result: negative

Species: sheep
Test: pathogen isolation by egg inoculation
Test date: 8 Jun 2010
Result: doubtful (uncertain)

Laboratory name and type Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute

[The outbreak area can be seen on the map appended at the end of the
OIE WAHID report referenced above or on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/0dPb>.
Maps are a key to understanding the epidemiology of the disease
particularly concerning the distribution and history of different
strains locations. It might be very valuable to explore developing a
GIS (Geographic Information System) based surveillance for this
disease in order to understand the complexities in the distributions
of BT strains, species affected, and locations over time.

A very nice map that gives a comprehensive updated distribution of
bluetongue serotypes can be found at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bt_restrictedzones-map.jpg>.
Of note is the location of the current outbreak in Antalya, which is
located on the southernmost central part of Turkey, bordering the
Mediterranean. This is quite some distance from last year's (2009)
outbreak in the Aegaen Sea on the islands of Lesvos, Chios, Samos,
and the island of Rhodes, which was reported in December 2009 (see
Bluetongue - Europe (17): Greece (islands) BTV-1, BTV-16 archive no.
20091206.4157.) Also, of interest in regard to bluetongue
surveillance in Turkey are the comments of Mod.AS. - Mod.PC]
