A fungus that may reduce the size of the country's main crop has
infected cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast, the world's biggest
producer of the chocolate component. Abel Mounou of Cycle et Vie, an
Abidjan-based non-governmental cocoa research organization, said in
an interview that black pod rot, a fungus which causes cocoa pods to
turn black and rot, is widespread on farms in the east, near the
border with Ghana. Ivory Coast's eastern Abengourou region produces
about 130 000 metric tons of cocoa beans a year, or 10 percent of
annual [national] output.
"The problem is that farmers don't know how to prevent it or treat
it," Mounou said, adding that the disease doesn't appear to have
spread to other cocoa-growing regions. "I don't think there is reason
for alarm on a national level." The fungus spreads rapidly in periods
of abundant rainfall and insufficient sunshine, according to the
website of the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO].
Ivory Coast's main crop, harvested between October and March, is
expected to exceed last year's [2006] harvest of 1.06 million metric
tons by 11 percent. However, black pod rot may trim the size of the
main crop, Daniel Abo, vice-president of the state-run Bourse du Cafi
et du Cacao, said 9 Aug 2007. The West African nation accounts for 40
percent of global cocoa production.

[2] Black pod, cocoa - Ghana

Heavy rains in Ghana have spurred the spread of the fungal disease
black pod, especially in western regions bordering Ivory Coast, but
the world's 2nd largest cocoa producer still expects higher output
this year [2007]. Although heavy downpours in recent months have
raised hopes of a strong 2007/08 main crop, due to open in early
October, they also nurtured the fungal blight. "There is already
damage, if there is visible damage by now, then it is bad. I am very
worried. We haven't seen this much rain in September in a long time,"
one buyer said.
Unless the rain eases and the sun starts to shine, more cocoa pods
will bear the telltale black splodges of the fungal disease, growers
say. The fungus has already ruined thousands of cocoa pods in
war-divided Ivory Coast, the world's no. 1 cocoa grower. Black pod is
most severe in Ghana's Western Region, which borders Ivory Coast, one
of the country's most productive cocoa-growing areas, one buyer said.
But the disease did not alter his forecast for a total 2007/08 crop
of 740 000 tonnes. Others named Akaatiso and Sefwi Kaase in western
Ghana as areas hit hard by the disease. "There is black pod. It is
not as bad as in Ivory Coast," said another industry expert.
In Nyinahin, in Ashanti region, one depot manager answered his phone
from a farm where he had taken government sprayers. "We have asked
the mass sprayers to intensify so it [black pod] will not spread. The
situation is not alarming," he said, adding that the coming year's
[2007/08] output should still exceed the current year's.
But government-sponsored mass spraying effort is haphazard and on
some farms, they may be too late. "Black pod is a problem, especially
in the low lying areas," one buyer said. "When they do the spraying,
they do some farms and leave others they classify as low risk areas."
Cocobod [Ghana Cocoa Board] deputy chief executive Charles Ntim
declined to comment on the prevalence of black pod, telling Reuters
they will receive a detailed field report this week.

[Black pod (also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal
disease affecting cocoa worldwide since the 1920's. There are 3
species, which are mainly found associated with this disease: _P.
palmivora_ found worldwide; _P. megakarya_ found in several West
African countries; and a species closely resembling, but possibly
different from, _P. capsici_ found in South America, Central America,
and the West Indies. A 4th species, _P. citrophthora_, has been
identified from cocoa in Bahia, Brazil. It seems more virulent than
_P. palmivora_ or _P. capsici_, but is relatively rare.
The most common species is _P. palmivora_, which can cause losses as
high as 95 percent in very humid climates, with every pod affected.
However, _P. megakarya_ is more virulent and faster moving than _P.
palmivora_ and, therefore, more difficult to control. Molecular
diagnostic methods are available to distinguish between the species.
Pods can be infected at any age. The most serious economic loss
arises from infection during the 2 months prior to ripening. Pods
infected at this stage can be a total loss because the fungus can
easily pass from the pod husk to the seed-coat of the bean in a
developing green pod. Infection of other tissues can also occur, but
usually does not cause severe economic loss. Symptoms caused by the 4
_Phytophthora_ species vary slightly, but always start with a small
spot, which progressively turns darker brown and expands rapidly over the pod.
The fungi are spread by insects, mechanical means, plant debris,
water, and wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur
in plantations with epidemics developing from a series of foci.
Disease management is difficult. Trees too tall to be effectively
sprayed with fungicides or harvested can continue to disperse
inoculum from infected pods high in the canopy. Cultural techniques
such as shade reduction, regular harvesting, and frequent weed
control may reduce infection. Resistant cultivars are available for
some areas. Biological control measures are being investigated.
