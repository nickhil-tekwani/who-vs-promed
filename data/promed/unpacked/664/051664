[1] Cholera - Namibia (Kunene Province)

The number of cholera cases in Kunene Region in north western Namibia has risen to 107, up from 85 cases reported on Sunday afternoon, 5 Jan 2014, while the number of fatalities remains at 7.

At least 28 of the 60 patients admitted to the State hospital at Opuwo for treatment since 28 Dec 2013 have been discharged, says the acting director of health in Kunene Region, Ndahepele Jason, who told Nampa on Monday [6 Jan 2014] that some of the patients who were admitted more recently were just treated at clinics and sent back home. He added that the Directorate of Health was receiving support from different stakeholders, mainly the Office of the Governor, the Namibia Red Cross Society, and the Kunene Regional Council.

Jason said, "5 tents are still expected from Omusati Region so that we can establish a cholera isolation camp or facilities at the hospital premises."

Of the 7 people who have died of the disease, 4 died at Etanga village some 100 kilometers [62 miles] away from Opuwo, in the Epupa Constituency, where people resorted to drinking water from contaminated earth dams or traditional wells because of a lack of proper water facilities.

The clinic there has also been struggling with treatment of cholera patients because of this lack of water.

The only functioning source of water which supplies government institutions at the village has run dry.

Jason said the water shortage at the Etanga clinic has been temporarily solved with containers of water being transported from Opuwo to the clinic. "We sent out an investigation team to determine the source of the outbreak so we can establish if it is an imported infection or if it originated from within the region," he noted.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Kano, Zamfara States)

A Nigerian health official says a cholera epidemic has killed 71 people and infected 2165 since November 2013 in northern Kano state. Centre for Disease Control project director AbdulSalam Nasadi told reporters on Friday, 10 Jan 2014, that most cases are centered on Kano city, the country's 2nd largest [city].

Northern Zamfara state also has recorded hundreds of cholera cases. Nasadi said health officials have deployed to oversee cleanups and advise people on the need for cleanliness.

Lack of proper sanitation and clean water, pit toilets, mounds of uncollected garbage and storm drains blocked by garbage are among issues that contribute to health threats.

UN figures indicate half of Nigeria's more than 160 million people do not have safe water and 1/3rd do not have proper toilets.

[3] Cholera - Congo DR (South Kivu Province)

The chief doctor of the area of health of the Ruzizi River (South Kivu Province), Delphin Babikire Byamungu, indicated Tuesday, 7 Jan 2014, that 80 cases of cholera, including 2 deaths, have been recorded in the city of Sange these last 8 days.

According to the physician, the drinking water is at the base of the rapid spread of this disease. "The flooded river impeded the functioning of the water supply system in this city. We are asking them to boil water before drinking," he said.
