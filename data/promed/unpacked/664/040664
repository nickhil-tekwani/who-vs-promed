On 26 Jul 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed analysis of an unused package of romaine lettuce and carrot mix distributed to McDonald's by the Fresh Express processor in Streamwood, IL. The analysis confirmed the presence of cyclospora in that mix. On 27 Jul 2018, FDA informed Fresh Express of these results.

Fresh Express reported to FDA that the carrots in the mix went to McDonald's restaurant locations only, and that the romaine lettuce was the only ingredient in the mix that was distributed to other locations. Romaine lettuce from the same lot that was positive for cyclospora was distributed in pre-made salads and wraps distributed by Caito Foods, LLC of Indianapolis, IN. Fresh Express also reported that no romaine lettuce from the lot that was positive for cyclospora was packaged for direct retail sale to consumers.

On 30 Jul 2018, The US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert about pre-made salads and wraps containing romaine lettuce that were distributed by Caito Foods, LLC of Indianapolis, IN. The pre-made salads and wraps were shipped to distribution centers nationwide. The pre-made salads and wraps were produced 15-18 Jul 2018 and have a "Best By", "Enjoy by", "Best if Sold By", or "Sell By" date ranging from 18-23 Jul 2018. See the product labels here: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/8bbe5f53-e3ec-49c7-b060-2cfb470a2b72/USDA+Product+Label.pdf?MOD=AJPERES.

The pre-made salads and wraps have establishment number "EST. 39985" or "P-39985" inside or next to the USDA mark of inspection. See the full list of products, product labels, UPC code numbers, and other identifying information here: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/1827c9ab-6a03-4020-a74e-e8b2d5e7e8dc/List-USDA-Product-PHA-Cyclospora.pdf?MOD=AJPERES.

Important advice for consumers: if you purchased one of these pre-made salads or wraps and have not yet eaten it, do not eat it. Throw it away or return it to the place of purchase. If you have eaten one of these pre-made salads or wraps and you developed diarrhea, see a healthcare provider to be tested for cyclospora infection and to be treated if you are sick.

This investigation is ongoing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide updates when more information is available.

[It is good to know that the source has been identified. It is not surprising that the case numbers continue to increase, as most people will have been infected before the products were retracted. It is important to try to find out why the products were contaminated, as _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ has no known animal reservoir and infection usually occurs when human fecal material is used a fertilizer. - Mod.EP
