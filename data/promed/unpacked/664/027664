Wheat crops in Haryana have come under attack of 'yellow rust' due to cold and humid conditions. Though the disease is at present limited to Ambala and Yamunanagar districts of the state, farmers fear that the infection could spread and affect the yield of wheat this year [2020].

Alarmed, the Haryana Agriculture Department has issued an advisory to control yellow rust as well as Karnal bunt in the state for the benefit of farmers. Sanjeev Kaushal, additional chief secretary, Agriculture Department, however, claimed that the incidents had been witnessed only in limited areas.

Farmers have been advised to inform scientists and extension officers about yellow rust and the department has also prescribed certain fungicides to be sprayed in case yellow rust is confirmed. For Karnal bunt, farmers have been advised to avoid irrigation at heading time and the department has also prescribed fungicides to contain the infection.

[Stripe rust
------------
Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids) and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves, which leads to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40-100 per cent have been reported in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_P. graminis_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172). Projects for double-resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

The Himalayan region, including parts of Pakistan and India, has been identified as a source of most of the aggressive stripe rust races which have arrived in Europe over recent years (ProMED-mail post 20150717.3517395). In India, of the cereal rusts, stripe rust is the most serious constraint to wheat production.

Karnal bunt
-----------
Karnal bunt (also called Indian or partial bunt, named after the Indian city of Karnal in Haryana state) is caused by the fungus _Tilletia indica_. It is a serious disease of wheat, durum wheat and triticale. Disease development is favoured by cool, humid conditions at time of heading. Symptoms vary with environment and are difficult to detect in the field because of the irregular distribution of infected kernels. They may include reduction in the length of ears and number of spikelets, brown blotches on kernels, premature grain drop and stunting of plants. All or part of the grain is replaced with a powdery mass of dark spores that emits a strong, fishy odour. Grain containing more than 3 percent bunted kernels is generally considered unfit for human consumption.

Harvesting shatters infected grains releasing the spores and leaving behind a broken, hollow shell. Spores can spread over long distances by wind and survive in the soil, on stored seed, or on contaminated equipment for up to 5 years. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread, use of clean seed, preventative foliar fungicides and change to alternative crops not susceptible to karnal bunt (such as barley).

Economic losses are mainly due to lower grain quality, costs of quarantine measures and loss of international trade. Consequently, most countries regulate karnal bunt as a quarantine pest. The resulting restrictions cover import of grain, agricultural machinery, feed meals, seeds and agrochemicals that may have been handled in the same transportation system as infected wheat.

Related species cause common bunt (_T. tritici_) and dwarf bunt (_T. contraversa_) of cereals, as well as black smut of rice (_T. barclayana_).
