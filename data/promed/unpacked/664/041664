The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture and Water
revealed the day before yesterday [29 May 2007]
that the number of foot and mouth disease [FMD]
[foci] in the country amounted to 46 and that the
number of animals affected within the same period
amounted to 2417. There were 1767 cows; 650 sheep
and goats. The number of animals which died was 229.
The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture and Water
explained that veterinary teams in the
Directorate of Agriculture and Water of all Saudi
regions were inspecting the animals in animal
farms. These inspections are taking place to
discover any cases and to do the needful in that
regard. These teams were making daily visits to
the effected areas in order to follow up the
disease and to carry out the fighting and
treatment programs that had been drawn up; and to
ensure execution of the procedures laid down for
containing the area of the disease. These steps
include the imposition of a veterinary quarantine
on all the herds and on the areas affected and to
ascertain that control over the movement of
vehicles, fodder, equipment and tools from the
affected areas to other areas is maintained. In
addition, to intensify the cleansing and the
sterilization operations of the barns and tools
used in farms, and also to coordinate with
municipalities to get rid hygienically of the
dying animals and of the leftovers of the farms by burning and burial.
He added that the Ministry had provided a
quantity of the vaccines against the disease to
immunize the cows that were in the country and
the vaccines were being distributed to the
Directorates of Agriculture and Water to carry
out the necessary immunization operations by veterinary teams.
The Ministry affirmed that the FMD was one of the
infectious epidemic diseases which spread widely
and affects split-hoofed animals such as cows and
sheep but that the infection did not affect
humans and that the meat of the animals
slaughtered at slaughterhouses may be consumed as
well as the dairy products without any fear. He
also stressed the necessity that the citizens
should expeditiously report any symptoms of the
disease appearing on their animals.

[According to the Saudi Arabia page on the
website of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD
(WRLFMD), the most recent FMD virus serotypes
identified in Saudia are the following: SAT1
(1970), O (2005), A (2005), Asia 1 (1994?), C
(1984), SAT2 (2000). See the statistica at:

/sau.htm>.
In ProMED-mail's posting 20070126.0345, we
included information, derived from a protocol of
a regional meeting held in Damascus in November
2006, about the circulation of the A Iran 05
strain in Saudi Arabia during 2006. It may be
assumed that (at least) FMDV serotypes O and A
are circulating in Saudi Arabia. No official
information for the years 2006 or 2007 is
available on OIE's WAHID interface; an update is
urgently anticipated. - Mod.AS].
