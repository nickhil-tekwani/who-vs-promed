Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc)

Epidemiological comments
In Moselle: a batch of heifers not yet vaccinated grazing in an anthrax-infected field (previous cases in 2016 and 2017). An animal is dead. The other animals were vaccinated, and no other cases were reported. In Hautes-Alpes: the current investigation has shown that earthwork was carried out nearby and that many thunderstorms in June and July 2018 led to leaching. An epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; disinfection; treatment of affected animals (antibiotics)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[One cannot argue with the French investigators. Their working conclusions are sound. On the Moselle farm there had been previous cases in 2016 & 2017 [See ProMED-mail postings: 8 Jul 2017, Anthrax - France (02): (Moselle) bovine 20170708.5160530 and 6 Sep 2016, Anthrax - France (04): (MO) bovine 20160906.4469824] and thus there might have been a contaminated grave or graves. Obviously, quickly reported so the index case remains singular. For Hautes-Alpes, I can quote many outbreaks which have followed from soil excavations unknowingly of old anthrax graves, and rains will bring spores to the surface to be drunk or grazed. If archived cultures remain, it should be possible to check the recent outbreak genomics against the historical outbreaks. If they don't match, it is back to the drawing board for new hypotheses. - Mod.MHJ
