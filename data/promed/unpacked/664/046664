Another meatpacker appears to have developed the neurological
symptoms identified in 12 other workers that sparked a nationwide
investigation. Unlike the others, however, the worker was not
stationed near the high-powered air compressor system used to remove
pig brain tissue at Quality Pork Processors (QPP). Rather, the worker
was exposed to brain tissue in the rendering operation in the
basement of the plant QPP shares with Hormel Foods.

State epidemiologist Ruth Lynfield said, "We are investigating a
likely additional case."

QPP employs 1300 workers and slaughters pigs on one side of the
plant. On the other side, an estimated 1400 Hormel workers process
the meat into bacon and other products. Hormel owns the rendering operation.

The 1st 12 cases of the disease involved employees working at the
"head table" of QPP, which was spun off from Hormel in 1989. QPP
halted the process of blowing out brains with the air compression
system as soon as the December 2007 investigation began.

As a result of the most recent suspected case, health officials are
expanding the investigation to include Hormel workers in and around
the rendering operation, according to a notice to employees posted in
the plant Tuesday [4 Feb 2008].

The meatpackers in Austin and 2 at a plant in Indiana have reported
fatigue, numbness and tingling in their arms and legs, with a wide
range in severity. A few are severely disabled, while others have
been treated and returned to work.

State and federal health officials are looking into whether pig brain
tissue, liquefied during removal by the air-compression system and
sprayed into the air as droplets, somehow caused nerve damage in
workers who were exposed to it. Investigators theorize that a protein
or other substance from the animal brains triggered the workers'
immune systems into mistakenly attacking their own nerve tissue.

The brains are frozen in boxes and shipped to the southern USA and
Asia, where they are sold as food.

Last week, state officials said they were broadening the
investigation of the QPP section of the plant to thousands of former
meat packers going back a decade, to when the powerful
air-compression system was 1st installed.
