Hong Kong confirms first case of H7N9
---------------------------------
Hong Kong has confirmed its first human case of the deadly H7N9 bird flu [avian influenza virus].

The Health Secretary Ko Wing-man said she is a 36-year-old domestic helper who has a history of travelling to Shenzhen, buying a chicken and slaughtering it to eat. She is in critical condition in Queen Mary Hospital.

So far about 140 human cases of H7N9 have been reported on the mainland, with 45 fatalities.

Hong Kong Government video report -- Human H7N9 case confirmed
----------------------------------------------------------
Secretary for Food & Health Dr Ko Wing-man has confirmed the first human case of avian influenza H7N9 in Hong Kong, affecting a 36-year-old Indonesian domestic helper. She is in critical condition. Speaking to the media after chairing the Steering Committee on Avian Influenza meeting tonight, he said the patient was in Shenzhen last month, and had been in contact with poultry there. She fell ill on 21 Nov 2013 and was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on 27 Nov 2013. She was transferred to the Queen Mary Hospital on 30 nov 2013. Her close contacts have minor symptoms and are being isolated in Princess Margaret Hospital.

Dr Ko said the Government has raised the response level from 'alert' to 'serious' under its preparedness plan for influenza pandemics, and the Centre for Health Protection is looking for the patient's friend who travelled with her to Shenzhen.

The Government has suspended the import of live chickens from three Shenzhen farms, and has notified Mainland authorities and the World Health Organisation about the case. The Hospital Authority will strengthen anti-infection measures, and will limit hospital visiting hours. The Food & Environmental Hygiene Department will ensure safety and cleaning measures at local markets, and the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department will inspect local chicken farms to tighten infection control.

[This is the first human case of H7N9 avian influenza virus infection reported from Hong Kong, and only the second case to have occurred beyond mainland China (the other being reported from Taiwan). There is a strong association between this case and contact with poultry, suggesting that the virus has not been entirely eradicated from poultry by the market controls imposed by the Chinese Government. As yet there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of infection associated with this patient, but it is too early to confirm this. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
