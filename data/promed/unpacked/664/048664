Authorities in the UK and Ireland are investigating _Salmonella_ illnesses linked to a brand of liquid egg whites. Seven confirmed cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis have been reported in the UK, and one suspected infection is under investigation in Ireland. One batch of Dr. Zak's Barn Farmed Liquid Egg White 970 mL from France with raw material from Spain was recalled on 17 Sep 2018 followed by other batches on 21 Sep 2018.

_Salmonella_ was found in 2 batches: the 1st with the use-by date 12 Dec 2018 and lot number 18163BN2A, and the 2nd with a use-by date of 29 Dec 2018 and lot number 18180BN2A. A precautionary recall was made for batches with a use-by date of 29 Dec 2018 and lot number 18180BN2B, and use-by date of 2 Feb 2019 with lot number 18228BN2A. A high count of _Enterobacteriaceae_ at 9500 most-probable-number per gram and high aerobic plate count with 6700 colony-forming units per gram were also found in the product.

Public Health England told Food Safety News that it is investigating the outbreak of _Salmonella_ affecting people who consumed the nationally distributed liquid-egg-white product that was recalled by the Food Standards Agency.

Illnesses have been reported in different parts of England since 17 Aug 2018, with the most recent case having an onset date of 3 Sep 2018. Cases linked to the outbreak strain have been confirmed through whole genome sequencing. Three cases have reported consumption of Dr. Zak's Barn Farmed Liquid Egg White, while 4 infections are still under investigation.

"Most of those affected have now recovered. However, _Salmonella_ can cause a serious infection in those with weakened immune systems or in vulnerable groups including babies, the elderly, or pregnant women," said Dr. Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE. "Anyone who has purchased this product is encouraged to check the recall notices issued by the Food Standards Agency. We're aware that the affected batches could have a use-by date up to February 2019. If you're storing the product from the recalled batches at home, do not consume the product, but return it to the store where purchased for a full refund, as advised by the FSA and manufacturer. We're aware that the high-protein product may be purchased by people for bodybuilding purposes."

A spokeswoman for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) said the agency was made aware by the FSA in the UK, as there was distribution of an implicated batch to Ireland. "We are not aware of an outbreak in Ireland linked to the consumption of the Dr. Zak's Barn Farmed Liquid Egg. There is one suspected case in Ireland that we are investigating," the spokeswoman said.

Following the recall, British Lion eggs called for the EU to raise egg-processing safety standards across Europe. Ian Jones, chairman of British Lion egg processors, said the gap in safety standards between British Lion egg products and non-UK produced egg products is clear.
"It is time to put in place more stringent egg-safety standards. If manufacturers and retailers do not want to act on government advice and recognize the additional food-safety standards of the Lion, then the British government should use Brexit as an opportunity to prevent the import of egg products produced to lower food-safety standards," he said.

Food-safety expert, Dr. Lisa Ackerley, said: "Pasteurization alone has been shown not to give the assurance we all need; the raw product needs to be of a high standard as well, and that's why British Lion egg products stand apart."

[It is not stated whether the product was unpasteurized. Eggs are common vehicles for the transmission of salmonellosis to humans. The following discusses issues related to egg whites and the survival of the organism:

Wang Y, Jia B, Xu X, et al: Comparative genomic analysis and characterization of 2 _Salmonella enterica_ Serovar Enteritidis isolates from poultry with notably different survival abilities in egg whites. Front Microbiol. 7 Sep 2018; 9: 2111. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02111. eCollection 2018.

Abstract:
_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Enteritidis (_Salmonella_ Enteritidis) is a globally important foodborne pathogen, and the contaminated chicken eggs are the major source of salmonellosis in humans. _Salmonella_ Enteritidis strains are differentially susceptible to the hostile environment of egg whites. Strains with superior survival ability in egg whites are more likely to contaminate eggs and consequently infect humans. However, the genetic basis for this phenotype is unclear. We characterized 2 _Salmonella_ Enteritidis strains isolated from chicken meat that had similar genetic backgrounds but large differences in survival ability in egg whites. Although genome comparisons indicated that the gene content and genomic synteny were highly conserved, variations including 6 insertions or deletions (INDELs) and 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed between the 2 genomes. Of these, 38 variations including 4 INDELs and 34 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNP) were annotated to result in amino acid substitutions or INDELs in coding proteins. These variations were located in 38 genes involved in lysozyme inhibition, vitamin biosynthesis, cell division and DNA damage response, osmotic and oxidative protection, iron-related functions, cell-envelope maintenance, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, antimicrobial resistance, and type III secretion system. We carried out allelic replacements for 2 nsSNPs in bioC (biotin synthesis) and pliC (lysozyme inhibition), and 2 INDELs in ftsK and yqiJ (DNA damage response) by homologous recombination, and these replacements did not alter the bacterial survival ability in egg whites. However, the bacterial survival ability in egg whites was reduced when deletion mutation of the genes bioC and pliC occurred. This study provides initial correlations between observed genotypes and phenotypes and serves as an important caveat for further functional studies. - Mod.LL
