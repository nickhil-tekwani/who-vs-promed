Epidemiology/Surveillance/Laboratory
-----------------------------------
Kampala
- One Marburg probable case was admitted at Mulago Isolation unit on 14 Oct 2014. The case is a male aged 22 and a resident of Nalumunye in Rubaga division in Kampala. He was reportedly admitted on the same ward in Mengo hospital with the index case; his last date of contact was 28 Sep 2014. He was reported to have developed fever, headache, general body weakness and dizziness 4 days ago (around Fri 11 Oct 2014). A blood sample was taken to UVRI for laboratory investigation. Line listing of contacts is ongoing. 79 out of 93 (85 percent) of contacts were followed up, only one was reported ill as mentioned above.
- The alert case that was reported by a doctor in Mengo hospital on 12 Oct 2014 was not traced. The surveillance team is still trying to trace him.
- Investigation of source of infection of index case still ongoing Mpigi.
- 11/25 contacts were followed up.
- One of the contacts developed fever and is being monitored at HCIV; a specimen will be collected and transported to UVRI laboratory on 15 Oct 2014.
- Data harmonization is ongoing.
Kasese
- 53 of the 70 contacts (76 percent) were reached on 14 Oct 2014, and none of them were reported to be having symptoms.
- The team could not establish links with one contact who is reported to have traveled to DRC.

Case management
-----------------
Kampala
- One probable case on the ward in Mulago and one probable case in Entebbe isolation facility, pending laboratory results.

Situation Update
----------------
- Health workers in Mulago fear to attend to patients with any bleeding, considering all of them as suspected Marburg. NTF agreed that all patients should go through Triage at Mulago assessment center, and only cases meeting Marburg case definition should be referred to isolation facility. The rest should be given good medical care.
Mpigi
- A probable case admitted on 14 Oct 2014 is being monitored at Mpigi HC IV. Blood sample tested was negative for malaria, brucellosis, and typhoid.
- Turn up of patients at Mpigi HCIV has increased as the health workers also increase following their completion of the 21 days.
- There is urgent need to equip lower level health facilities with information, some PPEs and other supplies to enable them to confidently manage alert cases.
Kasese
- Currently, no patient is admitted in the isolation unit.
- MOH, WHO and Makerere University School of Public Health conducted a training of health workers on VHF preparedness, response and case management and infection prevention and control. Health workers trained were from Kilembe, Bweera and Kagando hospitals and Bukonzo West health sub-District.

Social mobilization
-------------------
Kampala
- Radio spot messages continue to run on 26 local FM radio stations.
- TV spots on Ebola and Marburg on 4 TV stations (WBS, UBC, NTV, NBS)
- Plan is underway to deploy film van in 8 districts of Kampala, Mukono, Wakiso, Mpigi, Ibanda, Kamwengye, Kasese and Bundibugyo, with support from UNICEF.
- The process of printing of IEC materials is ongoing, with support from UNICEF Mpigi.
- Use of community megaphone/community radios was encouraged because it is cheaper and has a wider coverage.
- Sensitization has only been done in Mpigi T/C; scaling up to the rest of the sub counties requires budget support from MOH.
- The CAO will appeal to the DEO to communicate with all the head teachers so that they disseminate messages on Marburg to the school-going children.
- World vision pledged to support another talk show on Saturday [18 Oct 2014] at CBS if technical officers at the district and MOH are available.
- World Vision will also pay for radio spot messages if MOH can prepare and submit them to their office.
- There is still a gap in the IEC materials.
Kasese
- Radio spots and talks shows are ongoing on local FM radios.

Psychosocial Support
----------------------
Kampala
- Psychosocial team is planning to link up with the contact tracing team and provide psychosocial support for contacts identified to be in need of the service.
- The team was requested to prioritize provision of psychosocial support to the health workers in Mengo hospital, especially those that were contacts.

Logistics
------
- Mpigi CAO submitted the district Marburg response budget to MOH.
- VHF Preparedness and Response plan to be presented to Cabinet for resource mobilization for required logistics.

Challenges/Gaps
--------------
- Inaccurate media reports, e.g. Monitor report on 13 Oct 2014, indicating that Uganda has been declared Marburg free could hamper the response activities.
- Some contacts in Kampala leave their homes and switch off their telephones making it difficult for them to be contacted and traced.
- Some contacts travel to other districts and to DRC, posing a risk of spread to other districts and countries in case they fall ill with Marburg.
- Delayed release of funds for district response activities
- Several health workers require training and orientation.
- Shortage of funds for critical response activities
- Fear among health workers in dealing with VHF patients

Planned Activities
-----------------
- A Press conference has been scheduled for 2:30 pm on 15 Oct 2014 by Mpigi district and will involve the RDC, LCV chairman, the CAO and DHO.
- Mobilization of resources for the District Response Plans
- Train health workers in the various health facilities in Kampala on VHF.
- Strengthen surveillance nationwide, especially in Kampala, Kasese, Mpigi, Wakiso, Ibanda, and Kamwenge.
- Continue investigations for the source of exposure for the index case.
- Equip the Kagando Isolation Facility.
- Train and deploy additional contact tracers in Kasese district.

[To reiterate, there appear to be no new confirmed cases but 2 new probable cases, one in Kampala and one in Mpigi. The original report also contains a table, which we are unable to reproduce here, with details of numbers of contacts traced by region. It notes 192 possible contacts, 49 of whom are healthcare workers. Considerable contact tracing is ongoing, since the onset of the (apparent) index case on 11 Sep 2014 and his death on 28 Sep 2014. Today, 15 Oct 2014, marks day 17 since the last possible contact, nearing the extreme end of a 21-day possible incubation period. We await results of laboratory testing with great interest. - Mod.LM
