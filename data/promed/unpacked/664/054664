In perhaps the worst tragedy related to jaundice deaths in the town, a young lawyer lost his 25 year old wife 4 days after the birth of a baby girl, born at the state's Kamla Nehru hospital on 13 Feb 2016. The woman, married only a year before, was admitted to the hospital last week where she delivered a healthy baby girl, but 2 days later, she was found to be jaundiced.

"She was immediately moved to Indira Gandhi Medical Collage (IGMC) Shimla where she was kept in the intensive care unit hoping for her improvement. For 2 days, she remained in the ICU, but she fell victim to the disease," confirmed one of her husband's colleagues.

The number of deaths due to jaundice has risen to 10, which is still being disputed by the medical authorities, who have put the number at 4.

[A previous posting about the outbreak centered in Shimla in Himachal Pradesh identified the cause as hepatitis E. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.

A newly published paper provides some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:

Kmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al. The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2016;94: 203-11; http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.15-0238.

Abstract
--------
"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is severe during pregnancy, with a pregnant case fatality rate around 30 per cent. In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except 1 seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study."

A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in people aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses have been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia.
