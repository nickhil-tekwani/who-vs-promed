[According to Mozambique's annual reports to the OIE, its most recent occurrence of African horse sickness (AHS) took place in 2006. Reportedly, no preventive vaccination is routinely applied in Mozambique.

The following background information is partly based upon UK-Gov performed risk evaluations (2008 -- http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/monitoring/documents/ahs_uk081106.pdf and 2011 --http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/monitoring/documents/poa-southafrica110310.pdf):
Sub Saharan Africa, including South Africa is considered endemic for AHS in the wild equidae population. 9 strains have been identified across sub Saharan Africa, and occasional incursions have occurred beyond the traditional epizootic range into the Middle East and Europe, involving strains 4, 6, and 9.

During the recent decades, AHS remained confined to sub-Saharan continental Africa. The disease was reported to the OIE since 1993 from Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana (2010), Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique (2006), Namibia, Nigeria, Republic of South Africa, Senegal, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe.

Historically, only 2 AHS viruses (types 4 and 9) have been found in West Africa.

In recent years some other types of AHS virus were reported for the 1st time in sub-Saharan Africa. That is, AHS virus type 6 was identified in Ethiopia in 2003. AHS type 2 virus was also confirmed in Senegal and Nigeria in 2007. A further eastward expansion of the virus was reported from Ethiopia in 2008. In 2011, type 1 was reported from the Western Cape Province in South Africa.

Additional useful AHS-related information, including maps, is available at http://www.africanhorsesickness.co.za/default.asp.

Serotyping of the Mozambique case is anticipated. - Mod.AS
