A new case of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) has
been discovered in southwest France, bringing to 26 the number of cows
found with the disease this year, the Agriculture Ministry said Monday.
The Agriculture Ministry said new cases of the disease will continue to
appear until 2001, 5 years after stringent prevention measures were taken
against the illness, which has an average incubation period that long.
The latest case of BSE involved a milk cow born in March 1991 in the Alpine
region of
Savoie. All 281 cows in the herd were slaughtered last week.
In August, the European Union (EU) lifted a ban on the import of beef from
Britain, where BSE first appeared. But France has angered Britain by
continuing to ban imports. The European Commission, the executive arm of
the EU, has started legal proceedings against France.
France and Britain are in talks to break the impasse. France says it needs
more assurance about the safety of the meat, but Britain insists its herds
have recovered from the BSE crisis.
BSE has no known cure. Scientists believe the disease may be linked to an
equally fatal human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
