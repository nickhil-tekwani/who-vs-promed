Gabriela M Blohm John A Lednicky Sarah K White Carla N Mavian Marilianna C Márquez Kellyh P González-García, et al. Madariaga Virus: Identification of a Lineage III Strain in a Venezuelan Child With Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Illness, in the Setting of a Possible Equine Epizootic.

Abstract
We report identification of Madariaga virus (MADV) in plasma and urine samples from a child with acute undifferentiated febrile illness in Venezuela. Our data document the occurrence of milder MADV infections (ie, without encephalitis), with a symptom complex that resembles that seen with other arboviral infections, including dengue and Zika.

Introduction
Recent ecologic and genetic studies of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV; Togaviridae: Alphavirus) have demonstrated clear separation between North and South American EEEV strains: North American EEEV cluster in a single genetic lineage (lineage I, in the system proposed by Arrigo et al), with South American EEEV strains (now known as Madariaga virus [MADV]) clustering in EEEV lineages II, III, and IV. Although there is reasonable understanding of clinical and epidemiologic features of North American EEE, much less is known about MADV infections. MADV can cause outbreaks in horses and appears to infect a variety of mammals, including rats and bats, with a study in Panama finding the highest rates of seropositivity in short-tailed cane rats [_Zygodontomys brevicauda_] (8.3 percent). However, less than a dozen human cases of MADV infection have been documented, and almost all have been encephalitis cases in children seen as part of an outbreak in Panama in 2010. In population-based serologic surveys in Panama and the Peruvian Amazon, between 2 and 5 percent of the general population had evidence of prior infection, suggesting that mild or asymptomatic human infection is relatively common. We report here a case of MADV infection in Venezuela in a child with acute undifferentiated febrile illness, diagnosed after initial screening tests for Zika virus (ZIKV) were negative.

Case Report
A 12-year-old girl presented to Hospital Internacional de Barquisimeto (HI), Cabudare, Venezuela, with a history of fever of abrupt onset, asthenia, malaise, headache, and nausea. She had been previously healthy with no significant past medical history. The fever was high grade (39°-40° C [102-104F]), lasting 2 days, and was followed by severe fatigue; the patient denied arthralgias or mialgias. Concomitantly, she developed an intensely pruritic maculopapular rash that persisted for 5 days after the onset of fever. Physical examination revealed a conscious, febrile patient with rash, mild pallor, and congestion of palpebral conjunctiva. She had no petechiae, icterus, or lymphadenopathy, and an examination that was otherwise unremarkable. Complete blood count and chemistry were unremarkable except for mild lymphocytic leukocytosis. She was treated with oral acetaminophen 500 mg qid and adequate fluid intake, fully recovering after 5 days.

The patient lived in an urban area of the city of Barquisimeto (population of approximately 1 million; capital of the state of Lara). She had no exposure to sick contacts, pets, or animals, and no contact with horses or farms. She had traveled to the beach at Tucacas 10 days before onset of illness, a coastal town in the northern state of Falcón. During this time period there were reports of an outbreak of equine encephalitis near Tucacas, with veterinarians in the region reporting horses with fever, lethargy, extreme weakness, unstable gait, muscle twitches, and fatalities. There were also sporadic reports of equine illness in Lara and neighboring states, including Yaracuy, Portuguesa, and Barinas. Illness in the horses was only evaluated clinically, with no diagnostic testing done.

Diagnostic studies
At HI, the child's plasma tested negative for DENV, CHIKV, EBV, CMV, and parvovirus.

Comment
When studies were negative for ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV, all of which are known to be endemic in Venezuela, we looked for other possible viruses, and found MADV, demonstrating that MADV can cause relatively mild, self-limited febrile illness in children. These findings again underscore the potential for misdiagnosis when using clinical criteria to identify specific arbovirus infections. It also reinforces the need for caution before automatically assuming that all cases presenting in the midst of an epidemic (in this instance, a ZIKV epidemic) are due to the epidemic microorganism.

[2] Comment on the case
Date: Fri 27 Apr 2018

Madariaga virus (MADV), an alphavirus in the eastern equine encephalitis antigenic complex, has only rarely been shown to cause human disease even with the known capacity to cause outbreaks in equine populations in Latin America. When human cases have been detected, until recently, most have been associated with severe neurological disease. However, a follow up study to an outbreak of MADV in Panama in 2010 revealed both mild cases, as well as evidence of asymptomatic infections. Additionally, seroprevalence studies in the Amazonia region of Peru showed MADV antibodies in up to 3 percent of the residents, suggesting that infection with this virus may not be uncommon even in the absence of reported disease.

Blohm et al. [in the report above] describe a case of Madariaga fever causing only mild febrile illness in a child in Venezuela. With previous data (albeit limited) describing mild or asymptomatic infections with MADV, this case report provides one additional piece of evidence that these mild infections may indeed be much more common than neurological cases. This would not be unexpected for neurological arboviruses... This has resulted in the "iceberg" pattern of disease where the tip is the number of neuroinvasive disease cases, whereas the mild and asymptomatic cases are represented by the underwater portion of the "iceberg." A similar pattern may emerge for MADV as it becomes more epidemiologically characterized. What is perhaps more significant and potentially useful for clinicians and public health officials was how challenging it was to obtain this confirmation and characterization of an etiology of MADV.

The authors went through an extensive process of random primed polymerase chain reaction amplification, subcloning of the prominent amplicon, and Sanger sequencing using a genome walking methodology to confirm the nature of the infecting agent. Although these efforts were certainly far beyond the capacity of a typical public health laboratory to identify an agent, they were useful for full genetic characterization of the virus.

One other interesting element to the testing design in this study was that the authors astutely tested a urine sample for viruses; the finding in this work was that the universal primers generated an alphavirus amplicon from this urine sample. Until the Zika virus (ZIKAV) outbreaks of 2016-2017, urine was not typically a diagnostic sample type for most arboviruses. This sample type was explored extensively for use in detecting ZIKAV as it has been suggested that it may be more useful due to the simplicity of collection and the possibility that virus could be detected for a longer time in urine than in serum. The finding by Blohm and colleagues that urine was positive for MADV RNA suggests that it would be worthwhile to further evaluate this sample type for detection of a range of arboviruses, particularly those such as MADV or eastern equine encephalitis virus that have a long prodromal period and are therefore unlikely to be detected in serum samples.

Finally, although more cases of MADV, either mild or neurologic in nature, are likely to continue to be detected as awareness of this agent as a potential human pathogen increases, it is important to use caution in suggesting urban transmission, even speculatively, without evidence. This is tempting to do given the recent findings of significant levels of transmission of ZIKAV and CHIK virus in human-mosquito-human cycles. However, with limited public health, research, and mosquito surveillance resources, efforts must be focused on the most likely transmission patterns. Whether MADV is truly an emerging pathogen or one that is simply now being recognized as a cause of mild and perhaps widespread febrile disease, Blohm et al are correct in asserting that a better understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen is needed.

[Powers' report provides a thoughtful assessment of the Blohm et al. report of the MADV case in Venezuela. These 2 reports above underscore 3 important points. First, during an outbreak of clinically important disease, more than one pathogenic agent (viruses in this case) may be circulating and causing similar symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis is essential to determine which pathogens are circulating. This may be a challenge if sophisticated laboratory testing is required for accurate diagnosis, as these tests may be beyond the capability of many diagnostic laboratories. Second, urine is becoming recognized as useful diagnostic sample for this and several other arboviral infections. Third, the majority of MADV infections are likely to be asymptomatic or mild, overlooked and thus, underreported. Understanding the geographic distribution of the virus, its mode of transmission, host range and importance as a cause of human and equine disease will require further studies involving collaboration between clinicians in health care facilities, epidemiologists, veterinarians, mammalogists and, likely, medical entomologists in a holistic one health approach.
