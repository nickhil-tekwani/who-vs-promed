Characterisation of tomato fruit yellow ring virus: a new Tospovirus
species infecting tomato in Iran
---------------------------------------------------

Accepted for publication 19 Apr 2005.
During surveys for Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) in the major tomato
production areas of Iran, tomato fruits showing a bright yellow ring
pattern were observed, from which a tospovirus was isolated by mechanical
transmission to herbaceous hosts. The virus originated from the Varamin
area where over 30 per cent of the tomato crop was infected with TSWV.
Although typical tospovirus virions were found by electron microscopy, a
panel of antibodies used for detection and identification of tospoviruses
by ELISA failed to react with this isolate. An antiserum against virus
nucleoprotein preparations (DSMZ-AS0526) reacted specifically with plants
infected with the new isolate but not with other tospoviruses.
Analysis of the S RNA genome comprising the N protein gene (275 aa; GenBank
accession AJ493270) and a segment of the L Gene (GenBank accession
AJ493271), to determine the taxonomic position of the virus, confirmed that
this is a distinct tospovirus species, sharing 72 to 75 per cent
nucleoprotein aa identity with isolates of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV),
its closest relative.
A 42 to 45 per cent N protein similarity with N gene sequences of
tospoviruses from Asia (Watermelon silver mottle virus, Melon yellow spot
virus and Watermelon bud necrosis virus) and only 28 to 30 per cent aa
sequences in common with tospoviruses from Europe-Africa (TSWV, Tomato
chlorotic spot virus and Groundnut ringspot virus), further confirmed its
taxonomic position.
The absence of any detectable serological relationships and the limited
sequence similarity with IYSV and other tospoviruses justifies the
classification of this new virus as a distinct species of the genus
_Tospovirus_ for which we propose the name tomato fruit yellow ring virus
(TFYRV).
This virus has an extensive host range (Ghotbi, et al. 2005) but it is
found most often in tomato and in mixed virus infections with TSWV.

[This piece is a good example of virus evolution. The genus _Tospovirus_
(family _Bunyaviridae_) is one of 5 genera in the family, and the only one
that infects plants. Tospoviruses, transmitted by thrips, are capable of
infecting a large range of important crops. The type member, Tomato spotted
wilt virus (TSWV), has one of the broadest host ranges among plant viruses.
It is well established in many parts of the world and affects crops such as
potato, lettuce, tomato, pepper, groundnut, mungbean, and tobacco. Rough
estimates calculate the worldwide loss due to tospoviruses at USD 1 billion.
Lettuce crops in Hawaii have suffered serious damage due to TSWV for
several successive years, forcing growers to switch to other crops. Annual
losses due to peanut bud necrosis virus (PBNV) in Asia are estimated at
more than US$ 89 million. There are at least 15 recognized tospoviruses.
A new approach to disease management of TSWV is peptide-mediated, broad
spectrum plant resistance, as described by Rudolf, Schreir, and Uhrig at
the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne and Bayer
Crop Science in Mohnheim, Germany
(<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/8/4429>, to which the numbered
references in this comment refer, and which includes a comprehensive
review). An example is the development of broad spectrum resistance which
is expressed by specific viral proteins. There are unambiguous examples of
protein-mediated virus resistance -- mainly expression of viral coat
proteins (3,4,10) -- but cases of protein-dependent pathogen-derived
resistance due to expression of viral movement proteins or replicases are
also known (9,11,12). In some instances, resistance is based on the
expression of intact, functional proteins; in others the expression of the
intact protein leads only to weak resistance or even to enhanced
susceptibility. In contrast, expression of a dysfunctional protein may lead
to strong resistance (12,13). Presence of the viral gene product in
inappropriate amounts, form or time, is thought to interfere with viral
infection. However, in some cases it is difficult to distinguish between an
RNA- and protein-mediated resistance (8,9). Despite the number of
successful examples, the molecular basis of protein-mediated virus
resistance is, in most cases, not understood. Further research and
development are required.
