UCLA Scientists Reveal How Nipah Virus Infects Cells
----------------------------------------------------
University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA) scientists have discovered how
the deadly Nipah virus* infiltrates human cells to cause encephalitis.
Designated as a potential bioterrorism agent by the National Biodefense
Research Agenda, the virus exploits a protein essential to embryonic
development to enter cells and launch its attack.
*[a unique type of parainfluenza virus, which, together with the closely
related Hendra virus, constitute the genus _Henipavirus_ of the family
_Paramyxoviridae_. - Mod.CP]
"In its natural state, Nipah virus can be used as a potential
bioterrorism agent capable of devastating an entire country's public
health and economy," said Dr. Benhur Lee, principal investigator and
UCLA assistant professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular
genetics. "Now that we understand how the virus operates, we can
develop vaccines and drugs to block Nipah from entering the cells.
This will help prevent infection and halt outbreaks before they reach
epidemic proportions."
Since 1998, Nipah virus has triggered disease outbreaks in Australia [Hendra
virus], Singapore, Malaysia and Bangladesh. Animals spread the virus to
people, in whom it causes life-threatening respiratory and neurological
diseases that kill up to 70 percent of patients, a danger level equivalent to
[that of] the Ebola virus.
To infect a cell, viruses must bind to a viral-specific receptor on
the cell's surface in order to penetrate it. Lee's team identified a
cell receptor called Ephrin-B2 as the key used by the Nipah virus to
unlock the cells. Located on brain cells and cells lining the blood
vessels, Ephrin-B2 is critical to nervous system development and the
growth of blood vessels in human and animal embryos. Ephrin-B2 is
found in humans, horses, pigs and bats, which may explain why the
infection can jump so easily from one species to another.
Collaborating with the University of Pennsylvania, the UCLA team
applied tools of advanced molecular biology as well as old-fashioned
detective work to track down the identity of the Ephrin-B2 receptor.
The researchers created a bait: they stitched the Nipah protein to
part of a human antibody, like a worm on a fishing hook. When they
placed this bait on cells at risk for Nipah infection, the antibody
attached to a receptor on the cell surface. When placed on
Nipah-resistant cells, however, the bait did not bind to the cell.
The scientists used an instrument that sorts molecules by weight to
identify Ephrin-B2 as the receptor that bound to the bait.
To confirm their findings, the UCLA team engineered a harmless virus
with Nipah virus proteins embedded in its coat. The decoy virus
successfully infected cells vulnerable to the Nipah virus but could
not infect Nipah-resistant cells. In the final step, the decoy virus
entered nerve cells and cells lining blood vessels by latching onto
Ephrin-B2, proving that the receptor is the same doorway that the
real Nipah virus enters to infect these cells.
"We now can screen for small molecules that will block viral entry
via Ephrin B-2 and develop them as therapeutic drugs," said Lee.
"Because pigs are particularly susceptible to Nipah infection, public
health officials could use these drugs to protect the animals, pig
farmers and 1st-line responders, like paramedics, from a Nipah virus
outbreak."
In the United States, agricultural experts estimate the value of pigs
alone in the hog-farming industry at USD 8.6 billion. The 1st
reported outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia occurred between 1998
and 1999, sickening 265 people and killing 105. Spreading from bats
to pigs to humans, the outbreak infected more than 200 pig farmers
and killed 40 percent of them. Desperate to contain the outbreak, the
government ordered its military to kill more than one million pigs,
resulting in economic devastation to the country.
In Bangladesh, death rates of repeated outbreaks of Nipah virus in
the past 4 years have risen to 70 percent, suggesting that the virus
is becoming more lethal.

Organization Livestock Industries, Australian Animal Health
Laboratory, Geelong, Victoria 3220, Australia; and the Protein

Frederick, MD 21702 is entitled: "Ephrin-B2 ligand is a functional
receptor for Hendra virus and Nipah virus."
The Abstract of the paper describes research providing independent
confirmation of the preceding report. "Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah
virus (NiV) belong to the genus _Henipavirus_ of the family
_Paramyxoviridae_ and are unique in that they exhibit a broad species
tropism and cause fatal disease in both animals and humans. They
infect cells through a pH-independent membrane fusion process
mediated by their fusion and attachment glycoproteins. Previously, we
demonstrated identical cell fusion tropisms for HeV and NiV and the
protease-sensitive nature of their unknown cell receptor and
identified a human cell line (HeLa-USU) that was non-permissive for
fusion and virus infection. Here, a microarray analysis was performed
on the HeLa-USU cells, permissive HeLa-CCL2 cells, and 2 other
permissive human cell lines. From this analysis, we identified a list
of genes encoding known and predicted plasma membrane
surface-expressed proteins that were highly expressed in all
permissive cells and absent from the HeLa-USU cells and rank-ordered
them based on their relative levels. Available expression vectors
containing the 1st 10 genes were obtained and individually
transfected into HeLa-USU cells. One clone, encoding human Ephrin-B2
(EFNB2), was found capable of rendering HeLa-USU cells permissive for
HeV- and NiV-mediated cell fusion as well as infection by live virus.
A soluble recombinant EFNB2 could potently block fusion and infection
and bind soluble recombinant HeV and NiV attachment glycoproteins
with high affinity. Together, these data indicate that EFNB2 serves
as a functional receptor for both HeV and NiV. The highly conserved
nature of EFNB2 in humans and animals is consistent with the broad
tropism exhibited by these emerging zoonotic viruses."
These papers report significant advances in the characterization of
these dangerous viruses, which have the potential to accelerate the
design of specific anti-henipavirus antivirals. - Mod.CP]
