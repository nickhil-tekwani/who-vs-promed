Leishmaniasis, military troops - Colombia
---------------------------------------
Colombian Army troops must dodge land mines and ambushes in their offensive
against rebels in the jungle, but one of their biggest obstacles is the
lowly sand fly.
Leishmaniasis, caused by sand-fly bites that produce nasty open sores and
swelling, now forces more troops from the battlefield into hospitals than
gunshots and mine blasts combined. It has hampered the army's unprecedented
onslaught to wipe out the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
Caused by a parasite living in the sand fly's gut, the disease is found in
parts of 88 countries, mostly tropical or subtropical. U.S. soldiers in
Iraq call it "Baghdad boil," and during 2004, hundreds of them had to be
ferried home for treatment.
In Colombia, about 2500 soldiers were hospitalized in 2004 for
leishmaniasis -- up more than 3-fold from 2003 and more than double the
1150 injured in combat, Defense Ministry officials said. "Our soldiers are
going into jungle regions where they've never been before and the rise in
leishmaniasis cases is one of the unfortunate results," Dr. Hector Navarro,
top medical adviser at the ministry, told The Associated Press at the Tres
Esquinas military base in southern Colombia.
He said it usually takes about a month for soldiers, receiving daily
injections to combat leishmaniasis, to recover. The government is now
issuing the troops with long-sleeved T-shirts, teaching them to use bug
spray and ensuring medicine is available, Navarro said. Medicine alone
costs more than $425 per affected soldier. Leishmaniasis has especially
afflicted troops spearheading the offensive known as Plan Patriot deep into
Colombia's steamy southern jungles that began in 2004 and is aimed at
capturing or killing rebel leaders.
"The soldiers make camp at sundown, sit down against a tree to relax, and
unbutton their fatigues, leaving them totally exposed to sand flies,"
Navarro said.
[A 21 year old male], got the disease while fighting in the southern
Cacqueta province. He's been getting treatment at a military clinic in
Bogota for nearly 3 months, but the ugly, itchy boil on his chin won't go
away. "I'm going to have this for the rest of my life," said the distraught
soldier, who said he had been living and fighting in the jungle for 7
months straight when he got infected. "I used repellent, I slept in
hammocks with netting, I did everything to avoid it, but when you're out
there for so long, it's impossible to avoid getting bitten," he said.
The guerrillas are also suffering, judging by the thousands of tubes of
leishmaniasis medicine netted in raids on their camps last year. The New
England Journal of Medicine recently reported that the disease is so
prevalent in the deepest jungles of Colombia that it is seen as a way of
identifying insurgents or their supporters, and that the army may choose to
detain mobile clinics carrying medication.
Leishmaniasis causes large bumps and open sores on the skin, and if
untreated, can cause permanent disfigurement. Many soldiers regard
leishmaniasis scars as a badge of honor, proving they have been on the
front lines pressing the offensive against the insurgents. On a recent day,
troops heading into the jungle at the Miraflores military base in southern
Colombia proudly pulled up their sleeves to show a reporter their
leishmaniasis scars.
Gen. Carlos Alberto Fracica, Plan Patriot's field commander, sought to play
down the concerns. "Getting leishmaniasis is like getting the common cold.
You get it, you take some medicine and you're back on the battlefield. It's
nothing," Fracica said.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in the Amazonas region including Columbia. The
article referred to in the posting [Reilly and Morote, NEJM
2004,351:2576-8] describes how health care facilities that treat
leishmaniasis are used by both sides. - Mod.EP]
[The epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and most other
South American countries can be very complex, involving different species
of parasite and different vectors, much depending on geographical location
and local ecology. Although the report on the infection in Colombia is not
specific, this will be cutaneous leishmaniasis, which can be caused by
several _Leishmania_ species such as _L. amazonensis_, _L. panamensis_ or
_L. braziliensis_. Following treatment or a relapse mucocutaneous
leishmaniasis or espundia can occur, due usually to infection with _L.
braziliensis_ which is often transmitted by the sandfly _Lutzomyia
wellcomei_. This can result in severe facial disfigurement, such as loss of
the nose and destruction of the palate. So I think the gung ho statement
that "leishmaniasis is like getting a common cold. You get it take some
medicine and you're back on the battlefield" is -- to say the least --
optimistic!
Incidentally Colombian sandflies also transmit bartonellosis (sometimes
called Oroya fever or Carrion's disease) caused by _Bartonella
bacilliformis_, and several strains of sandfly fevers (_Phlebovirus_). -
