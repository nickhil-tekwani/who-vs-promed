Alarming reports from Portuguese Military Force in East Timor are saying
that Dili is one of the places in the world with great dengue endemicity.
So the report about quarantine in the port of Darwin as a consequence of
importation of _Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes in ships coming from East Timor is
absolutely justified.
Probably, Australian authorities, should invest much more in mosquito
control in East Timor. All Timorese and Australians should gain from such
an action.

[Are all these informal reports of dengue in East Timor a reflection of a
change or the first news of an awful situation. It is possible that the
breakdown of governmental actions because of the civil unrest has brought a
halt to vector control measures. It is also possible that there hadn't
been any vector control measures, and all that had been controlled was news
of the extent of the situation. In case no one has noticed, war is not a
good thing for people. - Mod.CHC
