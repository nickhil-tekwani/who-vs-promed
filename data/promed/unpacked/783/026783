[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for sending this Gideon summary.
Since several hepatitis virus infections are common in Pakistan,
including Sindh province, the etiological agent responsible for the
hepatitis outbreak in Sindh province reported in the 9 Jun 2009
ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20090609.2125) remains uncertain.
ProMED would appreciate receiving laboratory results that determine
the virus involved as they become available.
