A Maine family is grieving the loss of their toddler after they say he was exposed to a deadly strain of _E. coli_ at a county fair.

MyFoxBoston.com reported that the 20-month-old died Monday, 5 Oct 2015, after visiting the petting zoo at the Oxford County Fair in Maine, where he was infected with _E. coli_. Some strains of _E. coli_ are harmless, while others can lead to severe anemia and kidney failure. The family said that the boy died after contracting hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition that results from the abnormal destruction of red blood cells. HUS is most common in children, and the most common cause of acute kidney failure among this demographic, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

According to MyFoxBoston.com, the state's health commission hasn't confirmed the link between the fair and the boy's death, but the toddler was one of 2 toddlers who contracted HUS in Maine and went to the same petting zoo

[Although the serotype of _E. coli_ is not stated, it is certainly likely to be an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either O157 or one of the other serotypes. Petting zoos at state fairs are well recognized to be a venue for transmission of this potentially lethal toxin-producing pathogen.

The CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/features/animalexhibits/) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:
"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer [2015]. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

"Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill.

"If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
- Use hand-washing stations.
- Find out where hand-washing stations are located.
- Always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking.
- Running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

"Food and drinks:
- Keep food and drinks out of animal areas.
- Do not share your food with animals.
- Do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

"Children:
- Children younger than 5 years old need supervision.
- Never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals.
- Hand washing should be supervised."
