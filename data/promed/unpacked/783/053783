Multistate investigation of measles among adoptees from China; April 2004
---------------------------------------------------
On 6 Apr 2004, Public Health Seattle and King County, Washington, reported
a laboratory-confirmed case of measles in a recently adopted child from
China. Public health authorities in Washington state notified the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which collaborated with health
officials in other states to locate other recently adopted children from
China and contact their adoptive families. This report summarizes the
preliminary results of an ongoing multistate investigation that has so far
identified 4 confirmed and 5 suspected cases of measles among adoptees from
China, underscoring the need for health care providers to remain vigilant
for measles and other vaccine-preventable communicable diseases in children
adopted from international regions.
The investigation determined that a group of 11 families traveled to China
in March 2004 to adopt children. The group and their 12 adopted children
remained together for approximately 10 days during the adoption process
before departing for the United States on 26 Mar 2004. The 12 children were
adopted from 2 orphanages in Hunan Province. They traveled to 5 US states.
8 traveled to Washington, and one each traveled to Alaska, Florida,
Maryland, and New York.
As of Fri 9 Apr 2004, investigators had determined that 9 of the 12 adopted
children had measles-like rash illness, including 4 (3 in Washington and
one in Maryland) who were serologically confirmed to have measles. The 9
serologically confirmed or suspected cases were aged 12 to 18 months; they
had rash onset during the period 22 Mar to 6 Apr 2004. The 3 children who
did not develop measles-like rash illness traveled to Washington (a child
aged 7 years), Alaska (a child aged 13 months), and Florida (a child aged
13 months). To date, all 12 children have been or are being evaluated for
laboratory evidence of measles or are under observation by public health
authorities. Vaccination status or history of measles illness is not known
for any of the 12 children. State and local health departments are
continuing to investigate, seeking potential cases, identifying and
evaluating potential contacts, and providing prophylaxis when indicated, as
recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (1).
3 of the children with suspected measles were probably infectious while
traveling from China to the US on 26 Mar 2004 on the following airline
flights: United Airlines flight 862 from Hong Kong to San Francisco, Cathay
Pacific flight CX872 from Hong Kong to San Francisco, United Airlines
flight 476 from San Francisco to Seattle, and United Airlines flight 794
from San Francisco to Seattle. [The infectious period for measles is from 4
days before to 4 days after onset of rash.]
Because most people in the US are immune to measles, US airline passengers
usually are at low risk. But people traveling on the 4 flights who have
fever or rash on or before 16 Apr 2004 should be evaluated for measles by a
health care provider. [The incubation period for measles from the time of
exposure to onset of rash is 7 to 21 days.] Investigators have determined
that the other 6 children with rash illness were not likely to have been
infectious with measles during the time they traveled from China to their
ultimate destinations in the US.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Measles, a highly infectious viral illness that can cause pneumonia,
diarrhea, encephalitis, and death, continues to be imported into the US
(2). Although measles is no longer endemic in the US (3), as this
investigation highlights, maintaining high levels of vaccination coverage
and strong surveillance in the US is critical.
During 2001, an outbreak among children adopted internationally resulted in
14 US measles cases, 10 among adopted children and 4 among caregivers and
siblings aged 28 months to 47 years (4). Health care providers should have
a high index of suspicion for measles in people with febrile rash illness
from families who recently adopted children from abroad and among people
who have had close contact with children who were adopted recently from
abroad. Suspected cases should be reported to the local health department.
In the latest outbreak, all confirmed and suspected cases of measles have
been in children aged >12 months, for whom vaccination with
measles-containing vaccine is recommended in both the US (1) and China (5).
Vaccination of internationally adopted children is not required before
their immigration into the US, but should occur within 30 days of entry
(6). Although this measure should ensure that internationally adopted
children receive recommended vaccines expeditiously, it cannot prevent
importation of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. Efforts to ensure
that adoptees are administered safe and age-appropriate vaccines in their
country of origin in accordance with recommendations of the World Health
Organization or the country of origin could help prevent this type of
importation in the future.
