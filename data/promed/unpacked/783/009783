In south China's Guangdong Province, 37 people have been confirmed as having contracted dengue fever in Zhongshan City, China's Xinhua news agency reported, quoting local authorities as saying on Saturday [20 Jul 2013].

As of Friday [19 Jul 2013] afternoon, all 37 patients were found in 5 localities in the city's Huangpu Township since 16 Jul [2013], and it is likely that more cases will be reported, the Guangdong provincial disease control and prevention centre said.

He Jianfeng, an expert from the Disease Control and Prevention Centre, said the patients have been hospitalised, showing mild symptoms of muscle pains and skin rashes.

None of them had made trips to Southeast Asia, where most infections occur, indicating that the outbreak is not imported, according to He.

He attributed the outbreak to the rainy weather which favoured mosquito reproduction and said the situation had been brought under control.

The number of contracted cases of the potentially fatal, mosquito-borne disease has been rising year on year. Experts have warned about controlling and preventing the mosquito bites that transmit it.

[ProMED-mail seldom receives reports of dengue outbreaks in China. It would be of interest to know what the _Aedes aegypti_ situation is in Guangdong Province. The most recent dengue outbreak there reported by ProMED-mail (archive no. 20121022.1356841) was on 15 Oct 2012.

[2] Cross protection, Thailand

Abstract
Dengue, a mosquitoborne virus of humans, infects over 50 million people annually. Infection with any of the 4 dengue serotypes induces protective immunity to that serotype, but does not confer long-term protection against infection by other serotype. The immunological interactions between serotypes are of central importance in understanding epidemiological dynamics and anticipating the impact of dengue vaccines. We analysed a 38-year time series with 12 197 serotyped dengue infections from a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Using novel mechanistic models to represent different hypothesized immune interactions between serotypes, we found strong evidence that infection with dengue provides substantial short-term cross-protection against other serotypes (approx. 1-3 years). This is the 1st quantitative evidence that short-term cross-protection exists since human experimental infection studies performed in the 1950s. These findings will impact strategies for designing dengue vaccine studies, future multi-strain modelling efforts, and our understanding of evolutionary pressures in multi-strain disease systems.

[This study is valuable not just for its application to vaccine development and application but in providing a quantified basis for better understanding the role of cross protection over time in epidemiological studies. ProMED-mail thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for sending in this report.
