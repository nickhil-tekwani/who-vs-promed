[As of close of day 25 Jan 2020, there were 1975 confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV reported out of 30 of the 33 provinces (including autonomous regions and municipalities) including 324 severe cases and 56 deaths. 23 431 close contacts have been tracked. There is a huge effort to identify infected individuals and contain transmission of this virus in China. From media reports, tourism is being shut down.

Areas with heavy concentration of cases (mostly in Hubei province) have been quarantined, so there is no traffic in or out of these areas. The military has brought in medical personnel to handle the surge requirements, and new hospitals are being built to deal with the surge capacity.

Remembering back to the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003, it seems as though the timetable for this outbreak is much shorter than with SARS. The 1st identifiable case (a.k.a. the postulated index case) had date of onset of illness on 22 Nov 2002 in Guangdong. There was low level transmission in December 2002, (contained to Guangdong) and it picked up in the 2nd half of January 2003, with social media websites breaking the silence of the outbreak in the early part of February 2003; ProMED posted on these social media reports on 10 Feb 2003 (see Pneumonia - China (Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357). It continued "exploding" in Guangdong throughout February 2003. On 11 Mar 2003, there was the 1st report of a case outside of China (Undiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI 20030311.0595) and by 15 Mar 2003, there were imported cases into Viet Nam, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany and Canada, with instances of person-to-person transmission (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Worldwide 20030315.0637). While we still don't know the date of onset of the index case, the local explosion has taken approximately 1 month, and the multicountry importation of cases has also occurred in the same 1-month period. Both outbreaks seemed to have been amplified by the lunar new year travel, but it appears as though the SARS outbreak was contained to Guangdong for 3+ months before it exploded outside of Guangdong and China, whereas it has taken maybe 4-6 weeks for the same pattern in this current outbreak. The SARS major "escape" out of China was related to a single "superspreader" staying in a hotel in Hong Kong, with international visitors who returned to their home countries infected with the SARS-CoV.

[3] New countries confirming imported cases: Canada

Canada ex China
Date: Sat 25 Jan 2020
Source: CBC [edited]
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760


Canada confirmed its 1st "presumptive" case of coronavirus in Toronto as the number of infections worldwide surpasses 1900 cases.
------------------------------------
Public health officials announced Saturday [25 Jan 2020] afternoon the confirmed case -- a man in his 50s who had travelled to Wuhan, China -- was found at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Within a day of arriving, officials say, he became "quite ill," said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, associate chief medical officer of health with the provincial Ministry of Health. Officials say lab results were received Saturday afternoon. The man is in stable condition.

While the case has been confirmed by a test in Toronto, officials said it has yet to complete separate testing by the National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases in Winnipeg. The illness can't be officially confirmed until that testing is completed.

Toronto's medical officer of health Dr. Eileen de Villa says a team is tracking down those who might have been in contact with the man, whose family members are already in self-isolation.

What do we know about the case?
Officials said the man took a flight on 21 Jan 2020 from Wuhan to Guangzhou, then from Guangzhou to Toronto, arriving on 22 Jan 2020.

He is believed to have travelled "privately" from the airport to his home. Officials do not believe he took public transit. They have not said what part of the city the man lives in.

Upon arriving, he told family members he felt ill and called 911. Officials say paramedics arrived prepared, taking all necessary precautions "right from 1st contact" until the hand-off to the hospital's emergency department on [23 Jan 2020], officials say.

But in a tweet following Saturday's [25 Jan 2020] news conference, the Toronto Paramedic Union said the 1st responders who transported the man only learned he was infected with the coronavirus after the fact.

Toronto Public Health issued a statement in response saying it does not identify paramedics about patient lab results if they have not been exposed to a public health risk.

"In this situation, the paramedics used full personal protective equipment and no follow up was therefore necessary," said the statement from Dr. Rita Shahin, associate medical officer of health.

The union later sent a pair of follow up tweets, confirming that the division was notified by Toronto Public Health "of a change in condition to a patient that paramedics transported.

"Paramedics were fully protected during the emergency call. It remains unacceptable that they were not informed of the change in condition prior to the media release."

When the man arrived at Sunnybrook, hospital officials say he was immediately identified as possibly affected by the virus and placed into a negative pressure room to prevent any contamination, with health-care workers taking protective measures to ensure the safety of staff and other patients.

What's the likelihood it will spread?
Officials are now trying to determine exactly how much contact the man could have had with others since his return to Canada. Officials say any contact was likely limited to members of his household. Anyone who lived with the man is currently in "self-isolation," said Yaffe.

It remains unknown whether anyone travelling on the plane with the individual may have been exposed to the virus. Dr. David Williams, the province's chief medical officer of health, told reporters people without symptoms are not deemed to be contagious. But to what degree the man displayed symptoms in-flight has yet to be determined.

The federal government says it has been working with provincial, territorial and international counterparts since China 1st began reporting cases to make sure Canada is prepared to limit the spread of the infection.

"Canadian hospitals have strong infection control systems and procedures in place to limit the spread of infection and protect health-care workers," said federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu, who is expected to hold a news conference on Sunday [26 Jan 2020] morning.

What does "presumptive" mean?
Health officials referred to the case as "presumptive" because they're being cautious due to the detailed process of testing and validating the sample, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.

When testing for a typical virus, technicians with the Public Health Ontario Laboratory would compare the sample with positive and negative specimens in order to verify a positive result, she said.

But because the test for the new coronavirus was developed so quickly based on positive cases overseas, it's standard practice to have 2 laboratories verify the sample. "You never call something definitive until 2 labs with 2 different tests have called it," McGeer said. "It would be really surprising if it wasn't confirmed."

How deadly is the virus?
Dr. David Williams, chief medical officer of health for Ontario, told the news conference that the province's health system acted as it should. "As a result, the risk to Ontarians is still low, and things are managed and well-controlled," Williams said.

It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which results in 12 200 hospitalizations and about 3500 deaths yearly.

China reports 15 new coronavirus fatalities, with the total death toll now 56. While 41 people have died of the virus in China, the World Health Organization has not declared the outbreak to be an international public health emergency. So far, there have been 56 reported deaths attributed to the virus, all in China, according to China's state media.

The majority of those infections have been inside China, where the virus has mostly been concentrated in Wuhan city, although there have been confirmed cases reported in Shanghai and Beijing, along with Hong Kong and Macao.

Toronto is prepared to handle a coronavirus outbreak, health officials say. Outside of China, cases have been confirmed in France, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, Viet Nam, Australia and Malaysia.

In China, transportation has also been shut down in roughly a dozen cities, home to roughly 36 million people. Canadian officials have said such mass quarantines are unlikely, even if the virus spread here.

Those with weakened immune systems are most vulnerable to severe disease. That includes the elderly and people with chronic illness, such as diabetes, cancer, heart or lung disease.

Those travelling to China, where the majority of infections have happened, are advised to avoid crowded areas and seek medical attention if they become sick. The federal government advises avoiding farms, live animal markets and contact with animals alive or dead, in addition to usual precautions.

Confirmation of this case comes just one day after Williams said it was only "a matter of where and when" the virus would arrive in Canada.

"Ontario is ready, our systems are ready," Williams said in a news conference Friday [24 Jan 2020]. "We're light years away of where we were in 2003," he said, referring to the SARS outbreak that killed 44 people in the Toronto area.

The federal government says measures to stem the risk and spread of diseases like the coronavirus are in place. These include messages on arrival screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a border services officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms, as well as an additional health screening question on electronic kiosks used by international travellers.

If need be, officials say passengers will be referred to local hospitals, with the individual's travel history available to the hospital they may arrive at.

British Columbia's minister of health and provincial health officer said there have been no cases in B.C., and the overall risk to the province is still low. ""We are closely watching the situation in Canada and globally and are meeting regularly with our counterparts across the country to make sure we are prepared if cases arise in B.C.," Adrian Dix and Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a statement issued Saturday [25 Jan 2020].

Ontario Confirms 2nd Presumptive Case of Wuhan Novel Coronavirus; Wife of 1st Case, Now Confirmed Positive, has been in Self-Isolation
----------------------------
Today [27 Dec 2020], Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, confirmed that the wife of the province's 1st case of Wuhan novel coronavirus has tested positive for the virus at Ontario's public health laboratory. Since arriving in Toronto with her husband, this individual has been in self-isolation.

"We are working alongside Toronto Public Health, who has been in regular contact with the individual during their self-isolation period," said Dr. Williams. "Given the fact that she has been in self-isolation, the risk to Ontarians remains low."

Dr. Williams, joined by Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health, and Dr. Eileen de Villa, Medical Officer of Health for the City of Toronto, will provide an update on the emerging situation at 11:30 a.m. at Queen's Park. A media advisory will be issued shortly with further details.

Pakistan (Punjab): 5 suspected cases
Date: Sun 27 Jan 2020
Source: The Express Tribune [edited]
https://tribune.com.pk/story/2144826/1-tally-suspected-china-virus-cases-pakistan-rises-five/


A new case of suspected novel coronavirus has surfaced in Multan, taking the overall tally of deadly China virus in Pakistan to 5, The Express Tribune learnt on [Sun 26 Jan 2020].

According to sources in the health ministry, 2 samples from Multan have been sent to Hong Kong for confirmation as there are no laboratories in Pakistan equipped to diagnose the pathogen. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) received the samples last night [26 Jan 2020], they added.

One of the 2 suspected coronavirus patients in Multan is a Pakistani national, said the sources.

On [Sat 25 Jan 2020], NIH chief Major General Dr Aamer Ikram said a Chinese national had been admitted to the Nishtar Hospital, Multan and kept in the isolation ward after he showed symptoms of the disease including flu, cough and fever.

Test reports are expected to arrive in the next 24 to 48 hours. The patients will receive necessary treatment based on the results of test reports.

According to sources, the Chinese national, hospitalised in Multan, travelled from China to Dubai and reached Karachi on [21 Jan 2020]. After landing in Karachi, he took a flight to Multan.

Three Chinese nationals were also admitted to Lahore's Services Hospital and shifted to the isolation ward on [Sat 25 Jan 2020].

According to hospital sources, the suspected patients were residents of the Chinese city of Wuhan and had recently arrived in Lahore.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has confirmed that all Pakistanis in Wuhan, and in other parts of China, are safe.

China has expanded drastic travel restrictions to contain the viral contagion that has killed 56 people and infected nearly 2000, as the United States and France prepared to evacuate their citizens from a quarantined city at the outbreak's epicentre.

China has locked down the hard-hit province of Hubei in the country's centre in an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people to slow the spread of a respiratory illness that President Xi Jinping said posed a "grave" threat.

Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and around the world, with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries as distant as France, Australia and the United States.

The World Health Organization puts the number of confirmed cases reported from mainland China at 1975. "This includes 324 severe cases and 56 people who have died," the WHO added.

[So far, these suspected cases have tested negative for other common respiratory pathogens and the patients are doing fine. An important impediment to confirming cases is availability of the nCoV confirmatory assay in the country(ies) at the time of its emergence. This lag time can be improved by adoption of advanced methods such as field sequencing and designing detection primers and probes based on early data. This again requires capacity building of the workforce, better infrastructure to support this operational capacity; in short - Preparedness-Mod.UBA]

[5] Transmission prior to seafood market
Date: Mon 27 Jan 2020

Wuhan seafood market may not be source of novel virus spreading globally
----------------------------------
As confirmed cases of a novel virus surge around the world with worrisome speed, all eyes have so far focused on a seafood market in Wuhan, China as the origin of the outbreak. But a description of the 1st clinical cases published in The Lancet on Friday [24 Jan 2020] challenges that hypothesis.

The paper, written by a large group of Chinese researchers from several institutions, offers details about the 1st 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 Dec 2019 and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report. "No epidemiological link was found between the 1st patient and later cases," they state. Their data also show that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. "That's a big number, 13, with no link," says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University.

Earlier reports from Chinese health authorities and the World Health Organization had said the 1st patient had onset of symptoms on 8 Dec 2019, and those reports simply said "most" cases had links to the seafood market, which was closed on 1 Jan 2020.

Lucey says that if the new data are accurate, the 1st human infections must have occurred in November 2019 -- if not earlier -- because there is an incubation time between infection and symptoms surfacing. If so, the virus possibly spread silently between people in Wuhan and perhaps elsewhere before the cluster of cases from the city's now-infamous Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was discovered in late December 2019. "The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace," Lucey asserts.

The Lancet paper's data also raise questions about the accuracy of the initial information China provided, Lucey says. At the beginning of the outbreak, the main official sources of public information were notices from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. Its notices on 11 Jan 2020 started to refer to the 41 patients as the only confirmed cases, and the count remained the same until 18 Jan 2020. The notices did not state that the seafood market was the source, but they repeatedly noted that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission and that most cases were linked to the market. Because the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission noted that diagnostic tests had confirmed these 41 cases by 10 Jan 2020 and that officials presumably knew the case histories of each patient, "China must have realized the epidemic did not originate in that Wuhan Huanan seafood market," Lucey tells Science Insider. (Lucey also spoke about his concerns in an interview published online yesterday [26 Jan 2020] by Science Speaks, a project of the Infectious Disease Society of America.)

Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at the Scripps Research Institute who has analyzed sequences of 2019-nCoV to try to clarify its origin, says the 1 Dec 2019 timing of the 1st confirmed case was "an interesting tidbit" in The Lancet paper. "The scenario of somebody being infected outside the market and then later bringing it to the market is one of the 3 scenarios we have considered that is still consistent with the data," he says. "It's entirely plausible given our current data and knowledge." The other 2 scenarios are that the origin was a group of infected animals or a single animal that came into that marketplace.

Andersen posted his analysis of 27 available genomes of 2019-nCoV on 25 Jan 2020 on a virology research website. It suggests they had a "most recent common ancestor," meaning a common source, as early as 1 Oct 2019.

Bin Cao of Capital Medical University, the corresponding author of The Lancet article and a pulmonary specialist, wrote in an email to Science Insider that he and his co-authors "appreciate the criticism" from Lucey.

"Now it seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus," he wrote. "But to be honest, we still do not know where the virus came from now."

Lucey notes that the discovery of the coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, a sometimes fatal disease that occurs sporadically, came from a patient in Saudi Arabia in June 2012, although later studies traced it back to an earlier hospital outbreak of unexplained pneumonia in Jordan in April 2012. Stored samples from 2 people who died in Jordan confirmed they had been infected with the virus. Retrospective analyses of blood samples in China from people and animals -- including vendors from other animal markets -- may reveal a clear picture of where the 2019-nCoV originated, he suggests. "There might be a clear signal among the noise," he says.
