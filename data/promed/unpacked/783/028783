SALMONELLA MENSTON: RFI
=======================
From: "Wright, Jackie" <jacqueline.wright@esr.cri.nz>
Subject: Salmonella menston
I am seeking information from fellow promed users on the prevalence and
distribution of the Salmonella serotype menston. Here in New Zealand we use
a strain of _Salmonella menston_ as the national positive control strain.
This is because Salmonella menston is not found naturally in New Zealand.
The isolate is occasionally isolated from specimens here, but investigations
invariably show that a breakdown in procedure has allowed the positive
control strain to infect the test culture. However, we are uncertain as to
the prevalence and distribution of this serotype elsewhere in the world and
I would be keen for people to contact me directly with information on this.
