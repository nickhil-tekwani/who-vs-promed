Galveston Bay Reopens for Limited Commercial Oyster Harvesting
Texas Commissioner of Health William R. Archer III, M.D., today announced
that commercial oyster harvesting could resume in Galveston Bay effective at
12:01 a.m. Saturday, but oysters must be removed from their shells and
packed in containers labeled "For Cooked Consumption Only" before being
shipped or sold.
Shipment and sale of in-the-shell or on-the-half-shell oysters, popular with
consumers of raw oysters, will not be allowed yet. Archer warned consumers
that oysters from the bay should be cooked before being eaten. He said
thorough cooking should kill any bacteria.
Harvesting in Galveston Bay was halted 26 Jun 1998 after the Texas
Department of Health (TDH) linked an outbreak of diarrheal illness to
oysters from the bay. TDH tallied 416 cases of the illness believed
to be caused by _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, a bacteria. Illnesses were
reported from 13 states and included 296 cases in Texas. Testing of
some of those who became ill identified a specific type of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ as the culprit. But laboratory testing in the past
three months has not detected the type, 03:K6, in oyster samples from
the bay.
Laboratory testing did identify another type of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ capable of causing illness ... 08:K. This was found
in one of 90 sample batches of oysters from the bay. But Archer said
the type has never actually been identified as the cause of any
illnesses or outbreaks. He said water conditions in the bay are
essentially the same as they were in June when the outbreak occurred.
"If these oysters are adequately cooked, there should be no
problems."
The June outbreak linked to Galveston Bay oysters was the first in
the U.S. known to be caused by the 03:K6 type of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_, but 03:K6 has been implicated in illness outbreaks
in Japan and other Asian countries.

This summer, _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ illness outbreaks also have
been linked to oysters from Washington and New York. TDH and local
health officials will monitor for compliance with the harvesting and
labeling requirements and for _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ illnesses.

The illness ultimately was blamed on a strain of bacterium normally found in
waters around Japan and some other Asian locations. Federal health officials
speculate that the bacterium got into Galveston Bay when a passing ship
dumped ballast water. Months of testing have failed to isolate this strain
directly from oysters in Galveston Bay however.
(Comment: While the original strain of _V. parahemolyticus_ may well be
gone, I imagine that it remains possible that the same series of events
could cause a recurrence of the problem, thus these regulations. Maybe
someone should look into the habit of dumping ballast water in shallow, low
salinity areas.)

[It is interesting that even though there is an ecological continuity from
Galveston through to the easternmost Louisiana oyster beds, these
organisms caused no problems in Louisiana, which might support the
ballast hypothesis - Mod.MHJ
