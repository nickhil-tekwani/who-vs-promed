[1] China: 5 month review H7N9, H5N6

From last September [2015] to 1 Feb [2016], 44 H7N9 human cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported in the Chinese mainland, 70 cases fewer than the same period of the previous year, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said on [Tue 2 Feb 2016].

An expert with the commission said the decrease of reported cases has been related to the country's tougher supervision over live poultry markets.

Over the same period, 5 human cases of H5N6 were reported nationwide, with 2 patients dead. Official data show that as of [24 Jan 2016], China has reported 9 cases of human infection of H5N6 avian influenza virus with 5 deaths, since the 1st case was discovered in 2014.

Scientists have not found any mutation of H7N9 or H5N6 viruses that poses threats to public health so far, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). There's no evidence of human-to-human transmission in the spread of the viruses, said Ni Daxin, deputy head of the Office of Disease Control and Emergency Response under the China CDC.

Winter and spring are the peak seasons for respiratory infectious diseases, making clusters of H7N9 and H5N6 human cases more likely in some areas on the mainland, Ni said.

[2] China (Hunan): H7N9
Date: Thu 4 Feb 2016

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (4 Feb 2016) closely monitoring an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in the mainland, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

According to the Health and Family Planning Commission (HFPC) of Hunan province, the 60-year-old male patient lived in Yongzhou, Hunan.

"H5 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses can cause severe infections in humans. Due to the seasonal pattern, our risk assessment shows that the activity of avian influenza viruses is expected to remain at a high level in winter months. Increased numbers of human H5N6 and H7N9 cases have been recorded in the mainland since this winter [2015-2016]. Locally, birds positive for H5N6 were also detected this winter. The public, particularly poultry traders, travellers, and those who may visit the mainland in the coming Lunar New Year [8 Feb 2016], should be highly alert. Do not visit poultry markets and farms. Avoid poultry contact. We will continue to monitor the regional and global disease situation," a spokesman for the CHP said.

From 2013 to date [4 Feb 2016], 683 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the mainland health authorities.

The DH's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up. The display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is under way. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information. Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:
- do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
- if contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels, and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.
