ORPHAN DRUGS & VACCINES
=======================

C.J. Peters' comments on the Lassa fever situation in Sierra Leone
[see ProMED-mail archive 970307170619] raise some
insightful questions (as usual) about resources for disease control. Some of
these questions may be best dealt with by ProMED-mail readers with more
knowledge of legal and policy issues. Some may be best dealt with over a few
beers...
Consider a drug such as intravenous ribavirin which is patented by a private
company with no compelling financial reason to develop or produce it, but the
drug may be important to deal with importations, rare events (eg overwhelming
measles), or in poor countries. What can be done to insure a supply? Can the
patent rights be purchased (or even taken over) by the government, WHO, or
some NGO? Could they afford to produce it? Are there more creative solutions
like extending liability protection and patent extension in exchange for a
cheap and adequate supply for public health?
In the case of vaccine research and production, we still struggle with the
idea of how to produce needed vaccines which will not be profitable. This
doesn't only apply to arenavirus disease or filoviruses, but to much more
"mundane" vaccines such as malaria or HIV vaccines. I hear discussions on
how to fund research, but not on how to fund production. Can a government
guarantee a minimum return on investment if a US market fails to materialize,
yet let the company gamble for big profits if they can develop a market in
"rich" countries?
What about other creative solutions? Can we tax a highly profitable sector,
say cholesterol reduction drugs, oral cephalosporins or weight loss drugs to
fund a specific orphan disease research fund to maintain steady funding in
tropical medicine and emerging diseases, even after the current trendiness
wears off?
No official disclaimers necessary...
