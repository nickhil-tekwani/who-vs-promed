Poliomyelitis - Democratic Republic of the Congo [8 Jan 2019]
-------------------------------------------------------------
As of October 2018, genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates were detected in 2 cases from Haut-Katanga province (Mufunga-Sampwe district) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The 1st case was a 11-year old child who experienced onset of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on [6 Oct 2018]. The 2nd case was a 29-month old child who experienced onset of symptoms on [7 Oct 2018], and is a known contact of the 1st case. The isolated viruses are a new emergence and unrelated to previously-detected cVDPV2s affecting the country. This is the 4th distinct outbreak of cVDPV2 detected in the country since June 2017. In total, 42 cVDPV2 cases have now been confirmed since detection of the 1st outbreak in June 2017, 20 cases of which were detected in 2018.

Public health response
In February 2018, the government declared cVDPV2 to be a national public health emergency. On [26 Jul 2018], the Minister of Health, WHO Director General, the Regional Director for Africa, and provincial governors convened an urgent, high-level meeting and signed the 'Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication'. Provincial governors pledged to provide the necessary oversight, accountability and resources required to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. It is imperative that the remaining operational gaps in outbreak response are urgently filled with the appropriate oversight and engagement.

WHO and partners are responding in accordance with international outbreak response protocols including through administration of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2). However, operational gaps such as the under-immunization of high-risk populations, continue to hamper the full implementation of these protocols. Thus, the response so far has not adequately controlled the outbreak nor prevented its spread. The recent emergence of the 4th outbreak of cVDPV2 from Haut Katanga can potentially be attributed to the prior use of mOPV2 and may be related to the response program's current limited capacity to adapt effectively and implement necessary corrective measures in a timely manner.

With the evidence of geographic spread of some of these strains and emergence of the new strain, 2 large scale rounds of mOPV2 were administered in September 2018 and October 2018 targeting around 12 million children in 16 of 26 provinces of the country. Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries.

The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to the ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province to the east of the country. Polio outbreak response teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner.

WHO risk assessment
Currently, WHO finds the overall national public health risk associated with these 4 outbreaks to be very high. The risk of international spread, particularly to the neighboring countries also remains high due to the continuation of these outbreaks close to international borders. This risk is magnified by known population movements between the affected areas of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Central African Republic, Zambia and South Sudan.

As of July 2018, in light of the epidemiology of the reported polio cases, genetic analyses of the isolated polioviruses, risk of further in-country and international spread, and the country's response capacity, the outbreak has been graded as a Grade 2 public health emergency based on the WHO Emergency Response Framework.

The detection of cVDPV2s underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage to minimize the risk and consequences of poliovirus circulation. These events also highlight the risks posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is necessary to impede further disease transmission, ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas, and prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to monitor and evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents and visitors staying for more than 4 weeks in affected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel. Efforts should also be made to ensure that individuals who received vaccinations are provided the appropriate documentation to record their vaccination status.

As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country affected by poliovirus transmission should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency.

At this time, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the basis of the information available for the current cVDPV2 outbreaks.

Cross border activities should be conducted between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries to strengthen AFP surveillance and routine immunization as well as operations linked to the control of other vaccine preventable diseases. Direct and regular collaboration between neighboring provinces and districts should begin quickly awaiting formal administrative and political address.

[The disturbing part of the above report is the sentence "The recent emergence of the 4th outbreak of cVDPV2 from Haut Katanga can potentially be attributed to the prior use of mOPV2 and may be related to the response program's current limited capacity to adapt effectively and implement necessary corrective measures in a timely manner." This may be a presage of future events with cVDPV2 outbreaks in other areas with sub-optimal vaccination infrastructures and resultant sub-optimal coverages during vaccination campaigns for other cVDPV outbreaks.

[2] China - vaccine challenges
Date: 9 Jan 2019

More than 100 children in eastern China have been given expired polio vaccines by a local health centre, according to mainland media, just months after a public health scare over faulty products.

A total of 145 infants and toddlers in Jinhu county, coastal Jiangsu province received the oral vaccines that were past their expiry date of [11 Dec 2018], news website Thepaper.cn reported.

The case came to light on [Mon 7 Jan 2019], when a hospital worker discovered the vaccine about to be given to their child was nearly a month out of date.

Children who have been given the batch of expired vaccines range in age from 3 months to 4 years, according to the report.

The report said some of the children had experienced adverse health effects such as vomiting and drowsiness since they were vaccinated.

Jinhu authorities had invited provincial experts to carry out health checks for all affected children on [Thu 10 Jan 2019], the report said, citing the county propaganda chief.

A total of 3 public health officials in the county have been removed from their posts and the health centre workers involved have been suspended and placed under investigation, according to the report.

In China, polio vaccines are part of a compulsory immunisation programme provided free by the disease control authorities. Every child must be vaccinated 4 times from when they are 2 months until they are 4 years old.

Confidence in the country's vaccination industry was already low - the Jinhu case comes after a nationwide outcry over vaccine safety last summer [2018] that was widely seen as China's worst public health storm in years.

That crisis erupted in July [2018], when the drug regulator reported that Changchun Changsheng Bio-technology, one of the country's biggest vaccine makers, had produced 252 600 substandard DPT vaccines that were given to hundreds of thousands of babies - some as young as 3 months old.

As well as the faulty diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus shots, the company also forged data in the production of some 113 000 rabies vaccines, the authorities said. A subsequent investigation found that the company had engaged in such malpractice for more than 4 years.

It came after health authorities in 2016 said 2 million improperly stored vaccines had been sold across China. A year earlier [2015], hundreds of infants in central Henan province were reportedly given expired vaccines, causing 2 deaths. And in 2010, journalist Wang Keqin published investigative reports on unrefrigerated vaccines in Shanxi province that killed 4 children and sickened more than 70 others.

[With the description of the 4th outbreak of cVDPV2 in the DR Congo in section [1] above, followed by the vaccine scandal article in Chin's Jiangsu province, this report is not a cheerful report. The comment in this article that children had experienced adverse health effects such as vomiting and drowsiness is less likely due to administration of OPV 1 month past its expiration date. The concern here would be of children receiving vaccine that potentially had reduced potency. Nevertheless, the review of the prior events related to vaccine potency issues for other vaccines in China, in a country with over 1.3 billion population, and occurring in a state (Jiangsu) with a population of over 80 million, and a country with a population of over 5 million in the prefecture city of Huai'an. Hence, not an insignificant potential "pocket" of susceptibles should reduced potency vaccine be administered.

Sigh, challenges for the vaccination efforts in China, and for the polio eradication effort.
