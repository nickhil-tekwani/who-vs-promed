Confirmation of red blotch-associated virus vector
--------------------------------------------------
Researchers at the University of California [UC] have identified the 3-cornered alfalfa treehopper (_Spissistilus festinus_) as the 1st known vector for red blotch-associated virus in greenhouse experiments. They caution that the discovery does not mean it is the only vector. However, the finding opens new avenues to help control both the virus and the pest.

The hopper is native to North America, but its range has largely been restricted to the southern United States. [Grapevine] red blotch [GRB] disease was first recognized in 2008 in California, but is now present in many major grape production regions of the US and Canada. The disease is not known to kill grapevines; however, there is an effect on the wine produced.

Brian Bahder [UC] said a vineyard had been healthy for 70 years. "Then, in the last few years, they brought in new material from a nursery, and all of a sudden, you get a cluster [of GRB] on the edge of the vineyard, which is indicative of a vector." He focused his greenhouse tests on 5 suspected vectors, including the treehopper (a member of the Membracidae family), 2 species of leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), one jumping plant louse (Psyllidae), and a planthopper (Cixiidae). Just the treehopper transmitted the virus.

Since the announcement, researchers already found overwintering adults [in vineyards] that were infected with the virus in the salivary glands [which] would mean they are capable of spreading the virus. More research will center on whether adults can transfer the virus through eggs to nymphs, and when nymphs and adults move from ground cover to the vines themselves.

[Grapevine red blotch (GRB) has been identified recently as a syndrome that affects fruit ripening. So far it is being reported from the US and Canada on a wide range of grape cultivars, including wine, table, raisin, and rootstock varieties. It does not appear to be a new disease but is likely to have escaped detection because its symptoms resemble leafroll disease (associated with several viruses within the family _Closteroviridae_; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Symptoms of GRB appear in autumn when leaves normally would turn shades of yellow. They may include irregular red(ish) blotches on leaf blades, pink or red veins, occasional reddening of leaf blades, as well as slow accumulation of sugars or failure to mature in fruits. It is not known whether there are any effects on fruit yield or plant longevity. Symptoms differ from leafroll disease mainly in that the leaf margins do not roll downwards.

The disease has been shown to be graft transmissible. A new virus has been shown to be associated with GRB in the US and Canada and was given the preliminary name grapevine red blotch associated virus (GRBaV). It is thought to be a likely member of the family _Geminiviridae_, but final taxonomy still requires complete characterisation. The virus has been detected in the host before appearance of symptoms and also in dormant canes. Like many viruses (and viroids) of mainly vegetatively propagated hosts, the new virus may have been spread widely with host varieties and, therefore, may be present outside the US as well.

Disease management of grapevine viruses may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of clean planting material -- including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting which have been certified for virus freedom -- is essential.
