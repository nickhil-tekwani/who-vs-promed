On 8 Feb 2011, the Ministry of Health in Sierra Leone notified the
World Health Organization (WHO) of 2 cases of yellow fever in Jahun
village in Bonthe district, Southern province. The index case was a 40
year old woman, who developed symptoms on 17 Jan 2011 and tested
positive for IgM by ELISA test conducted by Institut Pasteur in
Abidjan on 1 Feb 2011. The WHO reference laboratory for yellow fever
at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar confirmed the case on 8 Feb 2011.

The 2nd case was an 18 year old man identified during an outbreak
investigation between 11-14 Feb [2011]. The case tested positive for
IgM by ELISA test conducted by the Institute Pasteur in Abidjan.

Neither of the cases had a history of yellow fever vaccination.

On 5 Mar 2011, the Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone began a
response vaccination campaign targeting 144 479 people aged 9 months
and above, excluding pregnant women in Bonthe district. Sierra Leone
benefited from a yellow fever preventive mass vaccination campaign in
2009, which covered 11 out of 13 districts in the country, excluding
Bonthe and Bombali districts.

[Although these cases occurred more than a month ago, they are worth
noting as there have been no of yellow fever (YF) cases reported from
Sierra Leone for more than 2 years. At that time, YF was reported from
both Southern and Northern provinces in Sierra Leone in December 2008.
However, the YF cases in the Southern province were in a different
district rather distant from the one in the current report (see
ProMED-mail archive number 20081222.4029). One hopes that the month's
time between the date of laboratory confirmed diagnosis and initiation
of the vaccination campaign will not result in additional cases. On 29
Sep 2003, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation reported a substantial
YF outbreak totaling of 90 cases from 8 districts in central Sierra
Leone (see ProMED-mail archive number 20031002.2474).
