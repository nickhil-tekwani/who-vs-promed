Health officials are advising East Mountains residents to be aware of a potential risk from tularemia after 2 dogs recently were confirmed to have contracted the disease.

Tularemia is a highly infectious bacterial disease similar to plague, according to a news release from the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department and the Bernalillo County Health and Protection Section. The organism commonly occurs in rabbits and rodents, and can kill large numbers of rabbits quickly, authorities said.

Human symptoms include chills, fever, severe headache, and occasionally skin lesions. Disease transmission can occur from the bite of an infected tick or deer fly, or from close contact with an infected [animal].

"The rain and increased vegetation we have seen over the last several months has provided extra food and harborage for rodent and rabbit populations," said Dr Paul Smith, a manager for the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department, in a statement. "A larger number of rodents and rabbits often leads to more occurrences of both tularemia and plague."

There have been no human cases of plague or tularemia so far in Bernalillo County in 2015, [but] 5 dogs and 1 rabbit have been confirmed with tularemia infection.

"Dogs and cats can become infected with plague and tularemia through hunting rodents and rabbits or by exposure to their fleas or ticks." said Dr Mark DiMenna, Deputy Director for the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department. "People are often exposed when their pets bring these infected fleas or ticks into the house or through direct contact with the sick or dead rodent."

Authorities offered the following tips to reduce the risk of plague and tularemia:
- Keep your pets from roaming and hunting
- Talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea and tick control product on your pets
- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles
- Don't allow children or others to handle sick or dead wildlife
- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian
- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it
- Avoid mowing over dead animals
- Bernalillo County citizens living east of Tramway Blvd. should report sick or dead rodents and rabbits to 311. Rodents or rabbits with obvious signs of injury (gunshot wounds, bite wounds, etc.) do not need to be reported.

[The causative bacterium of tularemia, _Francisella tularensis_, is a non-sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 per cent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.

In domestic animals, sheep are the primary hosts, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beavers, muskrats, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.

Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod., which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

The commonest source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who skin, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.

The incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria [abnormally frequent urination] may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.

People may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.

Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.

Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death.

Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular.

Use of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.
