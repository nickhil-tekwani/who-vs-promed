The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently received an official report of a confirmed case of malaria in a U.S. traveler to the island of Great Exuma, Bahamas. The traveler visited the island between February and March 2012 and reported no additional recent travel outside of the U.S.

An outbreak of malaria previously occurred on Great Exuma island, Bahamas in 2006, and the last documented case on the island was in 2008. Malaria is not endemic to the Bahamas, and no malaria cases have been reported from the country since then.

Malaria control measures have been implemented; environmental controls have been put into operation, and on-island surveillance has been enhanced. Officials will report any new cases of malaria if they are discovered.

Travelers should monitor their health during travel and for up to one year after return from the Bahamas for any symptoms of malaria, which are flu-like, such as fever and chills. If symptoms occur, the traveler should seek immediate medical care and inform their health-care provider of their travel to an area currently experiencing a malaria outbreak.

More information about malaria can be found at the CDC Malaria homepage. General health information for travel to the Bahamas can be found at the CDC Travelers' Health website. Health-care providers needing assistance with diagnosis or management of suspected cases of malaria should call the CDC Malaria Hotline: 770-488-7788 or toll-free at 855-856-4713 (M-F, 9 am-5:00 pm, Eastern Time). For consultation after hours, call 770-488-7100 and ask to speak with a CDC Malaria Branch clinician.

[The outbreaks in Great Exuma in 2006-2008 were most probably due to local transmission from refugees from Haiti, being asymptomatic carriers of malaria parasites. - Mod.EP
