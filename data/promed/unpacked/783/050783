The Ministry of Emergencies of Kazakhstan has reported that the head
of the West Kazakhstan oblast has announced a quarantine because of a
case of anthrax in Zhimpity village in the Syrymsky district. The
report states that only one sick cow has been registered; the body has
been burned and buried.

A total of 8 groups of specialists consisting of veterinarians and 2
assisting staff implement vaccination in the surroundings. 2
observation posts equipped with disinfection barriers have been
established for surveillance. An
investigation has started in the farmstead where the sick cow [died]
and the place was disinfected.

[Comments of Mod.NR. The last outbreak of anthrax in this country was
registered in the South Kazakhstan region in October 2006. 9 people were
identified with anthrax. The sources of these sporadic cases are
hundreds of animal burial grounds spread over country. - Mod.NR

While most outbreaks of anthrax in Kazakhstan are in the oblasts along
its southern border there are occasional outbreaks in the western
oblasts. While persistent contaminated "foci" are high in one's
suspicions for this country, the actual causes remain unclear. It is
more likely to be deficient control procedures, including a poor
vaccination policy. Interestingly. we have had
reports of anthrax from this district before; see ProMED-mail
20060721.1998. There have been other reports posted on outbreaks in
this oblast.

The facts of infection of livestock with anthrax in Kazakhstan do not present
threats to Azerbaijan due to absence of meat import from this country,
a source stated in the State Veterinary Service of Azerbaijan's
Agriculture inistry. "We do not have such co-operation with Kazakhstan
and therefore, it presents no threats," the same source stated.

The State Service reported that as a rule, the [bacteria causing] this
disease live in a soil environment and there are several centers of
this disease in
Azerbaijan, particularly in the districts of Barda, Shamkir, near
Mingachevir. Annually vaccination is held in all regions to prevent
the spread of this disease amongst livestock.

"Currently the epizootic situation in Azerbaijan is being assessed as
neutral," the same source reported.

Kazakhstan's Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that the facts
of infection of livestock with anthrax were registered in
Western-Kazakh region. The Ministry stated that quarantine has been
announced in Jimpiti Sirimski
village of Western-Kazakh region due to the spread of anthrax.

[West Kazakhstan oblast (province) does not border on the Caspian Sea,
which reduces the likelihood of shipments reaching Baku. Logically
Volgograd,
Saratov, and Samara in adjoining south-central Russia are more at risk
as they are significantly nearer this Kazakh oblast. - Mod.MHJ]
