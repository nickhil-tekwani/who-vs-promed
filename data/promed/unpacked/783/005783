The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and St. Thomas Fish Market are warning the public not to consume the Bar Clams described below because they may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_. Toxins produced by these bacteria may cause botulism, a life-threatening illness.

There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of this product.

The manufacturer, St. Thomas Fish Market Inc., Saint-Thomas-De-Kent, New Brunswick, is voluntarily recalling the affected product from the marketplace. The CFIA is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.

Affected products are Bar Clams sold in jars declaring a drained weight of 210 g (7.41 oz.). The affected jars also contain one of the following lot codes which is located on the cover of the jar: 03731, 03732, 03831, 03832, 03833, 03931, 03932, 05631, 05633, 05634; UPC code: 0 81971 90013 1.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
