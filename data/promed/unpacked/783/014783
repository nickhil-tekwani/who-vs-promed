India gets ready for banana war
-------------------------------
A fungus that threatens popular Cavendish bananas
was traced in the country. Just as India was
gearing up to broaden its export base,
researchers have sounded alert: the fungus
_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_ is affecting
Cavendish bananas in the country.

Banana growers in the Cumbum region of Tamil Nadu
had been complaining of sporadic occurrences of
the wilt disease for 4 years, said R Thangavelu,
National Research Centre for Banana [NRCB].
Researchers recently surveyed the plantations and
found _F. oxysporum_ is infecting the Cavendish.
M M Mustaffa, director of NRCB, said since the
infection was spotted in a small area it is
unlikely to affect India's Cavendish yield immediately.

C Mohan, Punjab Agricultural University, said it
is difficult to contain the disease once it
breaks out. R K Jain, Indian Agricultural
Research Institute, said the fungus, resistant to
fungicides, can spread through irrigation water.
Any infection capable of killing one banana plant
can wipe out the entire variety because banana lacks genetic diversity.

Thangavelu tested the virulence of the fungus
from Cumbum on a Cavendish variety, Grand Naine,
and indigenous varieties. Red Banana and Nendran
[varieties] did not get infected, he said.
Farmers should be encouraged to cultivate
Cavendish bananas and rice alternately, plant
fungus-resistant varieties and should buy
uninfected corm from reliable sources or adopt tissue culture.

on the occurrence of a virulent strain of
fusarium wilt pathogen (Race-1) infecting
Cavendish (AAA) group of bananas in India. Pl Dis

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banana wilt disease caused by _Fusarium
oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_ is one of the most
significant threats to banana production
worldwide. Strains have been grouped into race-1,
-2, or -4 on the basis of differential virulence
among different genotypes of banana. In India,
though the disease is reported among susceptible
varieties with races 1 and 2, it is not reported
from Cavendish cultivars which are the differential host to race-4.

Recent surveys of the Cumbum areas (Theni
District, Tamil Nadu) revealed symptoms (e.g.,
yellowing and drooping of leaves around the
pseudostem and longitudinal splitting of
pseudostem) on cv. Grand Naine (Cavendish group Â­
AAA). _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_ was
recovered and single-spore isolates had
characteristic morphology. Pathogenicity was
demonstrated on cv. Grand Naine by inoculation.
Vegetative compatibility and characterization on
the basis of volatile odor production [compared
to] controls for race-1 ('inodoratum') and race 4
('odoratum') showed that this new strain from
Cavendish belonged to the 'inodoratum' group.

Pathogenicity was demonstrated on cvs. Rasthali
(Silk-AAB), Karpuravalli (Pisang Awak-ABB), Ney
Poovan (AB), Poovan (Mysore-AAB), Red Banana
(AAA), Nendran (French plantain-AAB), Monthan
(ABB), and Grand Naine (Cavendish-AAA) by
inoculation. The result showed that all
cultivars, except Red Banana and Nendran, had the
highest rating for disease severity.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a
virulent strain of _F. oxysporum_ f. sp.
_cubense_ of race-1 on Cavendish banana.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal
or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne
fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_.
Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and
streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die
rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected
planting material, mechanical means, soil and
water. It can survive in the soil for decades,
and consequently a crop rotation with rice, as
suggested in item 1 above, is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Several races of the pathogen exist. Races 1 and
2 attack several different cultivars of eating
and cooking bananas (plantains), but until now
not Cavendish varieties (see below); race 3
attacks ornamental _Heliconia_ species only;
temperate race 4 and the recently emerged
tropical race 4 (TR4) attack cultivars in the
Cavendish subgroup as well as hosts of races 1
and 2. Until now, TR4 was considered the most
serious pathogen strain, however, the new strain
of race 1 reported here will add considerably to
the threat posed by PD to banana industries.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly
relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion
(as mentioned in item 1). Constant vigilance is
required in areas where the fungus is present to
prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new
strains. No effective chemical or cultural
control measures are available, and integrated
approaches have been developed (see ProMED-mail
post 20090419.1483) which may include cultural
practices, certified clean planting material and
biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and
molecular techniques are being used to develop
crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains.

The majority of today's cultivated bananas are
related to either _Musa acuminata_ (A) and/or _M.
balbisiana_ (B). These varieties are mostly
triploid and sterile; some diploid and partly
fertile cultivars exist as well. The specific
genetic background of a banana variety is
indicated by the letters A or B. Cavendish is a
group of banana cultivars with a triploid genome
derived from _M. acuminata_ reflected by AAA.
