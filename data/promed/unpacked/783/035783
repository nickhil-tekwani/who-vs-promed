Measles outbreak hits Geneva
----------------------------
A fresh outbreak of measles has struck the canton of Geneva and the
surrounding French border region. The last previous bout of the
disease struck in 2008.

This time round, 60 percent of the cases involve adults. A total of
26 people have been infected in Geneva since the beginning of the
year. Around 2000 cases have been reported in the adjoining
Rhone-Alpes area of France.

The disease has affected almost exclusively people who have never
been vaccinated for measles or who were inadequately vaccinated.

[In Switzerland routine measles immunization has been recommended
since 1976, and the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) triple vaccine
by campaign since 1987. An MMR booster has been administered at age 4
to 7 since 1996. Levels of immunisation have risen from the low 70's
initially to the high 80's in recent years. Geneva and its
surroundings are vulnerable to the introduction of highly contagious
diseases such as measles in view of the continual flux of
international visitors, and the presence of some social groups that
discourage vaccination (for example, see: "Measles - Switzerland
(02): (VD) 20090208.0565").
