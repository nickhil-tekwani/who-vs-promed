A mystery disease has broken out in Bihar, claiming the lives of 20 children in one week. All the deaths were reported from Muzaffarpur and the neighbouring districts of the state.

The disease, which some claim to be encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, or acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), has claimed over 1000 lives of children in the past 15 years in Bihar, but no one has been able to find out its real reason despite several studies. The disease strikes generally the northern parts of the state every year once the mercury soars but ends the moment rains starts. The symptoms of the disease include high fever, irritation, and swelling of brains.

"The disease has not been diagnosed yet," Bihar's health secretary Deepak Kumar told the media on Friday [6 Jun 2014], adding the government of India had roped in a medical team from United States to investigate the cause of infection. "Dr Jacob John is leading the combined India-US team to diagnose the ailments. Samples of the infected children are being collected for examination in viral laboratories located in both the countries," the heath secretary said.

What has worried experts more is that infection has spread in a virulent form this time as the survival rate of the victims looks low. Alarmed at the situation, then health authorities held an emergency meeting [in Patna, Bihar] on Thursday evening [5 Jun 2014] at which it was decided to send a high-level team of health experts to Muzaffarpur where the victims have been admitted at various hospitals for treatment.

Strangely, the health experts are still to identify the disease despite spate of studies, causing strong resentment and frustration among the victims' families. The scene is quite touching at the hospitals in Muzaffarpur districts where continual wailing by victim family members moves every visitor to pity.

Every year, the government claims to have taken preventive measures to check recurrence of the disease but this ultimately turns out to be an empty promise. "The disease struck this time despite preventive measures launched by us. We had already alerted the doctors and supplied sufficient medicines to the health centres, yet the disease goes unchecked," Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Gyan Bhushan said.

The seriousness of the entire situation is underlined from the fact the mystery disease has claimed more than 1000 lives in the past [15 years]. However in the last 4 years, it has turned out to be quite deadlier.

[A 7 May 2014 report of a recent study from Odisha and Jharkhand states (ProMED-mail archive no 20140508.2459977) indicated that cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were caused by infections with viruses of dengue and measles. However, this study indicated that although herpes simplex virus (HSV) was a dominant agent for acute encephalitis, in some cases the viral agents were those of dengue and measles. Over 16 per cent of cases were found to be caused by viral agents identified to be either HSV I or II while another 2.6 per cent of cases were due to measles virus infections. Similarly, Japanese encephalitis virus caused 1.5 per cent of cases, followed by 0.57 per cent by dengue virus. This still leaves nearly 80 per cent of the cases without a diagnosis.

Past reports have implicated Japanese encephalitis virus as responsible for some or all cases but also related cases to polluted water implying enteroviruses, or making a case for heat stroke. The results above indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) should be included in the battery of laboratory tests done to diagnose AES illnesses.

It is of considerable interest to learn that a joint India-USA medical team will be investigating these cases of encephalitis. The team will be headed by Dr Jacob John, a distinguished Indian medical virologist. One hopes that after decades of speculation and incomplete data, the team will finally come up with an identification of the etiological agent(s) involved in these ongoing, unfortunate cases.

The 9 June 2014 edition of the Delhi Daily News (http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Protests-in-Bihar-as-encephalitis-death-toll-reaches-25-1402308211/) stated that the death toll is now up to 25 children.
