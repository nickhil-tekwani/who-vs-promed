HOW TO GET THOSE MISSING DIGESTS: CORRECTION
********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

Bright red face here. The other moderators will tell you how hard I come
down on them when they let a typo through when posting. Now it seems I
canÂ´t even get a simple Majordomo command right! I omitted the "n" before
the last three digits in the "get" command. The corrected list is below.
I apologise to all of you who tried the wrong command & wasted your
valuable time.

If we were to re-send these to the whole list, this would put a terrible
strain on our already overloaded server (one of the reasons we need money
-- so, many thanks to all who have pledged so far!)
Therefore we are asking you to send for the missing issues yourselves, by
sending the following message to
majordomo@usa.healthnet.org (that's right, to the HealthNet server; the
Harvard server does not have our archives)
get promed v99.n034
get promed v99.n035
get promed v99.n036
get promed v99.n037
get promed v99.n038
get promed v99.n039
get promed v99.n040
get promed v99.n041
end
Those of you who have missed fewer or more digests should edit the message
accordingly.
This way, your requests will arrive at HealthNet in staggered fashion, and
the load should not be too great.
Sorry about the problem.
Best wishes,
Jack
