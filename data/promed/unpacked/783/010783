Cape Town health authorities are in control of an outbreak of [bacillary]
dysentery that has affected 82 people and caused the deaths of three
children under two.
Most of the cases have been in Nyanga, were 41 people have been diagnosed,
while five cases have been reported in Khayelitsha.
Hassan Mahomed, a City of Cape Town epidemiologist, described the disease
as "seasonal", particularly in warm weather. Most of the cases were
reported in February and March, when the weather was hot.
Dysentery cases had been monitored across the metropole for the past four
years, and Dr. Mahomed said the figures were worse this year. Dysentery was
caused by a bacterium spread from person to person, and, in some cases, by
flies.
Dr Mahomed said an intensive awareness campaign was being conducted in
informal settlement areas, which were those worst affected because of poor
sanitation.
"The bacterium is carried in the human intestinal tract and manifests
itself as diarrhoea. It is most dangerous where there is no proper
sanitation and human waste is not properly disposed of."
Keeping hands clean and ensuring that nobody with diarrhoea prepared food
or looked after children were among the simple ways to prevent the disease.
"The awareness campaign, along with the cooler weather, has helped control
the number of cases," said Dr Mahomed.
The cleansing department had been asked to address the problem of poor
sanitation in informal areas, and there were plans to replace the old
bucket system still in operation.
"Of course, in the long-term, we are aiming at providing water-borne sewage
systems," said Dr Mahomed.

[Khayelitsha is one of the largest townships in the Cape Town Metropolitan
Council area, with population estimates of over one million. Parts of
Khayelitsha and Nyanga are considered squatter areas without basic services
such as water and electricity. Other parts are with services. In this
article, "informal settlements" refers to areas that are without basic
services. - MPP]
