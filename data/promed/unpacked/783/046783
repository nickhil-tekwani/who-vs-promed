The first ever case of hantavirus in southern Alberta has been confirmed.
The victim, who was infected earlier this summer when he was cleaning a
barn, has now fully recovered.
Alberta Health is refusing to say exactly where in southern Alberta the
infection occurred, but health officials say this serves as a warning that
the sometimes fatal disease has spread from central and northern areas of
the province.
Nineteen cases of hantavirus have been reported to date in Alberta -- all
of them in central and northern areas.

[I do not believe at all that this serves as a warning that the virus,
ostensibly Sin Nombre virus, has spread from central and northern to
southern areas of Alberta. More likely, the virus occurs in deer mice
throughout Alberta and has only now been discovered in southern Alberta.
This is not usually a commonly occurring virus in North America but it is
distributed widely. It is the odd and unfortunate case that attracts
attention. In my mind the only question about the occurrence of Sin Nombre
virus in any given area of North America is the infection rate in deer
mice. One might find 1 in 10 or 1 in 1,000 mice infected but the virus is
essentially everywhere. - Mod.CHC
