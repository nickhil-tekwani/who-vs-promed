During 2004-2005, 3 outbreaks of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections
occurred among agricultural fair, festival, and petting zoo visitors
in North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona. 108 cases, including 15
cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), were reported in the North
Carolina outbreak; 63 cases, including 7 HUS cases, were reported in
the Florida outbreak; and 2 cases were reported in Arizona. No
fatalities occurred. Illnesses primarily affected children who
visited petting zoos at these events. This report summarizes findings
from these outbreak investigations, which indicated the need for
adequate control measures to reduce zoonotic transmission of _E.
coli_ O157:H7.
North Carolina
---------------
On 29 Oct 2004, the NC Division of Public Health (NCDPH) received a
report of a cluster of 3 HUS cases among children who visited a
petting zoo at the North Carolina State Fair [For figure, refer to
original URL - Mod.LL]. Approximately 800 000 visitors attended this
fair during 15-24 Oct 2004. The fair had 2 petting zoos (petting zoos
A and B).
NCDPH notified all local health departments to report cases of
diarrheal illnesses. Intensified surveillance identified 108 persons
who became ill, with onset after fair attendance and without other
known cause. 82 (78 percent) reported visiting a petting zoo at the
state fair. Median age was 5 years (range: 1-61 years); 64 (59
percent) were female. Illness onsets were consistent with exposure
during the fair dates. 52 (48 percent) persons reported bloody
diarrhea, and 48 (44 percent) reported fever. 41 cases were
laboratory-confirmed Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC)
infections, of which 38 yielded _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolates
indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). 20
patients (19 percent) were hospitalized, and 15 (14 percent) had HUS
diagnosed.
Systematic environmental sampling of the fairgrounds identified
extensive _E. coli_ O157:H7 contamination at 1 of 2 petting zoos
(petting zoo B). Analysis of isolates from 30 systematically obtained
environmental samples revealed a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from
the predominant clinical isolate pattern. No other PFGE patterns from
isolates at this site were noted after systematic sampling.
NCDPH, in collaboration with CDC, conducted a case-control study to
identify risk factors for infection. 45 case-patients and 188
controls were enrolled; these were frequency-matched to cases in 3
age groups (0-5 years, 6-17 years, and greater than 18 years).
Confirmed cases in the study were those in persons who 1) had
laboratory-confirmed _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection or clinically
diagnosed HUS with onset after 15 Oct 2004, 2) reported fair
attendance, and 3) had illnesses that were not acquired from
secondary transmission. Probable cases were those in persons who
reported bloody diarrhea (3 or more loose stools per 24-hour period)
beginning after fair attendance without other known cause and were
determined not to have acquired infections from secondary
transmission. Controls attended the fair and reported no diarrheal
illness through 7 Nov 2004. Potential controls were identified from a
randomized list of 23 972 persons who purchased tickets to the fair
online, at kiosks, o!
r in malls. The study questionnaire included items about human/animal
interactions, food and beverage consumption, and hygiene practices.
Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs)
were computed for various exposure variables.
No specific food, beverage, or recreational water exposure was
associated with illness. 36 (80 percent) of 45 case-patients visited
petting zoo B, which was noted to have extensive environmental
contamination, compared with 64 (34 percent) of 187 controls (AOR =
8.2; CI = 3.6-18.9). This petting zoo contained approximately 100
goats and sheep in an area where visitors could have extensive
contact with animals and their bedding. Case-patients reported
spending a median of 20 minutes in petting zoo B, compared with 15
minutes for controls (p = 0.04). Visits to petting zoo A were not
associated with illness.
Among children aged less than 6 years who visited petting zoo B,
illness was associated with touching or stepping in manure (OR = 6.9;
CI = 2.2-21.9). Behaviors such as falling or sitting on the ground
(OR = 3.2; CI = 1.1-9.1) and use of a pacifier or "sippy" cup or
sucking on one's thumb while in petting zoo B (OR = 11.0; CI =
2.0-55) also were associated with illness. Reported alcohol-based
hand sanitizer use was not protective (OR = 1.9; CI = 0.3-10.2).
Reported awareness (among adults who accompanied children) of risk
for disease from contact with livestock was protective (OR = 0.1; CI
= 0.03-0.5).
Florida
-------
In Mar 2005, Florida health officials identified a cluster of 22 _E.
coli_ O157:H7 infections, including 7 HUS cases, related to
attendance at Florida Fairs and Festivals during 10-21 Feb 2005, and
3-13 Mar 2005. Early patient interviews identified no common food or
water exposure but did implicate a common animal exposure (i.e.,
petting zoo attendance). 3 implicated fairs had one common animal
vendor, an exhibitor of a farm animal petting zoo. The petting zoo
owner was contacted on 24 Mar 2005, and the animals (sheep, goats,
and cattle) were placed under voluntary quarantine.
Stool samples from suspected cases were sent to the Florida
Department of Health (FDOH) Bureau of Laboratories for culture and
PFGE typing of _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolates. Stool samples also were
collected from 36 animals exhibited at 2 of 3 implicated petting
zoos. Environmental samples were taken from exhibit grounds of
implicated petting zoos from the 3 fairs. 24 human stool samples, 6
animal stool samples, and 20 environmental samples yielded _E. coli_
O157:H7 isolates with an identical PFGE pattern. The implicated farm
animals were put under state quarantine by the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services on 8 Apr 2005.
FDOH intensified surveillance by requesting rapid reporting of
suspected _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections and HUS cases. 63 patients
were identified who had symptoms of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection
within 10 days or HUS within 21 days after visiting the implicated
fairs and who had no alternate diagnosis to explain their symptoms;
of these, 20 (32 percent) persons had culture-confirmed _E. coli_
O157:H7 infection. 4 persons had culture-confirmed infection;
however, these cases did not meet the case definition.
Median patient age was 4 years (range: 1-63 years); 35 (56 percent)
patients were female. Clinical features included diarrhea in 63 (100
percent) patients, vomiting in 28 (44 percent), abdominal cramps in
27 (43 percent), and fever in 23 (37 percent). 17 patients (27
percent) were hospitalized, and 7 (11 percent) had diagnoses of HUS
(3 of the 7 patients with HUS did not have _E. coli_ O157:H7-positive
stool cultures).
34 ill persons (54 percent) were reported to have touched at least
one cow, sheep, or goat. 20 (32 percent) reportedly fed at least one
cow, sheep, or goat. Preliminary analysis of a case-control study
that included 34 case-patients and 176 controls (identified from
credit card receipts from the fairs and defined as persons who went
to the petting zoo and remained well) found a positive association
between illness and both direct animal contact (e.g., 71 percent of
case-patients and 47 percent of controls touched a cow [OR = 4.2; CI
= 1.7-10.5]) and indirect (e.g., 33 percent of case-patients and 12
percent of controls touched sawdust or shavings [OR = 3.3; CI =
1.4-7.8]) animal contact.
Arizona
--------
In Jul 2005, 2 children hospitalized with _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection
were reported to the Arizona Department of Health Services. Isolates
from the 2 children had indistinguishable PFGE patterns. Both
children had visited a zoo in Arizona that contained a petting zoo.
No common food or beverage was consumed by the 2 children at the zoo,
and the children were not related. One child had direct contact with
petting zoo animals; the 2nd child only had possible contact with
exterior railings at the petting zoo. Both children had played in an
area immediately adjacent to and downhill from the petting zoo
facility. 15 of 25 (60 percent) fecal specimens from petting zoo
animals yielded _E. coli_ O157:H7; 12 isolates had PFGE patterns
indistinguishable from the clinical isolates. Upon notification of
the results, zoo officials immediately closed the petting zoo and
adjacent play area.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------
_E. coli_ O157:H7 causes approximately 73 000 illnesses in the USA
annually, leading to an estimated 2168 hospitalizations and 61 deaths
(1). HUS is a principal cause of acute renal failure among children
in the USA and occurs in 3-7 percent of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections
(2). Among patients with HUS, approximately 3-5 percent die as a
result (2). Most cases of diarrhea-associated HUS are caused by STEC,
of which _E. coli_ O157:H7 has the strongest association with HUS
worldwide (3). At least 80 percent of childhood HUS is attributable
to infection with STEC, primarily _E. coli_ O157:H7 (4).
The primary animal reservoir for _E. coli_ O157:H7 is ruminant
livestock, which are asymptomatically colonized. The primary route of
transmission for _E. coli_ O157:H7 is foodborne; however, among 350
_E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks reported in the USA during 1982-2002, the
transmission route for 11 (3 percent), accounting for 319 cases, was
animal contact (5). The 3 E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks described in this
report, accounting for 173 cases and associated with direct and
indirect animal contact at petting zoos, emphasize the need for
adequate control measures to reduce zoonotic transmission.
In the North Carolina outbreak, extensive direct animal contact
occurred in an area contaminated with manure. In the Florida
outbreak, illness was associated with touching and feeding animals
and indirect animal contact (e.g., touching sawdust or shavings or
visibly soiled clothes or shoes). In the Arizona outbreak, at least
one case likely resulted from exposure in the play area adjacent to
the petting zoo, where contamination via drainage from the petting
zoo was suspected. In certain instances, exposure to _E. coli_
O157:H7 might have occurred before petting zoo patrons could practice
hand hygiene. Also, exposure from contaminated clothes, shoes,
strollers, or other fomites might have occurred before or after
hand-hygiene practice.
Experience from these and previous outbreaks (6,7) underscores the
necessity of using sensitive laboratory isolation methods, such as
those used in these outbreaks, for detecting _E. coli_ O157:H7 from
livestock feces and agricultural environmental samples. Had direct
plating methods used for human stool been the only method used to
recover _E. coli_ O157:H7 from environmental samples, many positive
specimens would have been undetected. Because of the multiple,
competing microorganisms in livestock fecal material and soil,
selective culture conditions, including selective broth enrichment,
immunomagnetic separation, and plating on selective media, should be
used (6).
In 2001, CDC issued guidelines to reduce the risk for transmission of
enteric pathogens at venues where the public has contact with animals
(8,
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5015a5.htm>). In Mar
2005, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians
(NASPHV) published recommendations on hand washing, venue design,
animal care and management, and risk communication regarding disease
transmission for staff and visitors (9,
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5404a1.htm>).
Petting zoos are minimally regulated. Guidelines based on the NASPHV
compendium were adopted by the North Carolina Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDACS) after the outbreak. In
addition, a law was enacted in North Carolina in Jul 2005 that
requires sanctioned agricultural fairs to obtain a permit from NCDACS
for all animal exhibitions open to the public.* The Arizona
Department of Health Services adapted the NASPHV compendium
recommendations into educational packets distributed to petting zoo
operators statewide.
These recent petting zoo-associated _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks
highlight the need to strengthen control measures for such exhibits
to reduce disease transmission and prevent similar outbreaks. To
reduce human exposure to manure, revised control measures should be
considered, particularly those restricting young children from
directly entering open-interaction areas of petting zoos.
