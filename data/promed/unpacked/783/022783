FMD-affected calves to be slaughtered in Arava
-----------------------------------------------
Cases of FMD have been discovered in calves kept in the "Eilot"
quarantine station in southern Israel (Arava). The disease was
discovered in calves imported from Australia for fattening in Israel.
The number of affected cattle has not been disclosed.
The affected calves will be slaughtered. 10 000 imported calves,
maintained in 2 quarantine stations in the Arava region, have been vaccinated.

[From this report it is not clear how long after their arrival at
the Eilat harbour and transportation to the quarantine station, north
of Eilat, the suspect clinical signs have been discovered.
Calves (of about 200 kg weight) for fattening are imported from
Australia unvaccinated; they undergo vaccination with a trivalent FMD
vaccine during their quarantine period, before being released and
moved to the fattening farms in central and northern Israel.
Laboratory confirmation of the suspected outbreak, details of the FMD
virus serotype involved and information pertaining to the possible
origin of the infection are anticipated. Eilat, and the Eilot
quarantine station, are rather close to the Egyptian border. The Nile
Delta governorates of Egypt are, reportedly, suffering a massive
outbreak of FMD at present; however, no outbreaks of the disease have
been reported, so far, from sparsely-populated Sinai, which is a
broad buffer zone separating the Nile Delta and Israel. See map at
http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?
=showmap&country=183_9005_5&language=1>.
An outbreak of FMD, serotype O, was reported from Northern Israel in
Dec 2005 and did not spread. - Mod. AS].
