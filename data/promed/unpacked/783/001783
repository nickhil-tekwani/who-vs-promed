Ebola in Uganda
---------------
As of Sat 17 Nov 2012, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Uganda has notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever [Ebola virus disease] in Luwero district in Central Uganda. 4 cases, including 3 fatal, have been reported. Samples were taken from 2 cases, for which laboratory confirmation of Sudan ebolavirus was made by PCR and serology tests at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe. The Ministry of Health, WHO, and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF; Doctors without Borders) have sent a team to conduct preliminary investigation into the outbreak. Health authorities are conducting active case search and tracing close contacts of the confirmed and probable cases.

The isolation facility at Mulago hospital in Kampala is reactivated and another isolation facility at Nyimbwa Health Center IV at the epicenter is being established. The military hospital in Bombo, Luwero district is also serving a holding center until the isolation facility is properly set up at the Nyimbwa Health Center IV. 7 close contacts of the cases have developed symptoms and are being isolated in the isolation facilities.

WHO and partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Uganda Red Cross (URCS), African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) are supporting the authorities in the response activities. Experts in the area of field epidemiology, health promotion, logistics management, and infection prevention and control are being identified to provide additional support through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN).

With respect to this event, WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restriction be applied to Uganda.
