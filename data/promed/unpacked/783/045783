A person from Oruro died due to yellow fever in the Cochabamba [department] tropics. This occurrence put the health authorities on alert and they requested the populace to get vaccinated 10 days before traveling to the tropical area.

Jorge Claros, Director of the Departmental Health Services (SEDES) reported that the fatality "is a person from the interior, from the Oruro area, who had visited the tropics and contracted the yellow fever [virus] infection there."

Given the presence of the disease, it is recommended that before entering the topical area people must be vaccinated against yellow fever. "The vaccine is free and there are health centers [that have it]," [he said].

[Yellow fever virus is endemic in the Amazon Basin of the South American tropics. This is undoubtedly a case of sylvan (jungle) yellow fever, where the virus infects wild primates and is transmitted to people by forest mosquitoes. It is critical that individuals in these areas be vaccinated against yellow fever virus infections, to not only protect themselves, but to prevent introduction of the virus into the urban cycle where significant numbers of cases, with a high (30 per cent) case fatality may occur, as happened in Paraguay in 2008. It is good that the local health authorities have responded to the occurrence of this case.
