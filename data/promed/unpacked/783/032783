An outbreak of legionnaires' disease has been reported in a Bronx neighborhood, city [New York City] health officials said Friday [20 May 2022].

According to the city Department of Health [https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2022/legionnaires-cluster-highbridge.page], 4 people in the borough's Highbridge neighborhood have been diagnosed with the disease, which is a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria that forms in warm water. Other individuals are awaiting test results.

Legionnaires' is not contagious and is treatable with antibiotics if caught early, officials said.

The health department said it is investigating and "sampling and testing water from all cooling tower systems in the area of the cluster."

The _Legionella_ bacteria typically grow in "cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks, and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems," the department said.

Those experiencing flu-like symptoms such as coughing, fever, and difficulty breathing are encouraged to get tested by their doctor. Those over the age of 50 [years], cigarette smokers, with chronic lung disease, and those with compromised immune systems are considered at higher risk of legionnaires'.

"Any New Yorkers with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible," Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said in a statement. "Legionnaires' disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early, but New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older, those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin."

The New York City Health Department has just released information on a Legionnaires' disease cluster in the Bronx.

A total of 4 cases have been confirmed since [9 May 2022] in the Highbridge neighborhoods in zip codes 10452 and 10456.

Doctors are waiting for the test results of several other people. So far, no deaths have been reported.

[The news reports say that the 4 cases have occurred in the Highbridge neighborhood. Highbridge (pop., 37 727 residents in 2010) is a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of the Bronx, located between the Cross-Bronx Expressway (I-95) to the north, Jerome Avenue to the east, Macombs Dam Bridge to the south, and the Harlem River to the west (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highbridge,_Bronx). A map showing the location of Highbridge can be seen at https://goo.gl/maps/GqQZ2VZRSWsWbvQx8. Yankee Stadium is on its southeast boundary.

The 2nd news report says the cases reside in the zip codes 10452 and 10456. Highbridge is part of zip Code is 10452, which is directly west of zip code 10456. A map showing the location of these zip codes can be found at https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/10456/.

Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually through inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease has also been described by Correia et al (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing systems by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, car-wash facilities, as well as a building's cooling towers (structures that contain water and a fan as part of centralized air cooling systems), and even wastewater treatment plants. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Genotyping the isolates from patients with legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates with that of clinical isolates to assure frequently costly corrective measures are carried out on the actual source (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). We will await further findings from the investigation. - Mod.ML
