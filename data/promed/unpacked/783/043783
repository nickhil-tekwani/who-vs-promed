CDC testing other possible cases of anthrax
-------------------------------------------
'We are not experiencing a national outbreak'
(CNN) -- In addition to the 6 cases of anthrax it has confirmed, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday it has identified
"less than 5" other possible cases of anthrax. The cases involve
individuals who have reported "skin lesions or exposure circumstances that
are under active investigation," said Dr. Julie Gerberding, head of
infection control for CDC. They are "in large part" linked to the 2 cases
in Florida or the 3 in New York City, she said. A 6th case --
involving a postal worker in New Jersey -- was confirmed later Thursday.
"We are not experiencing a national outbreak," Gerberding said, noting that
the number of confirmed cases has been "limited to a few exposures. Most
people have nothing to be concerned about." [AMEN! - MHJ
The latest confirmed anthrax infection involves a Hamilton Township postal
worker who tested positive for skin, or cutaneous, anthrax, acting New
Jersey Gov. Donald DiFrancesco said Thursday. A second employee is a
possible case, DiFrancesco said. The other confirmed infection announced
Thursday is a woman who works in CBS News anchor Dan Rather's office. She
tested positive for cutaneous anthrax and is receiving antibiotics.
Latest developments
. A senior law enforcement official told CNN Thursday that scientists and
investigators believe the anthrax found in 3 areas -- New York,
Washington and Florida -- came from the same source. In all 3 cases, the
anthrax particles were finely ground, making them easier to travel in the
air and be inhaled. Investigators have determined the anthrax in each case
occurred naturally and was not biologically engineered, according to
sources. Tests continue, but the similarities could help authorities narrow
their focus and identify the culprit or culprits responsible for the tainted
letters.
. Federal law enforcement investigators are conducting fingerprint and DNA
analysis on envelopes sent to NBC and to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle.
Handwriting analysis is proving more difficult, sources said, because the
writer used block letters, the most difficult type of writing to analyze.
Investigators are also checking the still-quarantined American Media Inc. in
Florida to determine if any mail there may be similar to the New York and
Washington letters. Investigators also are examining security videotape from
various New Jersey mail facilities.
. Attorney General John Ashcroft said 4 suspects face serious consequences
if convicted on charges of making terrorist threats as a hoax or lying to
authorities about a threat. The most serious sentence could mean life in
prison. He also said investigations of threats and hoaxes are under way in
the Midwest and Southeast.
. The FBI announced Thursday it is joining with the U.S. Postal Service to
offer the $1 million reward for the arrest and conviction of those
responsible for sending anthrax bacteria through the mail.

CBS News employee, New Jersey postal worker infected with anthrax; more
tests pending
-------------------------------
WASHINGTON - Two new cases of the skin form of anthrax were reported
Thursday, one involving an assistant to CBS anchorman Dan Rather and the
other a New Jersey postal worker, bringing to 6 the total number of
confirmed infections. In addition, up to 3 more suspected cases were
being investigated, according to Dr. Julie Gerberding of the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The additional cases "are in
large part linked to Florida and New York situations," she said. "We do have
other individuals who are reporting skin lesions or exposure circumstances
that are under active investigation," Gerberding said in a telephone
conference with reporters. "We are working around the clock to confirm or
rule out" anthrax infection.
The new cases were reported as the FBI and the Postal Service offered a $1
million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
perpetrators of anthrax attacks, the House of Representatives remained dark
and 6 congressional office buildings were closed for further germ tests.
The Senate remained in business.
Seeking to calm an anxious nation, Homeland Defense Director Tom Ridge said
that despite the new case, "thousands and thousands and thousands" of people
had been tested for anthrax exposure - and had come up negative. "We are
more vigilant today and continue to get more vigilant every day as we assess
different risks that might present themselves in this country," Ridge said
in his first news conference since taking the job last week. "I think our
antennae are up for all conceivable risks and you ought to be reassured of
that," he added.
Kenneth Moritsugu, deputy surgeon general, said that a sweep throughout the
sprawling Capitol complex will continue over the next several days to check
for anthrax spores. "At this time there is no evidence of contamination in
the ventilation system," Moritsugu added. Moritsugu added that analysis of
600 of the 1400 nasal swab tests performed Tuesday had revealed no
additional positive results in preliminary tests. "We continue to see good
news," he told reporters at a briefing.
Both the CBS employee and the New Jersey postal worker contracted the skin
form of anthrax, officials said. The postal worker may have handled letters
to NBC and to Daschle, acting New Jersey Gov. Donald DiFrancesco said in
Trenton. Test results for a second postal employee who may have been exposed
to the disease were pending, DiFrancesco said. The CBS employee, an
assistant to Rather, was expected to fully recover, CBS officials said. They
said that the infection was on her cheek. "She has no memory whatsoever ...
of any mail, anything in the mail that raised any suspicions whatsoever,"
Rather said. ABC spokesman Todd Polkes said that because the NBC and CBS
news anchormen had apparently been targeted, extra precautions are being
taken with mail addressed to ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings.

New Anthrax Cases
-----------------
"At CBS, an employee has tested positive for cutaneous anthrax," Tom Ridge,
director of the new White House Office of Homeland Security, said,
referring to the easily treatable "skin" form of the disease. "[She has
been placed on antibiotics and is expected . to make a full recovery." The
employee, an assistant to CBS News anchor Dan Rather, is the third person
believed to have contracted cutaneous anthrax at a television network in New
York. The other 2 - a 7-month-old infant who visited ABCNEWS headquarters
and an assistant to NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw - are also responding well to
antibiotic treatment. Unlike the NBC case, where the infected staffer is
known to have opened and handled an anthrax-laced letter, the sources of
infection in the ABC and CBS incidents are unknown.
State officials in New Jersey, meanwhile, said that 2 postal workers in
Trenton who may have handled the NBC letter as well as a second
anthrax-laced letter mailed to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle have also
tested positive for cutaneous anthrax. That brought the total number of
confirmed anthrax infections nationwide to 7, including 2 employees at
the tabloid publishing company American Media Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., who
inhaled anthrax spores. One died earlier this month and a second is
recovering.
. Government 'More Coordinated Than Ever'
Amid widespread criticism that the Bush administration has been sending out
mixed signals, Ridge - the man charged with heading up the government's
effort to prepare for and respond to terrorist threats - gathered with 7
other key officials to reassure the public about the nature of the anthrax
threat and the nation's readiness for any further terror attacks. Ridge was
joined by Attorney General John Ashcroft , FBI Director Robert Mueller,
Surgeon General David Satcher, as well as high-ranking officials from the
Defense Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The director later told reporters that one of his tasks is to make sure that
"alleged inconsistencies" in the information provided to the public by
various government officials and agencies "are few and far between."

. Anthrax Incidents Believed Linked
Federal investigators are pursuing possible links between anthrax attacks in
New York, Florida and Washington, D.C. Officials have said preliminary
testing appears to indicate the anthrax found at NBC News headquarters in
New York and American Media Inc. may be from the same strain, suggesting the
2 incidents may be linked. "These preliminary tests do not show any
differences between those 2 strains," said Mitch Cohen, director of the
CDC, which is overseeing the testing.
Senior law enforcement officials have told ABCNEWS investigators believe the
anthrax-laced letters sent to NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw and Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle are in fact connected. Both envelopes were postmarked in
Trenton, N.J., had prepaid postage and had similar block handwriting.
According to sources who have seen them, the handwritten letters inside were
both dated "11 Sep 2001," the date of the terrorist attacks in New York and
Washington, and contained the message, "Death to America. Death to Israel.
Allah is great." While the Brokaw letter began, "This is next. Take
penacilin [sic now," the Daschle letter began, "This is next. Take your
medicine."
But despite the similarities in the letters, sources said the
anthrax-contaminated powders they contained are very different: The
substance sent to Capitol Hill was white and appeared to have been
professionally manufactured, while the powder mailed to NBC was brown and
crude in comparison. Mueller, however, said today that samples of anthrax
from all of the cases were still being analyzed "to determine whether or not
there is a sole or single source of each of those attacks."
. With the number of people confirmed to have been infected by or exposed
to the potentially deadly bacteria growing, federal authorities today
offered a $1 million reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of anyone sending anthrax through the mail.
Additionally, the FBI is continuing its crackdown on those responsible for
the more than 3300 phony bioterrorism hoaxes the bureau has responded to
over the past 18 days. Ashcroft said today that 4 individuals have been
charged in connection with false anthrax threats this week.

[Tom Ridge, director of the the new White House Office of Homeland Security,
coming to the foreground in this matter is welcomed by all of us, and we
wish him well. Coordination is long overdue. And I hope he organises a
thorough post-mortem when the dust settles. We have been given a great
opportunity to make mistakes with minimal cost.
I am told by David Ashford, CDC, that some person is recommending that those
with inhalation anthrax be vaccinated. As such clinical patients would
already be undergoing antibiotic treatment I think we can assume that they
will, if they survive, generate a perfectly adequate immune response without
benefit of vaccination. - Mod.MHJ
