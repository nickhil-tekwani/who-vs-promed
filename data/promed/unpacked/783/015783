China CDC has identified 3 students from Xinjiang studying in Beijing,
having latent infection with wild poliovirus [WPV]. [Presumably latent
infection refers to non-paralytic infection. - Mod.MPP]

Beijing has not had wild poliovirus cases in 27 years.

[While these cases are not considered paralytic polio cases] their
fecal excretion of the virus can be transmitted to others.

After the polio epidemic in Xinjiang and Tianfa Sheng, the Chinese all
over the country are beginning screening.

[In another Chinese language newswire article there is mention that
the 3 individuals were symptom-free and were attending a meeting in
Beijing, and that the WPV identified was type 1 (see
http://www.fawan.com/Article/bs/ms/2011/09/29/154734131730.html).
>From the newswires, it appears as though the Chinese government is
undertaking extensive testing of individuals from the affected
province (Xinjiang) around the country albeit there is no specific
mention of this (another Chinese language newswire queried a possible
suspected case in Yunnan
http://yn.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2011-10/01/c_131170760.htm).

The identification of asymptomatic WPV carriers is not surprising as
the paralytic to non-paralytic ratio for WPV infection is known to
range from a high of 1 paralytic case for every 50 infected
individuals to a low of 1 paralytic cases for every 1000 infected
individuals. The identification of these WPV carriers now in Beijing
serves as a reminder of the extensive distances the WPV can travel
"silently", and how a virus genetically similar to one circulating in
Pakistan, very quickly travelled from Pakistan to Western China, to
the capital of China in the Eastern part of the country (for a map of
China with Provinces and bordering countries, see
http://www.vbmap.org/asia-maps-7/china-map-provinces-103/).

As a reminder, as of 28 Sep 2011, there have been 10 confirmed cases
of polio, all residing in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; all but
one case were from Hotan Prefecture, with the most recent date of
onset 5 Sep 2011 in a case residing Bazhou Prefecture. The WPV1
responsible for this outbreak was identified as genetically similar to
the WPV1 currently circulating in Pakistan, which does share a border
with the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region.

More information on the status of polio in China including current
monitoring activities from knowledgeable sources would be greatly
appreciated. Information on the current control measures is available
from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative at
http://www.polioeradication.org/tabid/408/iid/158/Default.aspx.
