An alert on the risk posed by new outbreaks of wild rabies was launched by the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA), mainly in the department of Magdalena, where suspected cases have been detected in the municipalities of Santa Ana, Zona Bananera, Santa Marta, Guamal, and San Sebastian de Buenavista.

Caracol Radio Station spoke with Juan Pablo Velasquez, director of ICA's national wild rabies program, who said that rabies is transmitted by the bite of vampire bats and explained what actions can be taken to prevent the disease. Without the appropriate management, rabies transmitted by vampire bats may end up affecting humans.

Velazquez highlighted that vaccination of cattle and other animals is crucial for disease prevention.

[There are 3 species of hematophagous bats in the Neotropical region, one of which -- _Desmodus rotundus_ -- is a well known reservoir of rabies. This species feeds on a wide range of hosts, including humans, although will preferentially feed on large livestock such as cattle and horses.
