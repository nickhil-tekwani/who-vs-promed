[Potato ring rot is a very serious disease of potato and is one of the
reasons for rejection of seed potatoes from certification. The bacterium
overwinters in infected tubers in storage or in mild climates under field
conditions. Infection commonly occurs when infected seed potatoes are cut
into seed pieces for planting; cutting knives or machinery can be
contaminated, thus spreading the pathogen to non-infected seed pieces. The
disease was first observed in Germany in 1906. Disease management involves
use of certified, disease-free seed and the deployment of strict
phytosanitary procedures (eradication of diseased plants and tubers,
high-pressure spraying of chemicals to kill the bacterium, disposal of used
sacks, crop rotation, etc.). Apparently there are no immune cultivars. -
