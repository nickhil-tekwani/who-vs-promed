Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Tai Hang, Islands District, Hong Kong
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Feb 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Dogs / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a dog kept in the same household as a confirmed COVID-19 patient. The animal did not show any relevant clinical signs.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Dogs / 100 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the dog was placed under quarantine on [26 Feb 2020] after its owner was hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection. Following veterinary examination, nasal, oral, rectal swabs, as well as faeces were taken after the dog's admission to the quarantine facility. Nasal and oral samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The dog has not exhibited any specific clinical signs. Additional samples taken on [28 Feb 2020] also tested positive. Investigations are continuing to determine the duration of virus detection. Risk management measures are in place for this case, including cleansing and disinfection of the premises, and proper personal hygiene and protection. Mammalian pets from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 will be placed under quarantine and veterinary surveillance for 14 days. Samples will be collected for testing of SARS-CoV-2 as appropriate.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; traceability; quarantine; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Dogs / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 28 Feb 2020 / Positive

[In the absence of clinical disease, serological tests may be required to establish infection of the dog with the zoonotic virus SARS-CoV-2. If such infection is confirmed it may justify the given status of an emerging disease in this unique case. Preferably, OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases will establish a case definition for COVID-19 in animals, to allow notification of confirmed cases.

According to the latest press release from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) published on 28 Feb 2020, (https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/publications/publications_press/pr2335.html):
"The AFCD received a referral from the Department of Health [on Feb 26 2020] that a dog of a patient infected with COVID-19 disease virus will be handed over to the AFCD. Staff of the AFCD picked up the dog from a residential flat at Tai Hang in the evening on the same day and sent the dog to the animal keeping facility at the Hong Kong Port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Oral, nasal and rectal samples were collected for testing of COVID-19 virus. The nasal and oral cavity samples were tested weak positive to COVID-19 virus. The dog does not have any relevant symptoms.

"The above dog is the only dog under quarantine at animal keeping facility at the Hong Kong Port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge at the moment. There are no other animals using the said facility. Staff of the department will step up cleansing and disinfection of the animal keeping facility.

"At present, the AFCD does not have evidence that pet animals can be infected with COVID-19 virus or can be a source of infection to people. The department will conduct close monitoring of the above dog and collect further samples for testing to confirm if the dog has really been infected with the virus or this is a result of environmental contamination of the dog's mouth and nose. Repeated tests will be conducted for the dog and it will only be returned when the test result is negative.

"The spokesman said that to ensure public and animal health, the department strongly advises mammalian pets of patients confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 virus to be put under quarantine by the AFCD. The pets will be delivered to the designated animal keeping facilities of the AFCD for quarantine and veterinary surveillance for 14 days. Samples will be collected for testing of COVID-19 virus as appropriate.

"The spokesman reminded the pet owners to maintain a good habit of hygiene, and wash their hands thoroughly with soap or alcohol sanitizer after contacting pets. Pet owners shall wear masks while going out. If there are any changes in the health condition of the pets, advice from veterinarians should be sought as soon as possible." - Mods.CRD/AS
