Danish officials have revealed there were 10 cases of botulism in the 1st half of 2021 compared with none in the previous 2 years. Botulism is a rare illness caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria.

In January 2021, a woman was hospitalized and died after being diagnosed with botulism poisoning. The patient was from Asia and the suspicion was that she became ill from home-fermented fish or cabbage.

In March 2021, there were 3 different events with 2, 1 and 6 cases. The 1st samples were submitted for testing at SSI [Statens Serum Institut] from Greenland involving 2 men of the same family. Both were positive for botulism and one died. The duo had probably been infected after eating seal meat that was improperly stored. Botulinum toxin E was detected in the meat. The isolated case was a man hospitalized in early March 2021. He was from Romania and came to Denmark shortly before the onset of symptoms. The man had likely been exposed to the toxin during a dinner in Romania, where another person also developed similar symptoms.

In early March 2021, a dinner party was held with 6 family members involving a number of fish dishes. Five were hospitalized with symptoms of botulism. Botulinum toxin type A was found in an open glass of red fish roe. The producer, Agustson A/S, issued a recall of the product in March 2021. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration's investigation showed it was the same type of roe from this producer that was an ingredient in the homemade jelly ring with jarred lumpfish roe that caused an outbreak in 2018 affecting 9 people.

[The initial report regarding the fish roe-related cluster of cases in Denmark mentioned toxin type B, not A. Most cases of botulism associated with seafood are type E.

Botulism occurs when usually preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract; when the botulinum toxin [BT] is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II.

A 2021 published paper presents a new immunologic technique for delivering a biologic to reverse the effects of the toxin:

Abstract
--------
"Efficient penetration of cell membranes and specific targeting of a cell type represent major challenges for developing therapeutics toward intracellular targets. One example facing these hurdles is to develop post-exposure treatment for botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), a group of bacterial toxins (BoNT/A to BoNT/G) that are major potential bioterrorism agents. BoNTs enter motor neurons, block neurotransmitter release, and cause a paralytic disease botulism. Members of BoNTs such as BoNT/A exhibit extremely long half-life within neurons, resulting in persistent paralysis for months, yet there are no therapeutics that can inhibit BoNTs once they enter neurons. Here, we developed a chimeric toxin-based delivery platform by fusing the receptor-binding domain of a BoNT, which targets neurons, with the membrane translocation domain and inactivated protease domain of the recently discovered BoNT-like toxin BoNT/X, which can deliver cargoes across endosomal membranes into the cytosol. A therapeutic protein was then created by fusing a single-domain antibody (nanobody) against BoNT/A with the delivery platform. In vitro characterization demonstrated that nanobodies were delivered into cultured neurons and neutralized BoNT/A in neurons. Administration of this protein in mice shortened duration of local muscle paralysis, restoring muscle function within hours, and rescued mice from systemic toxicity of lethal doses of BoNT/A. Fusion of 2 nanobodies, one against BoNT/A and the other against BoNT/B, created a multivalent therapeutic protein able to neutralize both BoNT/A and BoNT/B in mice. These studies provide an effective post-exposure treatment for botulism and establish a platform for intracellular delivery of therapeutics targeting cytosolic proteins and processes."
