[In June and again in November 2016, Russia reported 2 events related to HPAI subtype H5N8. See the summary and map of these previous events at:

Event reported on 17 June 2016, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=20335

Event reported on 23 November 2016, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21641

Astrakhan is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude. Its southern border is the Caspian Sea, eastern is Kazakhstan, northern is Volgograd Oblast, and western is the Republic of Kalmykia [Note: where November's event was located. - Mod.CRD] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrakhan_Oblast.

Although for this current event the neuraminidase has not yet been typed, given the continued spread of this virus in the area, there is a high likelihood that these findings may also be associated subtype H5N8. - Mod.CRD
