Update number 128
-----------------
Summary
-------
Influenza activity is increasing in parts of North America coincident
with increasing numbers of detections of influenza A(H1N1)2009 and
influenza type B, though the dominant virus in North America is still
currently influenza A(H3N2). Rates of pneumonia and influenza
mortality in the United States of America (USA) have remained above
the epidemic threshold for the past 2 to 3 weeks. Transmission of
influenza appears to have peaked in much of Western Europe, though
case counts of severe and fatal cases continue to accumulate. The
appearance of severe cases in Europe is similar to the 2009-2010
season; the highest number have been in the age group from 15-64
years, 60-70 percent have a pre-existing medical condition associated
with increased risk of severe influenza, and most have not been
vaccinated. Transmission in tropical zones of the world is sporadic
(the Americas) or low (tropical Asia). Countries in the southern
temperate zone have little influenza activity; however Australia
continues to have transmission of influenza A at low-levels. The
majority of the viruses characterized from North America and Europe
are closely related to the vaccine viruses for the current seasonal
vaccines, though small numbers of influenza type B of the Yamagata
lineage are reported in both regions.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America:
--------------
Influenza activity continues to be elevated and has intensified
somewhat since the last report across North America. In Canada,
influenza activity continues to increase in some areas including
Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. Consultation rate for Influenza-
Like Illness (ILI) are elevated and have increased to 35.7
consultations per 1000 patient visits nationally, which is within the
expected range when compared to previous influenza seasons.
Approximately 20 percent of specimens tested in Canada are positive
for influenza virus. Influenza type A accounts for around 90 percent
of all influenza detections, decreasing slightly compared to previous
weeks as the proportion of influenza type B viruses rises. Influenza
A(H1N1)2009 viruses are increasingly being detected in Canada, though
H3N2 viruses still make up approximately 88 percent of all influenza A
specimens subtyped. In contrast to observations in Europe where H1N1
(2009) virus has been the predominant virus circulating and severe
cases are primarily occurring in younger age groups, 65 percent of
fatal cases in Canada have occurred in age group >65 years. Influenza
activity in the USA remains elevated with widespread activity reported
by 36 states. 20 states are reporting high ILI activity, and
nationally the proportion of outpatient visits for ILI is 4.5 percent,
which is above the national baseline of 2.5 percent and increased from
4.0 percent reported 2 weeks ago. Influenza virus was detected in
approximately 35 percent of specimens tested in the USA. Sixty-seven
percent of influenza viruses detected were influenza A viruses,
decreased from 72 percent 2 weeks ago as the proportion of influenza B
viruses detected in the USA continues to rise. Of influenza viruses A
further characterized, 81 percent were influenza A(H3N2) and 19
percent were influenza A(H1N1)2009 and nearly all were cross reactive
antigenically with influenza A strains found in the current trivalent
seasonal influenza vaccine. Of the type B viruses characterized, 94
percent were influenza B (Victoria), the B lineage included in the
current vaccine, and 6 percent were influenza B of the Yamagata
lineage. Deaths reported as due to pneumonia or influenza in a USA
surveillance system encompassing data from 122 cities were reported at
8.9 percent of all deaths, which is increased over previous reports
and above the epidemic threshold.

Europe:
-------
Influenza activity remains high in most of Europe, though activity
appears to have peaked in many western and northern European countries
as evidenced by decreasing rates of ILI and the proportion of
respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza virus. Of the 41
countries reporting on consultation rates for ILI and Acute
Respiratory Infection (ARI), 8 (Albania, Belarus, the Czech Republic,
Iceland, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia and Slovakia)
reported increases while 6 (Ireland, Israel, Malta, Norway, Spain and
the United Kingdom) reported decreases. 2 countries (Georgia and
Luxembourg) and the Siberian region of the Russian Federation reported
very high intensity of influenza activity. 15 countries in the
European Region reported moderate to severe impact on the health care
system. Many countries of the region are reporting severe and fatal
cases of influenza, though numbers of severe and fatal cases are not
being formally tracked this season. In the United Kingdom, the number
of fatal influenza-related cases has increased over the last 2 weeks
from 395 to 494, a number slightly in excess of the reported fatal
cases last year. In general, severe cases from Europe continue to
occur in a pattern similar to that seen last season. Most are in the
age group from 15-64 years, 60-70 percent have a pre-existing medical
condition associated with increased risk of severe influenza, and most
have not been vaccinated. Notably, although both influenza A(H1N1)2009
and influenza type B are circulating in most countries, H1N1 (20009)
virus continues to be over-represented in severe cases. The percentage
of influenza B virus detections is 10 times higher in the outpatient
sentinel samples than it is for the for the severe influenza cases
admitted to hospital. Overall, 44 percent of specimens collected
tested positive for influenza. Of these, 44 percent were influenza
A(H1N1)2009, 3 percent were influenza A(H3N2), and 48 percent were
influenza type B.

North Africa and the Middle East:
---------------------------------
In North Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity has been
declining for several weeks and the overall number of specimens
testing positive for influenza continues to decrease. Most countries
have a mixture of influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)2009.

Northern Asia:
--------------
In the temperate regions of Asia, ILI activity has been variable,
though generally has either recently peaked or is decreasing. In
northern China, during 17-23 Jan 2011, there was a slight decrease in
ILI activity; with levels continuing to remain below that observed
during the previous 3 seasons. During 17-23 Jan 2011, 28 percent of
548 specimens tested were positive for influenza: 99 percent were
influenza A and 1 percent influenza B. Of the 149 influenza A
detections: 70 percent were H1N1 (2009) and 24 percent H3N2. In Japan,
ILI activity continued to decline during 7-13 Feb 2011. Of the 382
influenza viruses detected during 1 to 22 Feb 2011, 57 percent were
H1N1 (2009), 30 percent H3N2, and 13 percent were influenza type B. In
the Republic of Korea, ILI activity is now stable following a
declining trend, and H1N1 (2009) is co-circulating with H3N2. In
Mongolia, ILI activity increased during 7-13 Feb 2011, showing
fluctuating activity for the past few weeks. In most countries of
northern Asia, there has been a recent shift from H3N2, which was
previously predominant, to H1N1 (2009) which has become predominant in
recent weeks.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza transmission is generally low throughout the tropical zone
though the most active area is in parts of eastern Africa and tropical
areas of Asia. Countries of Central America and the Caribbean islands
have reported only sporadic influenza virus detections in recent
weeks. In sub-Saharan Africa, available data indicate little activity
in most countries. However, Madagascar is reporting continuing active
influenza transmission with a high proportion (53 percent) of
specimens testing positive for influenza viruses with nearly equal
numbers of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza type B. Kenya has recently
reported decreasing numbers of influenza viruses detected, most of
which are H1N1 (2009). Low level transmission is reported in several
parts of tropical Asia. In southern China, ILI activity has been
fluctuating but overall has remained low; however, 46 percent of 969
specimens tested were positive for influenza: 95 percent were
influenza A and 5 percent were influenza B. Of the 425 influenza A
detections: 88 percent were H1N1 (2009) and 6 percent were H3N2. Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region reports sustained ILI activity with
a predominance of H1N1 (2009) co-circulating with low levels of H3N2
and influenza type B. In Singapore, there has been fluctuating acute
respiratory infection (ARI) activity with recent levels above the
epidemic threshold; 2 percent of polyclinic ARI cases are exhibiting
ILI, and majority of the ILI cases were H1N1 (2009), co-circulating
with low levels of H3N2 and influenza type B. In the Pacific Islands,
increased numbers of ILI cases were reported from the Federated States
of Micronesia, Kiribati, and Tuvalu. Sustained activity was reported
from the Marshall Islands and French Polynesia. A decrease in weekly
ILI activity was reported from Fiji. Low ILI activity was reported
from American Samoa, Cook Islands, Guam, and Palau. In Nauru, 6 of 15
specimens submitted to a WHO Collaborating Center laboratory in
January 2011 were positive for influenza A(H3N2).

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The countries in the southern temperate regions of the world continue
to have very little influenza transmission since the end of their
winter season. Australia, however, continues to report out-of-season,
low level detection of influenza A(H3N2) with lower numbers of
influenza A(H1N1)2009.

Virological surveillance
------------------------
During weeks 5 to 6, regional and widespread outbreaks of laboratory
confirmed influenza A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2) and B viruses continued to be
reported in many parts of Asia, Europe and the north Americas. The
predominant virus subtype circulating in the various regions differed.
Influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses predominated in China, while both
influenza A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses co-circulated at high levels in
many European countries. In the United States, influenza A(H1N1)2009,
A(H3N2) and B viruses co-circulated, while in Canada, the predominant
viruses were still A(H3N2). Currently, the vast majority of
antigenically characterized viruses from the 2010-2011 influenza
season are similar to the viruses WHO recommended for the 2010-2011
northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.

FluNet reports
--------------
During weeks 5 to 6 (30 Jan 2011 to 12 Feb 2011), National Influenza
Centres (NICs) from 67 countries, areas or territories reported data
to FluNet. A total of 26 600 specimens were reported as positive for
influenza viruses, 20 073 (75.5 percent) were typed as influenza A and
6527 (24.5 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A
viruses reported, 84.3 percent were (H1N1) 2009 and 15.7 percent were
influenza A(H3N2).

In brief: The pattern in north America differs markedly from that
observed elsewhere. Influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses predominated in
China, while both influenza A(H1N1)2009 and B viruses co-circulated at
high levels in many European countries. In the United States,
influenza A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2) and B viruses co-circulated, while in
Canada, the predominant viruses were still A(H3N2). Currently, the
vast majority of antigenically characterized viruses from the
2010-2011 influenza season are similar to the viruses WHO recommended
for the 2010-2011 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines. - Mod.CP]
