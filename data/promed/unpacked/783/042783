Outbreak of scombroid fish poisoning in Lothian.
D F. McCormick; H Dick; R Othieno; L Davis; L Wellington.

Scombroid fish poisoning is a type of food intoxication caused by eating certain fish species that have begun to spoil. Fish that cause scombroid have naturally high levels of histidine in the flesh and include tuna and mackerel. Histidine is converted to histamine by bacterial overgrowth in fish that has been improperly stored (greater than 20 C [68 F]) after capture. Histamine and other scombrotoxins are resistant to cooking, smoking, canning, or freezing.

Symptoms begin within 2 minutes to 2 hours of eating the fish. The most common symptoms are rash, diarrhoea, flushing, sweating, headache, and vomiting. Burning or swelling of the mouth, abdominal pain, or a metallic taste may also occur. The majority of patients have mild symptoms that resolve within a few hours and often go unreported. Treatment is generally unnecessary, but occasionally antiallergenic medication may be considered.

On the afternoon of Thu 28 Feb 2013, NHS Lothian Health Protection Team was notified by the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) Environmental Health Team of several cases of allergic type symptoms (skin rashes, mouth tingling, vomiting and difficulty breathing) suspected to be caused by scombroid fish poisoning. All the cases had eaten a tuna sandwich from the cafe of a local college within an hour or so of symptoms developing. There was a lot of activity at the college when the students suddenly became ill. Several ambulances, the police and the press were in attendance within a short period. Six individuals were treated on site with adrenaline by paramedics, and, in total, 9 individuals attended Accident and Emergency Services for review. After the initial cluster of cases, there were no further reports of cases.

An officer from the City of Edinburgh Council visited the college on the afternoon of 28 Feb [2013], and all tuna was removed from sale. It was noted that only students who ate sandwiches containing tuna were affected and that there were no other reports of symptoms in individuals who had consumed sandwiches that did not contain tuna.

Inspections of the catering facilities in Fife and at the college kitchen were carried out, and all processes were reported as compliant with regulations.

The tuna had originated in Ghana but was delivered to the college from a location in Fife. The importer of the tuna supplied a satisfactory test certificate for histamine levels in the batch concerned as of 11 Nov 2012, and repeat testing at the time of the incident was also satisfactory. Test results from samples of unopened packs at the delivery source in Fife were also satisfactory (histamine level 13mg/Kg, colony count at 30 C [86 F] less than 4000 cfu/g). Neither of these suppliers had received complaints or notifications of issues from any other locations, and both had quarantined the batch in response to this incident.

For the samples taken from the college kitchens, elevated levels of bacteria at 30 C [86 F] were found in all the samples tested, the unopened tuna packs, tuna cheese sandwich filling, tuna melt mix, tuna mayonnaise, and classic mayonnaise. In the tuna cheese sandwich filling and the tuna mayonnaise, respective histamine levels were 19 and 23 times the maximum allowable. Visual inspection of the unopened packs did not show any damage.

These findings support the diagnosis of scombrotoxin fish poisoning. The clinical presentation of the cases were typical of an outbreak of scombrotoxin fish poisoning appearing shortly after the suspected fish meal and resolving within several hours.

Outbreaks of scombrotoxin poisoning are relatively rare in Scotland. Only 7 previous outbreaks have been reported to HPS since 1996, the number of persons affected in these previous outbreaks ranging from 3 to 12.

The sudden onset and dramatic presentation of this illness can result in considerable anxiety among those affected and a lot of press interest, which needs to be managed proactively. In addition, it can stimulate a robust response from health and environmental services, which can be stood down once the situation is clarified.

Elevated levels of bacteria in the classic mayonnaise are not uncommon in kitchens, as mayonnaise is an excellent medium for bacterial growth, especially where a jar is in constant use. The elevated levels in the apparently intact packaging from Africa cannot be explained other than by poor process hygiene at or prior to packing, as bacterial growth should not have taken place in transit or storage. The combination of bacteria in the tuna and the mayonnaise plus an extended period of the combined product left outside of temperature control in the college kitchen could create a "perfect storm" to create the very high histamine levels that cause symptoms.

An environmental health officer of CEC has revisited the college kitchen to discuss the results and the catering procedures that could have led to a failure of control. The officer has suggested a review of the college's hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) system. In particular, there needs to be a review of delivery procedures and associated temperature monitoring, a re-training of students (staff in the kitchen) on the procedures for minimizing the time that food being prepared is outside temperature controls, and a re-training of students in the procedures for stock rotation. Visual checks were carried out on packaging, and no damage was noted. However, in any future incidents, packaging should be retained for further analysis for damage, which may highlight issues with storage and transport processes.

The incident highlights the importance, during an incident, of all agencies working closely with each other and with members of the public to control the source, investigate the cause, and provide timely and reassuring information to the public.

[This article is well done regarding the signs and symptoms from this particular toxin, but it sufficiently reinforces my belief to avoid tuna fish and mayonnaise on sandwiches unless I make it myself and eat it immediately.
