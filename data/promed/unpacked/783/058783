CJD (new var.), suspected case - South Africa 20001211.2167

From: Prof. R Swanepoel <bobs@niv.ac.za>

Although sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) generally (but not
invariably) occurs in older patients, there is no evidence to indicate that
the patient under discussion suffered from (new) variant CJD (vCJD). The
brain biopsy sample examined by histopathologists showed lesions compatible
with CJD, and reportedly there were no features to suggest a diagnosis of
vCJD. Nevertheless, the tissue sample was very small. The original tissue
blocks were destroyed but the stained sections remain available and are
being referred to specialists in the field for an opinion.
There has been no evidence to indicate that BSE occurs in South Africa, but
veterinary authorities are aware that no country can claim immunity from
the threat of the disease. Apart from the bans imposed on the importation
of meat and carcass products, other measures are being taken to minimize
the risk of BSE in the country. Brain tissue samples from livestock with
nervous symptoms submitted for the investigation of rabies are being
screened routinely for evidence of the spongiform encephalopathies.
Examination of animals for signs of nervous and other disease has always
been routine before slaughter, but once there is international agreement on
specific sampling and test procedures for screening livestock at
slaughterhouses for spongiform encephalopathies, such procedures will be
implemented here.
