[Dagestan is an autonomous republic of Russia. It is small -- 19 400 square miles and 2.9 million people -- on the northwest Caspian Sea coast and adjoins Azerbaijan, Chechnya, and Georgia. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan.

Latterly, OIE has reported limited outbreaks in 2005, 2010, and 2012, but nothing since. Because of the civil unrest in the country, we may presume that the disease is under-reported, though sporadic. We can probably presume that these 3 persons were exposed while slaughtering and butchering a sick animal, probably a bovine. - Mod.MHJ
