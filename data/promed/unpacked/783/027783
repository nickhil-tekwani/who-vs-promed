In 2000, the government declared measles was eliminated in the United States due to its successful vaccination program. Shortly after that, the number of cases increased. "Nebraska had its 1st confirmed case of measles last week in Eastern Nebraska," said Sandy Preston, immunization clinic coordinator for Community Health in Scotts Bluff County. "Because vaccines are so safe and effective, we haven't had a case since 1990." Preston said people choose to not immunize due to fear or incorrect science, but numerous studies have found no connection between autism and vaccines. "One doctor conducted an improper study and had his paper retracted from Lancet, but he had enough influence that people listen to him," Preston said. "He lost his license, but meanwhile 8 children died." Infectious diseases that once regularly killed or harmed infants, children, and adults have been reduced or eliminated with vaccines. "We've had such a leg up people have forgotten how devastating it is," she said. "There are young people and doctors who've never seen these diseases."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccines contain the same antigens or parts of antigens that cause diseases, but antigens in vaccines are either killed or greatly weakened. Antigens do not cause disease. They make the immune system produce antibodies against them. Through vaccination, children develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases. No vaccine is 100 percent effective. Immunization also helps those who cannot get a vaccine because they are too young, cannot produce antibodies or other medical reasons. The herd immunity helps prevent it from spreading. Adults can also get measles if they are not vaccinated. Children under 5 and adults over 20 are at higher risk for measles complications including pneumonia, and a higher risk of hospitalization and death from measles than school-aged children and adolescents. About one out of 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection, and up to one out of 20 gets pneumonia, CDC said. For every 1000 children who get measles, one or 2 will die. "Of the fatalities we see, it's usually associated with pneumonia and encephalitis," Preston said.

August is National Immunization Awareness Month (NIAM), which increases awareness about immunizations across the lifespan. Community Health has several programs for those who can and cannot afford immunisations. "Vaccines are one of the safest methods to protect you and your child," Preston said. "Please have your children protected."

Another USD 1.45 million was allocated to kick-start a campaign to combat the outbreak of measles, which has left thousands of children at risk of disability and death, the humanitarian partners in Somalia said. This funding will be used to vaccinate 520 000 children under 5 years in the worst affected areas of Banadir, Lower Juba, and Puntland.

According to the latest humanitarian report released by the UNOCHA [United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs], around 4000 suspected cases of measles were reported between January and June this year [2014], more than double than the same period last year. 3/4 of cases were reported in children under 5 years. Measles is one of the leading killers of young children in Somalia, a situation made worse by the lack of health services. The vaccination drive will help prevent the spread of the disease to other locations, particularly those inaccessible to vaccination teams. The allocation will be complemented by USD 300 000 from the Somalia Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). The UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) has allocated over USD 20 million to bolster humanitarian efforts in Somalia. On 23 Jul 2014, the CERF allocated the largest single allocation to a country, USD 20 million, to Somalia for life-saving activities based on a global review of critical aid operations that are facing funding deficits.

Bay of Plenty authorities are confirming no new cases of measles in the Lakes and Bay of Plenty region, despite 8 new cases in the Waikato. The Toi Te Ora Public Health Service Medical Officer of Health Dr Neil de Wet said the last confirmed cases for the Bay was in the middle of July [2014].

To date, the Waikato District Health Board's Public Health Service has been notified of 124 confirmed cases of measles. "Almost half the confirmed cases are household contacts of a confirmed case and were already placed in quarantine before they were unwell," says a statement from the health organisation.

"Approximately 80 per cent of cases are aged between 10 to 20 years old. "Of the others, 15 per cent are aged under 10 years old and 5 per cent over 30 years old and are mostly close contacts of confirmed cases in quarantine as they were not vaccinated." 9 people have been hospitalised as a result of the disease but are now reported to have recovered. "Of the 124 cases, the vast majority are unimmunised; only 4 are fully immunised.

"Approximately 110 cases with a clinical illness and rash like measles have been investigated and found not to have measles."

The Northland District Health Board will know by next Tuesday [12 Aug 2014] if the District is experiencing a potential measles outbreak. One Northland child was confirmed to have the disease last week [week of 28 Jul 2014] after coming in contact with infected children from the Waikato.

Northland District Health Board Medical Officer of Health, Dr Clair Mills says public cooperativeness has helped to minimise the spread. She says so far only one other child is showing measles symptoms.
