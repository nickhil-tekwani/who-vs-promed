Prof. Lam Sai Kit informed me that the report from Bernama news agency
which I posted contains major errors. The figures given by the
Director-General of Health were 5 of 30 samples tested (not 19 of 98 as
reported) yielded the [Hendra-like virus. "The Director-General also
specified in no uncertain terms that the role of this new virus in the
present JE outbreak is unknown and CDC has been invited by the government
to assist the Ministry of Health and ourselves in quickly establishing
this," said Prof. Lam. Prof. Lam will be submitting a correction and an
update within the next 2 days.
[Here are some of the basic data needed for understanding this very complex
situation:
For humans (Number of males & number of females by age):
Number of suspect cases:
Number of suspect cases with a history of JE vaccination (by number of doses)
Number of cases confirmed by virus isolation as Japanese encephalitis:
Number confirmed by virus isolation as Hendra-like disease:
For pigs:
Number of suspect cases:
Number confirmed by virus isolation as Japanese encephalitis:
Number confirmed by virus isolation as Hendra-like disease:
Although ProMED-mail has not received formal messages providing information
regarding signs of illnesses in pigs, informally we have heard that pigs
"are dying with this disease" (whatever "this disease is"). Information as
to signs of illnesses in pigs would be informative. Many pigs have been
abandoned (i.e., not being fed) and for a very brief time some of them were
being beaten to death (aerosols?); this was stopped after public outcry.
Ken Lam is in a "hot seat" right now and obviously he and his associates
are working under pressure to obtain results immediately, which is
impossible. We wish him the best of good luck in working through this mess.
A media story in today's newspapers (around the world) follows.
Remarkably, the Malaysian Government is sticking to the story that this is
a Japanese encephalitis (JE) epidemic with, possibly, some Hendra-like
virus involvement. As our readers can tell from the change in headers,
ProMED-mail is emphasizing the emerging nature of the Hendra-like virus and
minimizing the JE factor.

Soldiers armed with shotguns fanned out across three villages in southern
Malaysia on Saturday to begin shooting 65,000 pigs, seeking to control a
virus that may have killed as many as 50 people. At a deserted primary
school near the villages, more than 1,000 soldiers and 300 health officials
drafted a plan to kill every pig in the area -- Southeast Asia's largest
hog-breeding region -- because they might carry the Japanese encephalitis
virus. The virus, which attacks the brain, causing high fever, vomiting
and coma, is transmitted from pigs to humans by _Culex_ mosquitoes that
thrive in swamps and open drains. More than 30 people have died in the
area, which has a population of 11,000, bringing the nationwide death toll
to 53 since October. Nearly all the victims have lived or worked near hog
farms.
Hundreds of families have already abandoned the villages, 60 miles
southeast of the capital, Kuala Lumpur. Police said the few who remained in
the prosperous pig-rearing district of Negri Sembilan state had been
evacuated to enable soldiers and police to begin the slaughter. The state
veterinary department director, Majid Awang, told the national news agency
Bernama that about 65,000 pigs would be shot over two days. Farmers in the
region say the pig population totals more than 300,000. There was no
immediate explanation of the discrepancy.
The government teams were to use tractors, bulldozers and backhoes to bury
the carcasses in an operation expected to last 10 days. "The entire pig
population in the affected areas will be wiped out,'' Health Minister Chua
Jui Meng said. Pig farmers who lose their livelihood will be compensated
from the proceeds of a special lottery, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Saturday. The government has spent $12million in the battle against
the virus, killing pigs and mosquitoes, clearing mosquito breeding grounds
and vaccinating people, he said. The government has ordered vaccinations
[with JE vaccine for 300,000 people and 500,000 pigs.

No live pigs will be brought into Singapore from today, following the death
of one abattoir worker and the hospitalisation of five others. The move to
suspend pig imports from all of Malaysia as well as Indonesia, is aimed at
removing the source of infection, the pigs.
The two abattoirs - Kim Chuan and Jurong - will be closed "to be completely
disinfected and to remove possibilities of infection," Primary Production
Department's (PPD) Dr Chua Sin Bin said yesterday.
The moves are a precautionary measure, as the authorities have yet to
determine if Japanese encephalitis (JE) has crossed the border into
Singapore.
The abattoir worker who died, [Mr. X, 49, did not suffer from JE. Medical
tests, however, have not pin-pointed the cause of death and are still
on-going, said Dr Chew Suok Kai, director of epidemiology and disease
control at the Health Ministry.
The five new cases from Kim Chuan abattoir where Mr. [X traded in pork,
were warded on Thursday night and yesterday afternoon. While they were
found to be suffering from encephalitis, doctors have not concluded that it
is JE. All the five [patients including a woman, are said to be in stable
condition.
[In another development, the PPD has disallowed cross-border crossings of
horses as they are also susceptible to [JE} virus. Twenty-four horses which
raced last weekend in Ipoh were not allowed to return yesterday.
[The ban on the import of live pigs from Malaysia is a correct move in view
of the report of the isolation of [the Hendra-like virus from a fatal
human case and the detection of infection in 19 of 98 [corrected above
hospitalised patients in Malaysia. No confirmed Hendra virus infection has
been found in Singapore yet, but it would not surprise anyone if human
infection is detected among abattoir workers who had, before the ban,
worked on imported live pigs from affected areas in Malaysia. However,
confirmation of Hendra virus infection will be impossible without the test
reagents. Hopefully, the CDC team coming to Malaysia will provide the
necessary assistance.
On the question of JE virus crossing the border from Malaysia into
Singapore, I have yet to see data showing that the virus is not present in
Singapore any more after phasing out pig farming here. JE, as I understand
it, is not a reportable disease in Singapore as well as in many Asian
countries. There is, thus, no serious attempts to identify JE virus
infection among the patients who are diagnosed as viral encephalitis.
Complement-fixing antibodies to JE virus have also been reported in survey
sera from humans in Singapore. As regards horses, both humans and horses
(which show clinical disease on infection) are regarded as incidental hosts
in the JE virus transmission cycle in nature. However, Hendra virus infects
and kills horses and could serve as a source of infection for man. -
Mod.CYC
[300,000 pigs x 100 kilo each = 30,000,000 kilos. That's a great deal of
protein taken out of the food chain.
I wonder whether the authorities realize that one of the hosts of JE virus
is wild birds. Lord knows what would happen if that got out. - Mod.CHC

Perspective of a pig producer
Date: Sat, 20 Mar 1999 04:47:40 -0500
From: Tim Harris <100257.1720@compuserve.com>

I have a customer in peninsular Malaysia near Ipoh to whom I have been
sending the ProMED-mail postings on JE. He is a pig producer and has been
buying replacement genetic material in UK. Here is his latest news today.
"Thanks for your emails. My family and I are sound and healthy here and so
are the pigs. Pig producers are in a dilemma as the JE crisis is very
tenseful and frightening due to the high death rate. To date, the disease
had claimed 37 lives in the Negeri Sembilan state mostly in Bukit Pelandok.
17 more were warded at various hospitals in the country.
The number of deaths and fatal cases were incorrect while others
information provided from the web were acceptable. Different papers provide
different statistics. I am puzzled at why pig workers died despite having
vaccinated 3 doses anti-JE? Last year the deaths of many pig workers in
Ampang, Ulu piah and Tambun were of suspected JE. As far as I know not even
one case confirmed JE. Very concerned and worried besides the big sum of
money loss everyday. Most importantly, all the people on the farm are safe
and healthy.
What shocking news from Singapore. Four pig handlers were warded
[hospitalized yesterday and two [of them died this morning. Another two
were warded bringing the total to six cases. All exporting pig farms to
Singapore had been banned as a result except pigs in Johor state are
allowed to be exported. That's all for the time being. Hope you hear your
advice regarding this matter."

Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad today announced there will be
a nationwide review of pig rearing activities and farming areas to ensure
that the Japanese encephalitis (JE) problem does not recur. The relevant
parties including pig farmers had agreed to the reorganisation and for the
need to keep farms clean with an efficient effluents disposal system, the
Prime Minister said. He said if the farmers had been prepared to spend a
little more to maintain cleanliness they would not be facing this JE
problem in Bukit Pelandok and Kampung Sungai Nipah, Port Dickson. He said
the government had taken all possible measures to counter the outbreak
such as killing the source of the virus - the pigs, destroying the
transmitter of the disease from the infected pigs to humans - the
_Culex_mosquitoes and their breeding areas and vaccinating the people in
and near pig farms.
On the setting up of a permanent crisis management committee to counter
infectious diseases, the Prime Minister said it was suffice to have ad hoc
committees because of the shortage of doctors in the country and moreover
one could never anticipate the timing of a crisis or an outbreak. "Only
when a situation like the present one occurs, will we know the appropriate
action to take. Before a particular thing occurs, no one will of course
know what action to take...no one ever told me before that if there is a JE
outbreak we will have to shoot the pigs," he said.
[The last quote of the Prime Minister is of interest. I too did not know
that one measure to control a JE outbreak is to shoot the pigs. The other
recent control measure taken by countries where JE virus is known to be
endemic is the banning of the import of pigs from a country where an
outbreak occurs. JE outbreaks occur in countries like Japan, China, Korea
and Taiwan. Could the experts from these countries advise me if the above
measures are now the recommended control method to prevent the spread of
transmission of JE virus, a mosquito-borne virus? - Mod.CYC
[This is what is called "the Remington vaccine" approach to livestock
disease control. It works, too. If you do not have the hosts you do not
have the virus in them. - Mod.CHC

All abattoir workers and pig traders have been ordered to go for checkups
to ensure that no one else has come down with encephalitis. [How will
patients with encephalitis get to the hospital for check ups? - Mod CHC.
So far, six have been hospsitalised for encephalitis, the latest being a
Kim Chuan abattoir worker who was warded on Friday. One is critically ill,
two are in serious condition and three are stable. The seventh victim [Mr.
X died on Friday. Another three have also been warded, but for pneumonia,
stroke and fever. Test results from three encephalitis victims, including
Mr Lim, have shown that Japanese encephalitis (JE) was not involved.
Authorities here are not ruling out encephalitis caused by the Hendra
virus, following Malaysia's announcement that the virus could be the cause
of some deaths there. Unlike JE virus, which is transmitted by [infected
_Culex_ sp. mosquitoes, this [Hendra virus is spread through close contact
with infected animals. Tissue samples of the three victims who had tested
negative for JE virus have been sent to the Centres for Disease Control in
Atlanta, United States, for Hendra virus tests. Results are expected in two
or three weeks' time. [sooner, I would expect - Mod CHC. A total of 116
[of 550 pig handlers have been screened at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's
Communicable Disease Centre so far. Nine have been warded for observation,
none for encephalitis-related symptoms. The nine, who suffer symptoms such
as a mild fever, will be warded for a few days, "just to be sure," said Dr
Chew Suok Kai, director of Epidemiology and Disease Control at the Health
Ministry. National Development Minister Lim Hng Kiang, who chaired
yesterday's press briefing, stressed: "The problem is confined to these 550
workers. The rest of us who have not had any direct contact with the pigs
are not at risk."
Following the ban on live-pig imports, the PPD [Primary Production
Department said yesterday there were no more live pigs in Singapore.
[Singapore has no pig farms. All live pigs are imported. - Mod. CYC Their
absence removes the source of the infection, but Mr Lim said "we are not
out of the woods yet."
Jockeys and those who have close contact with horses may have to go for a
medical checkup. Mr Lim said this move might be taken, following Malaysia's
announcement on Friday that the Hendra virus could be behind deaths
previously associated with JE. The virus, first discovered in horses in the
Hendra suburb in Brisbane, Australia, in 1994, killed 15 horses and three
people there. Since Friday, the Government has banned cross-border
movement of horses between Singapore and Malaysia. Mr Bernard Ang,
president of the Association of Racehorse Trainers Singapore said a Hendra
viral outbreak would be catastrophic, leading to hundreds of millions of
dollars lost from races and investment in horses. He estimated that there
are more than 60 trainers, over 100 jockeys and more than 500 other
handlers working in the Penang, Kuala Lumpur, Perak and Singapore racing
circuit.
[If the National Development Minister's comments are correct, that the
problem is confined to these 550 pig handlers and that the remainder of the
population, who have not had any direct contact with the pigs, are not at
risk, then this ain't JE. - Mod.CHC

Thailand placed an import ban on pork imports from Malaysia yesterday in a
bid to prevent a pig virus epidemic from spreading into that country. "The
livestock department has banned all pork imports or live pigs from Malaysia
and set up an ad hoc patrol unit along the common border," a Ministry of
Public Health statement said. Communicable Disease Control
Director-General Yooth Bodharamik warned the public not to panic as no
cases of the disease had been detected in Thailand. A Thai Customs officer
at a Thai-Malaysian border checkpoint told Reuters by telephone that his
outpost had asked Thais to stop bringing Malaysian pigs into the country in
January, when it first received reports of the virus scare. "Most Malaysian
pigs passing through here before the epidemic were for personal
consumption, not for trade," said the officer at Takbai checkpoint. "We
have since required anyone seeking to import pigs to have them certified
virus-free." An official at another checkpoint, at Sungai Kolok, said his
virus watch had also been extended to cows and other livestock.
