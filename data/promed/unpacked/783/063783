For the period 3-9 Oct 2012
---------------------------
On 5 Oct 2012, the Ministry of Health in Tunisia reported to EpiSouth 8 new confirmed human cases of West Nile virus [infection] among patients hospitalised from 9-28 Sep 2012. To date, a total of 15 confirmed WNV cases in humans have been reported in 2012, including:

- 2 cases in Monastir governorate (Ksar Helal and Zarmedine)
- 5 cases in Kebili (North Kebili, Kebili and Souk Lahad)
- 8 cases including one death in a 69 year old man in Gabes governorate (El Menara, Gabes, Mareth and Zarat)

Another probable case from Jendouba was positive for West Nile [virus? antibody?], but this case presented underlying pathologies including zona and immuno-depression, which could question the diagnosis. Further investigations are in process for this case.

The last WNV human cases reported in Tunisia dated from 18 Sep 2012. Since 2010, Tunisia has reported the following West Nile virus cases:

- In 2010, 3 cases were reported (Jendouba and Tataouine).
- In 2011, 3 cases were reported (Kebili, cf. eWEB 189).
- In 2012, 15 cases were reported (Monastir, Kebili and Gabes governorates).

The increasing number of reported cases in 2012 compared with 2010 and 2011, in addition to the geographical extension to new areas, are likely to indicate a stronger WNV dynamic in Tunisia this year [2012].

[There were ProMED-mail posts from 2003 indicating that there were 20 cases of human WNV infections without fatalities in central Tunisia (see archives cited below). Occurrence of WNV human infection in Tunisia is not surprising because sporadic human and equine cases are reported from countries in the Mediterranean Basin.

The above URL for the EpiSouth report provides maps showing the locations of the Tunisian governorates where the WNV cases occurred. - Mod.TY
