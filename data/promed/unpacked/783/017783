Whooping cough is hitting Idaho hard. 77 cases of pertussis have been
reported, about twice the average. Cynthia Taggart from the Panhandle
Health District says there's no particular reason for the outbreak.
She says the illness tends to go in cycles. She says the best way to
prevent the disease is through immunization.

Children get a series of shots through infancy. But Taggart says kids
become more vulnerable as they age.

Cynthia Taggart: "Kids 11 and 12 need their booster. They need to be
revaccinated, even kids who have been vaccinated for pertussis. But
it wears off over time. And, you know, a lot of parents aren't aware
of that." Health officials like Taggart also encourage adults who
have contact with children to get a special pertussis booster.

Over the last several months, Fairfield Medical Center's Infection
Control Department has observed an increase in the number of
pertussis cases (also known as whooping cough) in the community. As
of July 2010, there have been 36 cases detected through the
laboratory at Fairfield Medical Center. Donna Hedges, Fairfield
Medical Center Infection Control Practitioner, said, "We have
maintained open communication with the Fairfield County Department of
Health, and they are actively monitoring and following up on all
reported cases."

"Compared to 2009, this is a significant increase in numbers. In
2009, the hospital detected 24 cases for the entire year, and, of
course, we are concerned, since we are only half way through this
year. In fact, this is very troubling to us; during the summer, we
don't normally see these high numbers," noted Dr. Andrew Murry,
Infectious Disease Physician at Fairfield Medical Center.

Due to this rise in the number of cases, for the upcoming 2010-2011
school year, Ohio law for immunizations needed to enter school has
been changed. New this year [2010], a booster dose of the Tdap
vaccine (providing protection against Tetanus, Diphtheria, and
Pertussis) is required for all students entering the 7th grade. The
Ohio Department of Health recently made this revision to the
immunization requirements for school attendance.

Dr. Murry commented: "We strongly urge parents to plan ahead and meet
this requirement as soon as possible. There are many opportunities to
receive this vaccination for the overall safety and well being of
children in our community."

The state recorded about 1500 cases through 13 Jul 2010, a 5-fold
increase over the same period in 2009. Six infants have died in the
recent outbreak. Yesterday, 22 Jul 2010, officials in Calaveras
County near Sacramento announced 3 new cases of the sometimes-deadly
illness.

Whooping cough (also known as pertussis) is a highly contagious
bacterial infection that attacks the respiratory system. The
infection is preventable by vaccination, which is why Calaveras
County Health Officer Dr. Dean Kelaita urged people, especially
expectant mothers and those with infants in their households, to get
immunized, according to the Record Net newspaper.

Still, 5 of the 6 infants who died in California were under 3 months
old, which is too young for immunization.

[4] California (July 2010 immunization recommendations)
Date: July 2010
Source: California Department of Public Health (CDPH) [edited]
<http://eziz.org/PDF/CDPH%20Pertussis%20Immunization%20Policy%20July%202010.pdf>


CDPH recommends that all patients indicated for immunization against
tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis be immunized with:

- DTaP if aged 6 weeks through 6 years; or
- Tdap if aged 7 years and older.

The only reasons not to provide Tdap are documentation of a prior
dose or a valid contraindication. Health care facilities and
providers should institute policies to achieve these recommendations.

CDPH recommends that all patients without documentation of full
immunization against pertussis be fully immunized at the earliest
opportunity, particularly:

- Women of childbearing age: CDPH recommends that all women of
childbearing age be vaccinated with Tdap, preferably before
pregnancy, but otherwise during or after pregnancy, although
pregnancy is not a contraindication to vaccination (1,4). The
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that unvaccinated
pregnant adolescents be given the same consideration for Tdap
vaccination as non-pregnant adolescents (1). The Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) prefers Tdap vaccination in the
immediate postpartum period (4). AAP, ACIP, and the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that, when given
during pregnancy, it is preferable to administer Tdap during the 2nd
or 3rd trimester to minimize the coincidental association of Tdap
vaccination with adverse outcomes, which occur most often during the
1st trimester (1,2,4,6).

- Other close contacts of infants: CDPH recommends that birth
hospitals and other immunizers provide Tdap to all close contacts of
infants without documentation of Tdap vaccination, especially parents
and childcare providers. Contacts should be immunized before mother
and baby are discharged after birth, regardless of when the contacts
received any prior doses of Td.

- Health care personnel: CDPH recommends that all health care
personnel, particularly those who have direct contact with infants
and pregnant women, be immunized with Tdap to protect their patients
and themselves. Effective 1 Sep 2010, the Cal/OSHA Aerosol
Transmissible Disease Standard requires all hospitals, outpatient
medical facilities, and other employers covered by the standard to
offer Tdap immunization to their employees who may be exposed to
pertussis. Employees who decline to be vaccinated must sign a
declination form.

- Patients with wounds: CDPH recommends that providers administer
Tdap (instead of Td or TT) whenever tetanus toxoid is indicated for
wound management in patients 7 years of age and older.

When the risk of contracting pertussis is elevated, as at present,
ACIP and AAP recommendations permit any interval between doses of Td
and Tdap. In contrast to the grave potential risks of susceptible
persons becoming infected and transmitting pertussis to vulnerable
infants, the most common adverse reaction to tetanus or diphtheria
vaccines is a local reaction at the injection site, which may be more
likely after an increased number of prior doses (9); however, recent
studies and reports suggest that doses of Tdap given after previous
Td or DTaP are well tolerated at intervals as brief as 1-18 months
(3,7,8). An undocumented history of immunization with Tdap or Td is
not a valid reason to avoid or delay administration of Tdap.

The only contraindications to immunization with Tdap, both rare, are:
- a documented history of anaphylaxis after receipt of Tdap, DTaP or
their ingredients; or
- encephalopathy occurring within 7 days after immunization against
pertussis that was not due to another identifiable cause (5,6).

Use beyond licensed age groups is permitted by law:
- 7-9 Years: CDPH recommends administration of Tdap to children 7
through 9 years of age whenever vaccination against tetanus,
diphtheria, or pertussis is indicated. Existing data suggest that the
use of Tdap at these ages is safe (7, 10); in Canada, Tdap is
licensed for persons 4 years of age and older.

- 65+ Years: CDPH recommends administration of Tdap to persons 65
years of age and older. Local and systemic events after Tdap
vaccination have been reported less frequently in adults less than 65
years than in adolescents (5,11). Published data on the safety and
vaccine efficacy of Tdap in persons 65 years and older are limited.
Even if the immunogenicity of Tdap is found to decline with age, any
additional protection provided could help to limit transmission and
protect the vulnerable.

Use of Tdap beyond licensed age groups may or may not be covered by
private insurers.

Pertussis (whooping cough) is highly contagious and is spread by
inhalation of respiratory droplets or aerosols. A high level of
community immunity is needed to reduce the incidence of pertussis,
but immunity from immunization or disease wanes over time. Most
children vaccinated for pertussis before kindergarten are susceptible
again by early adolescence.

Tdap immunization rates in adolescents and adults are currently low.
As a result, pertussis continues to circulate widely, resulting in
the hospitalization and death of young infants who are too young for
routine immunization with DTaP. As of 15 Jul 2010, there have been 5
reported 2010 infant deaths due to pertussis in California. Close
contacts, most often mothers, are the most common known source of
pertussis in infants (12). Thus, vaccinating household contacts,
health care personnel, and child care workers against pertussis is
recommended at least 2 weeks before their contact with young infants
(5,6). Increasing community immunity through widespread immunization
will also decrease the chances that vulnerable infants will be
exposed to pertussis. Immunization will also prevent debilitating
cases of pertussis in older children, adolescents, and adults.

[The enhanced recommendation of the use of Tdap is overdue for its
use in limiting the outbreaks of pertussis around the country. One
might also suggest that, for both health care workers and day care
workers involved in the care of not yet fully immunized infants,
immunization should be mandatory. Given the New York State experience
with health care workers, especially nurses, refusing mandatory
epidemic H1N1 vaccination, this may be difficult to enforce. Supreme
Court precedence, however, going back to 1905 (Jacobson v. State of
Massachusetts
<http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/vaccines/Jacobson_v_Massachusetts.htm>)
gives states the power to require vaccinations. - Mod.LL]
