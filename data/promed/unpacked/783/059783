Headlines
Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - One case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)
- Pakistan - One case of WPV1 and 6 WPV1-positive environmental samples
- Niger - One case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2)

Afghanistan
- One case of WPV1 was reported in the past week from Spin Boldak district in Kandahar province with onset of paralysis on [4 Jan 2019]. This is the 1st WPV1 case in 2019 in Afghanistan. The most recent environmental WPV1 positives in the country were collected on [6 Jan 2019] from Kandahar and Helmand provinces.
- Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.
- The Technical Advisory Group for polio eradication (TAG) met on [15-16 Jan 2019] to assess the progress made towards polio eradication in Afghanistan in 2018 and made recommendations for the way forward in 2019.

Pakistan
- One case of WPV1 was reported from Bajour Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Area, with onset of paralysis on [18 Jan 2019]. This is the 1st WPV1 case in 2019 in Pakistan.
- 6 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 2 from Lahore district and 1 from Faisalabad district in Punjab province, 1 each from Quetta and Killa Abdullah districts in Balochistan province, and 1 from DI Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The samples were collected from [1-18 Jan 2019].

Nigeria
- No cases of cVDPV2 this week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34. The most recent cVDPV2 case was reported from Baruten LGA in Kwara state, with onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018].
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states and to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- One case of cVDPV2 has been reported this week in Niger from Magaria district, Zinder province with the onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018]. It is the most recent cVDPV2 isolated in the country.
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018 through 5 Dec 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals are being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20.
- The most recent cVDPV2 AFP case was reported from Mufunga-Sampwe district in Haut Katanga province with onset of paralysis on [7 Oct 2018].
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga, Mongala, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5, type 2; 6, type 3; and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- The most recent cVDPV2 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected on [11 Oct 2018] from Waberi district in Banadir province. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was isolated from an environmental sample also from Waberi district, Banadir province collected on [23 Aug 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 was 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 years, due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis before the start of the comprehensive outbreak response.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week.
- 2 genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates were detected, from an AFP case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018], in a 6-year-old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambezia province), and one isolated from a community contact of the case reported on [10 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

[Well, this week's global update marks the beginning of officially reported cases with dates of onset of paralysis in 2019, confirming one case of WPV1 associated disease in each Afghanistan and Pakistan and one case of cVDPV2 (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus) associated disease in Niger.

Interpretation: There is still significant circulation of the WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and the cVDPVs are still circulating in Africa.

Health Director General (DG) Dr. Munir Ahmed on Friday [8 Feb 2019] confirmed the presence of poliovirus in Faisalabad. As per details, the samples collected from Achkera Pumping Station turned out to be positive for poliovirus.

The crippling virus has been reported in Lahore and Rawalpindi, and it was earlier detected in Faisalabad back in 2016. "An anti-polio drive will kick-off from [18 Feb 2019] in Faisalabad, Lahore and Rawalpindi to eradicate the crippling virus from the areas," Dr. Munir said. He appealed to parents to ensure the vaccination of their children against polio and save their future while also helping Pakistan to become a polio-free country.

On Thursday [7 Feb 2019], the Prime Minister's Focal Person for Polio Eradication Babar Bin Atta had confirmed that the 2nd polio case of the year [2019] had surfaced in Bannu, where a 2-year-old boy had been diagnosed with the crippling virus. He had said that Bannu was one of the areas where parents usually refused to have polio drops administered to their children.
