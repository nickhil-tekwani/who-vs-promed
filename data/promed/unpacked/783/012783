During the 1st 3 months of 2015, 20 cases [of syphilis] were reported to the Erie County [in the US state of Pennsylvania] Department of Health, said Charlotte Berringer, RN, director of community health for the Erie County Department of Health.

It's the most cases reported during a 3-month period since at least 1995 and more than any full year during that time except for 2014, when 22 cases were reported.

"It is a significant concern," said Berringer, who has issued a health advisory to county health-care providers about syphilis. "Syphilis is a disease that comes in waves and that's what is happening. Until recently, we were seeing between zero and 5 cases a year."

Berringer shared information and statistics about syphilis during Monday's [27 Apr 2015] Erie County Board of Health meeting. Erie County sees far fewer cases of syphilis than it does other sexually transmitted diseases [STDs] like chlamydia and gonorrhea, but syphilis is a concern because it can lead to paralysis, blindness, dementia, and death if left untreated. Most people with syphilis can be easily treated with antibiotics in the disease's early stages.

Adagio Health, Community Health Net, and the Health Department all provide free and confidential STD testing. Patients also can visit their family physician, Berringer said.

[The state of Pennsylvania can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3332545,8442. Erie County, with a population of 280 566 in 2010, is located in the northwest corner of US state of Pennsylvania on the shore of Lake Erie (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_County,_Pennsylvania). For a map of Pennsylvania, showing the location of Erie County, see http://geology.com/county-map/pennsylania-county-map.gif.

Please see the moderator's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on syphilis for discussions of this disease. The news report above says that there is a rise in the incidence of syphilis in Erie County, but does not indicate any characteristics of those with syphilis.

A detailed description of the cases in Erie County is essential so that efforts to limit potential spread of syphilis can be effectively targeted. More information in this regard from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML]
