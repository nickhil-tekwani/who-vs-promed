REPLY TO PROF. VANDEVELDE AND DR. DOHERR
I must respond to some statements in this reply to my article in New
Scientist of 12 June, "BSE's hidden horror".
1. I did not, as the authors state, indicate that the Swiss TSE reference
laboratory was part of the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office. Drs. Vandevelde
and Doherr state that the research I reported was contracted by the Swiss
government and submitted to the Federal Veterinary Office. Sadly, it is not
possible in a short news article to mention the names of everyone concerned
in a research project. It is customary to mention only the agency in
charge, in this case the Vet Office.
2. It is true that one error of fact entered the article, concerning which
researchers identified which infected animal. As Drs. Vandevelde and Doherr
point out, I said six of the eight positives were identified by their
immunohistochemistry, and eight by the Western blot technique of Prionics.
In fact Prionics identified only six of the eight positives; four animals
tested positive with both techniques. This imprecision was not the fault of
any scientists I spoke to.
I regret this error, of course. But I must emphasise that it in no way
alters the article's conclusions. Each test analyses a different tissue
sample, and as altered prion protein is not uniformly distributed in the
brain, it is to be expected that two different tests of one cow may give
different results. As was painstakingly explained to me by the scientists I
spoke to in preparing this article, the bottom line is that eight animals
tested positive. All the conclusions in the article stem from this result.
Drs. Vandevelde and Doherr emphasise the possibility of false positives.
But as has been pointed out by others, a false negative is at least as
likely as a false positive, and eight positives are at least as likely to
provide an underestimate as an overestimate of the true incidence of
subclinical infection in this sample.
Even if, as they suggest, I accept only five positive results as opposed to
eight, then 5/1761 gives a rate of "silent" BSE infection 67 times the
clinical incidence, as opposed to 107. The implications for public health
are little different. The main one, of course, is the need for more tests.
3. Drs. Vandevelde and Doherr discuss models of the predicted incidence of
preclinical BSE at length. I do not understand their criticism of my
article in this regard. Surely real results are always preferable to
models.
Such measurement is especially important given the assumptions on which the
models are based. These start with the observed clinical incidence of BSE,
and add an estimate of the incubation time, to arrive at the number of
animals which have not yet shown symptoms but are infected, and thus the
total number of infected animals at any time. As I understand it, two
things will cause this number to be too low: an underestimate of the
incubation time; and a substantial number of infected animals which do not
ever express BSE in the lifespans available to them, and hence the
existence of a large amount of infection not reflected in the clinical
incidence.
Incubation times may well be underestimates if they are based on the
earliest time before the onset of symptoms at which tests are sensitive
enough to detect infection, which could be well after the time of
infection. But it is the assumption, as Martin Hugh-Jones pointed out on
ProMED-mail, that "if they had not been slaughtered, some if not all would
have eventually demonstrated BSE" that is most crucial, as if they did not,
this would imply that there is some burden of infection not reflected by
clinical incidence.
There is reason to suspect that the animals which tested positive in this
survey would not have gone on to display symptoms in the time they would
have lived if there were no herd slaughter policy. As the Swiss Vet Office
reports, 97% of the 272 BSE cases in Switzerland were the only animals in
their herds to develop symptoms. Most occurred at a time when subsequent
incidence in their herds could have been observed, between the first Swiss
case in 1990, and the start of herd slaughtering in January 1997. The
animals surveyed in this study were all from herds in which one case had
appeared. The great rarity of second cases in affected herds would suggests
that at least some of these animals would not have gone on to display
clinical symptoms before they were slaughtered for the normal reasons.
Drs. Vandevelde and Doherr state that because researchers "have always
suspected a large number of preclinically infected animals" because of
modelling, they have instituted such safeguards as the slaughter of animals
older than 30 months. The British 30-month rule has never been empirically
tested by looking for infection before that age in apparently healthy herds
in Britain.
Obviously, it is of greatest priority to do such tests. This is why I
examined the implications IF this incidence IS confirmed more widely. It
was also important to make these results more widely available to the
scientific community than they were by the Swiss Veterinary Office. The
complete text of that report, contained almost at the end of "Fact Sheet:
BSE" on the Vet Office Web site, is:
"Altogether, 2800 animals on BSE farms have been killed, including 180
offspring... The offspring and other animals killed are being examined and
investigated in an attempt to give indications as to the origin of BSE and
the route of infection. The examination of the offspring showed no
indications of BSE. 6 of 1719 had changes showing that the animals were
affected with BSE. This result does not surprise as the animals belonged to
a high-risk population."
The 6 are presumably those detected by Drs. Vandevelde and Doherr. But 2800
minus 180 does not equal 1719, or even 1761. Are more results forthcoming?
4. The statement above that BSE herds are an unusually high-risk population
can be questioned. Drs. Vandevelde and Doherr say there is no
epidemiological evidence to suggest that the incidence of subclinical
infection may be similar in herds which have not had animals with clinical
symptoms. The scientists to whom I spoke in preparing this article
explained to me in great detail why they think there is. As noted, the vast
majority of BSE cases are the only ones in their herds. This means that the
next case of BSE is more likely to arise in an apparently unaffected herd
as in an affected one. Scientists to whom I spoke in preparing this article
therefore suspect that the incidence of subclinical infection in apparently
unaffected herds may be not much smaller than the incidence in affected
herds. But of course, it is necessary to do the work.
5. Drs. Vendevelde and Doherr accuse me of stating that the Prionics
western blot is more sensitive than their technique, and that the cases
were detected for the first time by Prionics. The article does not make
these statements.
6. The "extrapolation showing huge numbers of preclinically infected
animals for 1997 as done by D. MacKenzie" was not done by me. It was done,
as cited, by one of the scientists to whom I spoke, and subject to the
clear caveat that IF the incidence revealed by this study was paralleled in
the general population, THEN that would be that number of cases.
Apart from the imprecision concerning whose test got which result -- which
I of course regret -- my article reports the results and implications of an
important piece of science, for which the Swiss are to be congratulated. It
is to be hoped that other countries will soon do similar tests.
