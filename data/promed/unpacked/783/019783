2560 chikungunya cases in Tuticorin
-------------------------------------
As many as 2560 people have been affected by chikungunya viral fever
in the district in the recent months, official sources said here
yesterday [28 Sep 2006].
However, the figures could be higher as several people get treated at
private hospitals, unnoticed by the health department officials.
Necessary steps have been taken to prevent spread of the disease,
they said, adding the 1st case of chikungunya fever was reported in
Sattankulam area on 29 Apr [2006].

[Chikungunya fever continues to spread to new locations in India,
with a substantial number of cases. It will be interesting to see if
the necessary steps to prevent spread of the disease, mentioned
above, prove to be effective. Presumably, these steps are aimed at
reducing breeding sites of the chikungunya vectors, _Aedes_
mosquitoes -- not an easy task. A map of India can be accessed at:
