Vale das Princesas, in Miguel Pereira, is at the point of convergence of 2 of the most important areas of the Atlantic Forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, the forests of the Serras dos Orgãos and Tinguá. It is also one of the places in Brazil where the diseases of the forest and the countryside meet the urban environment, because it was one of the places where people contracted malaria caused by a parasite that was thought to be specific to monkeys. It is a new discovery of the disease along the 2nd largest metropolitan region of the country.

A malaria outbreak with 49 cases in Rio de Janeiro [state] municipalities, including the Serra do Mar forests, in 2015 and 2016 was caused by _Plasmodium simium_. [See the original post on the outbreak in PRO/PORT> Malaria - Brazil (02) (RJ), autochthonous, increase in the number of confirmed cases 20150304.3208643, http://www.promedmail.org/post/3208643. - Mod. RNA]. The geneticist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Mariano Zalis, a researcher at the University, was one of the lead authors of the discovery and a specialist in genetic sequencing of parasites [1].

Infected people had received confirmation of diagnosis with _Plasmodium vivax_, the most frequent in Brazil and endemic in the Amazon, which intrigued scientists.

The discovery that _P. simium_ monkey malaria can be transmitted by the mosquito to humans has implications for public health in the state and for controlling malaria in the country.

Zalis points out that although the risk of major outbreaks is small now, human cases of monkey malaria show that surveillance for infectious diseases needs to be rethought and intensified. Rio de Janeiro, and Brazil as a whole, have all the elements of risk, that is a large population and infestation by mosquitoes and nearby forests.

"You must always be alert. We do not believe it will trigger an epidemic now, but it's an alert. This _Plasmodium_ can adapt, as other pathogens have done. It did not become an epidemic, because _Plasmodium simium_ seems to not be competent to infect human beings. And it causes a milder infection. However, this is the 1st time it has been demonstrated at the molecular level that this form of monkey malaria can be transmitted to the mosquito and from it to humans. These people did not bring the disease out of Rio de Janeiro. The disease was already here in the state. For how long, we do not know."

Malaria had its transmission cycle in the state of Rio de Janeiro interrupted in 1968. The state, where the disease caused devastation until the 1st half of the 20th century, seemed free of one of its major scourges. Today, the Amazon region has around 99.5% of cases in Brazil.

However, malaria may never have actually gone away. Autochthonous cases (sourced locally) have been registered in Rio since 1993. Autochthonous cases of malaria have also been reported in the last decades in Santa Catarina. From 2006 to 2014, 61 cases were reported in the state of Rio.

Zalis explains that it was necessary to do a refined molecular analysis to identify the parasite. In 2015, there were 33, and 16 in 2016. There were cases in Guapimirim, Petrópolis, Nova Friburgo (Lumiar) and Macaé (Sana).

_Plasmodium simium_ is very similar to _Plamodium vivax_. Only molecular analysis will distinguish the 2 and verify that _P. simium_ was the cause of the disease. It has also been identified in forest monkeys in Rio State. But we do not know the extent of the infection in mosquitoes _Anopheles_ (the malaria transmitters), common in forest areas, and in monkeys, or whether there are asymptomatic people living near the forest regions.

An article about the discovery is being prepared by researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), and other Brazilian and foreign institutions.

[If further studies show that infection with _Plasmodium simium_ is indeed common, perhaps _P. simium_ should be considered a human parasite just as _Plasmodium knowlesi_ is now regarded to be a human parasite. Also, for _P. knowlesi_, it was genetic analysis that showed that what was previously thought to be _P. malariae_ was indeed _P. knowlesi_.

Based on the finding described here, larger genetic studies of presumed _P. vivax_ in Brazil are needed. ProMED will be happy to post more information on simian malaria in Brazil. - Mod.EP
