A Comment on the Efficiency of Cleaning Agents
----------------------------------------------
I wonder how often the use of ineffective cleaning agents contributes
to the spread of norovirus outbreaks in institutions? We have
encountered this problem many times in long-term care facilities and
other institutions.
Noroviruses are notoriously resistant to many cleaning agents such as
the quaternary ammonium products commonly used in long-term care
facilities. Yet, the staff tend to be very resistant to using more
effective chlorine products and other effective products that tend to
be more expensive.
The result is that most cleaning serves only to transfer the virus
from surface to surface throughout the institution. Fortunately we
are starting to make some headway with this challenge. A recent
summary about norovirus infection in healthcare facilities prepared
by CDC (Norovirus in Healthcare Facilities, Released 21 Apr 2005) has
been very helpful.

Strict attention to efficient disinfection procedures has allowed
norovirus-affected cruise ships to be cleaned and turned around
within 48 hours. For example, see "CDC. Vessel Sanitation Program
Operations Manual 2000. Atlanta, Georgia: U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, CDC, 2000". - Mod.CP]
