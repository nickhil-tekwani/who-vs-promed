A new strain of group A streptococcus [also called GAS or _Streptococcus pyogenes_], which is able to produce significantly more toxin, is spreading in England and Wales, scientists say.

Strep A causes a range of infections, from a sore throat to scarlet fever. The new strain's emergence, reported in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [1], coincides with a rise in rare but potentially deadly invasive infections. However, it does not explain the mysterious surge in scarlet fever cases during the past 5 years. And there is no direct evidence the new strain causes more serious infection than other strains, experts say.

Scarlet fever is a very contagious infection that mostly affects young children. The number of children with scarlet fever soared in 2014, and 2 years later there was an increase in cases of invasive strep A, where the bug penetrates deeper into the body and causes problems such as sepsis (blood poisoning). The latest figures showed there were 1500 invasive cases in England in 2018-2019 -- 8% higher than the average for the previous 5 years.

A team from Imperial College London analysed the DNA, or genetic code, of stored strep A samples from patients to see if a change in the bacterium could explain the rise. Strep A is made up of several "families" known as emm-types. Emm1 has been linked to invasive cases in the past, and the study showed it had mutated to form the new strain. "We found no trace of it in the UK until about 2010," one of the researchers, Prof. Shiranee Sriskandan, told BBC News. "And it took off between 2011 and 2013, so that by 2016 it represented 80% of emm1 strains -- it's taken over its own family."

The mutated strain is able to produce 9 times more toxin (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A) than the previous version. This is the toxin that actually causes the symptoms of scarlet fever -- flu-like symptoms, sore throat, swollen glands and a rash.

However, Prof. Sriskandan told BBC News: "This study doesn't offer any answers to why scarlet fever came back in 2014." There is also no evidence, she says, that the toxin is causing the invasive cases of the disease.

The new strain has largely been confined to the UK. There has been one case in Denmark and another in the US.

"It's important because although invasive disease is very rare due to strep A, it has quite a substantial impact on the people it affects," said Prof. Sriskandan. "Mortality from invasive disease is between 15% and 20% -- these are very high mortality rates."

Scarlet fever -- because it is easily noticed and cases have to be reported to Public Health England -- is a good indicator of how much strep A is circulating. In the past 5 years, England has seen the biggest surge in scarlet fever since the 1960s. In 2013 there were about 4000 cases, reaching 15 000 in 2014 and 19 000 in 2016. The number of cases is now coming down again but remains relatively high.

Prof. Mark Walker, from the University of Queensland, in Australia, said: "An unprecedented global resurgence of scarlet fever and severe invasive group A streptococcal infections has been seen in the past few decades." China, South Korea and Hong Kong have all recorded similar spikes in cases, and Prof. Walker said there was an "essential need" to monitor group A strep infections around the world. "The report sends out an important warning [that] recently emerging scarlet fever group A strep strains have enhanced invasive potential which may have profound implications for the future," he said.

Prof. Jimmy Whitworth from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: "This important study gives us a plausible clue to the worrying recent increase in cases of scarlet fever in children in England. "A spokeswoman from Public Health England said: "Despite the rise in scarlet fever cases over the last 5 years, it remains a typically mild illness, readily treatable with antibiotics to reduce the risk of complications and spread to others. We remind parents to be aware of the symptoms of scarlet fever and to contact their GP for assessment if they think their child might have it."

NHS Mid Essex CCG [National Health Service Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, which is responsible for delivery of NHS services in mid Essex in the districts of Maldon, Braintree and the City of Chelmsford; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_commissioning_group] have confirmed that a 14th person has died linked to the _Streptococcus_ (iGAS) [invasive GAS] bacteria outbreak in Essex.

An NHS spokesperson said: "Following regular communications with the patients and their families affected by this outbreak, we have been informed that a patient in mid Essex who had previously been treated for iGAS earlier in the year [2019] has sadly died. We are reporting this retrospectively having completed investigations to conclude that their death is linked to this outbreak. To protect patient confidentiality we are unable to confirm when they had iGAS or when they passed away. Our thoughts are with their family."

Group A strep can cause infections, which range from minor illnesses to very serious and deadly diseases. It can be found in the throat and on the skin, and people may carry Group A streptococci in the throat or on the skin and have no symptoms of illness. It is spread between people through sneezing, kissing and skin contact. Sometimes life-threatening GAS disease may occur when bacteria get into parts of the body where bacteria usually are not found, such as the blood, muscle, or the lungs. These infections are termed invasive Group A Streptococcal (iGAS) disease.

Over the past 3 months, 13 other patients who have been treated in Essex have also died from the outbreak. A total of 37 people were affected overall. Most of those infected have been from Braintree and the surrounding area, although some sufferers have been from Chelmsford and Maldon.

[The summary of the journal article referenced in the 1st news report above is extracted below. The full article is available at https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext.

"Background
---------------
Since 2014, England has seen increased scarlet fever activity unprecedented in modern times. In 2016, England's scarlet fever seasonal rise coincided with an unexpected elevation in invasive _Streptococcus pyogenes_ infections. We describe the molecular epidemiological investigation of these events.

"Methods
-----------
We analysed changes in _S. pyogenes_ emm genotypes, and notifications of scarlet fever and invasive disease in 2014-2016 using regional (northwest London) and national (England and Wales) data. Genomes of 135 non-invasive and 552 invasive emm1 isolates from 2009-2016 were analysed and compared with 2800 global emm1 sequences. Transcript and protein expression of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA; also known as scarlet fever or erythrogenic toxin A) in sequenced, non-invasive emm1 isolates was quantified by real-time PCR and western blot analyses.

"Findings
-----------
Coincident with national increases in scarlet fever and invasive disease notifications, emm1 _S. pyogenes_ upper respiratory tract isolates increased significantly in northwest London in the March to May period, from 5 (5%) of 96 isolates in 2014, to 28 (19%) of 147 isolates in 2015 (p = 0.0021 vs 2014 values), to 47 (33%) of 144 in 2016 (p = 0.0080 vs 2015 values). Similarly, invasive emm1 isolates collected nationally in the same period increased from 183 (31%) of 587 in 2015 to 267 (42%) of 637 in 2016 (p less than 0.0001). Sequences of emm1 isolates from 2009-2016 showed emergence of a new emm1 lineage (designated M1UK) -- with overlap of pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and invasive M1UK strains -- which could be genotypically distinguished from pandemic emm1 isolates (M1global) by 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Median SpeA protein concentration in supernatant was 9 times higher among M1UK isolates (190.2 ng/mL [IQR 168.9-200.4]; n = 10) than M1global isolates (20.9 ng/mL [0.0-27.3]; n = 10; p less than 0.0001). M1UK expanded nationally to represent 252 (84%) of all 299 emm1 genomes in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis of published datasets identified single M1UK isolates in Denmark and the USA.

"Interpretation
-----------------
A dominant new emm1 _S. pyogenes_ lineage characterised by increased SpeA production has emerged during increased _S. pyogenes_ activity in England. The expanded reservoir of M1UK and recognised invasive potential of emm1 _S. pyogenes_ provide plausible explanation for the increased incidence of invasive disease, and rationale for global surveillance."

ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports since 2013 on outbreaks of scarlet fever, a noninvasive form of group A streptococcus (GAS) disease, throughout England and Wales (See Also's below). ProMED-mail also posted reports of an outbreak of invasive GAS infection since February 2019 that is occurring in Essex, a county in southeast England (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex). Cases are occurring mainly in the Essex districts of Braintree, with smaller numbers in Maldon and Chelmsford and with a few cases in other Essex districts. See ProMED-mail posts Streptococcus, group A, invasive - UK (02): (England) fatal, WGS 20190807.6611267 and Streptococcus, group A, invasive - UK: (England) fatal, RFI 20190628.6542184. One of these news reports (archive 20190807.6611267) said that whole genome sequencing of the clinical isolates of invasive GAS had identified an outbreak strain that linked cases occurring in Essex.

The 1st news report above says that one particular emm type of GAS, emm1, has become increasing common among isolates from both noninvasive and invasive GAS disease in England and Wales over the past several years and that whole genome sequencing of emm1 isolates identified an outbreak strain, called M1UK, that by 2016 accounted for about 84% of emm1 strains. M1UK was also found to produce 9 times more toxin that is responsible for the characteristic rash in scarlet fever.

A map of England showing the location of Essex can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex, and a map of Essex showing the location of its districts can be found at https://www.mapsofworld.com/england/counties/essex-map.html; according to this map, Braintree and Chelmsford appear to be located in mid Essex and Maldon in east Essex. - Mod.ML
