Clemson Livestock and Poultry Health (CLPH) officials are warning horse owners that eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) has been found in Colleton and Jasper counties.

Clemson confirmed on 25 Aug 2020 that 2 cases of horses with EEE have been found: a 4-year-old paint mare in Colleton and a 2-year-old paint colt in Jasper County. Both horses had to be euthanized.

EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-transmitted diseases in the US. The virus spreads from wild birds to mosquitos, which then pass the virus to humans, horses, and other birds.

The virus is the cause of brain infections (encephalitis) in people, horses, and other mammals.

Symptoms in people include
- high fever
- severe headache
- tiredness
- nausea/vomiting
- neck stiffness
- fever
- chills
- disorientation

Seizures and coma are possible thereafter.

There is no treatment, and infection is fatal in about 1/3 of patients. People over the age of 50 and younger than age 15 are at greatest risk for developing severe disease when infected.

Signs in horses include
- fever
- sleepy appearance
- muscle twitches in neck, flank, and shoulders
- weak, staggering gait
- animals that are down, unable to stand

There is no effective treatment. However, the disease can be prevented in horses with a twice-yearly vaccination.

Tips for human prevention
- Use insect repellent to avoid mosquito bites, especially from dusk to dawn. Look for active ingredients in the repellent such as DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
- Reapply repellent when needed and often.
- Mosquito-proof your home and yard by using window or door screens and eliminating any containers with standing water where the insects lay eggs.
- Protect your horses by having them vaccinated every 6 months. [The immunity wanes fast, within about 4 months. Revaccination at 4 months may be better depending upon your location. - Mod.TG]
- Drain water troughs and empty buckets weekly and remove standing water.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae or use mosquito "dunks" (solid doughnuts of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware or feed stores.
- Clean gutters and remove leaf debris from yard.

Contact Colleton County Animal Services for mosquito abatement and leave a message. Within 2 days, the abatement team will spray in front of your home.

According to Laura Clark, director of Colleton County Animal Services, trucks can spray in the driveway or in front of a home but cannot go into yards or fields. They will come at night when residents are likely to be in the house and not in the yard. They will not come if there is wind or if a beekeeper lives nearby. (New beekeepers should contact Animal Services to protect their hives.)

North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDACS) officials have confirmed a Camden County mare's clinical signs and serology (blood serum) results are consistent with a presumptive diagnosis of EEE and/or West Nile virus (WNV). The 10-year-old mare was unvaccinated for either disease.

EEE 101
Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes feeding on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases
- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the US. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

A horse in Taylor County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), according to the Taylor County Health Department.

The EEE virus is spread to humans, horses, and other animals through infected mosquitoes. The 1st confirmed human case of EEE this year [2020] happened in Eau Claire County this month [September 2020].

Signs of EEE in humans include fever, headache, chills, and vomiting, although many people may not get sick when infected with EEE. Signs of EEE in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death.

Taylor County residents are asked to be vigilant in preventing mosquito bites, as EEE is known to be currently circulating in Taylor County.

A horse has died from the mosquito-borne disease eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Barry County, health officials say.

The Barry-Eaton District Health Department was notified of the horse's death on [Thu 3 Sep 2020] according to a news release issued Friday [4 Sep 2020] by the health department. This is the 1st confirmed animal case of EEE in Barry County this year [2020], further expanding the geographic area where EEE has been found.

Health officials have not confirmed any other animal or human cases of the disease in Barry or Eaton County at this time.

The horse in Barry County marks the 13th confirmed case of EEE in horses across 5 Michigan counties to date. So far, horses with EEE have been identified in Clare, Kent, Newaygo, and Montcalm counties.

Health officials said people living in or visiting Barry or Eaton counties should take precautions against mosquito bites because of the prevalence of EEE-carrying mosquitoes this time of year. The mosquito-borne disease cannot be spread between animals or between animals and humans, but humans can get EEE through the bite of an infected mosquito, health officials said.

Most cases of EEE in humans do not cause any symptoms, health officials said. Less than 1% of humans with EEE develop serious illness, but more serious illness can cause swelling of the brain, according to the release.

Anyone can be affected by EEE, but people over the age of 60 and under age 15 are at greatest risk for developing more severe symptoms, the release said.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development recommends that people get their domestic horses vaccinated. Horse owners can report signs of EEE in their horses at https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ORS/Home.

[Posting all of these cases of EEE is really sad. People have not heeded the warnings of those in public health. When the mosquitos were testing positive for EEE, people should have been vaccinating the horses.

Even if the cities/counties/parishes were not testing the mosquitoes, vaccines to protect your horse is part of the responsibility of owning and caring for animals.

Please get your animal vaccinated. It is not too late, as this could be a long EEE season. Please use sprays/repellents against flies/mosquitoes approved for horses. Keep fans running in the barn to discourage mosquitoes and flies. - Mod.TG
