A Toronto area woman, in her late 30s and originally from India, contracted
malaria from a local mosquito in what doctors say is the first such
infection found in Canada in modern time. Dr. Kevin Kain, Director of the
Toronto Hospitals tropical disease unit said that, "Mosquitoes in southern
Ontario can transmit malaria - all they need is some opportunity."
He also said that the woman had not left Canada in almost a decade but
acquired malaria last summer. He suggested that she got the disease from a
local mosquito that had picked up the parasite by feeding on someone
recently arrived from a malaria-infested area.
The article reported that Kain said there have been cases of "airport
malaria" reported in medical journals, in which parasite-carrying
mosquitoes hitched a ride from the Third World on an airliner or cargo
plane. But that's probably not what happened in the Toronto case.
Malaria is also known to recur in people who have had an earlier bout of
the disease, but the longest such relapse recorded occurred five years
after an initial malaria infection. The patient has never previously been
infected. Through the process of elimination, doctors concluded the woman
most likely acquired the disease from a local mosquito.
Kain went on to say, "It's never been reported in Canada before, but in the
United States, in the last 20 years, there have been 80 cases of people who
got malaria without ever having left the U.S." He also stated that such
transmission remains rare, but record numbers of people are coming into the
country with malaria, with Canada experiencing more than 700 known cases
last year.
