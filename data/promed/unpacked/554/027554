Danish pork replaced travel abroad as the main source of _Salmonella_ infections in 2020, according to figures from the Technical University of Denmark's National Food Institute. Danes traveled far less this past year because of COVID-19 restrictions, so going abroad was linked to just less than 20% of 614 _Salmonella_ cases. Normally, about half of registered infections are travel related.

Danish pork was estimated to have caused 22% of illnesses, followed by imported pork and duck meat with 9% and 6% of cases, respectively. A data management issue prevented the statistics being published earlier in 2021 at the same time as the 2020 zoonoses report.

A direct comparison of figures shows a large increase in the number of _Salmonella_ cases caused by Danish pork from 8% in 2019 to 22% in 2020. However, the primary reason for this is the drop in travel-related cases from 419 to 111 between 2019 and 2020. The actual rise in cases attributed to Danish pork is much smaller. Of 562 _Salmonella_ isolates from the 614 infections, 462 cases were sporadic and 100 were associated with 10 outbreaks, including 25 as part of an international event. Sporadic cases included 111 travel-related, 220 domestic and 141 with unknown travel history. Overall, 140 of the 562 cases were attributed to Danish-produced food, 94 to imported food and 127 to unknown sources.

A total of 35 outbreaks were registered in 2020 compared with 51 in the previous year [2019]. The number of people affected was 1190 with an average of 34 per outbreak and a range of 2 to 200. More than 1900 people were sick in 2019. The number of _Salmonella_ outbreaks was stable with 10 compared to 9 in 2019. Five were caused by _Salmonella_ Typhimurium or its monophasic variant, but sources were not found.

The largest national outbreak was because of _Salmonella_ Strathcona with 25 cases from May to July 2020. Imported tomatoes were suspected to be the cause. An outbreak of _Salmonella_ Kottbus occurred in a restaurant in Copenhagen in June 2020. Of 36 patients, 14 were lab-confirmed. Pea pur√©e was the likely source because of cross-contamination and inadequate temperature control on a hot summer day.
