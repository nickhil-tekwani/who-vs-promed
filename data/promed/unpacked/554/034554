With confirmed and suspected cases of mumps on the rise in Maine --
including a suspected case in an employee at Eastern Maine Medical Center
in Bangor -- and a much more serious outbreak just across the border in
Canada, Maine's chief public health officer on Monday [19 Nov 2007] issued
updated recommendations for vaccination against the potentially serious
illness. "Because this outbreak [in Maine] has spread, we are updating
vaccination recommendations, especially among children, college and
university students and hospital workers," said Dr Dora Anne Mills, head of
the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Because of the
environments where they live and work, such individuals are most likely to
contract and spread the virus, Mills said.

Since September [2007], 7 cases of mumps have been confirmed in southern
and central Maine, 4 of them in November 2007 alone. The state is awaiting
the results of lab tests on as many as 24 more suspected cases, according
to the Maine CDC. The age of the sickened individuals ranges from the late
teens to the late 50s. While the number of cases in Maine may seem
insignificant, more than 900 individuals in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,
mostly college students, have been sickened with mumps since last winter
[2006-2007].

On Monday [19 Nov 2007], a housekeeper at EMMC was given a preliminary
diagnosis of mumps pending confirmation by laboratory testing. Donna
Dunton, director of infection control at EMMC, confirmed on Monday evening
that the housekeeper has been asked to stay out of work until lab reports
of her mumps-like symptoms are complete. The employee is not thought to
have been in close enough contact with any patients to have spread the
virus, Dunton stressed, and routine infection control measures such as hand
washing are likely to have minimized the possibility of transmission.

Mumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms typically
include fever, headache, muscle ache, and swelling and tenderness of the
glands at the corner of the jaw. Symptoms may last 7 to 10 days, and
infected individuals are contagious for at least 3 days before becoming ill
and as long as 9 days after symptoms appear. Infection occurs through
direct contact with respiratory droplets from the nose or throat, through
saliva, coughing, sneezing, sharing drinks, kissing or from contact with
any surface that has been contaminated with the virus. Rarely, mumps
infection can lead to meningitis, inflammation of the testicles or ovaries,
inflammation of the pancreas, and temporary or permanent hearing loss.

"Although mumps is a virus and is not treatable with antibiotics, the good
news is that mumps can be prevented or its impact reduced with vaccine,"
Mills said. The MMR vaccine -- which protects against mumps, measles and
rubella, or "German measles" -- is the most common vaccine used to protect
against mumps.

The Maine CDC's updated guidelines are as follows:
- For students in kindergarten through 12th grade, all vaccine records
should be reviewed and updated. For any students who are not current with
their MMR vaccines, a letter should be given to the parents notifying them
of the mumps outbreak and informing them that if their child remains
unimmunized and the infection is detected in their school, their child will
be excluded from school for at least 18 days.
- For college and university students, all vaccine records should be
reviewed and updated. All students should have documentation of 2 doses of
MMR rather than the previously required one dose. Most students will have
had 2 doses as part of their routine childhood vaccinations, but older
"nontraditional" students may be lacking the 2nd dose.
- Hospital health care workers with direct patient contact should have
their vaccine records reviewed and updated.

Adequate mumps vaccination for those born in 1957 or later now consists of
2 doses of MMR rather than the previously required one dose. Adequate mumps
vaccination for those born before 1957 now consists of one dose of MMR,
rather than no doses, as previously required.

Besides the additional vaccinations, the Maine CDC also recommends that
individuals who become infected should be isolated for 9 days after the
onset of illness. Those who are not immunized and who are exposed should be
isolated for about 18 days after the last known exposure.

Mills acknowledged that compliance with these recommendations may be
financially and logistically burdensome for some individuals, institutions
and families. The average cost of a mumps vaccine is about USD 45, she
said, but the state is trying to secure supplies of lower-cost vaccine. The
Maine CDC can assist institutions with the process of reviewing records,
setting up vaccine clinics and obtaining vaccine supplies, she said.

Mills added that the new recommendations are likely to be upgraded to
requirements through departmental rule-making in the near future. "While
there is no apparent direct connection between people in Maine with
confirmed infection and the current outbreak in Canada, it is not
surprising that a border state like Maine would see an outbreak," Mills said.

A student health official at the University of Maine was unavailable Monday
[19 Nov 2007] to comment on how the new recommendations might affect the
Orono campus.

At EMMC, Dunton said employee charts have been under review for several
months in response to changes in vaccine recommendations from the Maine CDC
issued earlier this year [2007]. Monday's [19 Nov 2007] announcement, she
said, is likely to "step up the pace" of that review, and many employees
are likely to be asked to roll up their sleeves.

[For further information, visit the state of Maine's website at
<http://www.mainepublichealth.gov>. The state of Maine's response to the
occurrence of sporadic cases of mumps is prudent in view of the proximity
of the state to the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,
which are experiencing substantial outbreaks of mumps infection in young
adults and older children (see ProMED-mail references below). The words of
the director of the Maine CDC are well chosen: "While there is no apparent
direct connection between people in Maine with confirmed infection and the
current outbreak in Canada, it is not surprising that a border state like
Maine would see an outbreak." - Mod.CP]
