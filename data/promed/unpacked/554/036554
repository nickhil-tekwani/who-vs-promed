The annual recurring summer season (pre-monsoon rains) outbreaks of acute central nervous system disease in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, during Litchi [lychee] harvesting season, is quite different from other outbreaks that occur in other parts of Bihar and elsewhere in India post-summer (during and after monsoon rains). This year [2014], the outbreak began in the 1st week of June 2014 and has affected a very large number of children.

Typically, a child is found either unconscious or with seizures early in the morning. The cerebrospinal fluid is clear without inflammatory cell response (less than 5 cells per cubic mm). "CSF gushes out," said one pediatrician, indicating brain edema. The moderator's observation of similarity with Reye syndrome is correct. Individually, each child fits with Reye syndrome diagnosis.

The special feature here are the large numbers of children getting Reye-like encephalopathy in a short period of time (2 months). It is this phenomenon of clustering that fooled people to think of an outbreak due to some infection, hence encephalitis, virus unknown, hence acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). That mistake continued until 2013 when I was invited by the Bihar government to assist. Once I saw cases and made the diagnosis, things have changed rapidly, but unlearning old lessons is difficult for many. There is only so much one individual can do, but I am grateful to the Bihar government for the invitation. In India, there is lack of clarity as to which government -- State or Federal -- is in charge of outbreaks. I am helping the Bihar State government, while the Federal government had been sending various teams during the past many years. Why they do not work with me in cooperation is not known.

I have strongly recommended that the term AES be abandoned, as it is useless and harmful. The Muzaffarpur disease is a form of acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy. I had personally taken classes to the pediatricians of both the hospitals in Muzaffarpur and all Medical Officers of Primary Health Centers (PHC) prior to this year's [2014] expected outbreak and requested them to do lumbar puncture on every child to make sure we do not miss an occasional meningitis or encephalitis. (Among children admitted to the "encephalitis ward," I saw some with bacterial meningitis that would have been clubbed with the outbreak cases).

Secondly every child's blood glucose level must be tested and every child given 10 percent dextrose even before blood glucose value is available. This year [2014] (I am just back from Muzaffarpur), I can confirm that the disease is undoubtedly hypoglycemic encephalopathy (with blood glucose levels below 40 in about half the children in whom testing was done), and lower than 80 in 80-85 percent. The lesson was to give 10 percent dextrose infusion as soon as possible after drawing blood for glucose measurement. Pediatricians who did these tell me that children given 10 percent dextrose within a short period of onset tend to recover within a few hours and are well to go home the next day.

The instruction from the government so far has been to transport children from villages to the tertiary care hospitals in the city. This results in delays of a few hours. A few days ago, one PHC Medical Officer saw a child at around 7:30 AM, within a half hour of onset, and after taking blood for glucose measurement, infused 10 percent dextrose. Within a half hour, the child sat up with open eyes to the delight of everyone. Blood sugar value was 30 mg [/dL]. So I am advising that PHCs should be made ready for treating these children, and only those who really need more tests or treatment need be referred out.

I have tried hard to obtain a few liver biopsies to look for microvesicular fat inclusion bodies but have failed. In the 2015 season, I hope I will succeed. I understand the difficulties the local pediatricians face. They work really hard, and some feel very upset about so many sick children being hospitalised and many dying. They do not get additional hands to deal with the workload. Then, other investigators come and tell them this is viral encephalitis and keep collecting CSF and serum samples for virology. The public is told that the cases are encephalitis; some even say Japanese encephalitis (and JE vaccination is demanded and is being provided); others still call this AES. Sane voices are crowded out by such cacophony. My hand extended to CDC has not been reciprocated.

What causes Muzaffarpur outbreaks of Reye syndrome (or hypoglycemic encephalopathy)? I know of 3 suggestions: One, heat encephalopathy. Certainly, the disease occurs in the height of summer, but the age distribution (all under 10 years) and the early morning onset are against heat disease. In Bangladesh, where litchi-associated encephalopathy has been reported, the suspicion was that organo-chlorine pesticides may be the cause. This line will be explored by my colleagues in Muzaffarpur. The 3rd possibility is litchi-seed-associated methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), and this will also be investigated by my colleagues in future (Ref: John TJ, Das M. Current Science 2014; 106: 1184-1185).

Hope these details will clarify the Muzaffarpur situation.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. John for his comments. He suspects, as we did, that a Reye-like syndrome is the likely diagnosis in this outbreak in children in Muzaffarpur (see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Japanese encephalitis and other - India (08): (BR) 20140623.2558283).

In 1963, Reye and co-workers reported their clinical and pathological observations in 21 children with encephalopathy and fatty change in viscera (Reye RD, Morgan G, Baral J. Encephalopathy and fatty degeneration of the viscera. A Disease entity in childhood." Lancet 1963;2 (7311): 749-52. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(63)90554-3. PMID 14055046). The illness usually begins as a non-specific febrile syndrome that is then followed by profuse vomiting, altered mental status, convulsions, coma, and death. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level) occurs in most cases, accompanied by elevation of blood transaminase and ammonia levels with an acute non-inflammatory encephalopathy, cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and fatty degeneration in the liver and kidneys. The pathogenesis of Reye syndrome appears to involve mitochondrial injury.

Most cases of Reye syndrome were associated with use of aspirin during the illness. In the United States, Reye syndrome became a reportable disease in 1973, and the government began issuing warnings about the association between this syndrome and aspirin. A dramatic decrease in the use of aspirin among children then was followed by a marked decrease in incidence of Reye's syndrome. However, other drugs and mitochondrial toxins (e.g., insecticides) may also be associated with Reye-like syndrome. Several plant species contain substances that have hypoglycemic potential, e.g., the toxin hypoglycin A, which is present in unripened fruit of the ackee tree, can cause Jamaican vomiting sickness (Barceloux DG. Akee fruit and Jamaican vomiting sickness (Blighia sapida Koenig). Dis Mon. Jun 2009;55(6):318-26).

As mentioned by Dr. John, the current outbreak in Muzaffarpur has been attributed by some to consumption of litchi (AKA lychee) fruit (http://zeenews.india.com/news/health/health-news/litchi-virus-causing-acute-encephalitis-syndrome_28452.html). Although this news article attributed the illness to a "litchi virus," lychee seeds have been found to contain a toxic substance alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl) glycine that can induce hypoglycemia in experimental animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1243468/?page=1). - Mod.ML]

[It is worth having a look at Dr. Lloyd Olson's comments (archive no. 20131011.1995836). He noted: "In the province of Udorn, northeastern Thailand, of 3000 children admitted to the provincial hospital during 1969, we observed at least 83 children with the clinical features of acute encephalopathy (Pediatrics 1971; 47: 707-16). 46 died, all within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. The disease was characterized by the sudden onset of fever, vomiting, and headaches progressing to seizures and coma. Almost all children were less than 6 years of age, and the majority of cases occurred during the late rainy season (August to October). This area is also endemic for JEV, and without autopsy and laboratory data, it would have been easy to confuse this syndrome with acute infection."

Curiously, the Udorn encephalopathy outbreak ended by the 1980s and never returned, whereas the Bihar cases recur year after year. Dr. Olson also indicated that there was a possibility of aflatoxin involvement. Mod.ML added that contamination of food by aflatoxin has been postulated as another cause of Reye-like syndrome. In any event, given Olson's and Jacob John's assessments, Japanese encephalitis seems to be ruled out in these early season cases. - Mod.TY
