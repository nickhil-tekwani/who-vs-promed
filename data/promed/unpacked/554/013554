Referring to G.Donegan's report on a patient who died 4 days after the bite
from [a sick flying fox and stated that it was unlikely that death was
associated with lyssavirus, I would like to share my experience on the
following:
1. Incubation periods of rabies of genotype 1 such as canine-associated
variants may be shorter than 9 days. It may be partly explained by direct
inoculation into the nerve plexus or peripheral nerve. There is no need for
virus to multiply locally in the muscle cells. We had a patient with dog
bite to brachial plexus with IP of 5 days.
2. Once symptoms appear, the survival period may be as short as 1-2 days. A
case of rabies (dog bite) admitted to Chulalongkorn University Hospital in
April 97 presented with bizarre manifestations of ocular myoclonus and
hemichorea died very rapidly due to cardiac arrest. Further, my most recent
case 2 weeks ago died within 24 hours also due to arrhythmia. Therefore, it
is the cardiovascular complications that determine the survival period i.e.
how fast the virus can go to the heart (SA node etc.) and how fast it can
elicit myocarditis.
3. Australian lyssavirus of genotype 7? may differ from genotype 1 (in dogs)
in the sense that it may effectively replicate in the skin and dermis
cells, therefore the route of spreading and clinical behavior may not be the
same as what we have seen in genotype 1. Silver-haired bat rabies variant
in the U.S. share this property (Morimoto et al. Proc Natl Acad Aci USA
1996;93:5653-8).
4. Routine autopsy may not detect rabies virus negri body. In our August 97
paralytic rabies patients, Negri bodys (atypical appearance)can be found
just only in 1 out of 20 regions of brain, brainstem and spinal cord, but
this is easily demonstrated in all regions by immunohistochemistry.
5. Classic clinical presentations of furious and dumb rabies may not be
applied in the cases associated with bat rabies variants. Moreover, we here
in Thailand started to worry that we are having variants other than those
associated with dogs since we have seen, this year, rabies patients with
atypical clinical manifestations (such as above example with ocular
myoclonus), very short survival periods, and with almost absence of Negri
bodies.
