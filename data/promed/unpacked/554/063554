Babita, Anima Xess, Namrata Kumari, Shivendra Kumar Shahi, Sanjeev Suman. Seroprevalence of dengue in Bihar: a hospital based study. Journal of Evolution of Medical and Dental Sciences 2013, l2(27): 5047-5048.

Dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is an emergent disease in India. It is endemic in some parts of the country and contributes annual outbreaks of dengue. It is a vector borne disease transmitted mainly by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. This study was done in a hospital, Patna [Bihar state] on 123 patients who were admitted with symptoms of fever, myalgia, headache, retro orbital pain, bleeding, body pain, vomiting, abdominal pain during the period of September 2010 to January 2011. They were tested by dengue NSI Ag and Ab combe card method. Out of 123 patients, 34 (28 per cent) were positive for dengue; 13 (38 per cent) were reactive for antigen; 5 (14.7 per cent) were reactive only for IgM antibody and 8 (24 per cent) were reactive only of IgG antibody. But 21 (62 per cent) were reactive for both IgG and IgM antibody. The platelet count varied from 34 000 to 280 000 per cumm (Mean 85 000/cumm).

The epidemic affected males and females at ratio of 2:1. Majority of the patients (65 per cent) were found belonging to the age group more than 25 years. Maximum numbers of patients were admitted during September and November [2010] having 28 per cent positive cases. In our study 21 per cent required platelet transfusion. Another study showed 11 per cent IgM, 51 per cent IgG and 38 per cent both IgM and IgG antibody positivity. In West Bengal 6293 persons were serologically diagnosed to be suffering from dengue which occurred during the months of August to November 2005.

Bihar was said to be free from dengue, but in September 2010, outbreaks had been reported specially from 3 districts Patna, Munger and Begusarai. Cases reported from Patna were mostly due to migration from different areas in order to get better treatment facilities. In Kolkata alone, 14 deaths and 27 deaths in West Bengal occurred due to dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever. So in the future, dengue virus infection has to be taken seriously in Bihar and proper measures should be taken for prevention of the infection.

[2] Kenya (Mombasa)
Date: Wed 10 Jul 2012
From: Yasutaka Mizuno, MD <mizunomd@hotmail.com> [edited]


A 30-year-old Japanese man who has been in Mombasa, Kenya as a volunteer worker developed sudden onset of fever, chills and rigors associated with body ache, arthralgia and sore throat. He was admitted to a local university hospital in Mombasa, Kenya on 28 May 2013. On examination, his body temperature was 38.6 C, blood pressure:136/90mmHg, WBC:2,950, PLT:163,000. Serum sample on admission was negative for malaria antigen diagnostic test, pending results for dengue NS-1 antigen and IgM.

He was discharged after hospitalization for a total of 10 days. Although he was diagnosed with a viral syndrome there, day 16 after serum sample were both positive for dengue NS-1 antigen (Platelia, Bio-Rad, France) and dengue IgM,and IgG by ELISA at our institute. Although the 1st identified dengue outbreak in Mombasa was in 1982, recently there has been no current dengue outbreak there. There is a need for higher awareness toward the increasing risk of dengue in Africa including Kenya.

[This represents an additional case of dengue virus infection acquired in Mombasa, Kenya. The outbreak there has been going on since January 2013. As noted in the ProMED-mail post of 26 Apr 2013 (archive no. 20130428.1676860), "A dengue fever outbreak has been reported in Mombasa, Kenya. The 1st laboratory confirmed case was reported by Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) on 7 Mar 2013. However, a retrospective review of hospital records indicates that the 1st case was confirmed in a private laboratory on 7 Jan 2013. As of 26 Apr 2013, 83 of 148 (56 per cent) blood samples collected from residents of Mombasa who visited health facilities with dengue-like illness have tested positive for dengue virus (DENV) infection."

ProMED-mail thanks Drs. Mizuno and Takasaki for sending in this report. ProMED is especially appreciative of 1st-hand reports of dengue cases and outbreaks in Africa, where the dengue situation remains unclear.
