A new highly pathogenic strain of virus PRRS has been detected
--------------------------------------------------------------
Researchers at the University of Ghent (Belgium), led by Dr Hans Nauwynck,
have discovered a new strain of the porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome virus (PRRSV).

PRRSV is divided into genotypes of Europe and of North America. PRRSV
isolates from Eastern Europe belong to the European genotype, but are
different subtypes.

The researchers found, in a pig farm in Belarus, a new PRRSV which they
named "Lena". Analyses revealed that Lena is a new subtype 3 in Eastern
Europe, highly pathogenic and causes severe clinical symptoms. It is
different from European subtype 1 Lelystad and North American US5 strains.

[The original paper, published on 4 Jun 2010 in BMC Veterinary Research (an
open access, peer-reviewed journal, UK) is available online at
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/6/30> (ref 1). The paper includes,
among other data, a description of the severe clinical signs, including
significant mortality, in pigs experimentally infected by the "Lena"
strain, compared with other Type I (European) PRRSV.

Most ProMED-mail's postings addressing PRRSV, so far, were related to the
major epizootic (popularly named "blue-ear disease") in China and Vietnam
since 2006. This was caused by a Type II virus, related to North American
lineages. A list of available vaccines against PRRSV is to be found at
