The number of students who have fallen ill from salmonellosis at a Chiang Mai school has risen to 460. Health authorities say the students fell ill after eating 3-day-old boiled eggs tainted with salmonellae. Dr Pornthep Siriwanarangsan, director-general of the Disease Control Department, said Chiang Mai Welfare School students became sick after eating donated eggs that were boiled 3 days previously and not reheated before they were consumed, allowing the bacteria to develop.

On Sunday evening, 8 Jul 2012, about 900 students of the school, located in Mae Rim district, ate chili curry and donated boiled eggs at the cafeteria.

After the meal, 75 of the students became ill with headaches, high fever, nausea and diarrhea. The number of sick students increased to 460 yesterday [10 Jul 2012], health authorities said. Of them, 290 are recovering at home; 123 are still in 9 hospitals, and 8 students are critically ill. Another 47 students are being treated at the school's gym, which has been turned into a field hospital as there are not enough hospital beds available to accommodate all the sick students.

Officials have tracked down the source of the eggs, part of a much larger number which were distributed in the area. Surasing Wisarutrat, of the Chiang Mai public health office, said officials have traced about 10 000 donated eggs distributed to the school and other places in the district and which come from the same source. Elsewhere, the eggs had been re-boiled before consumption, which ensured no one fell ill after eating them.
