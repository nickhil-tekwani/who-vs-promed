Mass food poisoning hits Ukraine
---------------------------------------
Ukrainian health officials say that workers with dirty hands using dirty
instruments at state-run dairies caused an outbreak of food poisoning that
has affected hundreds of Ukrainian children.
Health Ministry spokeswoman Uliana Lozan said, on Mon 24 May 2004, that, so
far, over 800 children in 3 different regions of the country have been
affected by the outbreak of food poisoning. She said that over half of
those affected have been hospitalized. The capital Kyiv, in central
Ukraine, Kharkiv, in the east, and Odessa, in the south, are the main
outbreak zones.
On Fri 21 May 2004, health officials shut down a state-run dairy after more
than 200 children suffered symptoms of food poisoning.

[ProMED-mail requests more information about this outbreak. The
multi-centric aspect of the outbreak certainly suggests a centralized
source, in this case, perhaps, the implicated state-run dairy. An assessed
incubation period, symptoms, and length of illness would help in suggesting
an etiology, although multiple etiologies may be present. The degree of
need for hospitalization (more than 50 percent) suggests a more severe
illness such as shigellosis. - Mod.LL]
