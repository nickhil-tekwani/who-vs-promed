Bluetongue has been confirmed on a 2nd holding in Switzerland. The animal
found to be infected is a bovine from a holding in the Canton of Solothurn.

Only very mild clinical signs were observed, and the remainder of the herd
is undergoing blood tests to detect presence of the virus. The protection
zone has been extended and includes also parts of the canton Jura, in
addition to the cantons of Basel City, Basel Country, Solothurn, and Aargau.

Restrictive measures on animal transport have been applied, as well as
protective measures against the midges. The latter include sheltering the
animals an hour before dusk.
