Fever epidemic (Maldives)
-----------------------
Classes for preschools and primary schools indefinitely closed due to the
fever epidemic here may not resume even this week, the Education Ministry
said Saturday.
Assistant Director General Zahiya Zareer said the Education Ministry is
awaiting for the go-ahead from the Health Ministry.
"When the Health Ministry indicates that the epidemic has been controlled,
and gives us the green light, we will resume classes," Zahiya told
Haveeru. However, she said that classes will be resumed cautiously with
close advice from the Health Ministry.
More than 50 schools from the atolls also remain closed due to the
epidemic; Classes will be resumed this week only at the school in Haa
Dhaalu atoll Hanimaadhoo.
"No other schools in the atolls will resume classes this week," Zahiya
confirmed.
Schools started shutting down from 27 Jun 2002 after an epidemic of viral
fever, measles, diarrhea and flu broke out here.

[This newswire report suggests that the school closing is due to an
epidemic of "viral fever," although it does mention concurrent measles,
diarrhea, and flu cases. Readers are reminded that the Maldives is an
independent Republic comprised of an archipelago of a group of atolls in
the Indian Ocean, south-southwest of India in the Arabian Sea (Indian
Ocean). More information on the etiology of the outbreak responsible for
this school closing would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
