Unknown disease in South Africa and Zambia
------------------------------------------
On 12 Sep 2008, an office employee at a safari tour company living
and working in Zambia underwent medical evacuation to South Africa
with an as-yet unknown disease. The patient died in a Johannesburg
hospital on 14 Sep 2008. On 27 Sep 2008, the paramedic who cared for
the index case during her evacuation to South Africa was admitted to
hospital in Johannesburg where he died on 2 Oct 2008. In addition, a
nurse who cared for the index case in South Africa died on 5 Oct 2008
in Johannesburg.

Laboratory analysis has been conducted in South Africa at the Special
Pathogens Unit, National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)
of the National Health Laboratory Service. Samples have, so far,
tested negative for a series of viral haemorrhagic fevers and other
common infectious disease pathogens. Tests to identify the pathogen
continue at the NICD in South Africa and further testing will be
performed at the Special Pathogens and Infectious Disease Pathology
branches of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta, United States. CDC and NICD are technical partners in the
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN ).

Clinical features common to the 3 patients initially include fever,
headache, diarrhoea and myalgia developing into rash and hepatic
dysfunction, followed by rapid deterioration and death. Bleeding was
not a marked clinical feature (NICD report is available at
<http://www.nicd.ac.za/pubs/communique/2008/NICDSpecialCommOct_alert01.pdf>).

There are no further known symptomatic cases, either in Zambia or in
South Africa. 121 known contacts of the fatal cases are being traced
in South Africa and 23 in Zambia.

The WHO and its partners are actively supporting the investigation at
provincial and national levels. Epidemiologists from the WHO African
Regional Office have arrived to assist both countries, and personal
protective equipment (PPE) and sampling equipment are en route to
Lusaka. The WHO is also providing support to the Ministries of Health
of the 2 countries with epidemiological investigations, active case
finding and follow-up of contacts.

While the investigations and follow-up of contacts continue, there
have been no new cases since the last death on 4 Oct 2008. There is
no indication at this point of the need for any restriction of travel
to or from Zambia or South Africa and no special measures are
required for passengers arriving from these countries.

The WHO African Regional Office is providing updated information to
the WHO Country Offices in the neighbouring countries.

[Identification of the putative pathogen remains elusive. Fortunately
there have been no new cases either in South Africa nor in Zambia.
The WHO account omits mention of 2 possibly relevant factors included
in earlier accounts; namely return of the index case from South
Africa 2 days prior to her illness and a recent tick bite. - Mod.CP]
