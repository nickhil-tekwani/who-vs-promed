A total of 3 persons died after being bitten by rabid dogs while another 15 dogs were placed under observation after testing positive for the dreaded virus.

As this developed, Dr Albert Venturina, Bataan provincial veterinarian appealed to the pet owners have their animals vaccinated against rabies.

Venturina said that Bataan Governor Abet Garcia has directed the conduct of anti-rabies and vaccination drives down to the barangay [the smallest administrative division in the Philippines] level to prevent casualties.

Venturina said that in addition to the stock of the province, 2 [named] multi national companies had donated anti-rabies vaccines to the province.

"They are very supportive of our campaign against rabies and helpful to the people of Bataan," said Dr Ventura.

He appealed to individuals bitten by dogs and other animals to immediately seek medical attention to prevent the deadly virus from spreading to the brain.

Once a person is bitten by rabies-infected animal, Venturina said the victim may have only up to 3 months to live, if left untreated.[comment]

[Though, fortunately, not in every single person, bitten by an infected animal, rabies eventually develops, post-exposure treatment should be always applied in persons exposed to infection from a rabid or suspected-to-be rabid animal.

Health Minister Dr S Subramaniam says the rabies outbreak in Serian may be due to a serious outbreak in Kalimantan,
and a wild dog may have crossed the border and brought it into Sarawak.

He said the health ministry was informed that there had been an active outbreak of rabies in Kalimantan. However, no figures were provided on the number of cases reported there.

Subramaniam said it was not an unusual occurrence, adding that it had happened before where a stray dog with the rabies infection had crossed over the Thailand border into Perlis, spreading the infection.

"If humans can cross through our forest, I'm sure a dog can too," Subramaniam said at a press conference here today.
He said his ministry is currently helping identify the symptoms of rabies among those who have been bitten by dogs.

Subramaniam said 11 active case detection (ACD) teams are on the ground to provide health education related to rabies as well as information on preventive measures to the residents of villages in the area.

"They have visited 19 villages and covered 2098 doors/houses and checked 6094 people so far," he said.

The 68 people reported to have suffered dog bites in the area since 1 Apr 2017 will be given the vaccine and monitored as rabies symptoms take some time to surface.

"We have sufficient amounts of vaccine to manage the outbreak, for both the
people and animals.

"We are giving vaccinations to those bitten in the perimeter of 10 kilometres from where there have been confirmed cases of rabies,"
Subramaniam said.

He added that the veterinary department has also been conducting checks on dogs in the surrounding areas, both strays and pets.

Subramaniam said pet dogs may be given priority for vaccination as they are in constant contact with humans. He added that the decision on how strays would be vaccinated will be left to the veterinary department.

He advised people to take precautions and get their pets vaccinated with the anti-rabies vaccine.

It was reported today that 2 of 3 rabies-infected children in Sarawak had died. The 3rd victim, a 7-year-old girl, has been categorised as
critically ill and is still in the intensive care unit being ventilated.

The Health Ministry has not ruled out the possibility the rabies or mad dog virus that infected 3 children in Serian, Sarawak could have been transmitted from Kalimantan, Indonesia.

Deputy Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahaya said previously 9 similar cases were reported in that neighboring country and his ministry did not rule out that possibility due to the position of Serian, which lies next to Kalimantan, as the source of the rabies outbreak in the district.

"But the public need not worry because it is under control and so far there is no new rabies positive cases reported in Sarawak or any other states. "

"The Health Department with the cooperation of the Veterinary Department in every state is constantly monitoring the situation," he told reporters after flagging off the 29th Kuala Lumpur SEA Games Torch Run in

Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) Sungai Rusa, Balik Pulau Parliamentary constituency level here today [Tue 4 Jul 2017].

On [Sat 1 Jul 2017], Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said 3 children, including 2 siblings, aged 4, 6 and 7, in Serian district, Sarawak were infected by rabies, which was notified by the Sarawak General Hospital in Kuching on June 22 [2017].

Dr Noor Hisham said further investigation found that 2 of the victims had a history of being bitten by a dog about a month or 2 before manifestation of the symptoms while it could not be ascertained whether the 3rd victim was ever bitten by a dog.

Dr Hilmi said the ministry also took several control and preventive measures, including conducting thorough investigation on the actual cause of the rabies outbreak in Serian.

Asked on the latest development in the condition of the 3 infected children, he said until yesterday [Mon 3 Jul 2017] their condition was still critical and they were being treated and closely monitored by specialists at the Sarawak General Hospital.

[To comprehend the geographical situation addressed in the above items from Malaysia, in particular the proximity of Serian, in Sarawak (East Malaysia aka Malaysian Borneo) to West Kalamatan in Indonesian Borneo, please refer to the map at http://tinyurl.com/yaxscb2x.

An earlier media report, dated 1 Jul 2017, apparently preceding the death of 2 of the victims, included the following information:

"A total of 3 children including 2 siblings in Serian District, Sarawak have been infected with rabies.

"Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah in a statement [Fri 30 Jun 2017] said the Health Ministry received a report from the Sarawak Health Department after being notified by the Sarawak General Hospital on June 22 [2017].

"He said the victims aged 4, 6 and 7 years were initially thought to suffer from viral encephalitis and showed symptoms of fever, abnormal behavior and aggression at times, and were afraid of water.

"He said the children were warded at the intensive unit where 2 were put on oxygen.

"Further investigation found that 2 of the victims had a history of being bitten by a dog about a month or 2 before manifestation of the symptoms while it could not be ascertained whether the third victim was ever bitten by a dog, he said".

For the above information, published in http://www.theborneopost.com/2017/07/01/three-children-infected-with-rabies-in-sarawak/, we are indebted to Dr Tan Cheng Siang, Head, Centre for Tropical and Emerging Diseases, University Malaysia, Sarawak.

Since the vector animal (suspected to be a rabid dog) is not known to have been detected/tested, and in view of the long time elapsed since the exposure (probably 2 months ago), the Malaysian authorities have a lot of work on their hands to detect any additional exposure and spread of the virus within the local animal populations. Their efforts are reflected in report [2] above,

Malaysia is one of the few South-East-Asian countries which have managed to prevent the introduction of rabies for many years, though sporadic introductions have been recorded (most recent, in 1999 and 2014) on its continental (Peninsular Malaysia) borders with infected countries. The following chapter on Malaysia's rabies situation, included in the 2013 document "The South‐East Asia Dog Rabies Elimination Strategy" (available at http://www.rr-asia.oie.int/fileadmin/SRR_Activities/SEA_Rabies_Strategy_-_OIE_Final_Draft.pdf) could be of interest to subscribers.

"An Animal Rabies Surveillance Programme was initiated by the Department of Veterinary Services in accordance with OIE standards
in 1998 (OIE standards on rabies, which have been developed since then), but after an intensive campaign, no positive cases have been detected to date. With State and federal funding, Malaysia continues to implement initiatives that are relevant to rabies, including: annual dog licensing, annual rabies vaccination programme and animal movement control in the immune belt, management of dog bite cases, and a national surveillance programme. The efforts sustained have reportedly been supported by sufficient legislation at local and national levels. The Laws of Malaysia Act 647 (Animal Act of 1953) cover special provisions relating to dogs in connection with rabies. This includes licensing (Section 38), management of rabies‐infected areas (Section 39), destruction or detention of an animal suspected to be infected with rabies (Section 40), detention of any dogs that have bitten a person (Section 41) and anti‐rabies vaccination in dogs (Section 42)".

Laboratory confirmation of the human cases, and the virus' identification, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
