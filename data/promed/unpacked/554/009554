With all due respect to Charles Calisher [Good start. - Mod. CHC , I have
to take exception to [his response to Mr. Barnes concerning bioterrorism:
"[7 We have failed nothing. The virus was recognized quickly, identified
soon after that, and appropriate responses made. If it was a bioterrorism
event, it failed. Sure, the virus entered this country and was originally
misdiagnosed but when was the last time you heard of the epidemic incursion
of a human pathogenic virus that made only 60 people sick and killed only a
dozen people?"
If this act was terrorism of another form, by extension Charles would be
saying, "When was the last time you heard of a bomb exploding and only
killing two people?"
The facts are that the West Nile virus was misdiagnosed persistently for a
rather long period of time, and consequently misreported by all major news
outlets in New York City, including the exceptionally careful New York
Times. Ironically, the same thing occurred in Malaysia with the Nipah
virus, which was not correctly identified until long after the most
effective prophylactic measures might have been taken. While there was no
official effort to conceal the truth as was the case in Malaysia [personal
opinion of Mr. Shea. - Mod. CHC, there was qualitatively little difference
in the result.
If the introduction of a far more virulent bioterrorist weapon relied on
the state of readiness indicated by this event, thousands and perhaps tens
of thousands of people would die before anyone diagnosed the killer. There
is no reason to congratulate anyone on their early performance in this
case; had it been a carefully-planned bioterrorist action, such as those
described in "The Eleventh Plague" the entire country would have been
infected before any clear warning was made. Congratulations are due, if the
troubling issue of late Fall infections in birds can be put aside, to the
portion of the medical community that planned the efforts to fight the
spread of the virus once it was identified. However, not only in Malaysia
but in many other instances, the very slow identification of pathogens has
not deserved accolades. While it's clear that resources are not available
for all such efforts, as when hundreds of people died in the remote
Badakhshan region of Afghanistan before the virus could be identified, as
an outside observer I can't help but be impressed by the extreme caution
that accompanies the early diagnostic efforts, and I must wonder whether
the caution is in defense of medical reputations or of public health needs,
which night be better served by an approach that heightened public
alertness even in the absence of a highly accurate diagnosis.
ProMED-mail has done an outstanding job of serving as an early warning
system for epidemics, and it surely deserves congratulations on achieving
the vast scope of geographic coverage and the very high reputation it has
for excellent, timely reporting. Let us hope that a confluence of
circumstances conspired to make the medical community's WNV response an
aberration and not the norm.

[Mr. Shea is entitled to his opinions. However, the exploding bomb analogy
is like comparing fundamentalism to religion or Hip Hop to music. Had this
WNV outbreak been one caused by St. Louis encephalitis virus, everyone
would have marveled at the response, the paucity of cases, and the
efficiency of all involved. Okay, so they weren't perfect; who is? If
there are more comments to be made on this subject, please send them
directly to me, rather than to ProMED-mail. I will respond personally to
each one but I will not post any more on this subject. String not only cut
but severed completely. - Mod.CHC
