The GeoSentinel Surveillance and Research Network has identified an increase in cases of dengue fever in travelers to Cuba. Since the beginning of 2022, we have identified 29 travelers who acquired dengue in Cuba with one confirmed to have had severe dengue. All the travelers were Europeans and had been visiting Cuba for the purpose of tourism or visiting friends and relatives. Notably 22/29 (76%) acquired their infection between June and August 2022. We have reached out to our collaborators at TropNet (a network of European tropical medicine centers) and many of their sites have also seen recent travelers to Cuba with dengue fever. While Cuba is well known to be dengue-endemic, there appears to be an ongoing outbreak in the country that has resulted in a substantial increase of local transmission and enhanced risk to travelers.

The Agencía Cubana de Noticias released an alert recently from the Ministry of Public Health highlighting a recent outbreak of dengue. There are 4 provinces (Havana, Camagüey, Las Tunas and Holguín) that have had many of the recent cases. This alert suggests an increase of 21.7% of dengue cases in 2022 relative to 2021. The government states that is strengthening dengue control efforts although they are unable to increase fumigation due to fuel shortages.

We think it important to highlight the current risk of dengue fever in travelers to Cuba so that travel medicine and primary care providers can counsel travelers to Cuba on the importance of personal protection measures for the prevention of mosquito bites.

[The dengue viruses are endemic in Cuba. Historically, there have been sporadic dengue outbreaks on the island. David Hamer's above report indicates that there may be another outbreak going on currently. It has been difficult to obtain reliable publicly available dengue information issued by Cuban health authorities. Interestingly, the dengue case counts for Cuba posted on the PAHO/WHO weekly dengue update is given as of week 20 (week ending 21 May 2022) reports 450 cases (see https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en/dengue-nacional-en/252-dengue-pais-ano-en.html). It would be interesting to know if the number of dengue cases on the island has increased significantly since then.
