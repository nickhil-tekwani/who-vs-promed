- National. 13 Aug 2018. The number of people suffering from dengue in Sri Lanka has increased to more than 34 000 so far this year [2018], with Colombo reporting the highest number of infected patients, official statistics revealed on Monday [13 Aug 2018]. The statistics from the Epidemiology Unit said that in August 2018, 1075 patients have been diagnosed with dengue from across the island, and 6221 patients were reported in July 2019, reports Xinhua news agency. Some of the worst affected districts were Kandy and Gampaha. The National Dengue Control Unit last month [July 2018] warned that there was an increase in the number of dengue patients in 2018 due to the active South West monsoon rains. As a result, the unit said it has launched special programmes to eradicate dengue breeding grounds.

[2] Research: Mechanism that affects multiplication of dengue virus lineage
Date: 15 Aug 2018
Source: EurekAlert! [edited]
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-08/fda-mta081518.php


A lineage of type 1 dengue virus found in Brazil is able to prevail over another even though it multiplies less in vector mosquitoes and infected human cells. This discovery was made under the scope of a thematic project supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP involving several Brazilian institutions, as well as a university in the USA.

According to the study, the lineage activates a weaker immune response in the patient and is less strongly combated. As a result, the virus can multiply more in the organism and is more likely to be transmitted to others via infected mosquitoes, so that this lineage supersedes the other owing to its significantly greater overall capacity to multiply in mosquitoes and patients.

The researchers studied lineages 1 and 6 (L1 and L6) of type 1 dengue, which affect the population of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo State, Brazil. Their findings showed that while L1 had a superior capacity to multiply in mosquitoes and cells, L6 could minimize and even deactivate the human immune response, so that this lineage ended up replacing L1.

"There were 3 approaches to investigating the situations in which dengue virus multiplies and to explain why one lineage supersedes another. Our research brought to light a new phenomenon that explains how a virus survives in a population," said Maurício Lacerda Nogueira, a professor at the São José do Rio Preto Medical School (FAMERP), head of its Dermatological Disease Department's Virology Research Laboratory, and co-author of an article that published the results of the study in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Nogueira also chairs the Brazilian Society for Virology.

"However, knowing whether the virus multiplies more or less in mosquitoes or human cells isn't enough to understand why one lineage replaces another. We also need to know how the virus interacts with the human organism as a whole," said Nogueira.

The study produced vital new knowledge for the production of dengue vaccines. "A global understanding of how the virus interacts with the population helps us understand how vaccines work and is fundamental to our ability to design them," he said.

Type 1 dengue virus has been circulating in Brazil since the mid-1980s. A total of 3 lineages (L1, L3 and L6, all belonging to the same genotype) were introduced at different times. L6 was initially observed in São José do Rio Preto, where it began circulating in 2008. L1 was first identified in the city in 2010. These 2 lineages co-circulated for a period.

L1 was expected to display a higher capacity to multiply in cells and in the vector mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, since it arrived after L6 and its viral fitness appeared to be superior to that of L6. Therefore, L1 was expected to replace L6 as the dominant strain, but it began to decline in 2013 and eventually disappeared.

This fact contradicted existing scientific knowledge about the prevalence of one lineage over another -- a phenomenon called clade replacement (a clade is a branch of a phylogenetic tree comprising all organisms that have evolved from a common ancestor).

Clade replacement occurs if a lineage multiplies more in human cells after being introduced than another lineage that was already living in the same environment, or if a lineage that arrives later multiplies more in the mosquito. In both cases, the lineage that supersedes the other is said to have a higher level of viral fitness.

A 3rd explanation arose from a 2015 study conducted in Puerto Rico, where a lineage of dengue virus was found to have a lower level of viral fitness than the lineages that were already in the environment yet eventually replaced them. Scientists discovered that this lineage inhibited the interferon system, which acts as the 1st line of defense against viruses in mammals (interferons are a complex of proteins that interfere with viral replication and protect cells from infection). This phenomenon is called epidemiological fitness -- the capacity of a virus to become dominant in the field during epidemic outbreaks.

In the Brazilian case, none of this happened. The researchers 1st sequenced the genomes of the 2 viral lineages, which were found to have 47 different amino acids. Despite this significant genetic distance, L6 won the competition between them.

"Based on the information available at the time, it was assumed that L6 multiplied better and therefore became dominant, but when we looked at contaminated human and monkey cells, we found that L1 multiplied 10 times more on average than L6," said the coordinator for the FAPESP thematic project.

The next hypothesis was that L6's higher viral fitness might be due to its higher multiplication rate in the mosquito. Therefore, researchers infected captive mosquitoes (bred for use in scientific experiments) orally, having them feed by biting a membrane that contained mouse blood contaminated with dengue virus L1 and L6. "Again, L1 multiplied 10 times better than L6 in the mosquito," Nogueira said.

The researchers then investigated the possibility that the captive mosquitoes were somehow different from those found in the environment. In a new experiment, mosquito eggs were collected in the environment and hatched in the laboratory. The result was the same: L1 continued to be more efficient than L6 in terms of multiplication, although studies showed that patients infected with L6 had a far higher viral load than those infected with L1.
