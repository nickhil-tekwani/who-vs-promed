Efforts fail to halt pneumonia outbreak in sheep
------------------------------------------------
Wildlife officials will let a pneumonia outbreak run its course through a
herd of bighorn sheep west of Anaconda after killing dozens of sick animals
failed to keep the disease in check.

There are no known vaccines to prevent pneumonia in bighorn sheep, which is
usually fatal for the animals, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks [FWP]
officials said Tuesday [9 Nov 2010]. Instead, wildlife officials kill sick
sheep to prevent other animals from being exposed.

The agency has killed 44 bighorn sheep in the herd of about 300 animals
west of Anaconda since confirming the pneumonia outbreak in August [2010].
But FWP officials say the outbreak has now spread beyond management
control. The whole population appears to be exposed and there is nothing to
gain by killing more sheep, FWP regional wildlife manager Mike Thompson
said in a statement. Instead, the focus is now on trying to keep alive
every animal that has a chance of surviving the outbreak.

"It was worth a try to see if we could eradicate the disease early on, when
we still had hope it hadn't spread very far," Thompson said in the
statement. "But now we can't tell the difference between sheep that will
die and sheep that might survive."

Officials don't yet know how many animals have been killed in the outbreak
because the animals are too spread out, FWP spokeswoman Vivica Crowser
said. The number of fatalities may be clearer once the rut begins in a few
weeks, she said.

Pneumonia killed 60 per cent of a different herd in the Upper Rock Creek
area earlier this year [2010] after officials let the disease run its
course. FWP said other herds have lost 90 per cent of their populations in
other extreme cases.

The Anaconda herd lost more than half its population during a pneumonia
outbreak in 1991-1992, and another 19 per cent of the population died the
next year.

Wildlife officials suspect the Anaconda herd outbreak may have come from
the Upper Rock Creek herd outbreak, Crowser said. The Anaconda herd is
otherwise isolated except for a small population of bighorn sheep near
Garrison, she said.

The failure to keep the outbreak in check won't cause the state agency to
re-examine its methods, Crowser said. Culling sick bands of bighorn sheep
has improved survival rates in other herds in the past, she said. "If we
saw the opportunity again we would take it. Unfortunately, it didn't work
out in this case," Crowser said.

[What a pity that we are 10 years down the road from the last major
pneumonia outbreak and we still do not have methods of controlling this
disease aside from selective killing, which by their own admission has not
worked this time.

While there are no vaccines, where has the outcry been for research into
such a vaccine? What about an oral vaccine for these animals? What about
oral antibiotics laced on food for them?

It just seems a pity that in a world of technology, we don't have an
answer. While this may not change their methods, nevertheless the methods
should be examined and a "lessons learned" document published. Perhaps this
exercise would shed new light on this problem. - Mod.TG
