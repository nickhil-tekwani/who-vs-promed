[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase rapidly at several locations in this state. Since 1 Jul 2022, the number of deaths has increased to 44. The number of JE cases has risen rapidly from 183 reported on Tuesday (19 Jul 2022) to 274 cases on 28 Jul 2022. Interestingly, these 274 cases were classified as JE and not acute encephalitis syndrome. Although AES is mentioned above, all the cases are attributed to JE. There is still no mention of a vaccination campaign in the state. The JE virus transmission season may last an additional 2 or more months, so more cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
