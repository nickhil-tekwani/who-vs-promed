The daily newspaper yesterday [21 Mar 2007] announced the diagnosis
of the 1st [human] West Nile case in Spain. A young man of 21 years
was infected via a mosquito bite in Valverde de Leganes (Badajoz) in
2004, when there was an outbreak in Portugal. This patient was
admitted to hospital in September of that year [2004] with a
headache, vomiting, hallucinations and high fever. Symptoms and tests
pointed to possible viral meningitis, and there was recovery without
sequelae. 5 days later, he was discharged without signs of meningitis
and was able to resume working. Tests discarded common infections
such as herpes [virus] and HIV and finally were positive for West Nile virus.
Although the case was identified in Barcelona, the patient was
infected in Valverde de Leganes, near the Portuguese border, where he
spent his summer vacation and became ill 2 days after he returned
[home]. Given the incubation period of this disease, he must have
acquired the infection during this [vacation] time.
This discovery was not incidental. The Bellvitge group began a 3-year
study in 2003, looking for WN cases among encephalitis and meningitis
cases diagnosed in hospitals. There were 50 cases studied from health
centers located near wetlands such as the Delta del Ebro or the
Llobregat watershed. These areas are [ideal] for the circulation of
the [WN] virus since the 2 actors necessary for [WN] virus
maintenance in nature, migratory birds and abundant mosquitoes, are
found there.

[With sporadic WN virus infection of humans and equine animals in
France and a recent WN virus outbreak in Portugal, finding a human
case in Spain is not surprising. This study should alert health
providers in Spain to be on the lookout for WN virus infections in
humans located in areas where WN virus transmission is possible.
