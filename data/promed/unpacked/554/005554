Carlos Hernandez Sanchez, delegate of the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (Sagarpa by its initials in Spanish), said the federal agency has placed under quarantine 200 dairy farms because cases of bovine tuberculosis have been detected among the animals; consequently, 8000 cows will be slaughtered.

The official reported that Guerrero state is in the process of 'cleaning the cattle.' He said that in the coming days, 25 municipalities of the Costa Chica region will be declared as having low prevalence of bovine tuberculosis so the animals can be exported to the United States.

At a press conference, Hernandez Sanchez announced that in the coming days officials from the United States Department of Agriculture would visit municipalities of Costa Chica to verify the low prevalence of tuberculosis and called on farmers to comply with zoosanitary measures to ensure the quality of the livestock.

To date, 10 municipalities of Costa Chica have been declared with low prevalence of tuberculosis and are exporting their meat to the United States, resulting in significant financial gain. For this reason, 200 dairy farms have been placed under quarantine, 20 of them in the municipalities of Costa Chica. The goal is to terminate all 8000 susceptible cattle and replace them with healthy animals through a program launched by the Sagarpa, he explained.

Sagarpa will contribute MXN 16 million [approximately USD 1.2 million] to clean up the livestock industry at this stage and especially for the procurement of clean and healthy cattle to restore the 8000 that are to be terminated because of the tuberculosis situation.

As security measures, Sagarpa has declared a ban on free ranging animals and their movement from other regions of the country. Those that are brought into the area will be strictly monitored and can only be slaughtered in the federal inspection type (TIF) slaughterhouse located in Ciudad Altamirano.

[This sounds like a few cows at these dairies may have tested positive for tuberculosis. Because bovine TB is such a slow insidious disease, it is difficult to detect. In the USA, such a situation would result in a depopulation of the herd due to the nature of the disease. This is especially true in trying to eliminate the disease. Elimination of the disease is especially important to the country purchasing the animals or the meat.
