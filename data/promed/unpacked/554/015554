CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS & REPEATED GI OUTBREAKS: REQUEST FOR INFO
=================================================================
Recently, I was involved in the investigation of an outbreak of
gastrointestinal (GI) illness of residents living in a continuing care facility.
The outbreak lasted about one month and the symptoms were consistent with an
illness of viral origin although there is no laboratory confirmation.
A sample from one grew Clostridium perfringens (> 1,000,000 organisms) and
is considered a coincidental finding. However, on review of gastrointestinal
outbreaks at this facility over the past years, it interesting to note that
there is always at least one resident from whom Clostridium perfringens is
isolated. In an outbreak two years ago (not believed to be due to C.
perfringens) there were six residents from whom C. perfringens was isolated
and of the six, 2 were >1,000,000 organisms. We have not had the same
experience from other similar facilities.
The infection control team would be interested to know whether experts would
advise further investigation, and if so, what investigation.
Thank you
