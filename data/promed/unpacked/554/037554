The cause of the mysterious death of 5 people in a remote
Thanzamasora hamlet in southern Mizoram last month [March 2011] was
not malaria, as had been reported earlier, the state health department
said today.

Health officials, during a meeting of Anti-Malaria Month Advocacy
here, clarified that the cause of the mysterious death was 'Indian
tick typhus,' a very rare disease, and not cerebral malaria as stated
earlier. The officials said that malaria, considered to be the biggest
killer disease in Mizoram, has claimed "only" 2 lives during this
year.

Dr C Lalthanmawia, director of health services, in his power point
presentation on the scenario of malaria in Mizoram, highlighted that
of the 17 002 blood samples collected during this year, 805 were found
to be malaria positive. Of these, 768 were malaria due to _Plasmodium
falciparum_. He said Mizoram has witnessed a fall in the number of
malaria-related deaths in 2010 with only 31 people succumbing to the
killer disease, as compared to 199 in 2009 and 99 in 2008.

According to the record of State Vector-Borne Diseases Control
Programme (SVBDCP), of the 322 929 blood samples tested during last
year [2010], 15 130 were found to be positive with malaria, of which
14 189 were malaria due to _Plasmodium falciparum_, more deadly than
malaria due to _Plasmodium vivax_. As many as 15 099 malaria patients
were cured. As many as 9399 people were tested positive for malaria,
of which 7387 were malaria _Plasmodium falciparum_, during the year
2009. Of these 119 people died, the record said.

Among the 8 districts of Mizoram, Lunglei district in southern
Mizoram topped with 11 malarial deaths in 2010 and Champhai district,
bordering Myanmar, did not have any death due to malaria, the record
said.

According to the death investigation report of the health department,
most of the malarial deaths happened due to negligence on the parts of
the patients that led to delayed treatment. "In 2009, malaria patients
were on an average 4 days late when they took treatment. In 2010, they
were on an average 2 days late. There was a sign of improvement due to
extensive health awareness campaign through the media," officials
said. The health department has set up FTD/ASHA in all towns and
villages to help malaria patients get treatment on time.
