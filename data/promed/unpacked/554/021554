Argentina reinforces border controls
----------------------------------------------------
In accordance with the established norms of the Pan-American Center for
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (Panaftosa), and the Cuenca del Plata Treaty,
the Bolivian National Agricultural Health and Food Safety Service
(Senasag) has reported an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in
Trinidad (state of Beni), in the north-central part of this Andean country,
within the Amazon ecosystem.
Carlos Salinas, head of Senasag's FMD program, reported to Senasa
[Argentina's National Agricultural Health and Quality Control Service] that
the Bolivian technicians had applied the international rules: interdiction
of the outbreak, ring vaccination, and cattle movement control.
Salinas informed that 50 000 animals have been vaccinated in the peri-focal
area, that laboratory analyses determined that the acting virus corresponds
to the O strain, and that the Bolivian national timeline for vaccination
will begin in the states of Beni, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Cochabamba, and
Pando.
Since Bolivia is an FMD-infected country where vaccination is practiced, in
Argentina, Senasa has permanent border controls that have been reinforced.
In addition, although authorities do not inspect the commercial traffic of
merchandise susceptible to FMD, they have increased the controls to prevent
the introduction of products through local cross-border traffic.
