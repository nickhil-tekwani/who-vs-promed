Search for origin of new HIV strain widens
------------------------------------------
AIDS viruses isolated from 2 people are being studied to determine
whether either might be the source of a rare and potentially more
aggressive form of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [see: HIV,
multi-drug resistant - USA (New York City) 20050212.0476] detected in
a New York City man, an AIDS scientist involved in the studies said
yesterday [13 Feb 2005]. Many more tests need to be conducted to
determine whether the strains from the 3 people are the same, said
the scientist, Dr. David Ho. He directs the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in Manhattan, which is conducting some of the studies
in collaboration with the New York City health department. While some
findings may be available in a week, others will take longer, Dr. Ho
said in an interview.
Even if the strains prove to be the same, that would not necessarily
mean that a "supervirus" is on the loose, since there could be
genetic factors in the 1st man that would make his infection progress
faster. "What we can't prove is that this is a "supervirus" and that
it caused the rapid progression from infection to AIDS in the New
York City man, Dr. Ho said. Laboratory tests in Dr. Ho's laboratory
and elsewhere have shown that the strain from the man, whose case
started the investigation, is resistant to 19 of the 20 licensed
anti-retroviral drugs. AIDS experts said that the strain might have
led to the rapid onset of AIDS in the man or that his immune defenses
might have been weakened by drug use or genetics [he was a crystal meth
user. - Mod.JW].
Molecular tests of the man's HIV show that it has changes that appear to
differ significantly from the typical strains [circulating] in New York City,
and precisely what those changes mean remains to be determined, Dr. Ho said.
His laboratory has begun testing a virus that was isolated from a man who was
known to be HIV-infected before he became a sex partner of the New York City
man. That partner probably had sex with the New York City man in October
2004, a few weeks before the New York City man became ill with what his
doctors believe was [an] acute retroviral syndrome. It occurs in the earliest
stages of HIV infection. The partner is "a potential source for this man's
case," Dr. Ho said. "But he may not be."
The 2nd virus is from an unidentified patient in San Diego who was
apparently infected before the New York City man. It was found by
scouring the records of a commercial laboratory, ViroLogic Inc. of
South San Francisco, and portions of its genetic makeup closely
resemble the molecular pattern of the New York City man's virus, Dr.
Ho said. Dr. Ho's team sent the partner's virus to ViroLogic for
testing. Doctors from around the country also send thousands of HIV
specimens to the company for testing.
An additional man who was a sex partner of the New York City man has
declined to participate in the epidemiologic investigation, Dr. Ho
said. It is not known whether he is HIV-infected. The 2 male contacts
in New York City, only one of whom is cooperating with the
investigation, are among hundreds of men with whom the New York City
man told health officials he has had sex in recent weeks while using
crystal methamphetamine. The New York man who sparked the
investigation is cooperating with city health officials but
apparently does not know the names of all his partners. The health
department is trying to trace as many of his sex contacts as can be
ascertained. To protect his privacy, health officials have identified
him only as in his mid-40's.
So far, city health workers have reached "about a dozen" of the man's
contacts, said Sandra Mullin, director of communications for the
health department. She said she did not know how many contacts have
agreed to donate specimens for testing and, if so, what the findings
are. Officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a
federal agency in Atlanta, said that they have notified health
departments elsewhere. While the agency is aiding in the
investigation, the city is taking the lead, said Dr. Ronald O.
Valdiserri, the director of HIV/AIDS prevention at the agency.
On Fri 11 Feb 2005, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the commissioner of the
New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the man's
case was the 1st in which a strain of HIV had been found that showed
both resistance to multiple classes of drugs and apparently led to a
rapid progression from infection to AIDS. Each component has been
reported earlier. Dr. Frieden and other AIDS experts said they
considered it prudent to investigate what they knew was only one case
and to issue an alert to doctors and hospitals to seek other cases.
Dr. Frieden was joined by other AIDS experts at a news conference
that he said was intended to issue a wake-up call to the public and
health professionals about the seriousness of unsafe sex and the
apparent increase in drug-resistant HIV strains. While the experts
said that they could not rule out the possibility that they were
dealing with an extraordinary confluence of 2 rare events, they also
said they were concerned about the possibility of the man passing it
to his hundreds of sexual contacts. The health department asked
doctors and hospitals for their help, because the city, like most
other areas of the country, has no system to monitor the occurrence
of HIV drug resistance among recently infected people. So, Dr.
Frieden said, the city has no easy way to determine whether such a
strain was an isolated event or whether it was infecting a cluster of
people, small or large. Dr. Frieden and other experts said that,
logically, there had to be at least one other individual with the
rare strain who gave it to the New York City man.
Some scientists criticized the health department for causing
unnecessary alarm by disclosing information about just one case, and
for calling a news conference when it had to say the scientific
premise for its announcement was weak. Dr. Frieden defended his
department's decision to issue a warning on Friday [11 Feb 2005].
"Everyone who hears this, their 1st thought is either it can't be
true, or, if it is, it can't be that significant," Dr. Frieden said
in an interview. "But the more you hear about it, the more concerned
you become." He said that the decision to go public was not easy and
was not taken lightly, but that, given the evidence he had available,
he had no doubt they did the right thing.
As he cautioned on Friday [11 Feb 2005], several things remain
unknown. They do not know how widespread this strain is or how
widespread it will become. They also do not know how this patient
will fare. But they do know several troubling things beyond a doubt,
he said. "There is not a question that drug resistance is on the
increase," he said. In addition, he said, there is no good system in
place to track patient adherence to drug treatment. That, paired with
the fact that there is far too much risky sex taking place in which
methamphetamine use plays a role, is enough to give anyone pause.
"One of our really core values is that we take a great deal of care and pride
in what we say," Dr. Frieden said. "We don't go out and say things unless we
have reasonable certainty that what we say is correct." He said that anyone
who suggests that the department issued the warning simply to scare the
public into behaving more responsibly was absolutely wrong. Dr. Ho
acknowledged that it was extraordinary for the health department to issue an
alert before the full scientific information was available or made public.
But Dr. Ho said he and other scientists were doing the very tests that
critics said had not been performed. "A lot of people are asking for data
that we either have not disclosed or we are working on," Dr. Ho said. "It
could be that the man is genetically prone to have a rapid progression," Dr.
Ho said.

[The HIV strain recovered from this patient has been designated 3-DCR HIV and
appears to be unique, although a virus with some similar genetic features is
being studied in a San Francisco laboratory. The uniqueness of this case is
the combination of multiple drug resistance (resistance to 3 of the 4
commonest classes of anti-retroviral drugs) and an unusually rapid
progression to AIDS (20 months, in contrast to an average of 10 years). It
has still to be established, however, that the 2 phenomena are related. It
may be that the patient has been infected by a rare HIV variant that
transmits poorly and is present at such low frequency that it has not been
detected previously. Similarly, it is possible that the rapid progression to
AIDS may be a feature of the patient's genetic make-up rather than a property
of the virus. It was reported earlier (but not mentioned in the above report)
that the patient had not been treated with anti-retroviral drugs, therefore
selection of multiple drug-resistant variants in the index patient is
unlikely. Another unknown factor is the frequent use of the drug crystal
methamphetamine, a stimulant taken by the patient to reduce sexual
inhibitions. - Mod.CP]
