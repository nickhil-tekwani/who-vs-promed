A listeriosis outbreak has prompted a nationwide recall of certain brands of soft cheeses.

A total of 8 cases of listeriosis infection across Australia, including one in WA [Western Australia], have been found to be linked and a further 3 cases are under investigation, Victoria's Department of Health said.

The State's chief health officer Rosemary Lester said consumers should discard 1 kg brie and camembert cheese branded Jindi, the 1 kg Wattle Valley double brie, and the 1 kg Wattle Valley camembert with a best before date of 21 Dec [? 2012].

Dr Lester warned consumers to check the best before date of any Jindi or Wattle Valley soft cheeses. "Consumers who have purchased a cut portion of camembert or brie from a supermarket or delicatessen who are unsure of the brand should discard it," she said.

So far, 2 Victorians, 3 NSW [New South Wales] residents, and one person each in Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia have been diagnosed with the infection.

The cheeses have been voluntarily recalled as a precaution.

Listeriosis infections usually only produce mild symptoms in healthy people, but can be dangerous to pregnant women, their unborn babies, and elderly people, Dr Lester said. "It can cause miscarriages in pregnant women and even death in people with compromised immune systems," she said. "Investigations into listeriosis are complex as it can be difficult to identify the source. Symptoms of illness can take up to 70 days to appear."

[For a discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in 4 prior ProMED-mail posts this year (2012): Listeriosis - New Zealand: (HB) nosocomial, fatal 20120720.1209143; Listeriosis - UK (02): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, comment 20120418.1105643; Listeriosis - UK: (Northern Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120415.1101822; and Listeriosis - USA: (NJ), perinatal 20120316.1072439.

The news report above says that the 8 cases of listeriosis, occurring in 5 of Australia's 6 states and various territories, are "linked", but fails to says if the linkage is based on a common history of having eaten one of the recalled cheeses, or if genotyping has actually revealed a common strain among the clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ and if the genotype of clinical isolates matches that of any isolates from the cheeses.

The Australian mainland is made up of 5 states (Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales), and 3 territories (Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, and Jarvis Bay Territory), with the 6th island state of Tasmania to the south of the mainland. In addition, there are 6 island territories, known as external territories, and the Australian Antarctic Territory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia).
A map of Australia showing its states and territories can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia.
