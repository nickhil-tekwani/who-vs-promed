British holidaymakers visiting Mexico are being warned about an intestinal parasite that is ravaging resorts in the country.

A total of 14 tourists staying at luxury hotels in the Riviera Maya resort and Cancun have experienced crippling stomach pains, sickness and diarrhoea due to an illness that is passed on through contaminated food.

The cause of the illness is the _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ parasite, which is transmitted by faeces coming into contact with water and food. This the 5th year in a row that the parasite has infected tourists in the region.

Nearly 600 British people have been infected with the bug since 2015, and the same areas of Mexico were the subject of a public health warning 3 years ago. Now medical experts are advising anyone who has visited the affected resorts and is feeling ill to seek medical attention.

Advice on the Health Protection Scotland website reads, "All travellers to Mexico are strongly advised to maintain a high standard of food, water and personal hygiene even if staying in luxury resorts.

"Infection is transmitted through consumption of contaminated food or water; direct person to person spread does not occur. Foods often implicated in outbreaks include soft fruits like raspberries and salad products such as coriander, basil and lettuce.

"On return from Mexico, if travellers have any symptoms such as those described above, they should seek medical attention."

A spokesperson for Health Protection Scotland confirmed an outbreak of _Cyclospora_ in Mexico, stating, "There have been seasonal outbreaks of _Cyclospora_ infection in returning travellers from Mexico over the past 4 years.

"The majority of cases stayed at the Riviera Maya and Cancun regions of Mexico. Health Protection Scotland is aware of 8 cases in Scotland this year [2019] with a history of travel to Mexico.

"_Cyclospora_ infection can cause diarrhoea and illness. The infection can be more serious in individuals with an impaired immune system. Prevention is through following good food and water hygiene practices at all times while on holiday."

[Products originating from Mexico have been behind several multistate outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in the USA and Canada and are currently the source of an multistate outbreak in the USA (see ProMED posting from the 27 Jul 2019 below).

Cyclosporiasis has also been reported in tourists returning from Mexico to the UK, France and Canada (see ProMED reports below). Therefore, it is not surprising that there is a current increase in cases at the same time as the outbreak in the USA. - Mod.EP
