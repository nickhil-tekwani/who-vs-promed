Current situation of Citrus tristeza closterovirus in Italy
-------------------------------------
Italy has been free for some time from Citrus tristeza closterovirus
(CTV - EPPO A2 list), but recently outbreaks were reported in 3
separate areas in the south of the country: in Cassibile (province of
Syracusa, Sicilia) on Fortune mandarin (_Citrus reticulata_); see
also EPPO RS 2003/071; in Massafra (province of Taranto, Puglia) on
sweet orange (_C. sinensis_ 'Navelina'); and in Belpasso (province of
Catania, Sicilia) on sweet orange (_C. sinensis _ 'Tarocco').
In all cases, infected plants were grafted on sour orange rootstocks
(_C. aurantium_). Isolates from Cassibile and Massafra were mild,
whereas isolates from Belpasso induced severe symptoms, such as
dwarfing and dieback of trees, small leaves with interveinal
chlorosis, small and elongated fruits, and root death.
Genetic variation of the 3 CTV populations was studied with molecular
tools: single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and nucleotide
sequence analysis of CTV gene p20. All isolates from the same area
presented the same SSCP patterns, and these patterns differed from
one area to another.
Isolates from Massafra and Cassibile showed more than 99 percent
nucleotide identity with a mild isolate from Spain, and 92 percent
similarity with the Belpasso isolates. The latter were similar (more
than 99 percent similarity) to severe isolates from California (US)
and Japan.
These results suggested that there had been at least 2 independent
introductions to Italy, probably by imports of CTV-infected material.
The fact that virus populations were homogeneous within each area
also suggested that CTV is naturally and rapidly spread by aphids.
The need for eradication and containment programmes is underlined.

[CTV infects almost all citrus species, hybrids, and relatives.
Consequently there are many strains of the virus that contribute to
the diversity of symptoms associated with CTV infection. Mild CTV
strains are basically asymptomatic in their hosts. Severe CTV strains
express a range of symptoms including one or more of the following:
seedling yellows; root stock decline on sour orange; grapefruit
stem-pitting; and sweet orange stem-pitting. CTV-D strains cause
death of the phloem at the bud union, which produces a girdling
effect that can result in overgrowth of the scion at the bud union,
paucity of feeder roots, stunting, leaf yellowing, reduced fruit
size, poor growth, die-back, wilting, and death. Trees affected by
decline on sour orange rootstock may also exhibit pinholing or
honeycombing on the inner face of the bark, or brown discoloration at
the bud union. Trees on sour orange exhibiting decline are routinely
removed and replaced. Tolerant rootstocks include Carrizo citrange,
Cleopatra mandarin, and Swingle citrumelo.
Other virulent and damaging CTV strains cause stem-pitting (deep pits
in the wood under depressed areas of bark) in scion cultivars and
induce stunting and reduced production. Twigs on infected trees are
brittle and break easily when intentionally bent or blown off by wind
under fruit load. Stem-pitting may not be apparent until the bark is
peeled from twigs. Rope-like external symptoms can also be caused by
stem-pitting strains in grapefruit tree trunks and/or sweet orange
scions. Stem-pitting of scions caused by CTV results in decline but
does not usually cause tree death. The economic impact of these
strains results from reductions in tree size and vigor, and reduction
in fruit set, size, and quality. Stem-pitting is especially severe in
limes and grapefruit, but can affect some sweet oranges. Mandarins
are commonly tolerant, but some hybrids are affected. These CTV
strains commonly occur in Asia, Australia, Southern Africa, Brazil,
Columbia, Venezuela, and other areas.
Host resistance is probably the single most attractive approach to
control of virus diseases in long-lived horticultural crops such as
citrus, where short-term measures do not give any benefit. However,
development of new citrus cultivars is difficult because the citrus
breeding cycle is usually 8-10 years. Moreover, most citrus cultivars
are highly heterozygous, and the chances of combining virus
resistance with all other essential horticultural features are low.
Genetic engineering offers a means of incorporating virus resistance
into existing desirable cultivars. Introduction of viral genes into
plant genomes to confer resistance is well established in some
systems, e.g. use of CTV coat protein to mediate cross-protection.
Transformation and resistance can be demonstrated in a relatively
short period, but the evaluation of transformed plants for fruit
production is a long-term process.
Mild strain cross-protection has been used successfully in several
locations to reduce losses from CTV stem pitting, but has failed in
others. It is difficult to find isolates that are both mild and
protective and then show that these are not harmful to other
cultivars or crops. This has limited the wider application of mild
strain cross-protection. Our inability to predict or control all
potential hazards has also precluded the preventative use of
cross-protection
Shoot-tip grafting, a technique based on the fact that apical
meristems contains little or no virus, has been used successfully to
produce virus-free citrus plants. It is a powerful tool to free
existing cultivars of virus infection. Continued improvement in
indexing procedures also makes verification of virus freedom much
easier, and augments other regulatory approaches to control. Even
once a virus is well established, selective certification or
regulation to curtail movement of the more severe isolates can be an
effective component of management. Suppression of inoculum sources is
also useful in some situations.
