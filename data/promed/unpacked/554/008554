Suspected Ebola Fever Outbreak: Death Toll Reaches 51
-----------------------------------------------------
Villagers in a remote northern area of the Republic of Congo ran away from
health workers trying to contain a suspected outbreak of the deadly Ebola
[fever] as three further deaths boosted the toll to 51, the country's health
ministry said on Fri 14 Feb 2003.
In reports monitored in Nairobi, Ebola [virus] has not yet been confirmed as
the cause of the deaths in the districts of Kelle and Mbomo, about
800 kilometres north of the capital Brazzaville. But the authorities
suspect the
virus because of the symptoms and because several gorillas died from
Ebola recently and gorilla meat is a key part of the diet of people
in the area. Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever that causes massive
bleeding. It is spread by contact with bodily fluids. There is no
known cure. Blood samples from six of the 51 victims were being
tested in neighboring Gabon with the assistance of the World Health
Organization (WHO) to confirm if the cause is Ebola [virus].
A year ago, 62 people died in a confirmed Ebola outbreak in northern
Congo and across the border in Gabon, according to the WHO. In 1999,
170 people died in an Ebola fever outbreak in northern Uganda and in
1995, the disease killed 265 in the town of Kikwit in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, then known as Zaire.

Suspected Ebola Outbreak: 38 of 51 Deaths Occurred in Village of Ebelangoy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BRAZZAVILLE: The government of the Republic of Congo on Thu 13 Feb
2003 quarantined the Cuvette-Ouest Region due to an outbreak of
hemorrhagic fever, suspected to be Ebola [fever]. "We are still
waiting for lab confirmation, but it looks almost certain that this
is an outbreak of Ebola," Iain Simpson, responsible for media
relations and communications at the Communicable Diseases Programme
of the World Health Organization (WHO), told IRIN from Geneva on Fri
14 Feb 2003. "We are moving forward as though this is confirmed,
assembling a team including case management experts and
epidemiologists to travel to Congo as soon as practicable."
The epidemic has already caused 51 deaths, Minister of Health and
Population, Alain Moka, told a news conference in the capital,
Brazzaville, on Thu 13 Feb 2003. The districts of Mbomo and Kelle
have been the hardest hit. The village of Ebelangoy, where 38 deaths
have already been recorded, is nearly deserted, as residents have
fled towards Kelle and the surrounding area. "The conditions are ripe
for a rapid, large-scale spread of the disease, and we have the worst
to fear," said Moka.
