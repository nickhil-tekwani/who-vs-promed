[Recognizing that the problem of _Streptococcus suis_ infections in humans
will be sought and probably found in areas in China other than Sichuan, the
thread is being changed to Streptococcus suis, porcine, human - China. -

Pig disease found in 5 more cities
--------------------------------------
[Disease caused by] the deadly _Streptococcus suis_ [bacterium] was found
in 5 more cities across Southwest China's Sichuan Province on Fri, 29 Jul
2005. Also, 1 more person was killed by the bacterium, which is carried by
pigs, bringing the total death toll to 32.
The 5 new sites where infections have been found are: provincial capital
Chengdu, Zigong, Suining, Luzhou, and Mianyang. 25 cases were identified in
the 5 cities in the past 3 days. Since the outbreak started on 24 Jun
2005, official reports have previously only identified Ziyang and Neijiang
as affected.
The Ministry of Health said the new cases were discovered as a result of
the local health authorities' strengthened publicity efforts and were not
necessarily new infections.
Chen Nenggang, deputy mayor of Ziyang, said the city has issued more than 2
million posters urging farmers not to slaughter or eat sick pigs.
By noon on Fri, 29 Jul 2005, 163 confirmed human cases of the disease in
Sichuan had resulted in 32 deaths; 24 patients were in a serious condition.

Pig-borne disease found in mainland China
----------------------------------------
A slaughterhouse worker contracted a pig-borne disease in southern China, a
hospital official said Sat, 30 Jul 2005. He was the 1st mainland case
outside the Sichuan province, where 32 farmers have died since Jun 2005
from the illness.
Some 163 confirmed and suspected cases blamed on the bacterium
_Streptococcus suis_ have been found in Sichuan in China's southwest, where
farmers who handled or butchered infected pigs have been sickened in dozens
of villages and towns.
The latest case is a 43-year-old man in Chaozhou, a city in Guangdong
province, which borders Hong Kong and is hundreds of miles southeast of
Sichuan. He "recovered and was discharged," said an official from the
Chaozhou Central Hospital, who would not give her name or any other details.
It wasn't clear whether Chinese health officials believed the case was
linked to the Sichuan outbreak.

[This latter case is likely to be unrelated to the outbreak in Sichuan,
where the total number of cases continues to increase and more localities
appear to be involved. - Mod.LL]
