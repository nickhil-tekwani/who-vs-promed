Fusarium infects Manitoba cereals
---------------------------------
A recent survey of cereal crops shows farmers in Manitoba again need to be
vigilant for fusarium head blight (FHB) when harvesting and storing crops.
Fusarium was found in most crops surveyed, said Andy Tekauz, a plant
pathologist with Agriculture Canada's Cereal Research Centre in Winnipeg.
The average severity in Manitoba wheat and barley crops was 10 and 7
percent, respectively. "That's fairly substantial," Tekauz said, noting
this year's FHB levels are similar to those of 1996, 1997 and 1998.
Wheat fields most affected this year are the ones planted early, said
Tekauz. Those crops were flowering during moist, humid weather, which set
the stage for the disease to flourish. Fusarium head blight can lower
yields, grade and quality of infected fields. The disease can contaminate
the grain with mycotoxins, making it unsuitable for malting or feed.
While the latest survey by Agriculture Canada is a grim reminder of
fusarium's prevalence in Manitoba, there was some encouraging news for
Saskatchewan farmers. Part of the survey included eastern Saskatchewan
from Yorkton south to the Canada-United States border. Tekauz said levels
in that area are down from a year ago. He described them as "very, very
low." Samples for the survey were taken between July 24 and Aug. 3
Suggestions on how to deal with FHB have been provided by Manitoba
Agriculture. They include the following:
Adjusting combine louvre openings and air velocities so as to blow
lightweight, diseased kernels over the back of the combine without losing
too many good kernels.
Because FHB levels often vary from field to field, bin each field's crop
separately to make the most of market opportunities.
Store FHB-crops properly to prevent further mould and toxin development.
FHB-infected wheat infected with a moisture content greater than 14 percent
should be dried using heated air to stop further disease development.
Green feed should have less than 20 percent moisture.
As for silage, grain drying or proper ensiling in an airtight silo will
stop further mould development but will not remove the deoxynivalenol, a
mycotoxin produced by the fusarium mould. Silage contaminated with fusarium
head blight should be tested for its mycotoxin level before feeding.

[Fusarium head blight is caused by at least three species, _Fusarium
graminearum_, _F. culmorum_, and _F. avenaceum_, with _F. graminearum_
being the most prevalent. In Canada wheat, barley and corn are the major
hosts, although infections may occur on oat, rye and forage grasses. The
disease was first recorded in 1884 in England. _F. graminearum_ was first
observed in Manitoba in 1923 but serious outbreaks did not occur until
1984. Additional information on FHB in Canada can be obtained at the
