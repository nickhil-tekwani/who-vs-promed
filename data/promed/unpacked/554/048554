Scab scars wheat crop
---------------------
When it comes to the Northern Plains spring wheat crop, looks may be deceiving.
"There are pretty good stands from the road," says Jim Peterson, North Dakota
Wheat Commission marketing director. However, a walking tour of fields reveals
that leaf diseases and Fusarium head blight have taken more of a toll on some
stands than appears during a "windshield" tour, Peterson says. Peterson said
that once we got into the fields, the crop was "not as good as anticipated."
Crop scouts who participated in the annual tour of spring wheat and durum
fields in northern South Dakota, North Dakota and western Minnesota spent 3
days in late July [2005] walking over hundreds of wheat fields to analyze
yields and quality.
Scouts, farmers and other crops experts say damage to the wheat from Fusarium
head blight, commonly known as scab, appears to be primarily in northeast
North Dakota and northwest Minnesota fields [which share a common border. -
Mod.JW]. While the crop was planted early and had potential to be excellent,
excessive rains, heat and high humidity trimmed yields, Peterson says. "We
just didn't get some of those breaks along the way to help keep it at the top."
In Grand Forks County, where record June rains fell in some areas, scab is the
most severe it has been in 5 or 6 years, says Ken Nichols, Grand Forks County
extension agent. The disease is worrying farmers, because they know it will
result in fewer bushels in the hopper, Nichols says.
Because the excessive rains and heat were prevalent in June, scab appears to
have had a greater effect on wheat yields than on wheat quality, says Marcia
McMullen, North Dakota State University Extension Service plant pathologist in
Fargo. When the disease hits early in the flowering period, it prevents the
wheat heads from completely filling or produces shriveled kernels, thus less
wheat is delivered to the combine hopper. That's in contrast to the quality
damage that results when scab hits later in the flowering period, McMullen
explains.
In northwest Minnesota, early wheat harvest reports indicated that wheat
quality is pretty good despite the most severe scab infestation the area has
had in 10 years, says David Torgerson, Minnesota Association of Wheat Growers
spokesman. Farmers hope that will remain the case when harvest gets into full
swing during the next week. "They're hopeful they'll be able to blow out
scabby kernels and end up with decent quality in the trucks."
However, northwest farmers are anticipating lower average yields than the
record breaking 58 bushels per acre they produced in 2003 or the 55 bushel-per-
acre crop they harvested in 2004, Torgerson says.
"We were set up in April and May (so) we could have had those high yields
again. Conditions were right, then we started getting rains." The rains
knocked down the yield potential one notch and scab lowered it another,
Torgerson says.
In western North Dakota, hot temperatures appear to have reduced yields in the
early wheat crop, Peterson says. Although double or triple the amount of rain
fell in the west this year than fell last year, harvest test weights are
lighter, and yields are lower that farmers anticipated, Peterson says. Last
year, aided by cool temperatures, farmers' wheat fields produced yields of 25
to 30 bushels per acre.

[Wheat scab has plagued some farmers in the northern plains states of the
United States and some provinces in Canada. Farmers are concerned about the
lower quality of the wheat crop, especially after experiencing 2 successive
years of high yields. They will have to do a good job of seed cleaning to
maximize their yield. Wheat scab (a.k.a. scab or head blight) is caused by
fungi in the genus _Fusarium_, mainly _F. graminearum_, _F. avenaceum_, _F.
culmorum_, and _F. nivale_. These Fusarium species are all asexual forms that
produce only conidia. The sexual stage is _Gibberella zeae_.
Scab-infected wheat seed that is planted may develop root rot as well. These
Fusarium fungi are ubiquitous and unfortunately can also cause a seedling
blight and stalk, ear, and root rot of corn. A major concern is the presence
of several important mycotoxins that can be produced in grain affected by
scab. These toxins are produced by growth of the Fusarium fungi in the
kernels, and ingestion of them can cause vomiting, nausea, dizziness,
diarrhea, and muscle spasms in non-ruminant animals. Highly sensitive
laboratory tests are currently used to detect mycotoxin contamination in
grain. Thus, the chances of toxic compounds getting into human food is almost
nil. The problem arises when farm livestock are fed uncleaned scabby wheat,
oats or barley. 3 percent or more scabby kernels in feed may be poisonous to
hogs. Hogs fed 10 percent or more scabby grain may vomit and refuse to eat the
grain mixture. Cattle, sheep and mature poultry are much less susceptible to
the mycotoxins. These toxins are quite stable and may remain in grain stored
indefinitely.
Disease management involves crop rotation with legumes or other non-cereal
crops; planting only seed that has been thoroughly cleaned and treated with
recommended fungicides; using deep plowing to completely cover crop residues
so as to reduce head-blight infections; and planting less-susceptible wheat
cultivars where possible.
