Death of 34 herons generates an alert because of avian flu
-----------------------------------------------
Territorial Council in Generalitat Valenciana activated last Saturday
[4 Feb 2006] its protocol for the handling of a suspected outbreak of
avian flu, following the discovery of 34 dead herons. The dead birds
were found in Acequia Real del Jucar.
Though the 1st performed tests have ruled out avian influenza,
samples have been sent to Madrid for the confirmation of the negative
results.
Last Friday [3 Feb 2006], a group of environmental agents from the
Territorial Council detected "elevated mortality" of cattle herons
(garcilla bueyera, in Spanish) in Acequia Real del Jucar, within the
Municipality of Guadassuar (Valencia). The agents picked 3 carcasses,
which were transported to the Fauna Recovery Center in El Saler. Once
in the center, the Natural Environment's General Management decided
to activate, "as a precaution measure," the said protocol.
In addition to the 34 samples taken by technical personnel from the
Territorial Council, the Generalitat contacted the Nature Protection
Service (SEPRONA, according to its Spanish initials) of the National
Police in order to perform an exhaustive analysis looking for the
cause(s) of death in this group of birds. This department will
investigate during the next days whether water contamination was to
blame, or whether another infective agent is present in the area.
1st results of the necropsies were inconclusive: the birds were in a
good nutritional condition without visible respiratory infection
signs. Specialists added that 3 of the birds showed hemorrhagic
gastroenteritis to different degrees.
"Initially, a respiratory viral infection -- which might indicate
avian flu -- is ruled out," the preliminary reports concluded.
However, they add that samples have been prepared in order to be sent
to different Madrid laboratories for final diagnosis.
