State investigating whooping cough outbreak
-------------------------------------------
State health officials have reported more than 40 confirmed cases of
whooping cough after an outbreak was first seen in Georgetown County 3
months ago. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)
said on Tuesday that there are 15 more probable cases of whooping cough, or
pertussis. Over 300 people who have come in close contact with the patients
have begun taking antibiotics as a preventive measure.
Those 300 people include school and day care workers as well as household
members who have come in contact with a coughing patient, said Dr Robert
Ball, an infectious disease consultant and epidemiologist at DHEC's
Waccamaw and Trident public health districts. Hugging, kissing, and sharing
cups, utensils, and food can also spread the highly contagious disease of
the respiratory system.
Ball urged parents to make sure children are up-to-date on required
vaccinations, particularly for whooping cough. "The patients are in
treatment, and there have been no complications," he said. "While the
number of actual cases and those under preventive treatment are high, we
feel the actions of everyone involved have reduced the chances of more
infections and serious illness, especially in the elderly or very young."
Those most at risk are children younger than 12 months who may not be
vaccinated. Shots are recommended at 2, 4, and 6 months and at 12 to 18
months with a booster after age 4 but before entering school. Severe cases
[may suffer] pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and even death. From 6 to 21
days after exposure, patients suffer a runny nose and cough. That may
progress to whooping, a coughing spasm that ends in a prolonged,
high-pitched intake of breath.
Whooping cough is caused by bacteria [_Bordetella pertussis_] found in the
mouth, nose and throat of an infected person. Ball said it's usual to see
outbreaks of pertussis throughout the country each year, but it's unclear
where the disease originated this year. The first cases of the outbreak in
Georgetown were seen in early May 2003 and continued into July. Related
cases have been found in Horry, Williamsburg and Charleston counties, but
Georgetown has had more than 30 confirmed cases. South Carolina had just 48
pertussis cases in 2002. Greenville County had the most with 8, while
Charleston and Berkeley counties each had 5.

[The age distribution of cases is not stated in this news report but the
inclusion of school and daycare workers implies that young children are
among the cases. Small outbreaks of pertussis are not uncommon and may
occur in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children (including those
less than 1 year old who have not yet completed immunization) and older
children and adults in whom vaccine immunity has waned. Pertussis can be
troubling and debilitating (presenting as prolonged cough) but is rarely
fatal in this older group. Some apparent outbreaks occur when surveillance
and detection are enhanced. - Mod.LM]
