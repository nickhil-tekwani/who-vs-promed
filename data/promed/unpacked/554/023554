One new polio case is just confirmed in southern Kandahar province, days after nationwide campaign against the crippling disease kicked off on [Mon 18 Feb 2019].

A 60-month-old boy from Ghorak district is infected by the poliovirus. This is the 2nd case reported in 2019, highlighting the ongoing risks of polio and the need for continued immunization, health officials said.

"From today [18 Feb 2019], polio vaccination teams will visit 5.8 million children under 5 years old in 195 high-risk districts of 21 provinces of West, Central, and Southeast regions of Afghanistan," said a statement issued by Ministry of Public Health (MoPH).

The Minister of Public Health Ferozuddin Feroz urged Afghan people to take the situation seriously and called on people to open doors to vaccinators in the upcoming campaign.

"We already have 2 cases reported from Kandahar this year [2019]. While there is polio anywhere in this country, all children are at risk. Polio will continue to fight for survival. Immunization is the only way to put an end to this virus. We urge the people of Kandahar and across the country to step up, open your doors and get your children vaccinated. We don't want to see any more children paralyzed by polio, and we need to work together to stop polio once and for all."

Polio is incurable and can paralyze children for life. The only way to prevent polio virus is to vaccinate all children with 2 drops of polio vaccine every time it is offered. Children are better protected with every additional dose of the vaccination. Repeated vaccination helps to build strong immunity of your child and the whole community.

The vaccination campaign will take place from [18-22 Feb 2019]. Parents should ensure their children are home and available to be vaccinated. All children under 5 should receive the polio vaccine, including children who are asleep, visiting other homes and newborns, even if they have been immunized in the past. Children who miss the vaccination should visit their local health centre as soon as possible, where the vaccine is available free of charge. The polio vaccine is safe, even for sick and newborn children. It is very important these children get the vaccine, because they have lower immunity which makes them more susceptible to the virus. Polio vaccination has also been strongly endorsed by national and global Islamic scholars, the statement added.

Every country in the world except Pakistan, Nigeria, and Afghanistan has ended polio, highlighting the fact that the strategy and vaccines work Twenty-one Afghan children were infected by polio in 2018.

[Sadly, transmission of the WPV continues in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Since the beginning of 2019 there have now been 6 cases confirmed, 4 in Pakistan and 2 in Afghanistan. The vaccination history of this child isn't included in this media report, but most likely the child was inadequately vaccinated at 60 months (5 years) of age. - Mod.MPP
