Three people have been hospitalised with bubonic plague in Kazakhstan.
Authorities believe that the three, all members of the same family,
contracted the disease while butchering the carcass of a slain camel.
This is the third outbreak of bubonic plague in Kazakhstan this year.

[This appears to be a different outbreak from that mentioned in the 13 July
1999 ProMED-mail posting, although the geographic location of these latter
cases is not specified. It's also interesting that this article mentions
two prior plague outbreaks this year. Do any of the ProMED-mail readers
have information on the third outbreak not covered in these ProMED-mail
postings? - MPP
