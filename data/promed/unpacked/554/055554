Sample analysis of the adulterated prasad that claimed 3 lives in Barpeta district [Assam state] last week revealed the presence of fungal growth in the grams and moong beans used in the preparation. Analysts and health experts, however, said the presence of fungal growth alone cannot be treated as a direct cause of death as forensic analysis of the viscera and organs of the deceased is yet to be undertaken.

Two kinds of samples were sent for analysis. One comprised grams and moong beans and the other, the traditional payakh or rice pudding. The Barpeta district administration received the report from the state public health laboratory on Thursday, 26 Mar 2015.

Over 500 people, including women and children, fell sick after consuming the adulterated prasad at a religious ceremony held early last week in Nasattra, a village in the district. The devotees complained of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ailments and dehydration.

"The payakh sample didn't reveal any trace of fungus. There was no presence of pesticides either. Even the water sample was tested and found to be without any trace of fungal growth. The grams and the beans, which showed fungal growth, didn't come from one particular source," said Jayanta Das, food safety officer of Barpeta district.

An analyst at the public health laboratory, Anupam Gogoi, said the samples did not show any toxic or harmful content. "The samples were collected by the district administration from whatever was left of the prasad. The presence of fungus alone cannot be the cause of death. More forensic analysis is required. There has been a considerable gap between the time of preparation of the prasad and the time of testing of the samples," he said.

The Barpeta district administration on 19 Mar 2015 prohibited the sale and distribution of different varieties of grams and moong beans across the district.
