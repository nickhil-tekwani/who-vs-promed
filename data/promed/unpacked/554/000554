Public Health Dispatch: Multiple Human Exposures to a Rabid Bear Cub
at a Petting Zoo and Barnwarming -- Iowa, August 1999
----------------------------------------
On August 27, 1999, a black bear cub, approximately 5-6 months old,
died after several hours of acute central nervous system symptoms;
preliminary test results available on August 28 indicated the bear had
rabies. The bear was part of the Swenson's Wild Midwest Exotic
Petting Zoo in Clermont, Iowa (northeastern Iowa). At the petting zoo,
visitors fed, wrestled, and may have been nipped by the bear. The bear
also was taken to an August 14 barnwarming at the Tharp barn in Holy
Cross, Iowa (eastern Iowa), where it reportedly nipped people. An
estimated 400 people from 10 states (Arizona, California, Florida,
Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, and
Wisconsin) and Australia had contact with the bear cub at either the
petting zoo or the barnwarming during the 28 days before its death,
during which the bear may have transmitted rabies virus.
On the basis of telephone calls to petting zoo visitors who signed the
guest register and provided contact information, approximately 150 of
the 400 persons were exposed to the bear's saliva and need to obtain
vaccine and rabies immune globulin. Public health authorities are
attempting to contact petting zoo visitors by telephone and the Internet.
However, because not all petting zoo visitors signed the register or
provided sufficient information to enable health authorities to locate
them, state and local health departments are encouraged to ensure local
media coverage to alert persons who had contact with the bear after July
30 to the need for exposure assessment. Persons who attended the
barnwarming also need to be assessed for prophylaxis.
Information is available from the emergency telephone number of the
Iowa Department of Public Health: (515) 323-4360.
Reported by: Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology, Iowa Dept of
Public Health.
