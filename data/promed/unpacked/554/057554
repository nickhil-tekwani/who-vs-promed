As of 9pm EDT, Wed 14 Jan, 2009, 448 persons infected with the outbreak
strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium have been reported
from 43 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as
follows: Alabama (1), Arizona (8), Arkansas (4), California (60), Colorado
(10), Connecticut (8), Georgia (6), Hawaii (1), Idaho (10), Illinois (5),
Indiana (3), Iowa (1), Kansas (2), Kentucky (3), Maine (4), Maryland (7),
Massachusetts (40), Michigan (25), Minnesota (33), Missouri (8),
Mississippi (1), Nebraska (1), New Hampshire (11), New Jersey (18), New
York (18), Nevada (5), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (10), Ohio (57),
Oklahoma (2), Oregon (5), Pennsylvania (13), Rhode Island (4), South Dakota
(2), Tennessee (8), Texas (6), Utah (3), Vermont (4), Virginia (20),
Washington (13), West Virginia (2), Wisconsin (3), and Wyoming (2). Among
the 432 persons with dates available, illnesses began between 8 Sep 2008
and 31 Dec 2008. Patients range in age from less than 1 to 98 years; 48 per
cent are female. Among persons with available information, 22 per cent
reported being hospitalized. Infection may have contributed to 5 deaths.

The epidemic curve [on the original URL - Mod.LL] shows that most illnesses
began after 1 Oct 2008. Illnesses that occurred after 14 Dec 2008 may not
yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill
and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2-3 weeks.

[2] Producer recall

Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), a peanut processing company and maker
of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions, food service
industries, and private label food companies, today announced a voluntary
recall of peanut butter produced in its Blakely, Georgia processing
facility because it has the potential to be contaminated with salmonella.

All product affected was produced on or after 1 Jul 2008, specific to the
lot numbers and descriptions listed below. The peanut butter being recalled
is sold by PCA in bulk packaging to distributors for institutional and food
service industry use. It is also sold under the brand name Parnell's Pride
to those same industries. Additionally, it is sold by the King Nut Company
under the label King Nut. PCA customers who received the recalled product
are being notified by telephone and in writing.

None of the peanut butter being recalled is sold directly to consumers
through retail stores.

"We deeply regret that this has happened," said Stewart Parnell, owner and
president of PCA. "Out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily
withdrawing this product and contacting our customers. We are taking these
actions with the safety of our consumers as our first priority."

PCA initiated this recall after an open container of King Nut brand peanut
butter in a long-term care facility in Minnesota was found to contain a
strain of salmonella. King Nut brand peanut butter is produced by PCA.

The voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter, in containers ranging
from five to 50 pounds, is being taken immediately. PCA is notifying its
institutional customers and has set up a toll-free hotline number
1-877-564-7080 to answer questions.

Lot Numbers Affected:
8193, 8194, 8197, 8233, 8234, 8235, 8241, 8255, 8256, 8275, 8276, 8282,
8283, 8284, 8296, 8316, 8330, 8331, 8336, 8345, 8354

[3] Kellogg cracker warning
Date: Thu 15 Jan 2009

Kellogg is trying to determine whether peanut paste in some of its sandwich
crackers is contaminated as part of a salmonella outbreak in Ohio and other
states. The cereal company has asked stores to stop selling crackers sold
under its Austin and Keebler brands.

Kellogg gets at least some of its paste from the Virginia-based Peanut
Corporation of America, which has recalled 21 lots of peanut butter because
of possible contamination. Some of that peanut butter was distributed by
the Cleveland area's King Nut Companies, under the King Nut brand name.
