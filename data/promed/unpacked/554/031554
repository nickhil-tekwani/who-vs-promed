180 foot-and-mouth cases detected in Kyrgyzstan
-----------------------------------------------
Bishkek: Officials have identified more than 180 animals in Kyrgyzstan
infected with Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), in what is thought to be a
second outbreak of the virus this year.
Alexei Yermolov, spokesman for the country's emergency ministry, said 181
animals were confirmed to have the virus, from among 13 000 cattle and 106
000 sheep and goats in the Aktalinsk district of Naryn region.
Some 9500 sheep and goats and 2800 cows in the district have been
vaccinated against the spread of the disease, and 3810 square meters (41
000 square feet) of ground have been disinfected, he said. The remaining
animals were being urgently vaccinated, and 7 villages have been placed
under quarantine, he added.
Local specialists said the situation in Naryn was being brought under
control and there was no need for the mass slaughter of animals. It was the
second incidence of the highly contagious animal virus in the republic
since the beginning of the year and a previous case was discovered in Osh
region. That animal was reported to have come from a neighboring country,
the news agency reported, with Central Asia's porous borders making it
difficult for police to control the movement of cattle.
3 cases of FMD were discovered in Kazakhstan among cattle smuggled from
neighboring Kyrgyzstan.
It is unclear whether the cases are linked to the outbreak which erupted in
Britain nearly 2 weeks ago.
