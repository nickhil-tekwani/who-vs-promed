[1] Cholera - Uganda (Hoima district)

The cholera outbreak was last week [week of 19 Feb 2018] confirmed to have hit Congolese refugees in Kyangwali settlement camp who fled from fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). "We have registered 962 (cholera) cases out of which 29 people have died," said Dr Joseph Ruyonga, the Hoima district health officer on Tue 27 Feb 2018.

The cholera outbreak, which was confirmed by the Ministry of Health, has spread from Kyangwali refugee camp to various villages in Hoima district. Sebagoro, Kyehoro, Kaiso, Nkondo in Kabwooya sub county are among the affected areas.

Dr Nicholas Kwikiriza, a member of the district cholera task force said they have confirmed 2 cholera cases in Busiisi division and 1 case in Kyarwabuyamba cell in Bujumbura division in Hoima municipality. He said the district health office is conducting active surveillance of suspected cases and testing all refugees who are entering Uganda. "We are promoting efforts by people to access sanitation, water and hygiene but there are some communities that have low latrine coverage," Dr Kwikiriza said. He added that the district with the help of development partners is distributing aqua safe tablets which are being used to treat water before consumption in homes.

During a district disaster response meeting on 27 Feb 2018 which was chaired by the Hoima RDC [resident district commissioner], Mr John Stephen Ekoom, the Hoima district secretary of education and health, Mr Mugenyi Mulindambura, asked the central government to use a multi sectoral approach in mitigating the cholera outbreak. He said Uganda's border with DRC is porous which is exploited by people to enter Uganda and settle in local communities without being screened and registered.

"People are coming to our landing sites without being checked. Some have settled on the Lake Albert shoreline where open defecation is common," Mulindambura said. He asked immigration officers to closely work with security officers in screening all refugees and immigrants and ensure that they have sanitary facilities where they settle.

[2] Cholera - Malawi

The country has registered 653 cases of cholera during the current rainy season, the Ministry of Health and Population says. According to the ministry spokesperson Joshua Malango, over the past few days the country has registered 13 new cholera cases taking the number of cases since the outbreak started to 653.

To date, 24 patients are in cholera treatment camps and the deaths are still 12," Malango said. Recently, the Ministry of Health said cholera cases in the country are rising because some people believe the disease is caused by witchcraft. Various international organizations such as UNICEF are working hand in hand with government to alleviate the cholera cases. Malawi minister of health and population Atupele Muluzi warned recently that Malawi will continue to have cholera outbreaks if Malawians do not start to follow prevention measures. The minister said Malawians should make sure they are observing hygiene to prevent the disease. "It is not acceptable to simply throw rubbish out of the window, defecate in the open, or allow your surroundings to fill with detritus. We must work together to clean up our country to eradicate the possibility of diseases like cholera spreading," he said.

[3] Cholera - Kenya (Trans-Nzoia county)

Two people have succumbed to cholera in Kipsongo slums of Kitale town, in Trans-Nzoia county. Confirming the incident, Kitale Referral Hospital medical superintendent Dr Emmanuel Wanjala said 5 of the other 21 patients admitted to the facility had also tested positive for cholera and were under medication. However, 10 have already been discharged from the hospital after their conditions were stabilised.

Dr Wanjala also confirmed that some of the patients were students from the Kitale National Polytechnic. According to the medic, other areas affected by the disease included Lukhuna and Shanti estates in Kitale town. "We have sent a team of public health officers in these areas to assess the situation," he said.

Speaking to the press in Kitale town, the county public health officer Norbert Musundi said they suspected that the outbreak might have been caused by contaminated water. "Most of our sewer lines and water pipes were disrupted by contractors doing work in town and there is a possibility of pollution of water by fecal matter," he said.

Musundi noted the sewerage treatment works in Kitale town have been defective for a long time with the treating filters failing causing blockage and bursting of those pipes, thus discharging sewage that leads to contamination. He also said public health officers were following leads on hawking of food, especially in open-air markets and packaging after the ban on plastic papers. "With the ban of plastic bags, we don't know what these people are wrapping their foods and fruits with which might cause disease outbreak," he added.

The health officer said they were also tracing contacts of patients admitted to the hospital and those who have been discharged to unravel the cause of the outbreak. "We are also collecting samples from water sources and discharge from water treatment works to check whether it might be a source of contamination to our water," he added.

Two people have died and more than 40 been admitted [to hospital] after a suspected cholera outbreak in Nyaga village, Gatanga, Murang'a county. 35 [have been] admitted to Thika level 5 hospital while 11 are being treated at Kiunyu dispensary following the outbreak on Sun 25 Feb 2018.

According to Health CEC [county executive in-charge] Joseph Mbai, 8 out of the 225 residents screened have been confirmed to carry the cholera strains. Mbai has also directed all eateries to close down as the county government fights to contain the outbreak. "We are still appealing to all residents of this village to come out for screening," Mbai said, noting that those who are too weak to reach the dispensary are being ferried using ambulances.

A team of water experts from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation have, however, collected samples from Gathwariga river for testing. Residents had expressed fears that the disease had emanated from the river after a construction company that is tarmacking the Kiunyu Nyaga road destroyed water pipes, cutting off their tap water.

The health officials have collected samples from other water sources such as boreholes to establish where the disease spread from.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
