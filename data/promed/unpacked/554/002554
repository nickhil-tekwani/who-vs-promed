Elephant virus at St Louis Zoo has all zoos worried
---------------------------------------------------
The virus that has a 2 year old St Louis Zoo elephant fighting for her life
is a medical mystery. Scientists do not know how it is spread. They do not
have a proven cure. The virus is often fatal. It seems to target the young.
Since 2000, it has killed about one in 5 elephant calves born in US zoos,
according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

Because breeding elephants in captivity is so difficult and so important to
the endangered species, the virus is especially troubling. "It is probably
one of the biggest problems that zoos are dealing with right now" with
their elephant populations, said Mike Crocker, superintendent of Dickerson
Park Zoo in Springfield, Missouri.

Dickerson has been hard hit by the virus, a herpes infection unique to
elephants that can cause extensive internal bleeding. Three elephants at
Dickerson have died from it, most recently an elephant named Nisha in 2007.
A 4th elephant died shortly after moving to a California zoo. But Dickerson
also claims one of the rare virus survivors: Chandra, who was treated
successfully with antiviral drugs in 1997.

At the St Louis Zoo, home to 8 elephants, Jade is the institution's 1st
case. She was diagnosed late Tuesday [10 Feb 2009]. But drug treatments
were started the day before, when her behavior changed. "She was not as
exuberant, she showed a little stiffness," assistant general curator Bill
Houston said Thursday [12 Feb 2009].

Elephant keepers are trained to watch for behavioral clues because those
are often the virus' sole outward sign. Tests can detect it only after
signs have appeared. And then it is a race against the clock. "All we know
about the illness is that the sooner you jump on it, the better chance you
have of solving it," Houston said.

Jade, who is being held from public view, was in stable condition Thursday
[12 Feb 2009]. "She's still responsive," Houston said. "She's still up and
around. She's still eating."

The St Louis Zoo has suffered virus scares in prior years. In 2001, the zoo
gave antiviral drugs as a precaution to Rani, Jade's mother. But tests
showed she did not have herpes.

The virus typically plays out in about a week.

Researchers identified the virus in 1995 while trying to learn what killed
a 16 month old baby elephant at the National Zoo in Washington. One of the
co-discoverers was Dr Laura Richman, who oversees the National Elephant
Herpesvirus Laboratory.

Richman said scientists still do not understand why elephant herpes remains
hidden in some animals but causes life-threatening disease in others. Asian
elephants appear more susceptible than African ones. Both wild and captive
animals have been found with the virus, Richman said.

But a California-based zoo watchdog group, In Defense of Animals, argued
that Jade's case -- and other elephant herpes incidents -- illustrates some
of the problems with keeping elephants in captivity, even though the virus
is not fully understood.

Jade's case was being followed by researchers and zoo officials across the
nation, both because they are rooting for the young elephant to pull
through, and also because her survival could help the entire elephant
population. "If we're going to provide a hedge against Asian elephant
extinction," said Steve Feldman, spokesman for the Association of Zoos and
Aquariums, "we're going to have to solve this problem."

through. More importantly we hope a cure is found for this disease in all
elephants. - Mod.TG
