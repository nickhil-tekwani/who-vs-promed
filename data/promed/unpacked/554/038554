Patients tests positive for swine flu
-------------------------------------
A case of swine flu was confirmed at the PGIMER [Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, in Chandigarh] on Wednesday [2 Jan 2013]. The 23-year-old patient, a resident of Saharanpur in UP [Uttar Pradesh], was admitted to the hospital last week.

In addition, 2 patients, one from Patiala and another from Ambala, have been suspected to have contracted the H1N1 [influenza] virus. Both the patients were admitted to the PGIMER last week.

Last year, a number of H1N1 influenza cases were reported in Pune (226) and the virus claimed a total of 38 lives across India. The spread of the swine influenza A (H1N1) virus is thought to occur the same way that seasonal flu spreads. The influenza spreads from person to person through respiratory route. If a person already infected with the virus coughs, sneezes or even talks or sings loudly, he or she generates aerosols or droplets of saliva with virus particles in it.

Advisory:
---------
If you are sick, limit your contact with other people as much as possible. Do not go to work or school if ill. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Put your used tissue in the waste-basket. Cover your cough or sneeze if you do not have a tissue. Then, clean your hands and do so every time you cough or sneeze.

Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. Wash with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand cleaner. Wash your hands with soap and warm water for 15 to 20 seconds. When soap and water are not available, alcohol-based disposable hand wipes or gel sanitizers may be used. If using gel, rub your hands until the gel is dry. The gel doesn't need water to work; the alcohol in it kills the germs on your hands.

[It is stated that: "The spread of the swine influenza A (H1N1) virus is thought to occur the same way that seasonal flu spreads." It is presumed from this statement, therefore, that the outbreak strain is the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. However clarification of this point would be welcomed.

The most recent WHO influenza global update (Influenza (112): WHO update 20121210.1445344) contains no information regarding the current situation in India.

Chandigarh is a city and union territory in India that serves as the capital of two states, Haryana and Punjab. It can be located in the map of Idian cities at: http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/cities/india-map-with-cities.html. - Mod.CP]
