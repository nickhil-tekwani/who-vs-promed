Russia's growing epidemic of chronic hepatitis C
------------------------------------------------
"I don't know where to get the money from, treatment is too expensive," said one man, who lives in Saint Petersburg. He has been newly diagnosed with hepatitis C and is in need of treatment to reduce the risk of developing liver cancer and cirrhosis. "But the money for medication isn't available to normal people."

This is the plight of many Russians diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C. More than 4 million people in the country have the virus, where without medication, the risk of scarring of the liver due to long-term damage is up to 30 percent within 20 years. While drugs have been available to cure hepatitis C for some time, patent barriers and sky-high prices of oral treatments have priced many out of treatment. The most vulnerable groups susceptible to the virus -- the poor and those injecting drugs -- are left to await their fate.

"The incidence of acute hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection has been decreasing since 2000 and has stabilized since 2008 at the level of 1.5 per 100 000 population," says Tsvetelina Parvanova, of the World Health Organization. "However, the incidence of chronic HCV infection has appeared to increase over the last 10 years -- reaching 58.5 per 100 000 population."

Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus, a blood-borne virus that is largely spread through sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. In Russia, where between 2 and 3 million are estimated to inject drugs, the crisis is accelerating. "Currently, the majority of new hepatitis C infections occur among people who inject drugs," Parvanova says. "This group is also the most affected when it comes to the prevalence of chronic HCV infection, which range between 45 and 90 percent in different regions of the country.

"Chronic hepatitis C infection in Russia has grown alongside the socioeconomic crisis that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. As poverty levels rose, the healthcare system collapsed and the number of drug users soared -- allowing rates of infection with hepatitis C, HIV and tuberculosis to surge.

Russia has high rates of hepatitis C and HIV fuelled by injection drug use. Both hepatitis C and HIV -- Russia's other epidemic -- are fuelled by the country's high number of injection drug users. While HIV rates have declined globally, they have increased in Russia: from 170 000 a decade ago to around 1.2 million today. Experts place much of the blame on the Kremlin, pointing to its long-standing ban on methadone used globally in heroin addiction treatment.

"The risk factors are the same for hepatitis C and HIV because they are both blood-borne viruses, so viruses which can be contracted by blood-to-blood contact," a spokesperson from the Hepatitis C Trust told IBTimes UK. "So therefore the risk groups and risk factors are the same, such as injection drug users who share needles or drug users who share any sort of drug equipment. Hepatitis C and HIV can both be transmitted that way and there is a relatively large proportion of people who are co-infected with both viruses."

One of the key issues driving the spread of chronic hepatitis C is a lack of harm reduction interventions aimed at drug users -- which have proved fundamental in bringing down rates of hepatitis and HIV globally. Methadone -- used in Opioid Replacement Therapy to wean users off heroin -- is banned in Russian clinics, despite it being included on the WHO's list of essential medicines. Under Russian federal law, those who use or distribute the heroin substitute face up to 20 years in prison. Clean needle exchange programs are rare. Such programs used to be financed by the Global Fund, an NGO tackling the transmission of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, but stopped when the country withdrew from the fund in 2010. The move, viewed by critics as an entirely political attempt by the Kremlin to crack down on the operation of foreign NGOs in the country, has done nothing to help curb the spread of hepatitis C through drug equipment.

[Without an effective hepatitis C vaccine, controlling HCV in the illicit drug injecting population in Russia requires the same methodology mentioned in the post that is discussed in a number of recent posts about hepatitis C in the same cohort in the USA: providing counseling and rehabilitation and clean needle exchange programs. - Mod.LL
