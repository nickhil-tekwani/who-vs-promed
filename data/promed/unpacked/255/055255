New Zealand authorities confirmed the detection of Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) on a batch of watermelons from the Northern Territory and suspended cucurbit imports on August 20. [The following] week, NZ amended its requirements to allow fruit from CGMMV-free areas in Queensland to enter the country.

Dianne Fullelove, Australian Melon Association, said the infected fruit came from a farm found to have CGMMV in 2014. Australian biosecurity only regard plant matter and soil as methods to spread the virus, whereas NZ authorities include fruit. As a result, Australian fruit was not checked for CGMMV before it was exported to NZ.

The Department of Agriculture has now agreed to certify all Australian curcubits exported to NZ [as] produced on a farm certified CGMMV-free. The NZ Ministry for Primary Industries has agreed to accept [these] clearances. Ms Fullelove said the industry was working to reopen the cucurbit trade with NZ as soon as possible.

[_Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is a major pathogen of cucurbit crops with reported yield losses of around 15 per cent. The virus has a narrow host range. Many strains, including the type strain occurring in Europe, are limited to Cucurbitaceae, but some isolates have been reported which can also affect a number of species in other families, including Amaranthaceae and Solanaceae. Symptoms vary in different host species and may be masked in field crops. In cucurbits, they may include severe leaf mosaic, deformation of vines and leaves, as well as internal fruit symptoms such as discolouration and rotting of flesh.

CGMMV is both seed and pollen transmitted. It is extremely stable and can also be spread by mechanical means (human activities, insect damage, plant-to-plant contact), with contaminated agricultural tools, infected plant material, contaminated soil and in water. Spread by specific insect vectors appears doubtful. Disease management may include removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitary practices and use of certified clean seed or other planting material. Transgenic rootstock lines of some cucurbit crops (such as watermelon) with resistance to CGMMV have been or are being developed.

Considering the multiple pathways known for transmission of the virus, NZ would be totally justified to include cucurbit fruit as possible sources of introduction of CGMMV. In Australia, CGMMV has been detected repeatedly in Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland in cucurbit crops (including watermelon, pumpkin), cucurbit seedlings (for example, cucumber) and a number of weed hosts (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below).
