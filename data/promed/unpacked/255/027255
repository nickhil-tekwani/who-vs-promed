Indonesia: Release of samples as avian influenza toll mounts
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia announced 3 more human deaths from bird flu Wed 28 Mar
2007, a day after it agreed to resume sending virus samples to
international researchers on condition they wouldn't be made freely
available to commercial vaccine makers.
Indonesia, the nation hardest hit by the H5N1 bird flu virus, had
stopped sharing samples with the World Health Organization because it
feared its strain would be used to develop vaccines unaffordable for
poor nations in the event of a pandemic. "Now, we have the right to
directly face the companies to negotiate to get what we want," Health
Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said, adding Indonesia would resume
sending viruses immediately. "We trust WHO will not violate our
trust, because this is related to the WHO's credibility." Indonesia
had been sharply criticized for withholding its virus samples.
International scientists said that without the latest specimens, they
could not monitor the virus to see whether it was mutating into a
more dangerous form.
Underscoring the danger the virus poses to the country, 3 more people
-- including a 15-year-old boy -- were confirmed to have died from
the virus, officials said, bringing the number of fatalities in the
country to at least 69 [63 according to the WHO Table of confirmed
cases as of Wed 28 Mar 2007. - Mod.CP]. Two of the latest victims
lived on different parts of Java island, whereas the 3rd died on Sumatra.
Bird flu has killed at least 169 people since it began ravaging Asian
poultry stocks in 2003, according to WHO
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2
007_03_28/en/index.html>.
It remains hard for people to catch, and most human cases have been
linked to contact with sick birds. But experts fear that if the virus
changes into a form easily transmissible among people it could spark
a pandemic that could kill millions in countries around the world.
The announcement by Supari and WHO's top flu official Dr. David
Heymann that Indonesia will resume sharing viruses followed 2 days of
meetings in Jakarta between them and health officials from 18
countries. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged the delegates on
Wed 28 Mar 2007 to agree on fairer ways to distribute anti-bird flu
medicines and vaccines, saying that the poor countries currently
worst affected by the virus were getting a bad deal. "We need to gear
the world's preparedness and response mechanism around a new
paradigm, which puts equality between countries at the center of our
defense strategies," he told the meeting, due to end Wednesday. "It
is our duty to work together to ensure that a pandemic does not
happen in our time."
For months, Supari has been demanding that WHO change its 50-year-old
virus sharing system, in which it collects regular flu samples from
all over the world and makes them available to vaccine makers and
others. She said Wed 28 Mar 2007 she stopped sending samples to "open
the eyes of the world" to current inequalities. "Only 10 percent of
the world's population is concentrated in Europe and North America,
yet that part of the world holds 90 percent of the production
capacity for influenza vaccines," she told the delegates. "In the
event of a crisis, the majority of developing countries would have no
access to vaccines during, and possibly after, the 1st wave of a pandemic."
WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said under the new deal, viruses would
still be monitored in the same way, but any company interested in
using viruses for vaccine development would now be required to work
directly with the country of origin to receive permission for use.
Indonesia's decision to withhold the virus samples had received
support from some other poor nations, while some international
experts said it had raised an important issue: the need for equal
access to drugs and technologies. The meeting is discussing several
ways to ensure a fairer distribution of vaccines, among them,
creating stockpiles of vaccines for use in poor countries and
transferring technology so they can produce their own.
Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country, is seen as a
potential hot spot for a pandemic strain of bird flu to emerge
because of its high density of people and chickens. The sprawling
nation has been criticized for failing to take the threat of the
virus seriously, but the U.N.'s top bird flu official praised the
country's efforts when he last visited in February 2007.

Egypt: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 12
-----------------------------------------------
As of 28 Mar 2007, the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population has
announced 2 new human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection. The cases have been confirmed by the Egyptian Central
Public Health Laboratory and by the US Naval Medical Research Unit
No.3 (NAMRU-3).
The 1st case, a 6-year-old girl from Qena Governorate, was admitted
to hospital on 25 Mar 2007 with symptoms. The 2nd case, a 5-year-old
boy from Menia Governorate, was also hospitalized with symptoms on 25
Mar 2007. Both children remain in a stable condition. Initial
investigations indicate exposure to sick birds in both cases.
Of the 29 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 13 have been fatal.
