A Los Angeles seafood company is voluntarily recalling its smoked and dry vobla fish because it may be contaminated with a bacteria that can cause botulism. LA Star Seafood Co. Inc. said in a release Wednesday, 25 Apr 2012, that it is recalling 20-pound bulk boxes of the salt-cured fish that is popular in many Russian households and beer restaurants.

The boxes are not vacuum-packed, have no lot numbers, and no expiration dates. The company says the fish were improperly eviscerated, leaving them vulnerable to contain spores of the botulism bacterium. Customers who purchased the fish between 28 Feb 2012 and 23 Apr 2012 are urged to destroy or return the products.

The products were distributed and sold in Utah, Oregon, Colorado, and California.

[Vobla, also spelled wobla, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vobla) is a Russian word for a fish called the Caspian roach (_Rutilus caspicus_, formerly recognized as subspecies of the common roach). Salt-dried vobla is a common Russian meal or snack that goes well with beer. It is popular in many Russian households and beer restaurants.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated [yet] with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
