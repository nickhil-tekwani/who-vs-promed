1st case of ASF in wild boar in Poland
--------------------------------------
The Chief Veterinary Officer has received the official results of the laboratory tests confirming the identification of genetic material of the African swine fever [ASF] virus in a sample obtained from a dead wild boar. No case in domestic pigs has been found so far. ASF virus does not infect humans.

Samples were collected on 13 Feb 2014 from a dead boar found, within the framework of the ASF Monitoring Programme, in the municipality of Szudzialowo [Sokolka county, Podlaskie Voivodeship (province)], about 900 meters [0.6 mi] from the border with Belarus.

The District Veterinary Office in Sokolka has already taken appropriate action on 15 Feb 2014; this, in view of the epidemiological situation in [neighbouring] Belarus.

Following the instructions of Poland's Chief Veterinary Officer, the provincial Veterinary Office of the Warmia-Masuria province has undertaken, since February 2011, a surveillance for ASF encompassing wild boars and dead/culled domestic pigs, within a 40 km [25 mi] wide zone along the border with Russia's Kaliningrad oblast. Since the beginning of March 2012 a similar programme has been put in operation in 40-km wide zones along the borders with Lithuania, the Republic of Belarus, and Ukraine, as well as refresher ASF training for veterinary practitioners and state veterinarians working in the Veterinary Inspection and for pig farmers.

Following the detection of ASF in Belarus, since July 2013, Poland introduced a countrywide preventive program aimed at early detection of infection with the ASF virus and increased knowledge about the risk of the disease in the territory of the Polish Republic.

The said program has been continued during the current year [2014].

The Veterinary Inspection is maintaining close contacts with the Polish Hunting Association, the Border Guard, and the General Directorate of State Forests, to facilitate the transmission of information about wild pigs found dead and the performance of prescribed official duties by the said institutions, particularly in border areas.

More information will be announced tomorrow (18 Feb 2014) by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Stanislaw Kalemba, now in the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries of the EU in Brussels. The ASF issue is among the subjects discussed in the said meeting, at the request of the Polish and Lithuanian delegates, with the participation of EU Commissioners Dacian Ciolos and Tony Borg.

[Since ASF penetrated Russia from Georgia in November 2007, the virus has become established in most of western Russia from south to north. It has already spread to Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania. Its penetration to Poland by wild boars is not surprising.

Poland is the 2nd EU member to become infected, following Lithuania. ASF introduction into an EU Member State necessitates intra-community measures to prevent its further spread. The updated measures to be applied in such a scenario have been included in the recently (14 Jan 2014) published EC working document SANCO/7138/2013, titled: "Guidelines on surveillance and control of African swine fever in feral pigs and preventive measures for pig holdings" available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/sanco_7138_2013_asf_wb_en.pdf.

Poland, an important pork exporter, maintains a swine population (OIE's 2012 data) exceeding 17 million domestic pigs (density 54.9/sq.km) in 280 146 establishments,. There is a significant wild boar population as well. - Mod.AS
