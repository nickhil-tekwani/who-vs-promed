Update on the Avian Influenza situation as of 23 Dec 2005
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Latest information on Avian Influenza
2 years have passed since the 1st case of Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was reported to OIE from the Republic of Korea
on 12 Dec 2003. The disease has spread from Southeast Asia to the
north-west involving Quinghai Lake, Xinjang Province in China,
Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Romania, Turkey, Croatia, and now has
also been confirmed in Ukraine. Meanwhile, some countries in EU have
decided to relax control measures since the wildfowl migration for
this winter, which is regarded as a high risk factor, is reaching an
end.
2.Country situation
a. Europe.
Ukraine (22 Dec 2005):
Massive deaths of poultry started on 25 Nov 2005 in near Sivash Lake,
on the Crimean Peninsula, and preliminary testing confirmed the
presence of avian influenza virus of sub-type H5 on 8 Dec 2005. It
was later confirmed as HPAI H5N1 by a Laboratory in Russia and by
VLA-Weybridge, UK. The disease has so far spread to at least 27
villages on the Crimean Peninsula. On 3 Dec 2005, the President
decreed a state of emergency in the Peninsula and the Government made
available about 5 million dollars for compensation to poultry
breeders on 4 Dec 2005.
Control measures imposed include quarantine of infected properties,
the creation of sanitary cordons of approximately 3 km radius and
prohibition of the sale of backyard poultry and poultry products in
the Crimea. Outbreaks in Dzhankoyskiy, Nizhnegorskiy and Sovetskiy
Districts were reported to OIE on 5 Dec 2005. Since then,
veterinarians and soldiers have seized and culled more than 67 000
domestic fowl, including chicken, geese, ducks and turkeys in
affected villages.
Romania (22 Dec 2005):
In November, AI sub-type H5 outbreaks were reported in 7 swans, a
chicken and a turkey in Calarasi and Braila counties, and H5N1 was
confirmed in samples from Calarasi and Braila Counties by
VLA-Weybridge. During December, the disease was further reported in
chickens and ducks in Braila, Buzau, Calarasi, Ialomita and Tulcea
(near the border with Ukraine) Counties. Romania has been conducting
surveillance by sampling of 1200 birds every week. The Ministry of
Agriculture urged villagers to keep their poultry confined to avoid
contact with migrating birds. Some 53 000 poultry have been culled in
Romania between 7 Oct 2005 and early December. In November, Romania
has collected 150 samples from wild birds, mainly seagulls for virus
isolation testing.
Russia (20 Dec 2005):
Since the last issue of AIDEnews, outbreaks were suspected or
confirmed in Omsk, Tambov, Cheliabinsk, Altai, Kurgan Regions in
November, and in Kurgan, Astrakhan and Kalmykia Regions in December.
In Astrakhan Regions (in the Volga Delta near the border with
Kazakhstan) and in Kalmykia, around 600 dead swans have been found.
Research undertaken by the Russian Vektor Center's zoonotic
infections laboratory indicated differences between viruses isolated
in Novosibirsk Region: virus isolated in the summer/autumn of 2005 is
almost identical to the strain that caused an outbreak in northern
China in spring 2005 but the virus found in the second outbreak was
similar to virus found in Viet Nam in 2002-2003.)
b. South, Southeast and East Asia
China (15 Dec 2005):
Further outbreaks were confirmed in chickens, ducks and geese in 8 of
the 30 provinces/autonomous regions during November and in one in
December. Areas where outbreaks were found are the Fuxin
Municipality, Jinzhou Municipality, Beining City (Liaoning Province),
Zepu County, Urumqi County, Hetian City, Urumqi City, Miquan City,
Shanshan County, Xinyuan County (Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region),
Huainan City (Anhui Province), Jingshan county, Xiaogan city, Shishou
city (Hubei Province), Zalantun city, Molidawa Dawo'er Autonomous
County (Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), Yinchuan City (Ningxia
Autonomous Region), Xiaoyi City (Shanxi Province), Chuxiong City
(Yunnan Province). The most recent case was reported in ducks in
Suichuan County (Jiangxi Province) detected on 6 Dec 2005. The
country decided to vaccinate all 14 billion poultry (raised per
year). According to news media, Chinese officials said that samples
of the oral secretions of pigs have tested positive for bird flu i!
n Xiangtan County, Hunan Province. [This information seems to be
novel. Details on the virus involved will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
There had been 21 outbreaks in China this year, 144 624 birds have
died and 21.1 million have been culled. According to WHO, there have
been 5 human cases of which 2 were fatal.
Viet Nam (21 Dec 2005):
The latest case of HPAI was found on 15 Dec 2005 in a flock of 140
ducks in Ninh Binh Province. Since 1 Oct 2005, a total of 3 702 257
poultry have been culled of which 1 245 072 [were] chickens and 1 980
369 muscovy ducks and [other?] ducks. As of 21 Dec 2005, vaccination
has been implemented in 64 provinces and cities, of which 2 rounds of
vaccination have been completed in 21 provinces. A total of 135.3 and
67.7 million doses have been vaccinated in chickens and ducks
respectively.
Indonesia (30 Nov 2005]:
Outbreaks have been detected in 23 of Indonesia's 33 provinces. H5N1
virus has been discovered in Tsunami-hit Aceh Province in its 3
districts including Pidie. Birds were found infected with avian
influenza virus in 7 of 20 subdistricts in Jakarta. Outbreaks were
also suspected in Tangerang Province, West Java and East Nusa
Tenggara Province, West Timor.

Romania discovered a new outbreak of bird flu in a village 80 km (50
miles) east of Bucharest, indicating avian flu might be spreading
towards the city of 2.5 million people, the farm ministry said on
Friday [23 Dec 2005]. Since October, Romania has found avian flu in
24 villages in and around the Danube delta on the Black Sea, where
the deadly strain of the virus was first discovered 300 km from
Bucharest. "Samples from domestic birds from one small farm in the
Stefan Voda village in Calarasi county tested positive for bird flu,"
the ministry said in a statement.
It said domestic birds in the small farm where bird flu was
discovered were culled and the farm was quarantined, while tests are
being carried out on birds in the whole village. 9 cases have been
confirmed as the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain since October 2005,
and the ministry said it will send 7 more samples from the counties
of Ialomita and Calarasi in the east of the country to a British
laboratory to be tested.

[The newswires from Romania, describing the daily advance of the
disease towards Bucharest, might evoke unpleasant reminiscences of
the introduction in 1996 of another zoonotic virus, West Nile virus,
which caused a major epidemic (352 recorded acute
central-nervous-system infections, 17 fatalities). Though WNV, unlike
avian influenza, is an arbovirus (_Culex pipiens_ was incriminated as
the vector), its initial introduction into south-eastern Romania and
Bucharest was ascribed to migratory birds.
Surveillance activities included avian investigations; interestingly,
only one of 12 Passeriformes sampled, an _Erithacus rubecula_, was
found positive for neutralizing antibody to WN virus, while domestic
fowl had a very high infection rate (see table 4 in: Savage et al,
1999. Entomologic and Avian Investigations of an Epidemic of West
Nile Fever in Romania in 1996, with Serologic and Molecular
Characterization of a Virus Isolate from Mosquitoes. Am. J. Trop.
Med. Hyg., 61(4), pp. 600-611).
The outbreak was confined to 14 districts in the lower Danube valley
and Bucharest. The authors indicate that although the Danube Delta is
home to only about 44 resident species of birds, millions of
migratory birds, representing at least 100 species, move through the
region, many of them summering in northern Europe and Asia, including
Siberia and Mongolia, returning southwards on their fall migration in
August to October. - Mod.AS]
