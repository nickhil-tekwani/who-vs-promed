Dear Dr. Hugh-Jones,
Thank you so much for your response. This afternoon a friend who lives
about 15 miles away had a emu go down yesterday. Couldn't seem to stand.
This morning he is dead and there was blood coming from the mouth. Looks
like it is here.
Thanks again for taking time out from your busy schedule to answer my post.

Before I said OK, you can quote me, I double-checked my facts. The
gentleman said the emu had a bloody stool on Monday night when he went to
feed her, she ate and laid down. When he came home the next night the emu
was dead. He did say it had never been vaccinated. Other emu he has were
vaccinated early on but have not been in the past few years. Also year
before last he had a few emu that had bloody stools but they survived. I
know this is serious and I don't want to steer you wrong but it is
important for farmers to know if it is in their area.

[I have shown this to my avian pathologist colleague Simon Shane who says
it could very well be EEE -- the differential diagnosis would be
salmonellosis and readily checked. So it would appear that EEE may have
reached central Mississippi. Emu owners in the area would be wise to get
veterinary advice immediately. - MHJ
