Recent cases of salmonellosis, a foodborne illness caused by exposure to _Salmonella_ bacteria, have been linked to hazelnuts sold at a farm stand in McMinnville, and state agencies are recommending that people who bought the nuts discard them immediately. Officials at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division and the Oregon Department of Agriculture announced today [6 Jan 2017], that laboratory and epidemiologic analyses traced the salmonellosis cases to hazelnuts sold by Schmidt Farm and Nursery along Oregon Route 18.

"People who have hazelnuts from the farm stand at Schmidt Farm and Nursery should toss them out right away," said Paul Cieslak, MD, medical director of the Public Health Division's Acute and Communicable Disease Prevention Section.

5 people became ill with a specific strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium between 15 Oct 2016 and 13 Dec 2016. When interviewed by public health officials, 3 of the individuals recalled buying hazelnuts from the Schmidt Farm and Nursery stand in McMinnville. The 4th ate hazelnuts from an unlabeled bag of partially shelled nuts. A 5th case was linked to the other 4 cases after having tested positive for the same strain of _Salmonella_. Tests performed on nuts purchased at the farm also identified the same strain of _Salmonella_. All 5 cases were in adults. None of the individuals were hospitalized and all have recovered.

According to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, Schmidt Farm and Nursery sells only a small portion of its hazelnuts at the farm stand. Schmidt Farm and Nursery distributes the bulk of its hazelnuts through wholesalers.

"Wholesalers have steps in place that kill any _Salmonella_ on the hazelnuts they handle before the nuts reach consumers," said Stephanie Page, the agriculture department's director of food safety and animal services. "To date, we have no indication there were any issues with this part of the process. The concern in this case is with hazelnuts bought at the farm stand."

[The hazelnut (or filbert) is unique (http://oregonhazelnuts.org/about/fun-facts/) in that it blooms and pollinates in the middle of winter. Wind carries the pollen from yellow catkins to a tiny red flower, where it stays dormant until June, when the nut begins to form. The nuts mature during the summer months, turning from green to shades of hazel nestled in a protective husk, and are harvested in late September or October after they have fallen to the ground.

It would seem easier for the nut shell to be contaminated as the nuts are harvested after falling to the ground. - Mod.LL
