MALARIA, MEFLOQUINE PROPHYLAXIS
===============================
Date: Mon, 17 Mar 1997 08:38:48 +1000
From: Jonathan Cohen <jcohen@netspace.net.au>
In Australia, there is most certainly a widespread reluctance to use
mefloquine prophylaxis for travellers to Africa as perceived by both travel
agents and health professionals. This has not been helped by recent
publications emphasising the risk of side effects.
At our clinic, we routinely recommend mefloquine because of its obvious
advantages of efficacy and increased compliance however it seems almost as
if there has been a worldwide effort to discourage its use.
It is worthwhile mentioning, anecdotally, that we get a number of complaints
from returned travellers about side effects from doxycycline and chloroquine
but interestingly not from mefloquine.
It may be worthwhile for the ISTM [International Society for Travel Medicine]
to consider endorsing an official recommendation to use mefloquine for those
at risk.

[This message seems to be in response to one about use of mefloquine, or
reluctance to use of mefloquine; I cannot tell. It would be good of people
submitting comments on previously posted items to let us know what items they
