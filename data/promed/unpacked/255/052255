More cases of the serious illness lepto [leptospirosis] are seen by vets around Weld county [Colorado] now.

It used to be in Weld County and Greeley, we had your farm type "outdoor" dogs and your city dogs. The farm dogs were those rough and tumble labs and heelers that worked all day and hunted all weekend. They did chores, herded, chased rabbits, and swam in ditches. This was the group that vets vaccinated against the [bacterial disease] called leptospirosis, commonly referred to as lepto. Since it can be spread by cattle, rats, raccoons, deer, coyotes and other mammals [including other dogs - Mod.TG], and these dogs had plenty of chances for exposure because of the work they did, veterinarians believed it was worth the risk to vaccinate those dogs.

There were a couple downsides: The vaccines available to us in the 1980s and 1990s only covered 2 of the 7 types of lepto, and there did seem to be more likelihood of mild to moderate reactions after the vaccine.

We also didn't have any quick tests to confirm lepto. A 2-step blood test wouldn't turn positive until after 1 to 2 weeks after infected -- not a lot of help in the hospital. A good portion of those farm dogs maybe didn't make the trip into the vet when they got sick. So, we didn't worry a lot about lepto in Weld County.

Now we do. Veterinarians now are seeing lepto with a frequency we have never experienced in northern Colorado. The corn and sugar beet fields became subdivisions in Weld county. All those ditches and patchwork fields give access for wildlife into your neighborhood.

Now we've started seeing much more lepto in the "city" dogs. These are backyard, trail walking, dog park frolicking dogs.

Lepto is caused by bacteria that are spread from the urine of infected animals. These animals can include those listed above, but also rabbits, squirrels, horses, and mice. So yes, pretty much everything. Not every one of these animals gets sick and dies. Many walk around, flagrantly urinating out these bacteria into rivers, ponds, puddles, and the soil.

The bacteria like warm weather and water. Typical highest risk season in our area is August to November, but that can be affected by flooding, prolonged warm weather (like 70 deg F [21 deg C] in November) or urine-saturated soil. (Did you know raccoons choose the same latrine areas to visit over and over?) Louie the Labrador goes sloshing in the Poudre on your weekend walk and is exposed to urine in the water.

An animal will seek out the smelly urine and become infected after licking it. Although the bacteria are killed by exposure to the sun, drying, and most disinfectants, you can't disinfect a river, a puddle, or your soil. So, if the bacteria get there, it's going to live there for a while.

Just like the wild animals, not every dog that gets exposed to lepto will get sick. Some just feel a little down for a day or 2. But, when it hits with full force, lepto can cause bleeding in to the lungs, severe liver and kidney disease, and even failure. Vets are now more vigilant against lepto when we see this combination.

Lepto can also cause bleeding into the lungs and inflammation of the inside of the eyes. Dogs with this severe stage of lepto must be treated in the hospital with antibiotics, IV fluids, and support for the liver. This can be fatal to dogs.

A not-so-fun fact is an animal sick with lepto is shedding the bacteria in the urine and can be contagious to humans. Careful hygiene must be observed. Speaking to your physician is critical if you feel you may have been exposed to an animal sick with lepto.

The good news is the vaccines have come a long way since the 1990s. We now have vaccines that cover 4 of the 7 types of lepto, and reactions from it are generally mild. This can be a lump or sore spot, or maybe a fever for a couple days.

The vaccines are not 100 percent effective, meaning not every dog will be protected against every strain of lepto. Vaccination and risk should be discussed with your veterinary care team, and it is likely they will recommend it for your healthy dog.

In addition, we now have "in-hospital" tests which can more quickly determine if your very sick dog has lepto or not. These are screening tests and have limitations, but it beats the heck out of the old days when we had to wait 2 weeks after your dog was sick to test.

[So, what can you do to protect your dog] from this new fear I just put in your head? Vaccinate if appropriate and don't forget the booster vaccine; keep your dog away from areas that you know are visited by rodents and other wild animals; wait for winter and colder weather, oh and vaccinate, did I already say that?

[Leptospirosis is a disease dogs should be vaccinated against. The article is reasonably comprehensive in its description. Whether you walk your dog in a dog park, visit friends with pets, or swim in the lake, your dog is at risk of this disease. Please contact your veterinarian about having your pet vaccinated.

The population is more mobile, and for many years vaccinations against lepto decreased, which left a na√Øve population all across the nation. A pet from one region can easily bring the disease to another region because of our highly mobile society. Please have your dog vaccinated against this disease. - Mod.TG
