experts and replies are appended. Arthur suggested some follow up which is
being done. As & when & if they reply, their comments will be posted. - MHJ

The report of a negative rabies immunofluorescence in a case of cat rabies
from which the virus was subsequently isolated is disturbing. How often do
such false negative tests occur? How do we continue to make decisions
regarding post exposure prophylaxis based on immunofluorescence results?

As usual, I can't be of too much direct help. I seem to remember an
analysis done a good many years ago, I'm pretty sure by Webster and Casey
in Canada, of a large number of results in which the occasional false
negative was found, but I can't find it. Both Al Webster and Al Casey have
now retired.
I have recently seen the Annual Report of the Ondetepoort Veterinary
Institute for April 1998 to March 1999. Suggested reasons for six first
test negative cases which were subsequently found positive on neuroblastoma
cell isolation are given (from 310 positives/1067 specimens), but I'm not
sure that the report has been published.
As regards the specific case and the concerns of Basil Fine, no one claims
the FAT to be infallible and 100% accurate. When there is suspicion and
human involvement but the FAT is negative, almost everyone does a repeat
FAT on fresh smears (sorry I don't have MMWR.48.RR-1).

A negative immunofluorescence test with a subsequent positive isolation is
very infrequent in our laboratory. However, we have had 2 cases in about
the last 5 years or so in which we've had a cow turn up negative for FAB
and positive for isolation. We use isolation on all large animals (cows,
horses, etc.), "weak positives", and inconclusives to help rule out any
false negatives. We have found that this system works very well. In
addition, we use RT-PCR in conjunction with a restriction digest to type
most rabies virus variants which allows us another means to try and amplify
any suspicious results by either FAB or isolation.
The FAB is definitely still the gold standard and I wouldn't be too
disturbed by this result. I would be more inclined to re-emphasize the
importance of a 2nd set of eyes to look at any suspicious results by FAB
(or 3rd if necessary). We often have very weak positives by FAB that get a
repeat FAB with a different conjugate that helps with the interpretation.
It is also important to consider a contamination problem with the isolation
procedure.
