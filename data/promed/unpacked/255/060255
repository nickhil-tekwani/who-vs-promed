A total of 23 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium have been reported from 9 states. Since the last update, 3 new cases have been reported from Idaho (1) and Ohio (2).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 26 Dec 2011 and 5 Mar 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 91 years, with a median age of 14 years. 39 percent of ill persons are 10 years of age or younger. 61 percent of ill persons are female. Among 20 ill persons with available information, 7 (35 percent) have been hospitalized. One death associated with the outbreak has been reported in Washington.

Illnesses that occurred after 19 Mar 2013 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

Investigation update
--------------------
In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 19 (86 percent) of 22 ill persons interviewed reported contact with pet hedgehogs or their environments before becoming ill. Investigations are ongoing to determine the type and source of hedgehogs that might be linked with illness. Ill persons with available purchase information reported purchasing pet hedgehogs from multiple breeders in several states.

The United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) Animal Care is currently assisting CDC to identify the sources of hedgehogs linked to ill persons. State health departments have also tested additional environmental and hedgehog samples collected from ill persons' homes. The outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium was isolated from Illinois environmental samples of a hedgehog's wheel, ramp, feed area, and bedding as well as from the pet hedgehog's feces. The outbreak strain was also isolated from an Ohio pet hedgehog's feces.

[Since ProMED-mail's last posting regarding this outbreak [see archive no 20130206.1531), there have been 3 more cases reported and 1 more state involved.

A hedgehog (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog) is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae and the order Erinaceomorpha. There are 17 species of hedgehog in 5 genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and New Zealand (by introduction). There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas. Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (order Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated rodent porcupines and monotreme echidnas.

The name hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English heyghoge, from heyg, hegge ("hedge"), because it frequents hedgerows, and hoge, hogge ("hog"), from its pig-like snout. Other names include urchin, hedgepig, and furze-pig.
