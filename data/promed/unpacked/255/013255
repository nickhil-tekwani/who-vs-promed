Increase in hepatitis cases of unknown aetiology in children - multicountry 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 5 Apr 2022, an increase in acute hepatitis cases of unknown aetiology among previously healthy children aged under 10 years was reported by the UK. Most cases identified by the UK presented with symptoms from March 2022 onwards. Since then additional cases have been reported from the EU/EEA and globally.

Update of the week
------------------
EU/EEA:
As of 5 May 2022, approximately 95 cases of acute hepatitis among children aged 16 and under have been reported from 15 EU/EEA countries (Austria [2], Belgium [3], Cyprus [2], Denmark [6], France [2], Germany [1], Ireland [< 5], Italy [35], the Netherlands [6], Norway [2], Poland [1], Portugal [4], Romania [4], Slovenia [1] and Spain [22]). Among these cases, at least 13 have tested positive for adenovirus, at least 3 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 5 cases have required a liver transplant.

On 1 May 2022, according to the Romanian media and a Ministry of Health statement, the 5-year-old child initially reported as having symptoms of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology has been diagnosed with Wilson's disease.

On 4 May 2022, Belgium reported 2 additional possible cases of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology. However, the cases were detected retrospectively and may not qualify under the reporting criteria as laboratory investigations are no longer possible.

Non-EU/EEA:
As of 29 Apr 2022, the UKHSA has identified a total of 145 children, aged 10 and under, with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology. Of these cases, 10 children have received a liver transplant. The cases are predominantly children under 5 years old who initially presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (such as diarrhea and nausea) followed by the onset of jaundice and acute hepatitis. A detailed technical briefing on the investigations among the UK cases was published by the UKHSA on 25 Apr 2022 [and an update on 6 May 2022. - Mod.LL]

Outside of the EU/EEA and the UK, as of 6 May 2022, there are at least 60 cases of acute hepatitis among children. Cases have been reported by Argentina [2], Costa Rica [1], Indonesia [3], Israel [12], Japan [3], Panama [1], Palestine [1], Serbia [1], Singapore [1] and the USA [at least 35] [now > 100 in the USA - Mod.LL]

On 3 May 2022, the media quoting public health authorities reported a death of an 8-year-old child with acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in Palestine. It is unclear at present whether this is the same child that was diagnosed in the previous week. Confirmation of this case is pending.

The total number of cases reported worldwide is approximately 300.

2 possible cases of hepatitis in children identified in Oakland County, Detroit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michigan health officials have identified 2 possible cases of hepatitis in children. The 2 cases are in Oakland County and Detroit, they said.

The 2 patients under investigation in Michigan meet the CDC's inclusion criteria, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

Health department confirms case of child under 5 with acute hepatitis in Puerto Rico
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DH) of Puerto Rico confirmed today, Friday [6 May 2022], that a case of a child under 5 years of age with acute hepatitis is being treated in Puerto Rico. The WHO had warned since last week about rare cases of children with hepatitis of unknown origin in several European countries and in the USA.

The WHO assured last week that the increase in cases of acute childhood hepatitis of unknown origin is a "very urgent" issue to which they are giving "absolute priority." "It is very urgent and we are giving this absolute priority and working very closely with the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control in management and coordination," said WHO Regional Director of Emergencies Gerald Rockenschaub.

Nebraska health officials report 9 cases of liver illness in children
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nebraska health officials Friday [6 May 2022] reported that they are investigating 9 cases of unexplained hepatitis in young children, including 2 in Douglas County and 2 in the health district that covers Sarpy and Cass Counties.

The Nebraska cases are among a total of 109 such cases in 25 states and territories under study by the CDC dating back to October [2021], agency officials said Friday [6 May 2022].

In the USA, more than 90% of children with the condition had to be hospitalized, said Dr. Jay Butler, the CDC's deputy director of infectious diseases. Of them, 14% required liver transplants and 5 have died. More than half had a confirmed infection with an adenovirus that commonly causes cold-like illnesses and gastrointestinal symptoms. Butler noted that adenovirus has not been confirmed as a cause. While rare, children can develop hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver with a range of causes, and it is not uncommon for the cause to be unknown.

The 9 Nebraska cases were identified between [5 Nov 2021] and [6 Mar 2022], according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 9, with a median age of 2. Three tested positive for adenovirus. No liver transplants or deaths have been identified. Lindsay Huse, director of the Douglas County Health Department, said the notification should be more of an alert to parents to keep an eye out for symptoms of hepatitis than a cause for alarm.

Both of the children in Douglas County were hospitalized but have since been released, Huse said.

[More clinically compatible cases continue to be reported -- it is not entirely clear how many of these are newly presenting or being found looking back at past cases over the past few months but the 6 May 2022 UKHSA report suggested new cases are occurring. A timeline of all the cases based on the day of initial symptoms would be very informative.

One possible cause, adenovirus serotype 41, one of the so-called enteric adenoviruses, has not been known previously to cause hepatitis in the immunologically normal host. Whether the finding of adenovirus serotype 41 is an epiphenomenon or the virus is etiologic here is not yet known. In this CDC report related to the Alabama cases (Hepatitis, undefined, global (03): USA (AL) children, CDC, poss adenovirus, 2021-22 20220430.8702942), which were seemingly recognized prior to European cases, no clear evidence of adenovirus in the affected liver tissue was found, and although type 41 was identified by hexon gene sequencing, it is not clear if a whole genomic analysis of the virus has been compared or even can be compared to older adenovirus serotype 41. Hexon is the major surface coat protein of adenovirus.

If the virus is the cause, has the agent acquired additional virulence factors, or is a cofactor involved (virus or toxin)? Are certain children genetically more susceptible to the more severe disease? Metagenomics available so far from the UK has not reported adenovirus but rather adeno-associated virus (AAV)-2. It is unclear what this means (as discussed in the text and below). Posts from Spain and Japan seen above also reported adenovirus type 2 and 1 respectively, not 41. Not all cases have apparently been found to have coexisting adenovirus infection.

It has been known for more than 50 years that AAVs can be isolated from humans since Blacklow NR, Hoggan MD, Rowe WP: Isolation of adenovirus-associated viruses from man. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1967 Oct;58:1410-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.58.4.1410. The children did develop antibodies against AAV as well, but it is unclear what role AAV plays, if any, in human disease. The viruses have, however, begun to be used in gene therapy. AAV2 is now approved for gene therapy for several rare genetic diseases in the UK and USA (Keeler AM, Flotte TR: Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Gene Therapy in Light of Luxturna (and Zolgensma and Glybera): Where Are We, and How Did We Get Here? Annu Rev Virol. 2019 Sep 29; 6(1): 601-621 doi: 10.1146/annurev-virology-092818-015530). Whether AAV2, a virus that can integrate its genome into the human host and exist in this latent state, is related to these cases of severe pediatric hepatitis seems unlikely but more information is needed.

At this point, no major evidence for household clusters has been reported, which one might expect if a foodborne or environmental toxin or transmissible agent was involved, although the UKHSA reports 2 pairs of epidemiologically-linked cases. A link to dog ownership in the UKHSA 6 May 2022 report is noted but of unclear importance at this point as it too would likely result in more clustered cases. Additionally, it remains interesting to know if any asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations were looked for in household contacts. The cases recognized as severe could be the "tip of the iceberg," as we saw with paralytic poliomyelitis when only a small percentage of infections resulted in the classical asymmetrical flaccid paralysis of polio.

For the most part, SARS-CoV-2 has been minimized as a primary player in these cases as many cases in the extensive reports from the UK and USA (Alabama) have not been RT-PCR positive. SARS-CoV-2 infection can certainly cause amminotransferase elevations with or without the therapeutic use of remdesivir. Hepatitis can be a significant manifestation of MIS-C, as documented in Cantor A, Miller J, Zachariah P, DaSilva B, Margolis K, Martinez M: Acute hepatitis is a prominent presentation of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: a single-center report. Hepatology. 2020;72:: 1522-1527. The link to SARS-CoV-2 was not just a RT-PCR or antigen assay but also could be positive antibodies to the virus or contact with a known COVID-19 case. It is not clear from the case presentations available if there was a multi system involvement to make this diagnosis. Individuals with MIS-C present with fever, often accompanied by severe abdominal pain, progressive respiratory failure, and myocardial dysfunction with varying degrees of cardiogenic shock and circulatory failure. It would be useful to know the SARS-CoV-2 antibody status of the children affected by this so far not well etiologically-defined severe hepatitis.
