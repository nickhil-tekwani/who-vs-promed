[This is the 4th immediate notification of avian influenza outbreaks in the Palestinian Authority since the beginning of 2015. The previous notifications were:
1. West Bank: notified 20 Jan 2015, resolved 16 Feb 2015, total 3 outbreaks.
2. Gaza Strip: notified 24 Mar 2015, resolved 24 Mar 2015, total 1 outbreak.
3. Gaza Strip: notified 2 Apr 2015, resolved 12 Apr 2015, total 2 outbreaks,
4. Gaza Strip: notified 15 Aug 2015, continuing; so far, 7 outbreaks.

The 4th, continuing epizootic in the Gaza Strip, reportedly started on 12 Apr 2015. An "immediate notification" was sent on 14 Aug 2015 (report submitted to the OIE on 15 Aug 2015), describing 6 new outbreaks in 6 named locations: Gaza (=Gaza city?), Jabalia, Rafah, Khanyounes, Beit Lahiya, and "The Middle".

The recent 7 outbreaks are spread throughout the small (360 sq km = 139 sq mi) densely populated territory (2014 estimate: 1 816 379; density 5046 per sq km = 13 069.1 per sq mi) of the Gaza Strip, which borders Israel on the north and east, and Egypt (Sinai) on the southwest (see map at http://tinyurl.com/ps5rspv).

The full identity of the so-named "H5" strain (most probably H5N1) and its genotyping results are requested, to confirm -- or (we hope...) exclude -- similarity to the HPAI H5N1 strain currently circulating in Egypt and infecting humans (reportedly, 145 cases in 2015). Controlling the disease, and protecting human contacts, is a challenging task for Gaza's human and animal health authorities in view of the dense human population and the many backyard holdings in both rural and urban areas.

The situation in Gaza is of concern to neighboring territories (see moderator comments in ProMED-mail post 20150817.3584854). - Mod.AS
