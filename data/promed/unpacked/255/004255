Sudan Meningitis Epidemic Spreads

A meningitis epidemic spreading through Sudan has reached alarming levels
in six states, killing at least 233 people, the International Federation of
Red Cross and Crescent Societies reported Thursday. The aid agencies said
1,762 cases have been reported and warned that unless vaccination campaigns
are accelerated, the disease will spread further.
Vaccination campaigns are under way, but a vaccine shortage has prevented
comprehensive coverage in the worst-affected states and people have begun
to panic, it said. Streams of frightened people are now besieging aid
offices, asking for vaccinations.
The disease has reached southern Sudan, where infection rates are expected
to be extremely high due to population movement caused by the African
nation's civil war.
The groups appealed for funds to immunize over 1.3 million people in the
six states, bolster treatment in medical centers and train volunteers to
prevent and identify meningitis. The Red Crescent has been fighting the
disease since the first outbreak was reported in the western state of North
Darfur in December, and is now on full alert in 26 states.
Meningococcal meningitis is an infection of the membranes around the brain
and spinal cord. The illness is spread through direct exposure such as
kissing, sharing utensils, coughing and sneezing. Symptoms include fever,
headache, nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness, and skin rash.

[This thread was originally started because news out of Sudan is scarce, &
in the beginning it wasn't clear whether this outbreak was meningococcal or
viral encephalitis. Now we know it is meningococcal & forms part of the
sad pandemic that sweeps across the "meningitis belt" of sub-Saharan Africa
every year, some years worse than others, always acompanied by vaccine
shortages. In other words, not an emerging disease. So this thread is now
cut - Mod.JW
