Nicaragua's Health Ministry said the outbreak of
leptospirosis in the department of Leon is under
control. To date, 35 cases in 8 municipalities have been confirmed.

La Primerisima radio station reports today [22
Sep 2010] in its website that according to an
official bulletin issued last night [21 Sep
2010], 11 cases were reported in Leon over the
past 2 days in addition to the 22 detected over
the past 8 weeks in this department.

With these cases in Leon, 35 cases have been
reported in the country so far this year [2010],
mostly in people living in rural areas, the radio station said.

The official bulleting quoted by the radio
station describes this epidemiological situation
as an outbreak, which tends to be favored by
climatic conditions characterized by the heavy
and continuous rains with frequent flooding
affecting the country since last May [2010].

It also reminds [readers] that in June [2010]
authorities launched in some localities of the
municipalities with confirmed cases a massive
campaign with "Biorat", an effective biological
rodenticide developed by the Cuban pharmaceutical
laboratory Labiofam, which has been applied with
great success in other countries. Since then the
government has run a comprehensive action plan to
prevent more cases and keeps a close watch on
patients attending health centers with high fever.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease transmitted
by the bacterium _Leptospira interrogans_, which
affects many animals, including mammals, birds,
amphibians, and reptiles, and which can be found
in warmer climates, in fresh water contaminated
by animal urine, especially that of rats.

The disease is common during the rainy season
with flooding and the infection is usually
transmitted to humans when water contaminated by
animal urine comes into direct contact with
lesions on the skin, or through the eyes or mucous membranes.

Outbreaks of leptospirosis are detected with some
frequency in Nicaragua. In 1995, 9 people died
because of the disease in the municipality of
Achuapa, department of Leon. The following year
[1996], in the departmental capital [Leon], a
teenager died and 8 members of one family
contracted the disease. But the most serious
outbreak to date was detected in October 2007, in
the departments of Chinandega and Leon, when 13
331 people were infected and 9 died.

[The news release above states that to control
leptospirosis, Nicaragua is using the rodenticide
Biorat manufactured by Labiofam (Laboratorios
Biologicos y Farmaceuticos), Cuba. This
rodenticide is "reportedly harmless if consumed
by other animals or human beings" (US-Cuba Trade
and Economic Council. Economic eye on Cuba, 22-28
Feb 1999. [cited 2004 Mar 31]. Available from
<http://www.cubatrade.org/eyeonz26.html>).

However, Biorat is a salmonella-based rodenticide
that is made by coating rice grains with a
combination of live _Salmonella enterica_
serotype Enteritidis, phage type (PT) 6a and
warfarin (see Painter JA, et al:
_Salmonella_-based Rodenticides and Public
Health. Emerg Infect Dis 2004 June [date cited].
Available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no6/03-0790.htm>).
_S._ Enteritidis can cause severe diarrheal
illness, which can be life threatening,
especially among children, the elderly, and
immunocompromised persons. The _S._ Enteritidis_
strain found in Biorat is similar to the strain
found in Ratin, a discontinued European product
that caused human illness. Investigators from the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
and Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark
warn against use of Biorat as the Biorat strain
is likely to be as pathogenic to humans as the
Ratin strain (see Painter JA, et al:
_Salmonella_-based Rodenticides and Public
Health. Emerg Infect Dis 2004 June [date cited].
Available from <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no6/03-0790.htm>).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by
any of the several hundred distinct serovars of
the spirochetal pathogen _Leptospira
interrogans_. Leptospirosis is distributed widely
throughout the world in warm climates. The
microorganism can be found in fresh (not salty)
water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been
contaminated by urine from chronically infected
reservoir host animals, such as swine, cattle,
rodents, dogs, and many wild animals. Leptospires
enter the body through open sores or wounds in
the skin, or through mucous membranes following
exposure to contaminated water. Outbreaks
frequently follow large rainfalls, flooding with
fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is frequently an occupational
hazard for rice and sugarcane field workers,
farmers, crawfish farmers, sewer workers, animal
husbandry workers, veterinarians, dairy workers,
abattoir workers, and outdoors people such as
campers, bathers, and sportsmen exposed to
contaminated rivers, canals, or lake waters.

More than 90 percent of patients with
leptospirosis have a mild, self-limited illness,
with fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, cough, pharyngitis, red eyes, skin
rash, and muscle pain, especially in calves and
lumbar region, which is rarely fatal. About 10
percent develop a more severe illness with
myocardial, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic
involvement that may be fatal in 5-40 percent. In
recent studies of patients admitted to hospitals,
about 20 percent die (see
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/513767>
and <http://www.psmid.org.ph/vol31/vol31num4topic1.pdf>).

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of
the clinical presentation of many infections, the
diagnosis of leptospirosis may be incorrectly
made in the absence of laboratory confirmation.

Leon is a department (province) in northwestern
Nicaragua, with a population in 2005 of about 355
000 people
(<http://www.citypopulation.de/Nicaragua.html>).
Leon is also the name of the capital of the Leon
department and is the 2nd largest city in
Nicaragua, after Managua. Leon is an important
industrial, agricultural (sugar cane, cattle,
peanut, plantain, and sorghum), and commercial
center for Nicaragua (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeÃ³n,_Nicaragua>).
