In Colombia, citrus is cultivated in mostly small plantings that total 55
000 ha by approximately 25 000 farmers. Production includes 1200 tons of
fresh fruits and 60 tons of juice for domestic consumption, resulting in a
net worth of US $650 000 per year. Most of the production comes from areas
located between the Cordillera Occidental and Cordillera Central mountain
ranges (departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Quindio, and Risaralda) near
coffee plantations. The departments of Meta and Casanare, located at the
east plains (Llanos Orientales), include a zone parallel (4 to 5 deg N, 72
to 74 deg W) to the east mountain range and generate approximately 10
percent of the total Colombian citrus production. Suspected citrus leprosis
symptoms on leaves and fruits of sweet oranges (_Citrus sinensis_ (L.)
Osb.) were first observed by plant pathologists for CORPOICA (Colombian
National Agricultural Research Organization) in citrus orchards in Casanare
in 2003, and later in 2004, in Meta.
To confirm the visual identification, leaves and fruits from Valencia
sweet orange exhibiting typical lesions of leprosis were collected from
several locations in the departments of Casanare (Yopal, Aguazul) and Meta
(Guamal, Villavicencio, and Cumaral). Samples were fixed in
cacodylate-buffered paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde solution and
subsequently processed for examination in thin sections using electron
microscopy. Samples were processed and examined at the Citrus Research and
Educational Center (CREC) of the University of Florida, Lake Alfred, and
the Agricultural College (ESALQ) of the Universidade de Sao Paulo at
Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. Some leaf samples collected in Meta were also dried
and used for detection of Citrus leprosis virus, cytoplasmic type (CiLV-C)
by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Centro
APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira at Cordeiropolis (CAPTACSM). The RT-PCR was
performed with primers that specifically amplify a fragment of the viral
genome that codes for the putative cell-to-cell movement protein (1).
Locations at CREC and ESALQ each observed, using electron microscopy, cell
changes characteristic of CiLV-C that include short bacilliform particles
in the endoplasmic reticulum and dense, vacuolated, and irregularly shaped
viroplasm in the cytoplasm (2) in samples from Casanare and Meta. RT-PCR
amplified cDNA fragments of the expected size for samples collected in Meta
and one of the amplicons was sequenced (GenBank Accession No. DQ272491).
The sequence obtained was found to have 98 percent nucleotide sequence
identity to the Brazilian CiLV-C isolate (GenBank Accession No.
AY289190.1). Mites collected from affected plants from the department of
Meta were identified at ESALQ as Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), a known
principal vector of CiLV-C (2). These several lines of evidence confirmed
that the symptoms observed in sweet oranges at Meta and Casanare are due to
the infection by CiLV-C. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this
virus in Colombia.

[The citrus crop plant sweet orange, _Citrus sinensis_, develops symptoms
of the disease leprosis, when infected by citrus leprosis virus (family:
Rhabdoviridae, genus: Rhabdovirus -unassigned, CiLV-C - cytoplasmic type)
Citrus leprosis is a devastating viral disease of citrus. It has persisted
in Brazil and Argentina since the early 1930s and as the previous postings
referenced below and the disease distribution map indicate, it seems to be
spreading in South and Central America. It causes significant mortality of
new wood growth, reduction in tree canopy development, premature leaf and
fruit drop, and significant yield reduction. Citrus leprosis occurred in
Florida citrus between the mid-1800s and 1962, with severe outbreaks
between 1907 and 1925. No occurrence of the disease has been reported over
the past 40 years in Florida and recent surveys in 2001-2002 did not detect
the disease. Citrus leprosis differs from many other plant viruses, which
are usually systemic in plant tissues. Citrus leprosis is non-systemic and
_Brevipalpus spp_ (mites) play a singular role in the spread of the disease
within and between citrus trees in the orchard. Sweet orange varieties are
susceptible. Planting resistant citrus cultivars, pruning to reduce disease
inoculum and seasonal acaricide sprays to control the mite vectors are the
only existing means of minimizing the current impact of this
disease. Continued expansion of this viral pathogen in South and Central
America can be seen as a warning that spread could occur to other
citrus-producing areas. Because the disease is strongly symptomatic on
leaves and twigs, this would probably require the introduction of
viruliferous mites, probably on rooted plant materials, into areas that may
already have the mite vector but not the virus.
