Romania says four cattle die of anthrax
-------------------------------
Romanian veterinary authorities said on Friday they had
taken measures to control anthrax, a disease fatal to
humans and animals, after an outbreak that killed four
cattle in a northern district.
"All the cases were due to failure to observe sanitary rules
concerning obligatory vaccinations,'' Ion Agafitei, chief veterinary
inspector in Neamt county, 350 km (200 miles) north of Bucharest,
said by telephone.
"There is no cause for panic, this is not an epidemic,'' he said.
The latest casualty was a calf which died last week in a village
where a temporary quarantine was immediately imposed. A cow
had also died and two were put down after being diagnosed as
having anthrax.
Anthrax, whose symptoms include high fever, an enlarged spleen
and swelling of the throat in some animals, kills thousands of cattle
and sheep annually in tropical and sub-tropical countries but
outbreaks are sporadic and generally small in temperate countries
[like Romania.
The disease can kill in a matter of hours and is commonest among
herbivorous domestic and wild animals, but it is also fatal to
humans who inhale its spores.
Anthrax is contracted mainly in warm weather by animals often
grazing near areas contaminated by the burial of other infected
animals. It can also be passed on through animal hides or wool
[carrying the spores.
