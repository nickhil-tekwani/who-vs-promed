The number of children being stricken by a mysterious paralyzing condition continues to increase, federal officials say. At least 252 cases of acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) so far this year [2018] from 27 states, including 90 that have been confirmed through [Fri 9 Nov 2018], CDC reported on Tuesday [13 Nov 2018]. Most of the cases have occurred among children between the ages of 2 and 8.

The illness usually starts as a fever and seemingly routine respiratory symptoms, which are common this time of year. But for some patients, something scary happens 3-10 days later. The arms and legs of otherwise healthy, active kids suddenly become paralyzed. In almost all patients, an upper limb was involved. About half of the patients had only upper limb involvement.

The cause of the condition remains a mystery. But officials say there is a possibility it is being caused by a virus known as an enterovirus that affects the digestive system, though that remains just a theory. Another possibility is that the condition is being caused by an overreaction of the immune system to an infection. Also under investigation are rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold and other respiratory illnesses.

Regardless, public health officials say they are racing to try to determine the cause and the best treatments. "As a mom, I know what it's like to be scared for your child. And I know parents want answers," Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a briefing for reporters. "We've learned a lot about AFM since 2014, but there are things we still don't understand." No one has died from the condition so far this year [2018], she noted, adding that the condition remains rare. In about half of cases, the patients eventually fully recover. But the other half appear to be left with permanent disabilities, Messonnier says.

AFM outbreaks appear to occur every 2 years, with most cases occurring in the late summer and fall. The pace of cases this year [2018] appears to be on track to have the same number as in the past few outbreaks, Messonnier says. While environmental toxins remain a possibility, Messonnier says that seems unlikely, given how widespread the cases are. She also encouraged parents to continue to get their children vaccinated, saying vaccines don't appear to be a possible cause. There is no evidence the condition is being caused by the polio virus. "We are trying to figure out what the triggers are that would cause AFM," Messonnier says.

The number of confirmed acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) cases from 25 states, including Washington, represents a threefold increase compared with the same time period last year [2017]. There were 80 confirmed cases of the rare condition between 1 Jan and 2 Nov [2018], according to CDC, and an additional 6 cases were considered "probable". In 2017, there were 33 cases. The numbers of cases have yet to reach that of 2016 and 2014. More than 100 confirmed cases were reported both of those years.

Six confirmed cases have been reported in Washington state since 28 Aug 2018: 2 in King County, with one each in Lewis, Pierce, Skagit, and Snohomish counties, according to the Department of Health.

The median patient age for confirmed cases since the beginning of the year was 4, according to CDC. The age range is 7 months to 32 years old. Of those patients, 47 were male, and 33 were female.

The cause of AFM is unknown. Symptoms are similar to other viruses, which make it difficult to diagnose. Approximately 90 per cent of cases are children who have experienced muscle weakness or paralysis. During the 4 weeks preceding the onset of limb weakness, signs and symptoms consistent with viral illness were reported for 99 per cent of patients. Of those, 81 per cent had a fever, and 78 per cent had gastrointestinal symptoms, according to CDC. All patients with confirmed cases were hospitalized, and 47 of the 80 were admitted to intensive care units.

No deaths related to AFM have been reported. The growing number of cases has some leaders concerned. Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell sent a letter to CDC last month [October 2018] requesting more information regarding the progress being made on research into prevention and treatment of AFM.

[There is no specific treatment, including antivirals, currently available for AFM, and the putative etiological causes are quite varied. Patients who are hospitalized with severe respiratory illness may need to receive intensive supportive therapy. The long-term sequelae of AFM can be quite debilitating for a large percentage of infected children, with physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation required to improve mobility. - Mod.UBA
