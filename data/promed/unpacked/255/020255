New Jersey health officials said Monday [29 Oct 2018] they are sending infection-control teams to four long-term pediatric centers and a hospital to assist with training amid viral and bacterial outbreaks that have left 10 people dead. The teams will assess infection prevention practices and deploy beginning in November [2018], according to Health Commissioner Dr. Shereef Elnahal.

The response comes amid a fatal adenovirus outbreak at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation that left 9 people dead, most under age 18 [years]. In addition, a premature baby died following the discovery of a bacterial infection at Newark [New Jersey]'s University Hospital this month [Oct 2018], state health officials have said.

"Facility outbreaks are not always preventable, but in response to what we have seen in Wanaque, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the chance they occur among the most vulnerable patients in New Jersey," Elnahal said in a statement.

Adenovirus usually poses little risk for healthy people and typically causes mild cold or flu symptoms. Some strains also cause diarrhea and pinkeye. The strain found in the rehab center outbreak - type 7 - is among the more potent types and sometimes causes more serious respiratory illness, especially among those with weak immune systems. The first symptoms showed up Sept. 26 [2018], and the state was notified of an outbreak Oct. 9 [2018], officials said. The department said later Monday there have been 26 adenovirus cases confirmed at the center. The agency said the most recent individual became sick on or before Oct. 22 [2018], which remains the last day when a patient showed new symptoms.

The 227-bed, for-profit facility has a pediatric center and also cares for elderly residents. No new residents are being admitted for the duration of the outbreak, which won't be declared over until the center can go four weeks without any new cases.

At the hospital, the state health department earlier said it found 4 _Acinetobacter baumannii_ cases since Oct. 1 [2018]. The baby had the bacterium and was transferred to another facility, where it died. The department said the exact cause of death is under investigation. There were compounding medical conditions. The bacterium can cause pneumonia or serious blood or wound infections. Those cases are not related to the virus at the Wanaque center, the Health Department said.

[_Acinetobacter_ are aerobic Gram-negative coccobacilli commonly found in soil and water and readily survive in a hospital environment. During nosocomial outbreaks, _Acinetobacter_ have been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment, including bed curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. Of the many _Acinetobacter_ species, _A. baumannii_ accounts for about 80 percent of reported infections.

Outbreaks of _Acinetobacter_ infections usually occur in healthcare settings, especially in critically ill patients in intensive care units. These organisms may colonize patients or cause a variety of infections, such as pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, burn wounds, traumatic and surgical wound infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and infective endocarditis. _Acinetobacter_ have been reported to spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from other patients who are either infected or colonized with these organisms.

Resistance of _Acinetobacter_ to multiple commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, monobactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, severely restricts treatment options for infections caused by these organisms. Some _Acinetobacter_ isolates are susceptible only to the polymyxins such as colistin and sulbactam (Go ES, Urban C, et al: Clinical and molecular epidemiology of _Acinetobacter_ infections sensitive only to polymyxin B and sulbactam. Lancet North Am Ed. 1994; 344(8933): 1329-32; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7968028), although resistance to these antibiotics has also been reported. Sulbactam is a beta-lactam that is most commonly used in combination with ampicillin to inhibit certain bacterial beta-lactamases that would otherwise break down ampicillin and thereby to allow ampicillin to kill the bacteria. Against _Acinetobacter_, however, sulbactam itself exhibits antibacterial activity.

The Wanaque Center is a nursing home, rehabilitation center and pediatrics center which offers short and long term care in the town of Haskell, Passaic County, New Jersey (http://www.wanaquerehab.com).

[_Acinetobacter baumannii_and Adenvirusare are both opportunistic pathogens which can seriously impact clinical care and outcome in immune-compromised patients.This emphasizes the implementation of infection control measures at the health facility and strict implementation of disinfection and hand hygiene practices by the staff-Mod.UBA
