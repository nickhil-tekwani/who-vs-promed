As at 8:30 am on 8 Oct 2007 there were 30 confirmed premises affected by
bluetongue. This figure will normally be updated once daily (Monday to
Friday). The cases of bluetongue remain within the Bluetongue Control Zone
and are located in a cluster in the Ipswich area, with further cases just
over the Essex border and near Lowestoft.
Since 22 Sep 2007, laboratory tests have detected the presence of
bluetongue in a small number of animals on a number of different premises
in Suffolk. These premises are all under restrictions and the infected
animals have been culled. Defra confirmed on 28 Sep 2007 that bluetongue
disease is circulating between the local animal and midge population in
East Anglia. For the Bluetongue Control Area and a Protection Zone --
declaration and definitive map, see

As of 5 Oct 2007, 12 323 cases of bluetongue disease have been confirmed in
Germany.
It is not clear whether this number refers to individual animals or
holdings affected with multiple cases. It is likely a combination of the
above and due to a lack of data it is not possible to establish within
herd/flock incidence and mortality rates. In some parts of Germany only one
animal per holding is blood sampled to establish the presence of the virus,
additional suspects from the same farm are confirmed on clinical diagnosis
only.

The Luxembourg Ministry of Agriculture stated that the bluetongue (BT)
virus is circulating in the whole of the country. So far (4 Oct 2007) more
than 1000 holdings are affected of which 75 per cent keep cattle and 25 per
cent sheep. As a result of BT, 556 sheep, 333 cattle, and 3 goats have died
so far.
For technical reasons, 3 blood samples per holding are deemed sufficient to
prove virus circulation.

[In the absence of mortality figures from the other BTV-8 affected
countries, Luxembourg's data (about 0.44 dead bovines and 2.22 dead ovines
per affected holding) may serve as a (very) rough indicator for the
probable mortalities in the other countries (where, reportedly, the number
of affected holdings may have exceeded 20 000 during 2007). Most probably,
the mortality rates in sheep will reach higher figures. The possible losses
in cattle are expected to be mainly related to the long convalescence
periods, resulting in decreased milk production, weight loss, fertility
problems, and veterinary-medical treatment.
The European Union's Animal Disease and Notification System (ADNS) is meant
to cover, in its weekly reports, the animal health situation in member
states. The most recent (5 Oct 2007) ADNS figures for 2007 on BTV-8 in 6 NW
European countries, with their respective dates, are the following. (In
brackets, their data as presented during the SCFCAH meeting in Brussels,
2-3 Oct 2007):
1. Belgium - 3758; 23 Sep 2007 (4138; 1 Oct 2007)
2. France - 1662 ; 27 Sep 2007 (1834, of which 1698 clinical; 28 Sep 2007)
3. Germany - 1166 ; 27 Sep 2007 (11 321; 1 Oct 2007)
4. Luxembourg - 949; 2 Oct 2007 (940; 30 Sep 2007)
5. Netherlands - 1434; 20 Sep 2007 (5051; 1 Oct 2007)
6. UK - 1; 28 Sep 2007 (18; 1 Oct 2007)
The ADNS table of 5 Oct 2007 is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/table_11_2007/adns_051007_en.pdf>.

The system does not seem to satisfactorily cover the fast spreading BTV-8
epizootic in all countries involved.
Similarly, the reporting to OIE is lagging behind and is incomplete. The
most recent data in OIE's interface data base, WAHID, are the following:
1. Belgium - last (16th) follow-up report submitted 25 Sep 2007, reporting
a total of 935 accumulated outbreaks (probably holdings).
2. France - last (16th) follow-up report submitted 3 Oct 2007, reporting a
total of 253 accumulated outbreaks (probably holdings).
3. Germany - last (3rd) follow-up report submitted 25 Sep 2007, reporting a
total of 930 accumulated outbreaks (probably holdings).
4. Luxemburg - last (6th) follow-up report submitted 11 Sep 2007, reporting
a total of 266 accumulated outbreaks (probably holdings).
5. Netherlands - only one (immediate) report submitted 25 Sep 2007,
reporting on 1 outbreak. No follow-ups.
6. UK - last (1st) follow-up report submitted 5 Oct 2007, reporting 21
outbreaks.
Animals and their products move rather freely between EU member sttates in
"normal" times; this underlines the need for the earliest possible
detection of animal diseases, when they appear, followed by their fast
confirmation and immediate notification, to allow timely containment and
prevention of spread. The delay in the notification of some BTV-8 outbreaks
(particularly in the UK, where the 1st notification was delayed until
"circulation" could be demonstrated), and the differences between the data
from the 6 affected countries -- as apparent in the various lists above --
underlie the need for a centralized, fast, reliable and comprehensive
data-base which would apply homogeneous, uniform criteria for data
collection from all countries.
Epidemiological data should be complete, including locations, species,
morbidity, and mortality. Monitoring and reporting the BTV-8 epizootic,
which has already affected 6 EU member states and is threatening to spread
further, could have been a useful rehearsal tool, providing an opportunity
to improve the reporting system as stated above. Such improvements become
indispensable for the timely and effective handling of highly infectious or
zoonotic animal diseases, if and when they make their own appearance.
We are grateful to Sabine Zentis for taking the trouble to try narrowing
the gap, searching for such information from available sources. - Mod.AS]
