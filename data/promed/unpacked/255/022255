Two cases of hemolytic [fever] with renal syndrome in Lipetsk Oblast
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st 2 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) this
fall have been registered in Lipetsk Oblast. The patients are a
30-year-old man and a 5-year-old boy from Dankovsky [district] -- a
father and son form the village of Perehval. They are currently
receiving treatment at the Central District hospital.

The risk of airborne infection has increased greatly as a consequence
of the increased numbers of rodents that transmit the virus
responsible for HFRS.

Due to the onset of colder weather rodents are moving closer to human
habitations. People should take measures to protect themselves from
these rodents by eliminating them from yards and gardens. Local
authorities should implement rodent control measures.

[There is a danger that the situation that took place in Lipetsk
Oblast last season will happen again. From December 2006 to March
2007, there was an epidemic increase in the incidence of HFRS in
Lipetsk Oblast. At that time the cause of such a situation was the
result of unusual mildness of climate and abundance of food for
rodents, which led to an unusual increase in the population of
rodents. Small mammals (bank voles and field mice) were caught in 40
percent of 100 trap-days. During last season, the infectiousness of
these mammals varied from 15 to 67 percent. - Corr.BA/Mod.NR

The original report includes an excellent photograph of one of the
small mammals that transmit HFRS. It can be accessed at the source URL.
