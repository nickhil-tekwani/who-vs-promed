Information received on 22 Oct 2004 from Dr Yukol Limlamthong, Director
General, Department of Livestock Development (DLD), Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives, Bangkok:
End of previous report period: 20 Oct 2004 (see Disease Information, 17
[43], 312, dated 22 Oct 2004).
End of this report period: 22 Oct 2004.
Though the clinical disease was first noticed on 11 Oct 2004 in 16 tigers,
the number of sick animals has been increasing on a daily basis.
Total number of animals in the outbreak (updated data):
species / fau / avi*
susceptible / 441 / 12
cases / 83 / 0
deaths / 39 / 0
destroyed / .. / ..
slaughtered / ... / ...
* 10 peacocks and 2 ostriches kept in a separate area of the zoo
Since the tiger is an animal on the CITES(1) list, any slaughter or
destruction in a zoo, for welfare reasons or public health concerns, must
be authorised by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.
It is possible that the sick tigers were not observed at the onset of
clinical manifestations. Sick and healthy animals would therefore have
initially been kept together in their usual cages. However, the healthy
animals, including tiger cubs (under 6 months of age) that were fed with
chicken meat and pork, did not subsequently present any clinical signs.
This information, provided by the zoo veterinarians, could imply that
tiger-to-tiger transmission is unlikely in this outbreak.
No clinical disease or deaths have yet been observed in other species: 2
domestic ducks that are occasionally put into the crocodile ponds(2), dogs,
pigs, horses and elephants raised separately from the tiger section and for
shows together in the zoo.
More than one supplier and more than one slaughterhouse are involved in
supplying chicken carcasses to the zoo. The DLD authorities are currently
tracing back supplies from all types of premises since late September 2004.
(1) CITES: Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora
(2) Note: the crocodiles are also fed with carcasses and whole chickens.

[While there is some claim that tiger-to-tiger transmission of disease did
not occur, the appropriate attack rate information by feeds fed and not fed
-- flowing from a well-executed outbreak investigation -- are lacking. In
the absence of such information, conclusions about foodborne spread will be
difficult to establish scientifically and therefore remain
speculative. This report intimates that tiger-to-tiger transmission is
unlikely, but chicken was fed to tigers who remained healthy. The problem
is whether the chicken fed to the healthy tigers was contaminated with
influenza; chickens are obtained from more than one supplier. In any
foodborne outbreak, trace-back to slaughterhouses and production farms is
often a record-keeping obstacle that cannot be surmounted. - Mod.PC]
