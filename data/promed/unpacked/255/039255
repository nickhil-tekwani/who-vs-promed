Isiolo veterinary department has closed all slaughterhouses and livestock markets for 2 weeks following an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF).

Following the outbreak, panic has gripped Isiolo and Meru counties [Eastern province], with veterinary officers moving with speed to contain the disease. The outbreak is suspected to have spread from the neighbouring Wajir County [North-Eastern province], where it has killed 6 people, with 26 cases reported so far. The disease has also hit Marsabit County [Eastern province].

Isiolo Livestock chief officer, Mr Benjamin Lopetet, has imposed a quarantine limiting movement of all livestock including sheep, goats, camels, and their products. Mr Lopetet said 106 samples collected from several areas in Isiolo's 3 sub counties (Garbatulla, Merti and Isiolo) had been taken to government laboratory, where 25 tested positive for RVF.

Isiolo butchers' association led by their chairman, Mr Salesio Kiambi, said they will comply with the directive but faulted the county government for allegedly withholding the information as they stare at losses.

Meru Livestock chief officer, Dr David Mugambi, said the region is on high alert following the outbreak in Isiolo and is mulling a quarantine in the grazing areas. Herders who graze in areas neighbouring Isiolo County have been urged to use repellent acaricides to control mosquitoes that spread the disease.

"Meru County is classified as risky since neighbouring counties are now affected. We discourage slaughtering of animals at home. Animals should be handled with gloves. We will ensure animals are vaccinated on time," Mr Mugambi said.

Mr Mugambi said 3 officers from the National RVF control centre were in the county to monitor the situation.

In Isiolo, the quarantine notice was copied to directors of veterinary services from Meru, Laikipia, Samburu, Wajir, Marsabit and Garissa counties which are regions at risk of contracting RVF from Isiolo because of livestock migration in search of water and pasture.

Herders have been warned against grazing livestock near public roads. No person has contracted the disease in Isiolo.

RVF outbreaks have also been reported in Tana River [Coast province] and Siaya [Nyanza province, southwest Kenya] counties.

At least 6 other counties have been identified as having the highest risk of an outbreak, including Tharaka Nithi, Mandera, Lamu, Garissa, Kajiado and Baringo.
