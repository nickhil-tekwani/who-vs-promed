Since [1 Aug 2017], the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified 2050 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since [1 Aug 2017], primarily among homeless people and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

The DPH is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of 6 Oct 2018:
- Total Outbreak: 2050
- Hospitalizations: 1126
- Deaths: 14

Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus. This increase in cases has primarily been among injecting and non-injecting drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

Those affected the most are the marginalized cohorts of humanity, including homeless people and substance abusers. Their needs for adequate sanitation and living conditions were supplied in the San Diego (California) area, and such an approach to these outbreaks is required elsewhere in the USA. Spillover into other portions of the population, such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers, will continue. It is not clear how many of these rapidly increasing cases are in individuals outside the described cohorts.

Kentucky remains in 1st place in cases. West Virginia has roared past California and Michigan for 2nd on the HAV case number list. With the 1527 number in West Virginia and Kentucky's 2050, these 2 states have reported 3577 cases.

In the entire year of 2016 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/index.htm), CDC reported only 2007 cases from all 50 states. Based on weekly numbers, 331 new cases were reported from these 2 states in the past 2 weeks. There is no clear sign of decreasing numbers. It is not entirely clear what public health responses are occurring. - Mod.LL

Allegheny County is experiencing a spike in hepatitis A cases, the health department announced Mon 15 Oct 2018.

On average, the department sees less than 10 hepatitis A cases a year, but 4 cases have been reported in just the last 6 weeks, the department said.

The cases are unconnected, the department said, but officials still urged residents to get vaccinated against the disease, particularly high-risk groups that include the homeless, drug users and men who have sex with men. Those who provide services to the homeless and food handlers can also be at risk.

CDC has been keeping track of outbreaks of HAV infections in the USA, posting about 10 states
https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm. Besides KY and WV, which are far and away leading "the pack," the latest numbers are:

Michigan - Total 899, Deaths 28 (Last updated 10 Oct 2018)
California - Total 704, Deaths 21 (outbreak reported over as of 11 Apr 2018)
Ohio - Total 666, Deaths 1 (Last updated 15 Oct 2018)
Indiana - Total 532, Deaths 1 (Last updated 12 Oct 2018)
Tennessee - Total 332, Deaths 1 (Last updated 12 Oct 2018)
Utah - Total 279, Deaths 2 (Last updated 15 Oct 2018)
Missouri - Total 203, Deaths 1 (Last updated 9 Oct 2018)
Arkansas - Total 168, Deaths (Last updated 10 Oct 2018)

Although most of the cases appear to be concentrated in certain high-risk groups, including homeless and illicit substance users, and the transmission is primarily from totally inadequate sanitation, there remains substantial risk of spillover from food service workers to the general public. Routine immunization of all food service workers against HAV would go a long way to protect the general population. - Mod.LL]
