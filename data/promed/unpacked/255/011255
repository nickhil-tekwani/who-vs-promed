French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has ordered hundreds of
extra soldiers be sent to help battle a mosquito-borne virus that has
infected 15 000 people on the French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean.
400 soldiers will be sent to Reunion, almost tripling the present
military deployment, along with dozens more medical experts to fight
the virus that causes chikungunya, which has no vaccine or cure.
The deployment, in part to reduce the mosquito population, was taking
place "without delay", said a statement from the Prime Minister's office.
Mr Villepin also instructed Health Minister Xavier Bertrand to go to
Reunion, east of Madagascar, and planned to convene a meeting of
government ministers on the issue on Mr Bertrand's return.
Chikungunya, a rare infection that is usually not life-threatening,
can cause muscle and joint pain, rash and fever.
France's Health and Overseas Affairs ministries said, without
elaborating, that about 20 recent cases "with complications" had been
identified.
The Overseas Affairs Ministry said that 10 000 to 15 000 cases have
been counted on La Reunion. No vaccine or cure has been identified, it said.

[The chikungunya outbreak has affected around 15 000 people (an
incidence rate of 2000 per 100 000, based on a population of 750 000)
on the island. Health authorities from the local government and
France have made mosquito control the top priority. - Mod.RY]
