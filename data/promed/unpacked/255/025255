The ministry of environment yesterday [Wed 11 Oct 2017] confirmed that anthrax was the cause of the recent deaths of 110 hippos and 20 buffalos at Kavango West's Bwabwata National Park. The ministry's spokesperson, Romeo Muyunda, yesterday said in a statement that the ministry and the veterinary services department of the ministry of agriculture were working together for solutions to contain the outbreak. Senior officials from the directorate of veterinary services as well as from the directorate of parks and wildlife in the ministry of environment are expected to visit the area to familiarise themselves with the situation on the ground.

Muyunda also told The Namibian that he was not sure whether the Botswana government was working with its Namibian counterparts to contain the situation after a few hippos were also found dead in that country. Some international media, including New China, yesterday [Wed 11 Oct 2017] reported that senior officials from the ministry of environment, wildlife and tourism in Botswana have joined hands with their Namibian counterparts to investigate the matter. Muyunda said the ministry has already started burning the carcasses and burying the ashes.

In the meantime, the ministry is likewise cautioning the public against touching the carcasses or consuming the meat as this might be catastrophic.

"The ministry is also aware of concerns regarding the safety of tourists intending to visit the park. In this regard, we would like to assure our visitors that there is no health hazard to people as a result of the situation," he noted. He added that the areas in which these mortalities are taking place is not open to tourists, but an exclusive area for management only, warning tourists from coming close to the affected area. The ministry thus does not foresee the situation threatening the existence of other wildlife species. Anthrax is a fatal bacterial disease known to kill game, cattle as well as humans.

Anthrax has been detected in dead hippos floating in the Okavango River, officials in Botswana said on [Wed 10 Oct 2017], after more than 100 of the animals were suspected to have been killed by the disease in neighboring Namibia.

Botswana's Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism advised people not to touch the dead hippos and to report any sightings of hippo carcasses.

The Okavango Delta is a major tourist attraction in southern Africa, supporting a diverse range of wildlife.

Namibian media reported on [Mon 9 Oct 2017] that more than 100 hippos had died in the remote Bwabwata National Park, in the northeastern part of the country, with anthrax the suspected cause.

The Okavango River flows through Namibia before entering Botswana. Tourism is important for the economies of both countries.

[I must apologize. The Namibian Ministry of Environment has shown more initiative than I had expected and had burnt those initial test carcasses. Burning hippo carcasses is no mean feat, especially when in a national park one has minimal facilities. I am truly impressed. It is hard work. And they have a further 125 carcasses to dispose of. Shoot!
