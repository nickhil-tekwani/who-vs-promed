Scotland: outbreaks in Aberdeen hospitals and schools
-----------------------------------------------------
A second ward at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI) has been closed after being
hit by the winter vomiting disease virus. It was confirmed yesterday that
38 people have been affected, resulting in the closure of one of the
hospital's wards on Fri 24 Jan 2003. The decision to shut it down was made
prior to the first ward to be affected reopening over the weekend.
An ARI spokeswoman said: "In total, 26 patients and 12 staff have been
affected over a 3 ward area. "Throughout the whole of ARI we do have
sporadic outbreaks of illness during the course of the year. These closures
do not have an adverse effect on any patients." She added that reports of
several more cases than usual at Woodend Hospital were also being
investigated. Meanwhile, no new cases of [viral gastroenteritis] have been
reported at the city's Rosewell House care home. At Stonehaven Community
Hospital, only one patient is still suffering from [viral gastroenteritis].
The hospital's Arduthie ward, which had been closed due to the illness, was
reopened yesterday.
The outbreak of [viral gastroenteritis] started 2 weeks ago. A public
health team and Aberdeen City Council's environmental health department are
investigating the cause and nature of the [infection], and results are
expected in the next 2 to 3 weeks. Schoolchildren throughout the north east
have also been struck down by [suspected winter vomiting disease]. As many
as 700 pupils are believed to have suffered from the flu-like virus over
the last few weeks. Westhill Academy reported that as many as 200 of its
909 students have been off ill in the last 2 weeks.
Other schools whose attendance levels were hit include Portlethen Academy,
Harlaw Academy, and Aberdeen Grammar School. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for
the council said she was unable to confirm how many youngsters had been
absent due to the illness.

[As inferred previously (see preceding update), the outbreak of suspected
viral gastroenteritis affecting schools and hospitals in Aberdeen is being
attributed to norovirus infection. Laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis
is awaited. - Mod.CP]

USA: Norovirus outbreaks in 4 Michigan nursing homes
----------------------------------------------------
At least 4 area nursing homes have experienced recent outbreaks of
norovirus infection. Within a day, the virus infection made half of a
nursing home's residents ill and caused staff to miss work, said Priya
Nair, epidemiologist for the Genesee County Health Department "When it
happens, it's hard to prevent transmission," Nair said. "The virus can be
airborne and easily spread by touch, but they've done their best to reduce
risks like canceling communal events."
Nair has helped investigate the outbreaks since November [2002]. The latest
one was last week at a nursing home with 134 residents. 60 per cent of the
residents fell ill, and 20 per cent of the staff were sick, she said.
Cruise ships, like nursing homes, harbor the virus among people who are in
continuously close contact. In addition, the elderly have a lower
resistance to illness, Nair said.
South east Michigan has seen 20 outbreaks of noroviruses, or Norwalk-like
viruses, a group of viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis, said Geralyn
Lasher, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Community Health.
Officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
announced that noroviruses appear to be on the rise. But after the cruise
problems in the fall, people are paying more attention to what's causing
gastrointestinal problems. "There's more awareness of it," Lasher said.
"Health care providers are taking the time to do testing instead of writing
it off as a general gastrointestinal [infection]." The current strain of
norovirus in Genesee County is called the Farmington Hills strain because
it was identified there in April 2002, Nair said.

USA: Suspected Norovirus Outbreak on Cruise from Los Angeles to Hawaii
--------------------------------------------------
Nearly 250 passengers and crew of the Sun Princess came down with a
gastrointestinal illness during the cruise ship's voyage from Los Angeles
to Hawaii, Princess Cruises said.
It wasn't known whether the sick were suffering from norovirus infection,
which has affected more than 1500 cruise ship passengers in recent months.
Noroviruses -- which cause diarrhea, stomach pain, and vomiting for up to
48 hours -- are spread by close contact with infected people or the things
they have touched.
Those with symptoms aboard the Sun Princess weren't allowed to take shore
excursions as the cruise line set to work sanitizing the ship after it
arrived in Honolulu Harbor on Saturday morning. The first illness was
reported shortly after the vessel left Los Angeles on 25 Jan 2003, the
cruise line said. The 247 people afflicted complained of common symptoms,
including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The ship was to make stops at
Kauai and Maui before returning to California.

USA: Norovirus outbreak on Hawaiian cruise
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of viral infections similar to those that hit cruise ships in
the Caribbean and Alaska cut short a Hawaiian cruise after nearly 300
passengers and crew members became sick. 10 days into the 15 day voyage
from Los Angeles to 4 Hawaiian islands, Princess Cruises diverted the Sun
Princess to Honolulu so nearly 2000 passengers could take flights home.
About 100 passengers, about half of whom were sick, stayed with the ship as
it left yesterday for Los Angeles, Princess Cruises spokesman Tom Dow said.
He noted that the cruise appeals to some people who are wary of air travel.
Most people who contracted suspected norovirus infection recovered before
the end of the voyage, cruise officials said. After 4 new cases were
reported on Monday, the cruise line, in consultation with health officials,
decided to divert the ship, Dow said. All crew stayed aboard, along with a
team sanitising the ship.
