Experts are warning that a dangerous flesh-eating parasite could be on its way to Canada. And dogs may be to blame.

Veterinarians have started to detect leishmania, a dangerous parasite capable of causing a flesh-eating disease in both animals and humans, in Canadian and US dogs.

The parasites, usually spread by sandflies not native to North America, cause the disease leishmaniasis. Some forms of the disease can lead to severe disfigurement or even death. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world are affected every year, but the parasite has largely remained out of Canada and the US. That may be changing.

According to researchers, the disease has been detected in dogs in 2 provinces and 18 states so far. A mixed-breed dog imported from Morocco was recently brought to a Quebec vet with face wounds and was later diagnosed to have the parasite. A group of McGill University and University of Montreal researchers wrote about the discovery of the parasite in the Quebec dog for The Conversation.

"More and more, owners are travelling with their pets or importing animals from other countries," they wrote. "Furthermore, since many of the tests and diagnostic treatments for exotic diseases (including leishmaniosis) are unfamiliar or inaccessible in Canada, diagnosis and treatment are complicated. This puts the health of the patient, and ultimately the public, at risk."

They pointed to past cases where the parasite has spread in foxhounds in dog kennels across North America as evidence the parasite can easily get out of control.

According to the Health Canada, the leishmania risk for humans travelling abroad is low, but public health officials warn you should avoid nighttime outdoor activity in countries where sandflies are common.

The researchers warned, however, that dogs are the main reservoir for the parasite's transmission to humans, and the parasite can be transmitted from dog to dog through bites, breeding, or blood transfusions.

And while you might think "flesh-eating dog parasite" is a uniquely 2020 problem, the disease isn't totally new in Canada. Back in 2016, researchers sounded the alarm about the parasite and the possibility of a Canadian insect spreading it.

The assumption is it can't properly spread here because we don't have the insects for it.

"But we don't know for sure and, as changes occur due to climate change, there might be an insect capable of spreading this," Ontario Veterinary College professor Scott Weese told the CBC at the time.

["Leishmaniasis is an important complex of protozoal vector-borne diseases that affects both humans and animals. It can be caused by many species of _Leishmania_. A few of these organisms are primarily maintained in humans, but most circulate mainly in animals. Most of the latter organisms are zoonotic. Leishmaniasis is transmitted by sandflies and can be difficult to prevent, and some of the drugs used for treatment have significant side effects or limited availability outside endemic regions.

"_Leishmania_ can also cause skin and mucosal lesions and/or visceral signs in animals. Most species of _Leishmania_ are maintained in wildlife, often without clinical signs, but dogs are an important reservoir host for _L. infantum_. Dogs are also the domesticated animal most often affected by leishmaniasis. Clinical cases in this species can be life-threatening and may be difficult to treat. Cases of leishmaniasis are also seen occasionally in guinea pigs, cats, equids, and captive or free-living wild species. Ruminant livestock are rarely affected."

The following is extracted from https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/dogs.html:

"What are the signs of leishmaniasis in dogs?

Some dogs can have the leishmania parasite for extended periods of time and may not exhibit any signs of disease (asymptomatic). In asymptomatic dogs, the parasite can lay dormant for a period of time, sometimes years, before a stimulant, such as stress or illness, triggers the parasite to multiply and attack the body and eventually lead to cutaneous leishmaniasis or visceral leishmaniasis. However, both asymptomatic and symptomatic dogs are capable of infecting sand flies and spreading the disease.

In most dogs displaying signs, the 1st sign of disease appears about 2-4 months after the initial infection. Signs may include sores on the skin, peeling, ulcers, loss of weight, bald patches, conjunctivitis, blindness, nasal discharge, muscular atrophy, inflammation, swelling, and organ failure, including mild heart attacks.

How do I prevent my dog from getting leishmaniasis?

There is currently no preventative for leishmaniasis in dogs. The best way to prevent your dog from getting infected is to avoid regions of the world where it is found. Additionally, do not allow your dogs near a dog suspected of having the infection.

What should I do if I think my dog has leishmaniasis?

Contact your veterinarian. [More information on leishmaniasis in dogs can be found at https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/leishmaniosis/leishmaniosis-in-dogs].

What is the history of leishmaniasis in dogs in the United States?

Leishmaniasis has been found in a few dogs imported to the US from areas of the world where the disease is prevalent. There is no competent vector to spread the disease in the US, and there has only been one major outbreak reported in the country. The outbreak occurred in foxhound populations throughout the eastern US and Canada and spread in foxhound kennels through blood transfusions and by congenital transmission.

Can I get leishmaniasis from my dog?

No. There have been no documented cases of leishmaniasis transmission from dogs to humans."
