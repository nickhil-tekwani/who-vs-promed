The FDA (US Food & Drug Administration) is summarizing important
information relating to medical products that contain potentially
contaminated heparin and is seeking assistance from healthcare
facilities and providers in identifying and reporting adverse events
related to these products.

Recommendations and considerations
----------------------------------
Be aware of recent recalls of injectable heparin and heparin flushes
and of life-threatening reactions, which have been reported in
association with contaminated heparin. Current recall information is
available at
<http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/heparin/default.htm#recalls>
and will be updated when new information becomes available.
Additional information on reported adverse events can be found at
<http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/heparin/adverse_events.htm>.

Report any adverse patient reactions that may be associated with
injectable heparin and heparin lock flush solutions. In addition, we
are asking you to report heparin-related adverse reactions associated
with use of other medical products, which contain or are coated with
heparin. This includes a wide variety of medical devices and
diagnostic products as described below. Instructions for reporting
these adverse events are also provided below.

Background on heparin and heparin-containing medical products
-------------------------------------------------------------
Heparin is an anticoagulant (blood thinner) that is commonly
administered intravenously or subcutaneously. It is used in patients
undergoing kidney dialysis, certain types of cardiac surgery, and
treatment or prevention of other serious medical conditions,
including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary emboli. These
products are typically sold in concentrations of 1000 U/mL or
greater. Heparin lock flush solutions, which are generally used to
maintain the patency of intravenous catheters and are considered
medical devices, are manufactured at concentrations of 100 U/mL or less.

A variety of other medical devices and diagnostic products may also
contain or be coated with heparin, including certain intravascular
catheters, oxygenators, pumps, filters, and blood reservoirs used
during cardiac procedures, vascular stents/grafts, and blood
collection tubes. A list of specific medical devices containing
heparin is provided at
<http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/heparin-device-list.html>. This is
not an inclusive list of all firms that manufacture or distribute
heparin-containing devices, or a complete list of medical devices
that contain or are coated with heparin. This list will be updated as
additional information becomes available.

Adverse events, product recalls, and FDA actions
------------------------------------------------
There has been an increase in the number of adverse events, including
deaths, reported in association with the use of injectable heparin
products. In particular, FDA has seen an increase in events
consistent with an anaphylactic-type reaction and/or acute
hypotension. Information on these events is available at
<http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/heparin/adverse_events.htm>.
To date, only a small number of similar events have been reported for
heparin lock flush solutions.

FDA scientists have identified a contaminant in the heparin, an
oversulfated chondroitin sulfate. The contaminant mimics heparin
activity so closely that it was not recognized by routine testing.
FDA now has in vitro and animal data demonstrating a solid
mechanistic link between the oversulfated chondroitin sulfate and the
adverse events observed after bolus dosing. Our data demonstrate that
the compound directly activates the kinin-kallikrein pathway in human
plasma, which can lead to the generation of bradykinin (a potent
vasoactive mediator) and C3a and C5a (potent anaphylatoxins). These
data were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

Several manufacturers and distributors of heparin products have
initiated recalls of their products based on reports of adverse
events associated with their product(s) or as a precaution after
testing revealed that they were supplied with contaminated lots of
heparin. Further information on these recalls may be found at
<http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/heparin/default.htm#recalls>.

The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has received
commitments from the major US heparin manufacturers/suppliers to
perform the recommended screening tests on all heparin active
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that is received
(<http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/heparin/default.htm#screening>).
In addition, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)
has issued a letter requesting medical device manufacturers and
distributors to determine if they market unfinished or final form
products that contain heparin or utilize heparin in their processing,
and if so, to ensure that the products are contaminant-free before
they are released for distribution
(<http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/heparin-notice.html>).

Reporting heparin-related adverse events
----------------------------------------
FDA continues to actively monitor its post-market safety database for
cases of heparin-related adverse events. Because we believe that it
is essential to learn of new events as soon as possible, we are
asking you to report any significant adverse events that may be
heparin-related, whether the product is a drug or a
heparin-containing medical device.

In particular we are asking you to report
- events with signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylactic-type
reactions, acute hypotension, and/or acute gastrointestinal distress.
- any other serious reaction, which may be attributed to the heparin
in a medical product. These may include, but are not limited to
- unexplained thrombocytopenia;
- excessive anticoagulation or hemorrhage;
- inadequate anticoagulation;
- unexplained or premature thrombosis of a heparin-coated device; or
spurious results of in vitro diagnostic tests that utilize heparin
either as part of the assay or as part of the specimen collection.

To assist us in learning as much as possible about the adverse
events, please include the following information in your reports, if available
- the specific name of the product and its manufacturer;
- the lot number of the product;
- a description of the patient's characteristics, co-morbid
conditions, and the reason for use of the product (diagnosis);
- a list of the patient's concomitant medications, therapies, and allergies;
- the route of administration, concentration, and total amount of
heparin given or on/in the device;
- the nature of the adverse event, the interventions required to
address or correct it, and the clinical outcome;
- the time to event after heparin administration or device use;
- an explanation of why you believe the injectable heparin drug or
the heparin component of the medical device was responsible for, or
contributed to, the adverse event; and
- in the case of medical devices, whether systemic or subcutaneous
heparin was administered concomitantly along with the device (and if
so, the concentration and total amount given).

Please submit your reports to FDA as follows:
Healthcare providers should report adverse events to the FDA's
MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either
online at <http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm>;
by returning the postage-paid Voluntary Form FDA 3500 (available in
PDF format at <http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm>) to 5600
Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787;
- by faxing the Voluntary Form FDA 3500 form to 1-800-FDA-0178; or
- by reporting the event by phone at 1-800-332-1088

User facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes are required to
report suspected medical device-related deaths to both FDA and the
manufacturer, if known, and medical device-related serious injuries
to the manufacturer or to FDA, if the manufacturer is unknown. Again,
please note that heparin lock flush solutions and in vitro diagnostic
tests are considered medical devices and are therefore subject to
these reporting requirements. These reports must be made on the
MedWatch Mandatory Form FDA 3500A (available at
<http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm>). Reports should be sent
to Food and Drug Administration, CDRH, Medical Device Reporting, PO
Box 3002, Rockville, MD 20847-3002.

Kishimoto TK, Viswanathan K, Ganguly T, et al: Contaminated Heparin
Associated with Adverse Clinical Events and Activation of the Contact
System. N Engl J Med 2008:358

The abstract is below:

Background
----------
There is an urgent need to determine whether oversulfated chondroitin
sulfate (OSCS), a compound contaminating heparin supplies worldwide,
is the cause of the severe anaphylactoid reactions that have occurred
after intravenous heparin administration in the USA and Germany.

Methods
-------
Heparin procured from the FDA, consisting of suspect lots of heparin
associated with the clinical events as well as control lots of
heparin, were screened in a blinded fashion both for the presence of
OSCS and for any biologic activity that could potentially link the
contaminant to the observed clinical adverse events. In vitro assays
for the activation of the contact system and the complement cascade
were performed. In addition, the ability of OSCS to recapitulate key
clinical manifestations in vivo was tested in swine.

Results
-------
The OSCS found in contaminated lots of unfractionated heparin, as
well as a synthetically generated OSCS reference standard, directly
activated the kinin-kallikrein pathway in human plasma, which can
lead to the generation of bradykinin, a potent vasoactive mediator.
In addition, OSCS induced generation of C3a and C5a, potent
anaphylatoxins derived from complement proteins. Activation of these
2 pathways was unexpectedly linked and dependent on fluid-phase
activation of factor XII. Screening of plasma samples from various
species indicated that swine and humans are sensitive to the effects
of OSCS in a similar manner. OSCS-containing heparin and
synthetically derived OSCS induced hypotension associated with
kallikrein activation when administered by intravenous infusion in swine.

Conclusions
-----------
Our results provide a scientific rationale for a potential biologic
link between the presence of OSCS in suspect lots of heparin and the
observed clinical adverse events. An assay to assess the amidolytic
activity of kallikrein can supplement analytic tests to protect the
heparin supply chain by screening for OSCS and other highly sulfated
polysaccharide contaminants of heparin that can activate the contact system.
