For the 1st time in 3 years, Latvia has reported confirmed measles cases, according to a Delfi report (computer translated).

The Center for Disease Prevention and Control (SPKC) reports 4 cases of measles infection among adults have been laboratory confirmed. All the patients are hospitalized for their illness.

The report doesn't state ages or vaccination status of the ill patients.

Given the worsening situation, the SPKC encourages family doctors and hospitals to pay attention to specific measles prevention and vaccination.

A 41-year-old man, a driver from Riviera Trasporti, died late yesterday [6 Jan 2018] at the Sanremo hospital for complications due to a measles infection. This was announced by the Asl 1 [local health authority] of Imperia [located in the region of Liguria]. The man, who had been transferred to the reanimation ward after a worsening of his general condition, would most likely have died from a pulmonary or cardiac complication from measles infection or from possible viral superinfection. Asl 1, "who joins the family in this moment of pain due to the terrible loss", has requested the diagnostic confirmation to confirm the causes of death.

During 2017, 4 cases were [determined] in Italy of death due to measles complications, which occurs in about 10 percent of cases. Epidemiological data at the national level show that mortality due to measles complications has an incidence of 0.1-0.2 percent, that is, 1 or 2 cases in 1000 infected patients. "We wish to reassure the population -- specifies the health management of the ASL -- to avoid alarm and unfounded fears. We are not in the presence of a measles epidemic: there have been some cases of this virus whose onset has no correspondence with the contextual seasonal influence peak. Measles, as confirmed by epidemiological data at the national level, is a disease that, if it does not present complications, can be treated at home with rest and symptomatic therapy.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, Italy remains one of the countries most exposed to measles cases. In 2017 it was the 5th country in terms of number of patients, after India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and China.

According to the most recent Surveillance Report of the ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Monthly measles and rubella monitoring report, December 2017. Stockholm: ECDC; 2017], reporting on cases from 1 Nov 2016-31 Oct 2017, 30 EU/EEA Member States reported 13 726 cases of measles (source: TESSy [the European Surveillance System]). 29 Member States reported consistently throughout this period (Croatia did not report for October 2017). All EU/EEA countries have reported measles cases in the last 12 months, except Latvia and Malta. The number of measles cases reported to TESSy may represent an underestimation, in particular for Romania. The ongoing outbreak in the country has caused delays in case-based reporting to ECDC and the most up-to-date data are available from the Romanian National Institute of Public Health. ECDC also published a Rapid Risk Assessment on the outbreak in Romania.

During the period from 1 Nov 2016, to 31 Oct 2017, the highest numbers of cases were reported by Romania (5 605), Italy (4 973) and Germany (952), accounting for 41 percent, 36 percent, and 7 percent respectively of all cases reported by EU/EEA countries. The diagnosis of measles was confirmed by positive laboratory results (serology, virus detection, or isolation) in 61 percent of all cases reported by EU/EEA countries. The number of cases by month and notification rate per million population by country for this 12-month period is presented in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the notification rate per million population by country for this period.

Since 22 Dec 2017, 10 cases with clinical and epidemiological suspicions of measles have been reported, of which 4 have already been confirmed by the Instituto Nacional de Higiene Rafael Rangel.

The Network in Defense of Epidemiology pointed out that the cases come from Valles del Tuy [several municipalities in Miranda state] and the Sucre parish [Caracas, capital district]. In the JM de los Ríos Hospital, there is a confirmed case and 2 suspects from Catia [Vargas state].

On 8 Nov 2017, the Pan American Health Organization reported that they were working on a rapid response plan, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health, to vaccinate the population from 6 months to 10 years of age, as well as selective vaccination of the population 11 years and older who have had contact with suspected or confirmed cases of measles.

The 1st phase covered the states of Bolivar, Anzoátegui, Delta Amacuro, Monagas, and Sucre. However, the Ministry has not issued any pronouncements on the approach to avoid the spread of measles.

"The rapid response plan is designed to allow the country to disrupt the circulation of measles before 1 year since the 1st case was identified, and thus to preserve the endemic measles-free country and region status," reported the international agency in a press release.

Measles spread faster than the PAHO response and the ministry plan. José Félix Oletta, member of the Network in Defense of Epidemiology, criticizes that Miranda state and Caracas [Capital District] were not taken into account in the plan of action.

"We do not know the number of immunizations from 2016 onwards for the Capital District and Miranda. We have the worst scenario: lack of information, presence of the active outbreak for 3 weeks in Caracas and zero responses to the immunization plan," he warned.

Oletta warns that general 3rd and 4th level hospitals do not have enough pediatric intensive therapy beds to cope with this outbreak. Measles can bring respiratory complications, neurological manifestations such as encephalitis, otitis, and pneumonia secondary to bacteria and the viral infections.

The dire situation in Venezuela was described by B Fraser in "Data reveal state of Venezuelan health system." Lancet. 2017; 389(10084): 2095. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31435-6; http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31435-6/fulltext. She describes how the political and economic situation have damaged the health system in this country. "The epidemiological data show that maternal mortality rose by about 9 percent between 2014 and 2015, then jumped by nearly 66 percent by the end of 2016 -- with 756 deaths. Infant mortality rose by about 30 percent between 2015 and 2016 -- 11 466 deaths in 2016 -- according to government figures.

According to Maritza Durán, president of the Venezuelan Society of Internal Medicine, the infant mortality rate is attributable to a shortage of vaccines, basic medicines, and hospital facilities, as well as increased child malnutrition. This is a health emergency that cries out for international support. - Mod.LK
