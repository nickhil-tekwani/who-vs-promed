Bluetongue, Brazil
------------------
Information received on [and dated] 28 Jul 2016 from Dr Guilherme Henrique Figueiredo Marques, director, [Animal Health Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply of Brazil], Brasilia, Brazil

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 17 Apr 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 15 Jul 2016
Date event resolved: 20 Jul 2016
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: bluetongue virus
Serotype: 22
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Foz do Iguacu, Parana
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Apr 2016
Outbreak status: resolved 20 Jul 2016
Epidemiological unit: zoo
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Pygmy brocket: _Mazama nana_ (Cervidae) / 29 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: A deer (_Mazama nana_) from the indigenous fauna (_Mazama nana_) held in captivity in a zoo within the ecological reserve of the Itaipu Binacional. The animal, 2-years old, was found dead and haemorrhagic lesions were identified during the necropsy.
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Pygmy brocket: _Mazama nana_ (Cervidae) / 3.45 / 3.45 / 100 / 3.45
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: An investigation in 2015 identified 2 other serotypes of the bluetongue virus in the same location. Phylogenetic analysis of the sample identified serotype 22.
Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result

[Bluetongue virus (BTV) (Reoviridae: Orbivirus) is a vector-borne pathogen that causes hemorrhagic disease (HD) in ruminants, mainly sheep, and less frequently goats, buffalo, deer, antelopes and camels.

In South America, viral isolations from field samples have only been reported in Argentina, Brazil and Guyana. Serologic evidence has been reported in Chile, Perú, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname and French Guyana.

In Brazil, BTV was first described in São Paulo in 1978. After that, several reports have shown that the virus is widespread all over Brazil. Serologic data can be found in the whole country, although the virus was previously isolated only in 2 opportunities: in 1980, BTV4 was isolated in Florida (USA) from Brazilian zebu cattle which had been quarantined; and in 2001, BTV12 was isolated from sheep showing clinical signs of bluetongue.

The few surveys that examined seroprevalence in cervids from South America failed to find a positive result. The only previous reports on BTV infecting a South American deer were in this same group of animals held in captivity, deer of the species _Mazama nana_ from a zoo. It is strange, and quite unlikely, that the same group of animals within a very short time lapse were infected with 5 different viral strains, 3, 14, 18, 19 and now 22 (see ProMED post num. 20160119.3948490 and 20160725.4366648). All diagnoses were confirmed by RRT-PCR and sequencing. - Mod.PMB
