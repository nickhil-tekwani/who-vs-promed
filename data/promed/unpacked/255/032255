The recent archived posting 20060722.2022 included information on the
exposure of humans to a rabid dog in the Surxondaryo province of Uzbekistan.
ProMED had never before carried a report specifically on rabies in
Uzbekistan. The following data, pertaining to rabies in humans and in
animals, demonstrate the high prevalence of the disease there and
some of the applied control measures.
a. Human rabies:
Data could be derived electronically from 2 official sources:
1. OIE's Handistatus database (Zoonoses - number of human cases):
1996 - 56; 1997 - 27; 1998 - 3; 1999 - 3; 2002 - 3; 2004 - 5. Data
for the years 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2005 not available. See
