A total of 255 sheep have been slaughtered following a suspected outbreak of anthrax in Jiamusi City, north east China's Heilongjiang Province. According to the Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center of Huanan County in Jiamusi, newly purchased sheep from the province's Qitaihe City died from suspected anthrax at a local breeding site.

Huanan authorities promptly launched an emergency response plan, implementing a series of measures to disinfect the area and prevent the spread of the deadly disease. All those who had close contact with the sheep have been quarantined, with one diagnosed with suspected infection by the virus and another whose diagnosis has not been confirmed. The county said the outbreak has been effectively controlled without spreading.

Huanan's neighboring county Yilan also intensified efforts to prevent possible contamination. A farmer in Fuqiangtun Village had his 255 sheep, including 190 bought from Huanan, slaughtered.

According to the relevant departments of the county, the fatality is suspected to be caused by sheep anthrax.

After the incident, the government department of Huanan County reported the relevant departments to the higher authorities for the 1st time and timely launched the emergency response plan. Under the guidance of experts from Heilongjiang Province, the county's epidemic prevention and control group established the blockade and culling treatment of the epidemic areas.

[Slaughtering healthy sheep in the event of ovine anthrax deaths in a flock is unnecessary. The optimum action is to move the affected flock out of the pasture where deaths have occurred so that they do not graze any blood-contaminated forage, to check the individual sheep for any with a temperature that might be incubating the disease, and to hold the sheep in a pen while treating them with long-acting antibiotics. The flock should then be checked at least 3 times a day for any new sick sheep. The healthy sheep should be vaccinated as soon as possible with the appropriate ovine dose. Any sheep treated with antibiotics should be vaccinated 10 days after their last antibiotic dosing, by which time the antibiotics should have cleared their systems and will not affect the live vaccine.

You cannot be more north east in China than Heilongjiang Province, and Jiamusi is on that border with Russia. It borders Russia's Khabarovsk Krai to the east (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiamusi). Qitaihe City adjoins the western tail of Huanan County (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qitaihe). - Mod.MHJ
