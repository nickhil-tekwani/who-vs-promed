Georgia officials who're just beginning their investigation of an _Escherichia coli_ outbreak are racing to solve the mysterious food poisonings before the epidemic spreads, with the number of cases now at 11 across 4 southern states. "We know that these cases are all linked, and that would suggest that there was a common source somewhere along the way," J Patrick O'Neal of the Georgia Department of Health said. "We just don't know where."

The death of an infant in New Orleans last week [week of 28 May 2012] has been linked to at least 10 other cases of _E. coli_ illness in Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and Alabama. The largest cluster of 5 sickened people, ranging in age from 18 to 52, is centered in Atlanta, Georgia.

The infant was 21 months old when she died last week at a hospital in New Orleans. 2 others in the New Orleans area were also recently stricken by the same strain of _E. coli_, known as O145. "The death of a young child is always difficult, and it serves as a reminder of how serious _E. coli_ is," Dr Takeisha Davis of the Louisiana Health Department said.

Alabama public health officials have linked 2 cases to the outbreak. And a 22 year old Florida woman's illness has been traced to the same dangerous bacterium.

Epidemiologists at CDC headquarters are poring over data sent in from the states in search of a common factor that could pinpoint a cause. "The likely exposure is a food source," Louisiana Department of Health spokesman Tom Gasparoli said. "But this has yet to be confirmed. Often, the contact source is not found."

Until this week, the government was not checking meat for the O145 strain. But the US Department of Agriculture for the 1st time began testing meat for 6 other strains of [enterohemorrhagic] _E. coli_, including the strain causing this outbreak [but not the O104 strain causing the huge Germany-based outbreak in 2011.]

In an unrelated case, a 6 year old boy in Millbury, Massachusetts, died last week from kidney failure caused by _E. coli_. Massachusetts health officials said scientists have determined his illness was not caused by the same strain as the clusters in the south. Officials in Tennessee said a recent _E. coli_ case in that state was also unconnected.

[CDC has, so far, not released an outbreak report on this cluster of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ O145. This outbreak once again underscores the relevance of non-O157 strains of verotoxin-producing _E. coli_. Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with VTEC (verotoxin-producing _E. coli_) disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle and, although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of VTEC (1), appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). In addition to O145, the serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. 5 (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed HUS; none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (8).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.

Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in VTEC infections treated with antimicrobials (9), antimicrobials should not be used for known acute cases.
