During a survey in September 2005, a leaf crumple disease of soybean
(_Glycine max_) was observed in Lucknow with a disease incidence of
more than 80 percent. The diseased plants exhibited severe yellowing,
crumpling and distortion of leaves. The infected plants remained
dwarf with fewer flowers which resulted in a very low yield. The
causal pathogen was suspected to be a begomovirus due to the large
population of whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_; the vector of
begomoviruses) observed on the crop.

naturally infected soybean (Glycine max) leaves [see link for picture]
The presence of a begomovirus was detected by PCR using begomovirus
coat protein gene-specific primers (Singh, 2005) and total DNA
isolated from infected leaf tissues. An amplicon of the expected size
(approx. 800 bp) was obtained only from leaf samples with symptoms.
The PCR product was cloned, sequenced and the 771 bp sequence data
was submitted to Genbank (accession number DQ343284). Analysis of
nucleotide sequence data by Blast search revealed the highest
nucleotide sequence identity (96-98 percent) with Tomato leaf curl
Karnataka virus (ToLCKV) [TLU38239, AJ810342, AY753203, AJ810370 and
AJ810347]. These results indicated that the virus of soybean is an
isolate of ToLCKV. Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (Usahrani, et
al., 2004) and Pepper golden mosaic virus (Mendez-Lozano et al.,
2006) have been reported on soybean from India and Mexico
respectively. However, ToLCKV infection of soybean in India has not
been report previously.

[The crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_) is susceptible to leaf
crumple disease in India, shown here to be caused by tomato leaf curl
Karnataka virus (ToLCKV), a begomovirus (family: _Geminiviridae_,
genus: _Begomovirus_). An incidence of more than 80 percent was
observed in Lucknow. Diseased plants exhibited severe yellowing,
crumpling and distortion of leaves. Infected plants were stunted, and
had a very low yield. The virus is not uncommon in solanaceous crops
like tomato in India (note "see also:"), but detection in soybean is
a 1st report. The complexity of different begomoviruses in India and
neighboring countries that cause similar diseases can be followed in
the posts listed below. Diversity is driven by an abundant active
vector, the whitefly _Bemisia tabaci_, many weed and crop reservoirs,
and the capacity for this group of ssDNA viruses to share/swap
genetic information thereby creating new viruses and strains. Their
ability to cause severe disease is demonstrated in this report.
