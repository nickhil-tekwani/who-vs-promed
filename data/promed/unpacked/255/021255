Danish seals face epidemic after return of deadly virus
-------------------------------------------------------
COPENHAGEN: Denmark's seals are facing a deadly epidemic after 150 of the
mammals [were] washed ashore dead in the return of a virus that killed half
their population over a decade ago, a top veterinary official said Mon 27
May 2002.
"Naturally we fear an epidemic similar to the one we had in 1988 and we
can't do much to stop it from spreading since there's no vaccine or
treatment", Hans Henrik Dietz told AFP. The same virus killed thousands of
seals on Danish and western European beaches in 1988, added Dietz, head of
research at Denmark's State Veterinary Institute, after inspecting some of
the dead animals. The dead seals were found over the past month on the
Danish islands of Anholt and Laesoe in the Kattegat Channel between Denmark
and Sweden.
More then half the Danish seal population was killed by the virus in 1988,
when hundreds of ailing seals had to be slaughtered by hunters on beaches
and in the sea, leaving an estimated 10 000 alive today.
"We examined 17 of these mammals and most showed the same symptoms as those
that died in 1988 from a virus that killed 4000 seals in Denmark and
thousands more across western Europe," said Dietz. He said he was "certain
that at least 3 of the seals examined died from the virus, which causes a
deadly inflammation of the lungs."
Further test results, due on Wednesday and Thursday, were expected to
"confirm the alarming outbreak of this epidemic," Dietz added. He said that
on Sunday he had visited the island of Laesoe, where the disease, initially
detected on the neighboring island of Anholt, had spread.

Seals hit by deadly virus on Swedish west coast
-----------------------------------------------
STOCKHOLM, May 29 (AFP): A deadly epidemic that has already killed 250
seals in Denmark appears to have reached Sweden, where 10 dead seals have
been reported along the country's west coast, Swedish news agency TT quoted
experts as saying on Wednesday.
The same virus killed thousands of seals on Danish and western European
beaches in 1988. This time around, some 250 of the mammals have washed
ashore dead in Denmark in the past month, while 10 have been found in
recent days in Sweden.
"Some 10 seals have been found. The locations stretch from Stroemstad to
Halland" along the Swedish shores of the Kattegatt channel between western
Sweden and Denmark, said Anders Bergman, a pathologist at the Swedish
Museum of Natural History in Stockholm.
"We can't be sure that all of them have died of the same virus that killed
the Danish seals. Now that people have heard about the epidemic they are
reporting all the dead seals they see, which they don't normally do. But it
undeniably looks like the virus has spread to Sweden," he said.
Bergman, who was to conduct necropsies on the seals, said the animals do
not die of the actual virus, called phocine distemper virus or PDV, but of
the ensuing illnesses such as inflammation of the lungs. "It is very sad
that this is happening again. To see seals die this way is horrible," he said.

[Mass abortions and high mortality were observed in harbor seals (_Phoca
vitulina_) in Danish waters in 1988. The disease, which started in the
Kattegat area in April 1988, spread rapidly to the North sea, the Wadden
sea, and the Baltic sea; it was estimated that 17 000 to 20 000 animals
died in 8 months on north west European coasts. Severe pneumonia and
emphysema were typical clinical and postmortem findings. Virological and
pathological/histopathological investigations eventually revealed that the
disease was caused by the introduction of a canine distemper virus
(CDV)-like morbillivirus (phocine distemper virus; PDV) into a highly
susceptible population presumably free from morbillivirus infection. The
origin of PDV remained unknown, but evidence of prior morbillivirus
infection was found in Arctic and Antarctic seal populations. The reader
may refer to several published reviews; a relatively recent one is
"Morbillivirus infections in aquatic mammals" by S Kennedy (J Comp Pathol
1998; 119(3): 201-25). - Mod.AS].
