Subject: Re: A new Saudi novel coronavirus case diagnosed in KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia)

Attached is a report we would like for you to consider releasing in ProMED-mail:

In accordance with Ministry of Health's (MoH) responsibilities for disease prevention and control, and in keeping with our practice to inform the public and the media about significant findings that result from MoH disease surveillance activities, we are announcing today [4 Nov 2012] that one of our hospitalized citizens has been confirmed to have pneumonia caused by novel Coronavirus (nCoV). This case had no epidemiological links to the 2 documented novel coronavirus cases to date. When this individual was first admitted to hospital, he was evaluated for usual respiratory agents including influenza viruses. When none of these tests were positive, additional specimens were collected and tested by one of our regional MoH laboratories and an international reference centre. Both labs report RT-PCR positive results for nCoV upE target. Today MoH press agents released this information in English and Arabic to local and regional television and newspapers. WHO has been contacted in accordance with our IHR 2005 duties.

With regard to the patient's current status, he is recovering and out of intensive care. We have done preliminary investigations of family members and contacts including health care workers. There are no apparent secondary cases at this time, however these investigations are on-going. This man has no significant travel history, in fact had not been out of Riyadh. One week prior to disease onset he reports having visited a farm. Additional details will be reported as they become available.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Memish for the above report on the additional novel coronavirus (nCoV) case recently diagnosed in KSA. It is noteworthy that this case as well as one of the 2 prior confirmed cases of respiratory illness associated with this novel coronavirus both had a history of contact with farm animals in the week or 2 prior to onset of their illness.

A comparison of the sequencing of the virus isolates from both prior cases indicated 99.5 percent identity, with one nucleotide mismatch over the regions compared, suggesting the 2 isolates were strongly related. The virus was identified as belonging to the genus beta-coronavirus, with closest relationship to bat coronaviruses (see Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (03): UK HPA, WHO, Qatar 20120923.1305982 and Bermingham A, Chand MA, Brown CS, Aarons E, Tong C, Langrish C, et al. Severe respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, in a patient transferred to the United Kingdom from the Middle East, September 2012. Euro Surveill. 2012;17(40):pii=20290. Available from: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20290). The extent of sequence identity of this latest isolate is not yet available.

As a reminder, investigations to date have not shown person-to-person transmission as close contacts of the 2 prior cases including both medical staff and other contacts did not have evidence of infection with this novel coronavirus.

We await further information on investigations of this new case.
