During the past 8 years, Florida has seen an average of just under 10 fatalities annually due to infection with the bacterium, _Vibrio vulnificus_, and in 2016, the Florida Department of Health reported 10 deaths. Breakdown by county is as follows: Santa Rosa (2 deaths) and one each in Broward, Citrus, Hernando, Lake, Palm Beach, Pinellas, Putnam, and Sarasota counties. Health department data do not distinguish between foodborne and wound-associated infection cases.

Health officials saw 46 cases in 2016, which is the highest number of cases reported in the past 8 years. Duval County reported the most cases at 4.

_Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacterium. Ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease.

[The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis."

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

The recent data on _V. vulnificus_ in Florida including 2016 is:
2008: 16 cases, 6 deaths
2009: 24 cases, 7 deaths
2010: 32 cases, 10 deaths
2011: 35 cases, 13 deaths
2012: 26 cases, 9 deaths
2013: 41 cases, 12 deaths
2014: 32 cases, 7 deaths
2015: 45 cases, 14 deaths
2016: 46 cases, 10 deaths

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination); and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
