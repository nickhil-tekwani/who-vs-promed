EPIZOOTIC HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE, CERVIDS - USA (WYOMING)

We have had a confirmed outbreak of hemorrhagic disease in
white-tailed deer in north central Wyoming (Dayton area). Epizootic
hemorrhagic disease virus was isolated from the blood of moribund doe
in this area. A game warden counted 21 carcasses along a
quarter-mile stretch of Big Goose Creek during the peak of this
outbreak a few weeks ago. We have had reports of suspect cases from
a much wider area (central and eastern parts of the state) but have
not been able to obtain samples for confirmation.
