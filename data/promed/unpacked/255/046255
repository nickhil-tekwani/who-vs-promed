--------------------------------
2.1 - As at 6th July 2012, a total of 933 suspected Lassa fever cases, 147 laboratory confirmed and 93 deaths (CFR 9.97%) were reported from 41 LGAs [local government agencies] in 23 States.
2.2. - In the reporting week 26 (2012), no suspected case was reported in any part of Nigeria while intensive surveillance and case search are ongoing.

[Since the previous ProMED-mail from Nigeria, dated 9 Jul 2012, this the number of cases has risen by 78 and the number of fatalities by 6 (see: Lassa fever - Nigeria (07): neglected disease 20120709.1195196).

This statement has a less alarmist tone than than the previous report from Nigeria and indicates that no new cases are being detected as a consequence of enhanced surveillance. Furthermore it states that supplies of ribavirin, the only drug known to be effective in treatment of Lassa fever virus infection, are adequate and generally available.

Ribavirin (brand names: Copegus, Rebetol, Ribasphere, Vilona and Virazole) is an anti-viral drug indicated for severe respiratory syncytial virus infection (individually), hepatitis C infection (used in conjunction with peginterferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2a) and other viral infections. Ribavirin is a prodrug, which when metabolised resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this form it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication. How it exactly affects viral replication is unknown; many mechanisms have been proposed for this but none of these has been proven to date. Multiple mechanisms may be responsible for its actions. The primary observed serious adverse side-effect of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia, which may worsen preexisting cardiac disease. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. It is dose-dependent and may sometimes be compensated by decreasing dose.

Ribavirin is active against a number of DNA and RNA viruses. It is a member of the nucleoside antimetabolite drugs that interfere with duplication of viral genetic material. Though not effective against all viruses, ribavirin is remarkable as a small molecule for its wide range of activity, including important activities against influenzas, flaviviruses and agents of many viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lassa fever.
