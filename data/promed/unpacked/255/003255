[1] Cholera - Iraq (Baghdad)

Iraqi health officials confirmed the 1st cases of cholera in Baghdad today,
20 Sep 2007, in a sign that an epidemic that has infected about 7000 people
in northern Iraq is spreading south through the country's decrepit and
unsanitary water system.
WHO and the Iraqi Red Crescent Society said they had confirmed at least one
case of cholera in Baghdad, though Iraq's Ministry of Health did not
confirm it. Hospital sources said there could be at least 2 other confirmed
infections, connected to a death in Kut and one in Tikrit.
Officials said there was a further possible outbreak in Diyala, an area
north of Baghdad, and in Kut, south east of Baghdad. The WHO has already
reported an outbreak of the disease in the northern cities of Kirkuk and
Sulaymaniyah, and 10 people are known to have died. But the disease is now
moving from the north into more unstable areas of the country where it
could be even harder to treat and contain.
"It is already endemic in some parts of Iraq, but when it is growing and
moving, that's when it becomes an epidemic," said Dr Naeema al-Gasseer, the
WHO's representative for Iraq. The organization said there was laboratory
confirmation of the disease in a 25 year old woman living in Baghdad.
Cholera is fairly simple to treat under normal circumstances, but the war
in Iraq makes it far more difficult to contain. The mass displacement of
the population has pushed many people into unsanitary living conditions,
where food and water can become tainted with sewage and spread the cholera
bacteria.
Kamar el-Jadi, head of the health department for the Red Crescent Society
in Baghdad, said cholera was spreading because some people embraced
unsanitary living conditions, and she criticized the government for not
responding properly.
The Red Crescent has said that shallow wells contaminated by sewage around
Sulaymaniyah, which had at least 2 cholera outbreaks in the decades before
the American-led invasion in 2003, could have set off the epidemic. But
problems that have developed since the invasion, like poor control of
chlorination levels, have the potential to make this outbreak more
dangerous, the Red Crescent said.
Officials focusing on Baghdad are trying to figure out how to ward off an
epidemic when it is too dangerous for health workers to easily move about
the city. WHO officials advising the Iraqi government said Baghdad might
need to set up response teams in each separate district, rather than trying
to work with a centralized response unit.

At least one person died on Thu 20 Sep 2007, and over 200 people have
fallen sick following an outbreak of cholera in central Nepal, reported
local media website ekantipur.
A woman in her mid-30s died without receiving treatment on Thu 20 Sep 2007,
at Jutpani Village Development Committee (VDC) of Chitawan District,
situated some 85 km (53 miles) west of capital city Kathmandu. Over 150 in
Jutpani VDC and 50 in Shaktikhor and Padampur VDCs are receiving treatment
in various hospitals in the district.
The cholera outbreak was initially noticed in eastern part of Chitawan
District on Tue 18 Sep 2007. As all beds in the Bharatpur hospital are
already packed, patients could be seen lying on floor and corridors. Local
private clinics are also swamped by cholera patients.
According to locals, the diarrhea had spread in an epidemic proportion
after the flash floods that hit the area some days ago polluted the main
sources of water in the village.

An outbreak of cholera in the West Nile district of Nyadri (in Arua) has
killed one person and left 8 others hospitalized.
"Our investigation shows that the outbreak came from the DR Congo [DRC] and
some cases were contracted during a funeral of a person who died of the
disease," Dr Aldo Pariyo, the officer in charge of Maracha Health
sub-district said yesterday, 19 Sep 2007.
He said that 5 of the 8 cases reported at Maracha Health Centre were
Congolese. Olufe and Oleba sub-counties that border the DRC are said to be
the most affected areas.
Meanwhile, reports from Hoima that the district is also worried of a
possible outbreak of the disease, especially in areas around the shores of
Lake Albert. The district director of Health Services, Dr Joseph Ruyonga,
said his office was still verifying information concerning a reported
outbreak. "The Nkondo LCI [local council, smallest administrative unit]
chairperson has reported to my office that the disease has killed 2 of his
residents," Mr Ruyonga told Daily Monitor.
