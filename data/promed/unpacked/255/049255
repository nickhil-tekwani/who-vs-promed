The Provincial Integrated Health Office (PIHO) here in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya on Monday [20 Nov 2017] reported 8 cases of the dreaded Japanese encephalitis (JE) disease in 4 municipalities in the province.

Medical doctor Florejean Albano of the PIHO said one JE case was traced from Barangay (village) Ibung in Villaverde town; one case in Comon village in Aritao town; 2 cases in Quezon and Bascaran villages in Solano town; 2 cases in Casat village in the capital town of Bayombong; and one each in the towns of Kayapa and Kasibu.

Albano said the mosquitoborne disease cases were confirmed by the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) of the Department of Health (DOH). The cases occurred during May to August this year [2017]. She said all cases were laboratory confirmed at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), a health research facility based in Muntinlupa (Metro Manila) also under the DOH.

A serious disease that may cause death, JE spreads through mosquito bites with symptoms that develop from 5 to 15 days, which include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion and difficulty in moving. Other features are swelling around brain and coma.

The DOH said there is no outbreak of JE in the country but warned the public that there is no specific treatment yet for the disease. It also urged the public to be educated on the modes of spread and control of the disease. In posted bulletins at health institutions and centers, the public has been enjoined to avoid indiscriminate fogging activities and to avoid mosquitoes during hours of biting.

Albano also cited the warning of medical doctor Eric Tayag of the DOH not to take JE vaccine shots during the rainy season because of the low probability of the vaccine to take effect. [This seems odd. It is not clear why the vaccine would not take effect during the rainy season or would not cover the transmission season. - Mod.TY]

[Japanese encephalitis is endemic, and sporadic cases can occur in various localities. The Philippines islands are within the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus endemic zone. A cluster of Japanese encephalitis cases occurred this year (2017) in central Luzon Island. Clusters have been relatively rare in the Philippines. On Luzon Island this year (2017), as of August 2017, the Department of Health (DOH) has recorded a total of 149 cases of JE with at least 22 cases in noted Pampanga, the highest in the Central Luzon region (see Japanese encephalitis - Philippines: (PM) 20170818.5257940).

A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that JE is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases. The report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquitoborne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems.

JE virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature.
