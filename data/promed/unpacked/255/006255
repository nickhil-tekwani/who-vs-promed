A cluster of 6 chikungunya (CHK) cases has been recently imported from
Senegal into the Bordeau area. All CHK cases have been confirmed this week
by serology or RT-PCR (dengue serologies were negative). These CHK cases
travelled in Dakar, Thies, Kaolack, Louga and the Petite Cote area (the
coast between Rufisque and Joal Fadiouth, 70 km southeast of Dakar) from
August to November 2006.
Furthermore, we noticed 8 additional suspected cases (index cases of a
confirmed CHK who stayed in Jouga) with clinical symptoms suggestive of CHK
(laboratory test results expected).
The clinical presentation of the 6 CHK confirmed cases was typical : no
previous symptoms, severe and incapacitating polyarthralgia associated with
high fever, diffuse exanthema rash with desquamation (prominent in
palmoplantar area) and enanthem with odynophagia (Kawazaki-like). Two of
them had diffuse and blistering rash and one [of] them had an erythema
nodosum. Three of them were medical doctors who traveled in Senegal for
humanitarian aid.
This is the first alert in 2006 of a CHK outbreak in Senegal. CHK virus
caused outbreaks in Senegal in 1966, 1977, 1975, 1983, 1988, 1990,1992,
1996 and 1997 in many areas including the Dakar area.
Senegal is the main travel destination in Africa for French
international travelers. This alert highlights the important role of
travel medicine practitioners concerning the surveillance of emerging
infectious diseases in Southern countries.

[This is another interesting example of movement of a tropical disease --
chikungunya -- into more temperate areas -- Europe. One wonders how long
it will be before a viremic individual brings the virus into an area where
competent vectors (_Aedes albopictus_) occur. Maps of Senegal and France
