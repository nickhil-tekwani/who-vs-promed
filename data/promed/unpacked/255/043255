INFECTION CONTROL - CALIFORNIA, USA
====================================

Date: 31 May 1996 13:45:13 PST
From: "Jon Rosenberg M.D. C" <HW1.JROSENBE@HW1.CAHWNET.GOV>

I am one of a two member team in the
California Department of Health Services dealing with infection control and
healthcare epidemiology - for a state with a population exceeding 33 million,
over 450 acute care hospitals and 1500 long-term care facilities. I believe
that New York is the only other state with a formally designated infection
control program, although others have an active interest in the area. We
instituted active surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the San
Francisco Bay area last year, just in time to document its emergence in this
area as it moved westward across the country, and now works its way southward
in the state.
Two years ago I contacted every member in the state belonging to
the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology (SHEA) and the Association for
Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) in an attempt to
establish a statewide electronic network of practitioners, via either CDC
WONDER/PC or the Internet. Only a handful of each responded, the hospital
epidemiologists preferring Internet, the infection control practitioners
preferring WONDER (easier to use for e-mail). However, the vast majority of
infection control practitioners did not have access to a computer with a
modem.
Sadly, I must agree with a previous commentator that most
hospital-based nurses do not have on-line access and that electronic networks
involving this important population are not likely to happen in the immediate
future. [Let's hope the situation is changing rapidly - Mod.JW]
