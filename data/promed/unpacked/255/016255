["Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is a disease of domestic and wild cattle. The virus is distributed world-wide, but has been eradicated from a number of European countries and others have active eradication programs.

"The disease is characterized by clinical signs of the upper respiratory tract, such as a (muco)purulent nasal discharge, hyperaemia of the muzzle (red nose disease) and by conjunctivitis. Signs of general illness are fever, depression, inappetence, abortions and reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect the genital tract and cause pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis. Post mortem examinations reveal rhinitis, laryngitis and tracheitis. Mortality is low, and most infections run a subclinical course. Secondary bacterial infections can lead to more severe respiratory disease, and BoHV-1 could play a role in multifactor diseases such as 'shipping fever'.

"Inactivated and attenuated live vaccines are available. The vaccines protect cattle clinically in case of infection and markedly reduce the subsequent shedding of field virus. Although vaccination may not prevent field virus infection of individual animals, spreading of wild-type virus in infected herds is efficiently reduced. The vaccines must not induce disease, abortion, or any local or systemic reaction, and must be genetically stable. BoHV-1 glycoprotein E deleted mutant marker vaccines are now generally available (live or inactivated) and can be used as part of a DIVA strategy".
