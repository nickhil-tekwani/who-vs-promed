Twenty-five people were being treated Friday after an outbreak of food
poisoning in northern England and a further two cases were suspected,
health officials said.
Most of the 11 hospitalised over the _E. coli_ outbreak in North Cumbria
were children. Three, including one believed to be 18 months old, were
receiving kidney treatment. Their condition was described as "stable but
poorly" [meaning "not good" - Mod.JW]
The infection is thought to be of the same _E. coli_ 0157 strain which
killed 21 people in Scotland two years ago in an outbreak linked to a
butcher's shop.
This time the food poisoning is thought to have come from a milk
pasteurising unit at a farm in the town of Brigham.
Health officials in Cumbria admitted it was a serious outbreak but that it
was being contained. The cases first came to light Monday after a local
doctor noticed a clutch of patients with persistent symptoms.
Stella Goh of North Cumbria Health Authority said of the three youngsters:
"They are in a serious condition, albeit stable. We have to consider this
as a serious outbreak, but you have to bear in mind that we have taken
action very, very quickly and we have contained it very well."
She added that, as the condition has an incubation period of between one
and six days, people could pass on the infection even though they were not
showing any symptoms.
Those affected were being treated in isolation.
