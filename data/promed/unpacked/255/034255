A 22 year old man from Batu Kurau, Perak has died of dengue, bringing the
number of deaths from the fever so far this year [2009] to 79 from 38 062
cases, said health director-general Tan Sri Dr Mohd Ismail Merican. He said
the man, who died due to blood [hemorrhagic] complication on 2 Dec [2009],
had shown dengue symptoms on 27 Nov [2009] but merely sought treatment at a
health clinic 5 days later.

He said checks at the victim's house discovered that the compound of 14 out
of 85 houses in the vicinity had _Aedes_ mosquitoes breeding grounds.
"_Aedes_ mosquitoes breed in empty cans, coconut shells, tyres, drums, and
paint containers left outside the houses," he said, adding that fogging had
been carried in the area.

Dr Mohd Ismail said 784 dengue cases with one death were reported between
29 Nov-5 Dec [2009] while 7 states had shown an increase in cases, namely
Kedah (189 per cent increase), Negeri Sembilan (59 per cent), Johor (46 per
cent), Terengganu (36 per cent), Sabah (7 per cent), Perak (6 per cent),
and Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya (5 per cent).

He said many gotong-royong [mutual assistance] activities to [eliminate]
_Aedes_ breeding grounds had to be shelved due to lack of cooperation from
the public. A total of 231 compounds worth RM 44 350 [USD 13 044 ] and 396
clean-up notices were issued last week [week of 29 Nov 2009], he added.

A spike in dengue fever cases in north Queensland has authorities fearing a
bigger outbreak once the wet season begins. Queensland Health announced on
Friday [11 Dec 2009] there had been 10 confirmed dengue [virus] type-1
cases in the latest outbreak, which began in Heatley, Townsville, in early
November [2009].

Tropical Regional Services public health medical officer Dr Steven Donohue
said dengue had now spread to Garbutt, Stuart, and Wulguru, with some cases
apparently unreported. "We have had 7 cases confirmed in just the past few
days," Dr Donohue said in a statement. "I am also concerned because people
contracted dengue from infected dengue mosquitoes in areas with no known
link to earlier generations of transmission." This meant there were
infected people that Queensland Health did not know about, he said. "Dengue
cases could now occur anywhere in Townsville and beyond and could set us up
for a bigger outbreak once the more intense rains arrive," Dr Donohue said.

More than 1000 people across north Queensland were infected with the virus
during the previous outbreak, which began in November last year [2008],
including an elderly woman who died due to complications in March [2009].
It was the largest epidemic for at least 50 years.

Dengue is not normally fatal on the 1st infection although its debilitating
symptoms -- which some have likened to being prodded with red hot pokers --
can last for several weeks. But an infection with a 2nd strain of dengue
[virus] can lead to the more deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever. The 931
people infected in the far north with strain 3 of the virus during last
year's outbreak are at risk of severe complications if infected this year
[2009].

North Queensland residents have been warned to remove potential mosquito
breeding grounds by emptying containers holding water and clearing roof
gutters. They have also been asked to discourage mosquitoes by using indoor
surface spray, coils and zappers, and always wearing insect repellent,
including during the day. "We want to ensure people are as prepared as
possible," Dr Donohue said.

[This report illustrates the difficulty in tracking dengue infections early
in an outbreak when mild or subclinical cases may occur. The Queensland
health authorities are justifiably concerned that the outbreak could spread
quickly once the rainy season comes and mosquito vector breeding sites
increase.

The number of dengue cases in Jalisco now total 4635, of which 690 are the
DHF form of the disease, according to the latest report of the National
Center of Epidemiological Surveillance and Disease Control, which places
the entity [state] in 4th place nationally for the greatest number of those
affected by the mosquito-borne [virus].

In the last report issued by the federal agency for epidemiological week
47, 22-28 Nov [2009], there were 220 confirmed cases, of which 169 were
classical [dengue] and 51 DHF, which indicates that the outbreak in the
state continues to be present. The municipalities having the most cases are
Puerto Vallarta with 553 cases, Tlaquepaque with 524, Zapopan with 258, y
Tonala with 188 persons ill with classical dengue. As for DHF, the figures
also place the Jalisco capital [Guadalajara] with the greatest number of
affected [people] totaling 384 illnesses followed by Tlaquepaque with 67,
Zapopan with 57, Tonala with 43, and Puerto Vallarta with 30.

According to information from the Jalisco State Secretariat of Health
(SSJ), the municipalities in the latest batch [of data] most affected [by
dengue] are Puerto Vallarta, Cihuatlan, and Tomatlan as a result of rains
registered in the [Jalisco Pacific] coast for the past 2 weeks, which might
generate an upturn in cases [that would show up] in later epidemiological data.

Up to yesterday [8 Dec 2009] the results for 30 suspected dengue deaths are
still awaited by the SSJ, which according to Elizabeth Ulloa Robles,
director of public health, may not be resolved until next year [2010], due
to the arrival of the vacation period.

[The Christmas/New Year vacation period is a time of considerable movement
within Mexico. Internal movement as well as the beginning of the high
tourist season to resort destinations such as Puerto Vallarta, may be
affected by this dengue outbreak. The virus may be moved around to various
locations by viremic individuals. Tourists may be discouraged from coming
to beach resorts such as Puerto Vallarta, with unfortunate economic impacts
in a country already suffering from an economic downturn.
