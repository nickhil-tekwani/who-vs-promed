The Hong Kong government said Wed [21 Dec 2011] that more than 17 000
chickens were being culled at a poultry market after a chicken carcass
tested positive for avian flu.

The territory's Director of Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation
declared the Cheung Sha Wan Temporary Wholesale Poultry Market an
infected place, the government said in a statement.

Local farmers will be prevented from sending chickens to the market
for 21 days.

The government said that it was working to trace the origin of the
chicken, which was infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, but
that it did not know at this point whether it was from a local farm or
was imported.

[Notably, on 19 Dec 2011, the HK authorities submitted to the OIE an
"Immediate Notification" on the discovery of an H5N1-positive case "in
a Black-headed Gull (_Chroicocephalus ridibundus_), which had been
collected on 13 Dec 2011 at 7 Tai Yuk Road, Yuen Long. The
Black-headed Gull is a common winter visitor in Hong Kong. The
following epidemiological comments were included:

"An intensive surveillance system is in place for all poultry farms,
poultry markets, and pet bird shops in Hong Kong. The H5N1-infected
wild bird was detected in the framework of the ongoing surveillance
program on wild birds. No spread of disease was evident. As this was a
wild bird case, the date the event ended is the same as the date the
bird was found (i.e. 13 Dec 2011). Important note by the OIE Animal
Health Information Department: According to Chapter 10.4 on avian
influenza of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2011), the
notification of this outbreak does not change the HPAI free status of
Hong Kong and should not affect trade of poultry and their products,
since the bird involved in this outbreak does not fall within the OIE
definition of poultry."

The current identification of H5N1 in domestic fowl, if officially
confirmed, will probably change the HPAI-free status of Hong Kong. -
