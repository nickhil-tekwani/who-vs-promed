Description of affected populations: Nelore breed fattening cattle. 20
animals aged between 12 and 14 months and one animal aged over 36 months
have shown clinical signs of a vesicular disease.
The farms were first inspected on 18 Oct 2005 and it was found from the
registers that all the animals were vaccinated.
Diagnosis: these clinical suspicions are based on clinical signs suggestive
of a vesicular disease. Samples have been taken in all 4 farms and sent to
the National Agricultural Defense Laboratory
(LANAGRO-PA), Belem, Para.
Control measures
A. Undertaken:
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;

Other details/comments:
The suspect herds referred to in this report have in common the fact that
they all received animals that had been purchased at auction at Londrina
(State of Parana) on 4 Oct 2005. The epidemiological investigation
established a link between the sick animals and other animals originating
from Eldorado (State of Mato Grosso do Sul), a district where 2 outbreaks
of FMD due to virus serotype O had previously been reported(1). The other
farms that received animals purchased at the auction sales at Londrina have
been placed under surveillance. The animals on these farms do not currently
present any clinical signs of a vesicular disease.
Final report: no.

[FMD is continuing to spread in Brazil. This sad disease has had a major
impact on the exports of animal/animal products from Brazil. Many countries
have placed bans on these products, which is having a tremendous economic
impact, as well as caused the destruction of large numbers of animals. This
also takes an emotional toll on producers, veterinarians, and all involved.
