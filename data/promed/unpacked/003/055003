We commend Drs. dos Santos and Kain for their report of concurrent
infection with babesiosis and Lyme borreliosis in a Canadian traveler.
However, we feel that one point made in the report warrants further
comment. Although specimens of the black legged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_,
have been collected over the past 20 years at widely scattered localities
in all provinces of Canada between Manitoba and Newfoundland, to our
knowledge, reproducing populations of black legged ticks are currently only
endemic on the Long Point peninsula and Point Pelee National Park, both of
which are located on Lake Erie, Ontario. At most other Canadian localities
where black legged ticks have been reported, only individual or small
numbers of adult ticks (usually females) have been encountered, usually on
dogs or people (Lindsay et al. 1995). This suggests that these ticks have
been adventitiously introduced to these widely scattered areas, likely on
birds (Klich et al. 1996), but does not indicate that tick populations are
established. Thus at the present time, established populations of _I.
scapularis_ are focal and limited in Canada.
Although people or pets living outside of the two tick-endemic areas of
Ontario can be infested locally by an adventitious tick, and hence
potentially infected with any of the pathogens associated with this
species, the probability of this occurring is low. This is reflected in
the low number of indigenous cases of Lyme borreliosis reported in Canada.
Similarly, because _I. scapularis_ is not widely established in Canada, the
probability that humans infected with Babesia microti elsewhere will serve
as reservoirs of infection for local populations of _I. scapularis_ is
equally small. However, this does not negate the importance of clinicians
in Canada being aware of the possibility that these tick transmitted
diseases can occur.
