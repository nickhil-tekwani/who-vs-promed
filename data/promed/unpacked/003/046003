ANNOUNCEMENTS (08): PROMED-MAIL GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS
****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

At ProMED, we strive to serve the needs of our subscribers by accurately reporting the locations of outbreaks of infectious diseases and acute exposures to toxins that affect human health, including those in animals and in plants grown for food or animal feed.

In the past, we have tried to use the list of member states of the World Health Organization as the basis for assigning place names. This sometimes leads to confusing nomenclature when countries have political jurisdiction over locations that are far from their main locations. From now on, the subject line of ProMED posts will place emphasis on the actual geographic location of an outbreak rather than on the national (geographically distant) sovereignty over overseas territories, collectivities, dependencies, departments, etc. We do this in the interests of clarity and scientific accuracy and not in an attempt to make political judgments.

Examples:
Leptospirosis - Reunion Island (03): more cases
Potato viruses - Greenland: 1st reports
Rift Valley fever - Mayotte (14): human, cattle
Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (54): St Martin ex DR
Invasive mosquito - New Caledonia (02): comment
Hand, foot & mouth disease - St Maarten
Avian pox virus, penguins - Falkland Islands
Rabbit hemorrhagic disease - Guernsey: wild rabbit
Foodborne illness - Guam: staph susp
Avian influenza (60): Antarctica, H11N2, penguin
