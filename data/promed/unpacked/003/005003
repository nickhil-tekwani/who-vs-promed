More birds have been dying of disease in Darwin
-----------------------------------------------
Another black kite was found sick at Shoal Bay dump in Leanyer [Northern Territory] last week [27 May-2 Jun 2013] and died shortly after.

Department of Primary Industries spokesman Bill Whitington said the cause of death was most likely canker [_Trichomonas gallinae_], a parasite not transferable to humans.

Mr Whitington said in October last year [2012] an autopsy was performed on a dead kite after dozens were reported in the NT News.

"The bird died from a parasitic infection in the mouth and throat commonly known as canker and diagnosed in previous years as a periodic cause of death in kites," he said.

"The most likely source was from eating carrion." Carrion, the dead and decaying flesh of animals, is a main food for black kites, medium sized birds of prey who are opportunistic hunters and are more likely to scavenge.

NT News photographer Daniel Hartley-Allen attempted to help the bird but was unable to save it.

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes) which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis. Epidemic mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported, and the parasite infrequently infects other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds.

Trichomoniasis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon _Ectopistes migratorius_ and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink pigeon _Nesoenas mayeri_ and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle _Hieraaetus fasciatus_.
