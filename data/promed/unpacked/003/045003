A senior Australian scientist has been appointed to head the biggest animal
disease laboratory within the US Department of Agriculture. Dr Keith
Murray, CSIRO Animal Health deputy chief, will take up the position with
the National Animal Disease Centre in Ames, Iowa, in December. The centre
carries out research in the detection, characterisation and prevention of
animal diseases of importance to US livestock industries.
CSIRO Animal Health chief Mike Rickard says the appointment pays tribute to
Dr Murray's expertise in animal health. "His appointment will no doubt
serve to foster stronger links between NADC and CSIRO to the benefit of
both organisations," he said in a statement.
Dr. Murray has worked on the diagnosis and research of several high-profile
diseases, including the Hendra virus which killed a Queensland horse
trainer and 14 horses in 1994. He's also done work on lyssavirus, carried
by bats, and on the recent mysterious pilchard deaths.

[I was at a meeting this Thursday with a very senior ARS veterinarian with
laboratory experience who spoke very enthusiastically of this appointment.
Ames has been somewhat adrift for some time and needs someone with vision
and ability. USDA is to be congratulated for looking outside its own ranks
and the US universities to fill this important position. - Mod.MHJ]
