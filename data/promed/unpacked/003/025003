A 25-year-old Egyptian woman has contracted the highly pathogenic
bird flu virus after coming into contact with infected birds, the
latest case in a growing spate of infections in Egypt, state media
said today [17 Apr 2009].

The new infection brings to 65 the number of bird flu cases in humans
in the most populous Arab country, which has been hit harder by bird
flu than any other country outside Asia.

The woman, from El-Marg on Cairo's outskirts, was in critical
condition on a ventilator after falling ill with a fever on 11 Apr
[2009]. She was being treated with the antiviral drug Tamiflu, state
news agency MENA reported.

While H5N1 avian influenza virus rarely infects people, experts say
they fear it could mutate into a form that people could easily pass
to one another, sparking a pandemic that could kill millions.

Since 2003, H5N1 has infected at least 411 people in 15 countries and
killed 254. It has killed or forced the culling of more than 300
million birds in 61 countries in Asia, the West Asia, Africa, and
Europe.

Egypt has seen a surge in cases in recent months, with 14 people
confirmed to have contracted this virus since the start of the year
compared to 7 in the same period last year [2008]. Most of the new
cases have been young children, a change from 2008.

Some 23 Egyptians have died after contracting the bird flu virus.

Most of those infected had come into contact with infected domestic
birds in a country where roughly 5 million households depend on
domestically raised poultry as a significant source of food and
income.

The World Health Organisation said this month [April 2009] it was
concerned some Egyptians may carry the bird flu virus without showing
symptoms, which could give it more of a chance to mutate to a strain
that spreads easily among humans. The issue will be the subject of an
Egyptian government study backed by WHO.
