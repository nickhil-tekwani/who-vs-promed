CDC says influenza B strain doesn't match vaccine
---------------------------------------------------------
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today [8
Feb 2008] that most circulating influenza B viruses tested so far
this season don't match this year's vaccine, signaling that 2 of the
3 vaccine components are off-target. Joe Bresee, MD, chief of
epidemiology and prevention in the CDC's Influenza Division, told
reporters at a briefing today that 93 percent of the circulating
influenza B viruses analyzed so far belong to the Yamagata lineage,
which doesn't match the influenza B component of this year's vaccine.
The B component is a B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like virus, which belongs
to the Victoria lineage. Because the Yamagata and Victoria lineages
are distinct, the vaccine provides little cross-protection for
influenza B, he said.

The news of the mismatch between the influenza B strains closely
follows recent indications that a circulating influenza A/H3N2
subtype, A/Brisbane/10/2007-like, doesn't match the vaccine. However,
the CDC said the Brisbane strain is a recent antigenic variant of the
A/Wisconsin/67/2005-like virus, a component of this year's flu
vaccine. Consequently, CDC director Julie Gerberding said this year's
vaccine should provide some cross-protection against the Brisbane
strain, according to a 2 Feb 2008 Associated Press report. "Even when
there is less than an ideal match, there is still some
cross-protection," Bresee said."This is especially true for high-risk
populations. Getting a flu vaccine may reduce the risk of death or
hospitalization from the disease."

According to the CDC's most recent weekly flu report, for the week
ending 26 Jan 2008, US laboratories have characterized 197 flu
viruses so far this season. Of 43 influenza B viruses, 40 (93
percent) belonged to the Yamagata lineage. And, 3 (7 percent)
belonged to the Victoria lineage. Of the other viruses analyzed so
far, 53 were A/H3N2 and 101 were A/H1N1. H1N1 is the 3rd subtype
included in the seasonal vaccine. So far, the H1N1 component in this
year's vaccine seems well-matched to circulating H1N1 viruses, health
agencies have reported.

Bresee said it's difficult for global health officials to predict
what strains will be prevalent in the next influenza season, because
the selection must allow enough time for vaccine production. World
Health Organization (WHO) officials meet next week to advise what 3
components should be included in the northern hemisphere's 2008-09
seasonal flu vaccine. Despite the difficulties, he said the seasonal
flu vaccine has been well matched to the circulating strains in 16 of
the last 19 seasons.

The US flu season started out slowly, but activity has increased
sharply, which is typical, Bresee told reporters. All states are now
reporting influenza activity, and 31 are reporting widespread
outbreaks. So far, one flu-related death in a child has been
recorded, but it is likely that 5 additional deaths will be added to
the CDC tally within the next few days, Bresee said. He said the CDC
doesn't know yet if any of the children who died of flu this year
were coinfected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA). The CDC recently urged clinicians to be alert for
coinfections, particularly with MRSA. In the last flu season the
number of pediatric flu deaths was moderately higher than the
previous season; 15 of 73 deaths involved MRSA coinfections. "This
reminds us all that influenza is a common disease and can be a severe
disease," he said.

The news about the influenza B mismatch is the latest in a string of
unusual findings about circulating flu viruses. In late January
[2008], the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
sounded a warning that some H1N1 influenza viruses in Europe were
showing signs of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistance. Yesterday the WHO
reported that resistance has been found in 14 countries, 10 of them
in Europe. According to a WHO table updated yesterday [7 Feb 2008],
8.4 percent (15 of 179) of the H1N1 viruses analyzed in the United
States so far had the resistance mutation, and 6.3 percent (8 of 128)
Canadian isolates showed signs of oseltamivir resistance. Bresee said
the CDC is watching the oseltamivir-resistant viruses very closely
and that investigators still don't know what caused the mutation.

The vaccine mismatch and the appearance of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1
virus in both Europe and North America are novel features of the
epidemiology of the 2007/2008 influenza season. - Mod.CP]
