2 people died last week from botulism in the Zaporozhye region, and 2 patients are in the hospital. A 32 year old woman and her 9 year old son were hospitalized with the same diagnosis to the regional hospital in Ivano-Frankivsk. Later a 20 year old man also fell ill with botulism. 3 people in the village of Piatykhatky in the Dnipropetrovsk region also fell ill with botulism in late April 2015.

According to physicians, almost all cases of illness are associated with the consumption of dried fish.

Doctors report that the recovery from infection is serum [anti-botulinum], which is almost absent in Ukraine now. "There are several types of this serum. It was purchased in 2013. A sufficient amount of serum was through 2014 but the shelf life has expired. The drugs were destroyed.

Indeed currently there is a shortage of these vaccines, reported Larisa Ryndina, the employee of the health Department of Zaporozhye regional administration.

[The lack of availability of polyvalent botulism antiserum no doubt can contribute to the deaths here. The antiserum can inactivate toxin that has not yet bound to its target at the neuromuscular junction.

The method of diagnosis of botulism is not stated here. Individual cases of the paralysis can be confused with other diseases, but a cluster of such cases is certainly likely to be botulism. Type E botulism is the type frequently associated with fish products (1).

Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in
which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (2).
