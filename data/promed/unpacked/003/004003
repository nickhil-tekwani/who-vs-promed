WHO Influenza update 160
----------------------
Summary:
- The 2011-2012 influenza season is coming to an end in most northern temperate regions of the world. Countries in the southern hemisphere temperate zone are still at low or inter-seasonal levels, though some very small increases in detections have been reported in Chile. Some activity persists in sub-Saharan Africa.

- Throughout the 2011-12 influenza season, different viruses have predominated in different parts of the world in the northern hemisphere. In North America, Canada had a slight predominance nationally of influenza B over influenza A(H3N2) (67 percent vs. 33 percent respectively) particularly later in the season but the distribution was not uniform across the country. In the United States of America (USA), the proportions were reversed, and A(H3N2) was more common. The season in Mexico was dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In Europe, the large majority of influenza viruses have been influenza A(H3N2) with only very small numbers of A(H1N1)pdm09 and B. In Asia, northern China and Mongolia reported mostly influenza B early in the season with influenza A(H3N2) appearing later, and this sequence was reversed in the Republic of Korea and Japan where, A(H3N2) was predominant in the beginning and type B appeared later.

- Early in the season, most viruses tested were antigenically related to those found in the current trivalent seasonal vaccine. However, by mid-season, divergence was noted in both the USA and Europe in the A(H3N2) viruses tested. Significant numbers of A(H3N2) viruses tested in recent months have shown reduced cross reactivity with the 2011-12 vaccine virus. Influenza type B virus detections have been both from the Victoria and Yamagata lineages with the former slightly more common in China and parts of Europe.

- Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been low or undetectable throughout the season; however, a slight increase in levels of resistance to oseltamivir has been reported in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates in the USA. Most (11/16) of these oseltamivir resistant cases have been from the state of Texas, where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has been the most common virus circulating.

[The ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) Weekly surveillance Bulletin for 25 May 2012 reported that the 2011-2012 influenza season in Europe has been unusual. It started late, had no geographical progression and has varied considerably in its overall impact from country to country.

The features the past week were:
- All reporting countries but Slovakia reported low intensity.
- Of 119 sentinel specimens tested by 22 countries, 6.7 percent were positive for influenza virus.
- Of 7344 influenza A viruses subtyped in sentinel practices since week 40/2011, 98.7 percent were A(H3) viruses and 1.3 percent were A(H1)pdm09 viruses. The lineage of 185 sentinel B viruses has been determined: 61.1 percent were B-Victoria lineage and 38.9 percent were B-Yamagata lineage by detection.
- During week 20/2012, 3 cases of SARI or severe influenza were reported. (For detailed information, see: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/120525-SUR-WISO.pdf.

It is concluded that the 2011–2012 influenza season is coming to its end. The season has been dominated by A(H3) viruses with no antiviral resistance. Among B viruses, both Victoria and Yamagata-lineage viruses have made a substantial contribution toward the end of the season, with the Victoria lineage dominating in some countries and the Yamagata lineage in others.

As a consequence the ECDC weekly report will be reduced to a a fortnightly report during the off-season period (weeks 21– 39/2012).

The onset of the impending Southern Hemisphere influenza season is now awaited. -Mod.CP]
