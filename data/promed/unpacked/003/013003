A 6 year old boy has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a critical condition in the Vall d'Hebron Hospital in Barcelona with diphtheria, the 1st case of this infectious disease diagnosed in Spain in 28 years. According to sources in the Department of Health, the boy, a resident of Olot (Girona), had not been vaccinated. Medications to treat children arrived in Spain yesterday 1 Jun 2015, from Russia, as reported by the Ministry of Health, which stated that the minister Alfonso Alonso has been personally involved in management.

Since diphtheria is an infectious disease that is spread through the air, the Public Health Agency of Catalonia (ASPCAT) has reported that it is coordinating "appropriate" control measures, comprising administering preventive medication and booster vaccination to prevent the occurrence of disease in people who have been in contact with the child.

Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by the bacillus _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, which manifests itself in the larynx and is transmitted through secretions from the nose, sneezing, sweat and tears of those infected and affects only humans. When the bacteria grow, toxins are released into the blood and can cause damage to the heart, kidneys and nervous system and the disease has a guarded prognosis for the 1st 50 days.

Symptoms of the disease are variable but it often produces sore throat and runny nose, swollen glands in the neck, malaise and fever. It may also cause the formation of a membrane in the pharynx that bleeds easily.

Since 1983 there have been no cases of diphtheria in Catalonia. The last recorded case in Spain was 28 years ago [1997].

The Public Health Agency of Catalonia reports that the affected child developed symptoms on 23 May 2015 and on 28 May 2015, when his condition worsened, he was hospitalized in Olot. When laboratory results confirmed the diagnosis of the disease, he was transferred to Vall d'Hebron Hospital where he is receiving treatment.

The Public Health Agency of Catalonia reminds readers that diphtheria is a "rare" disease in developed countries thanks to widespread vaccination of the population and the improvement of hygienic conditions.

[The medication obtained from Russia in this case was certainly a hyperimmune diphtheria antibody product, likely made in equines.

The following was extracted from http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf:

"Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated disease caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. The name of the disease is derived from the Greek 'diphthera', meaning leather hide. The disease was described in the 5th century BCE by Hippocrates, and epidemics were described in the 6th century AD by Aetius. The bacterium was first observed in diphtheritic membranes by Klebs in 1883 and cultivated by Loeffler in 1884. Antitoxin was invented in the late 19th century, and toxoid was developed in the 1920s.

"_C. diphtheriae_ is an aerobic Gram positive bacillus. Toxin production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene). Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease. Culture of the organism requires selective media containing tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distinguished in the laboratory from other _Corynebacterium_ species that normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin (such as diphtheroids). _C. diphtheriae_ has 3 biotypes -- gravis, intermedius, and mitis. The most severe disease is associated with the gravis biotype, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of _C. diphtheriae_ should be tested by the laboratory for toxigenicity.

"Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli in the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin that inhibits cellular protein synthesis and is responsible for local tissue destruction and membrane formation. The toxin produced at the site of the membrane is absorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of the body. The toxin is responsible for the major complications of myocarditis and neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria). Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing strains is generally milder. While rare severe cases have been reported, these may actually have been caused by toxigenic strains that were not detected because of inadequate culture sampling.

"The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10 days). Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diphtheria into a number of manifestations, depending on the site of disease. The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils. Infection at these sites is usually associated with substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The onset of pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include malaise, sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within 2-3 days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends, varying in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils to covering most of the soft palate. Often by the time a physician is contacted, the membrane is greyish-green, or black if bleeding has occurred. There is a minimal amount of mucosal erythema surrounding the membrane. The membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible attempts to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation may result in respiratory obstruction.

"The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid pulse, stupor, and coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days. Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may develop marked edema of the submandibular areas and the anterior neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a characteristic "bull neck" appearance.

"Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications are generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent during the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants."

Catalonia is an autonomous community of Spain, and designated a "historical nationality" by its Statute of Autonomy. Catalonia comprises 4 provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. Catalonia can be found on a map of Spain at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia. Olot is located in Girona province. - Mod.LL
