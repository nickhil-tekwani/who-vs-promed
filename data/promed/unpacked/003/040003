The Minister of Public Health, Daniel Rivera, assured yesterday [15 Jun 2022] 2 dogs and a cat were identified with animal rabies recently in the communities of Santiago but no case of human rabies was registered. He pointed out [that] immediately after the cases were identified, a timely intervention was made, and an epidemiological cordon was established, which allowed to break the transmission and control the situation so for the moment, there are no contagions.

He recalled [how] in November of last year (2021) and in March of this year (2022), vaccination campaigns for dogs and cats were carried out, covering a large number of the canine and feline population of the country, and [said] there are enough vaccines for people to immunize their pets.

The Minas Gerais State Health Department confirmed this Friday [17 Jun 2022] the death of a 4 year old child from rural Bertópolis, in Vale do Mucuri, was caused by the human rabies virus. This is the 4th confirmed case of the disease this year [2022].

The child died on [28 May 2022]. Before her, a 5 year old boy and two 12 year olds had also died from the disease. All were residents of rural Bertópolis.

The secretariat ruled out another case of the disease, registered at the same location, which affected an 11 year old child, notified on [21 Apr 2022].

Vaccination coverage in the Bertópolis region is 98.5% for the 1st dose and 90.6% for the 2nd dose. There was also reinforcement in the vaccination of animals.

The secretariat is now monitoring a new suspected case of the disease: a 17 year old, with no history of exposure to the suspected animal, resident of the rural area of Teófilo Otoni, in Vale do Mucuri. The case was reported on [13 Jun 2022] and the patient is under hospital observation after presenting neurological symptoms.

To date in 2022, there have been 6 suspected cases of the disease, with 4 confirmed deaths, 1 discarded and 1 under investigation.

The Ocean County Health Department has sent out a rabies alert for a section of Manchester (New Jersey). Several people were attacked by a cat in the Pines Manor section of town, which is a mobile home community off Route 37. That cat has been found dead and has subsequently tested positive for rabies.

Health officials are urging anyone who may have come in contact with the cat to seek immediate medical attention. Rabies is highly contagious to animals and humans. If caught early in humans, it can be treated. If left untreated, it is almost always fatal.

Manchester police say they were called to Pines Manor last Wednesday [8 Jun 2022] for a report a cat was attacking people. The animal was found dead and removed for testing by the animal control officer.

If you came in contact with this cat, notify the Ocean County Health Department and seek medical attention immediately. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Treatment involves a series of shots given to prevent the rabies virus from infecting the human nervous system.

[4] Georgia (Richmond County), South Carolina: fox, vaccine and safety reminder

A Richmond County resident was attacked by a fox when it was passing through the victim's yard on [9 Jun 2022] in the Lake Olmstead area of Augusta [South Carolina], authorities said. Augusta Animal Services responded to the scene and collected the fox.

The Richmond County Health Department Environmental Health Section was notified and sent the fox to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory in Decatur for rabies testing. Test results confirmed the fox was positive for rabies.

The Richmond County Health Department's Environmental Health Section is also notifying residents in the area to avoid contact with wild animals. It recommends the following:

*Make sure your dogs and cats are currently vaccinated against rabies.
*Do not let your pets roam free. They are more likely to have contact with a rabid wild animal.
*Avoid feeding your animals outside. This draws stray and wild animals to your doorstep.
*Teach your children not to approach wild animals and animals they don't know.

The Richmond County Health Department Environmental Health Section is asking all residents to make sure pets are vaccinated against rabies and to avoid all contact with wild animals. In addition, report any contact of humans and domestic animals with wild animals to Richmond County Health Department Environmental Health Section office or Augusta Animal Services.

Meanwhile, South Carolina officials sent out an email urging residents not to keep wild animals as pets. "Wild animals live in nature and are not domesticated, meaning they're not tame or kept as a pet or on a farm," the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and South Carolina Department of Natural Resources said on Thursday [16 Jun 2022] in a statement, "Keeping wild animals as pets in some cases may be illegal, and puts the owner and others who encounter the animal at risk of injury or getting diseases such as rabies."

The agencies recommend you protect yourself and others from rabies by:
*Leaving wildlife alone and not keeping wild animals as "pets."
*Not approaching an animal in need. Contact a wildlife rehabilitator for the type of animal in need. Deer, fox, and coyote rehabilitators require a special permit issued by SCDNR. A registry of rehabilitators, maintained by SCDNR, is available.
*Contacting your local animal control for stray and feral cats and dogs, a wildlife control operator for nuisance wildlife, or a wildlife rehabilitator for sick and injured wildlife.
*Never touching wild or stray animals with your bare hands.
*Vaccinating pets and livestock against rabies. By law, all dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated. You can find low-cost rabies vaccination clinics. It's also recommended livestock receive their rabies vaccinations, as well.

In South Carolina, the commonest animals to test positive for rabies are wild animals, such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats. CDC advises that a skunk, raccoon, fox, or bat having bitten someone should be euthanized and tested for rabies as soon as possible.

While cats and dogs may be able to undergo quarantined observation for a specific time period to determine whether they contracted rabies, holding wild animals for observation isn't a safe option because it's not known how long it takes for signs of rabies to appear in different types of wild animals. And since there is no approved rabies vaccine for wild animals kept as pets, even vaccinated wild animals will be treated as unvaccinated.

An adult brown tabby cat found in the area of Taylor Ave. in Mantua [New Jersey] tested positive for rabies on Wednesday [15 Jun 2022], Gloucester County officials said. A person who was exposed to the cat was undergoing treatment as of Wednesday [15 Jun 2022], officials added.

Individuals are reminded anyone who is exposed to rabies runs the risk for death and needs immediate treatment, according to officials. Therefore, anyone who sees an animal "appearing disoriented or exhibits strange behavior" should not try to help the animal, officials said. Rather, such individuals should contact Gloucester County Animal Control Office immediately, officials continued. The same warning applies to any wild or unfamiliar animals that individuals may encounter, officials said.

A dog in the Sloughhouse area has tested positive for rabies, according to Sacramento County Public Health. Public health officials are advising Sloughhouse residents to call them if they or their pet came into contact with a stray, sickly looking black and white Australian cattle dog between [24 May and 3 Jun 2022].

"Rabies in dogs is rare," public health officer Dr Olivia Kasirye said. "We want residents and the community to be aware and to remind people of the importance of vaccinating their pets."

According to public health officials, rabies is most commonly transmitted through a bite and the virus-containing saliva of those infected. Public health officials also advised residents in the area to check their pet's vaccination records. Anyone who suspects they or their pet came into contact with the infected dog can contact Sacramento County Public Health.

[Some readers may notice the case from Brazil seems familiar. It is a follow-up from the last rabies posting. The individual then was not confirmed to have died from rabies, but now the deceased has a firm diagnosis of rabies.

Bites suffered by any individual are unpleasant in any case, but feel worse when the animal is confirmed to have rabies. We are glad there is adequate treatment for these situations, but please don't linger, contact your physician or the county health department to know what to do should you be bitten by a wild, or stray animal.

Generally, there are 2 forms of rabies recognized in animals, the furious form and the paralytic, sometimes called dumb form of rabies. The aggressive or furious form is generally easy to recognize but some times the paralytic form may not be recognized when an animal seems extra shy or withdrawn or unusually quiet, especially for a wild animal.

"The furious form of rabies is familiar to most people. Signs may include:
• Aggression
• Loss of fear
• Daytime activity by a nocturnal species
• Attraction to noise and human activity
• Excessive vocalization
• Dilated pupils
• Difficulty swallowing
• Loss of appetite
• Restlessness
• Biting at objects or other animals
• May or may not drool

"The paralytic form of rabies may include signs such as:
• Decreased activity
• Poor coordination
• Hind limb weakness
• Acting "dull"
• Cats may meow more excessively

"As the disease progresses, an animal affected by paralytic rabies may:
• Drop its lower jaw
• Drool
• Be unable to swallow
• Become paralyzed
• Die

It is important to realize not all animals show every sign. Most neurological or behavioral abnormalities could potentially be rabies." (Extracted from https://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Animals/AHDServices/diseases/Pages/Rabies.aspx)

It is also important to be aware of your surroundings, especially any animals not known to you.

In human beings: "After a rabies exposure, the rabies virus has to travel to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between exposure and appearance of symptoms is the incubation period. It may last for weeks to months. The incubation period may vary based on
• the location of the exposure site (how far away it is from the brain),
• the type of rabies virus, and
• any existing immunity.

"The first symptoms of rabies may be similar to the flu, including weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. There also may be discomfort, prickling, or an itching sensation at the site of the bite. These symptoms may last for days.

"Symptoms then progress to cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia. The acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. Less than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been documented. Only a few survivors had no history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis."
