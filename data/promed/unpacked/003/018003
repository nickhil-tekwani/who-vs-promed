Since 1 Jan 2013, 1315 cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection have been reported by 11 Member States as potentially linked to the ongoing HAV outbreak. Of these, 240 were confirmed outbreak cases, sharing the same sequence KF182323 at the junction VP1-2a of the viral genome. When first declared, the outbreak was associated with travel to Italy. In addition to Italy, 7 other Member States have now reported cases with no travel history: France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK.

Epidemiological, microbiological and environmental investigations indicate frozen berries as the vehicle of infection for this outbreak and suggest that it could be a single outbreak, linked to a common, continuous source in the EU/EEA. However other hypotheses cannot be excluded, such as cross contamination in a food production environment or an outbreak strain that is already widespread but has, to date, gone undetected. Due to the characteristics of the pathogen (that is, low infectivity dose and long incubation period) and of the food vehicle (that is, long shelf-life and complex processing and distribution chain), it is expected that more cases will be reported and other Member States may become involved. In accordance with their national guidelines, Member States may consider active or passive immunisation of those in close contact with cases in order to prevent secondary transmission. Despite coordinated efforts from EFSA, ECDC, affected Member States and the European Commission (HAV-Trace Working Group), the ongoing trace-back investigation has not yet identified a likely source of contamination. The Working Group will continue the trace-back exercise and extend participation, on voluntary basis, to countries that have recently become involved, namely France, Norway and Sweden. All relevant information on national trace-back investigations shall be gathered and integrated into the HAV-Trace exercise via the RASFF (Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed) platform.

Given the epidemiological and laboratory evidence of contaminated frozen berries, the risk to human health, and ongoing transmission with increasing geographical spread, affected Member States could consider implementing mitigating measures at national level. In particular, Member States could consider promoting risk communication, recommending heat treatment of frozen berries before consumption and encouraging HAV vaccination of those in contact with cases and throughout the larger community. Implementation of an enhanced sampling scheme for frozen berries at the processing and distribution level could also be considered. Enhanced epidemiological and microbiological surveillance for HAV in the EU/EEA should also be encouraged. A whole genome sequencing approach needs to be considered to examine viral isolates from different points in time during the outbreak in order to confirm the hypothesis of a single outbreak. ECDC, EFSA, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the affected Member States, will continue to their efforts to identify the vehicle and source of infection and closely monitor this event. The risk assessment will be updated as soon as any new relevant information becomes available.

[In the developing world, exposure to fecal-oral transmitted agents such as hepatitis A occurs early in life, usually in the 1st decade. Often, children infected at this age develop either asymptomatic or anicteric infection. Infections developing later in adulthood, however, are much more likely to be overt and icteric in nature. This is more likely what occurs in the developed world. As a reminder, hepatitis A infection is not a cause of chronic hepatitis as can occur with types B and C, where cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma can result. - Mod.LL]

[As a reminder, citing from Mod.CP's comment when this outbreak was reported on ProMED-mail in Apr 2013 "Soft fruits, if not consumed close to their point of production, are usual transported and stored in a frozen state. Enteric viruses such as hepatitis A virus are not inactivated by freezing, and infection can be distributed widely. In the case of this multi-country outbreak, genotyping of samples suggests that berries picked in Egypt have been responsible for outbreaks of hepatitis A in several north European countries. Imported berries of unknown provenance should preferably be boiled before consumption. - Mod.CP". (Hepatitis A - EU: Nordic countries, food-borne, frozen berries 20130417.1653060). Of interest is a sizable multistate outbreak of hepatitis A genotype 1B (the same strain) occurred in the USA in 2013 and was epidemiologically linked to pomegranate seeds imported from Turkey. (see Hepatitis A - USA (10): frozen berries, update 20130925.1967843). - Mod.MPP
