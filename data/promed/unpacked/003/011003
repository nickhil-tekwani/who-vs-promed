26-year-old latest to die from dengue fever
-------------------------------------------
A 26-year-old woman who died at Uthai Thani Hospital on Thursday is
the country's latest case of dengue haemorrhagic fever, only a week
after the death of a 13-year-old boy whose case has aroused a
nationwide attention, increasing the country's death toll to 16.
Arun Taengsingtrong, director of Uthai Thani Hospital, said a patient
was transferred from nearby Nakhon Sawan province and admitted to the
intensive care unit on Wednesday. She had serious symptoms of dengue
shock syndrome -- low blood plasma, excessive blood thickness and
temporary shock -- and died a day later.
Blood samples have been sent to a laboratory in Nakhon Sawan for
diagnosis of the dengue serotype, he said.
A suspected severe outbreak of dengue fever has caught public
attention after a 13-year-old boy died last week due to severe dengue
shock syndrome and internal bleeding.
The virus is known to occur in 4 varieties -- Dengue 1, 2, 3 and 4 --
and usually hits the central and southern regions the hardest. Dengue
fever tends to strike urban areas because they have the highest
concentrations of _Aedes aegypti_ or striped mosquitoes, which carry
the virus.
So far in 2005, 8005 people have contracted dengue fever. The number
of patients and deaths is expected to increase especially during
rainy season in June-August. During 2004, 38 000 people contracted
the mosquito-borne disease and 40 died, most in the 10-14 year age
group.
Public Health Minister Suchai Charoenratanakul said he had appointed
an expert on dengue fever to monitor the outbreak in each province.
Health volunteers would talk to local communities about how to avoid
the disease.
Suchitra Nimmannitya, senior consultant of Queen Sirikit Institute of
Child Health, said people should send patients with suspected
dengue-like symptoms of high fever to hospital immediately.
Neither a vaccine nor antiviral drugs have been developed to cure the
disease, though local researchers are working on them.
The public should continue avoiding damp unsanitary breeding grounds,
including emptying pools of still water, from used tyres, small pots
and flower pots, jars, bottles, and water tanks.

Thailand to launch campaign against dengue fever
------------------------------------------------
The Thai government plans to launch a "major campaign" across the
country to increase public awareness of dengue fever.
The campaign against dengue fever will be launched on 29 May 2005, Public
Health Minister Dr. Suchai Charoenratanakul was quoted by the Thai
News Agency as saying Saturday. The campaign will target schools,
hospitals and households and encourage them to protect themselves by
helping prevent an outbreak of dengue fever.
The Thai public will be encouraged to use mosquito nets and mosquito
traps, and destroy mosquito breeding grounds.
Health officials and volunteers will act as "Mr. Dengue Fever" and
visit targeted areas throughout the country, giving advice on dengue
fever prevention. "There will be about 800 000 'Mr. Dengue fevers' to
support the campaign," the minister said.
The government campaign follows an official survey which showed the
number of dengue fever patients had increased by 790 in the week
between May 7-14.
The 10 provinces with the highest records of dengue fever cases are
Ranong, Surat Thani, Petchburi, Satun, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Trang and
Nakhon Si Thammarat in the South; Rayong and Sa Kaew in the East; and
Nakhon Nayok in the central region.
There have been more than 8000 reported dengue fever cases in
Thailand since the beginning of 2005. 15 people have died.

Dengue cases double in Phuket
-----------------------------
Thailand's southern island resort of Phuket today [24 May 2005]
launched a concerted campaign to destroy mosquitoes responsible for
spreading dengue fever, after a discovery of a 2-fold rise in the
number of dengue cases since last year [2004].
Led by Deputy Phuket Governor Suphachai Yuwaboon and the chief
provincial public health official, the campaign kicked off this
morning with pleas to the public to help in the fight against the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
Members of the public taking part in the launch held banners and
paraded around the town stating their commitment to destroying
mosquito larvae.
According to Dr. Wanchai Satyawuthiphong, the island province's chief
public health official, there are currently 68 confirmed cases of
dengue fever on the island, with another 340 patients waiting
diagnosis.
Phuket has the 9th highest number of dengue cases in the country [but does
not figure in the list of 10 most affected provinces in the post above. -
Mod.JW], and more than double the number it had last year [2004]. However,
the chief public health officer stressed that no one had yet died of the
condition, which has become a matter of national concern this year [2005].

Although now largely absent from newspaper headlines, dengue fever is
still widespread in West Java and continues to quietly kill people
there, with 101 having succumbed to the illness by 16 May 2005, a
health official says.
West Java Health Office head Yudi Prayudha said the latest data shows
that 5515 people have suffered from dengue fever in 25 regions from
January to May this year.
"During this transition season, where environmental sanitation is
[unsatisfactory], it's easy to trigger the increase of dengue fever
cases in the province," Yudi said in Bandung.
Despite the high number of victims, cases of dengue fever are still
half the number reported in the same period 2004, when 177 people out
of 17 200 sufferers died of the disease.
Yudi, however, cautioned against complacency, saying not all
regencies and municipalities had reported their fever cases to the
health office. Out of the reported cases so far, most of them, or 895
cases, were found in Bandung city, followed by Bekasi city with 836
cases.
In the 1st 5 months of 2005, the most reported cases happened in
February, with 2018 cases and 27 dead. In January, 41 people died of
dengue fever out of a reported 1043 sufferers.
The head of the office's environmental sanitation section, Udeng
Daman, said people's awareness about maintaining a clean environment
was still low.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever fast spreading in Indonesia
----------------------------------------------------
Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is spreading fast in Indonesia, with
7339 cases and 40 deaths reported in Jakarta between January 2005 and
last Sunday [22 May 2005].
A local newspaper quoted the Health Department as saying that the
number of DHF cases would reach its peak in May and June, when
climatic changes take place with intermittent rain. During the 2
months, many water catchment areas would become _Aedes_ mosquito
breeding grounds, it said. In Bandung, West Java residents were
reminded to be wary against DHF following the transition from rainy
to drought season, it said.
West Java Health Department head Yudi Prayudha said dengue cases
might rise as the people did not bother to clean up areas with
stagnant waters. So far, 895 cases and 7 deaths have been detected in
Bandung, he said. In Bogor, he said, 350 cases with 9 deaths have
been reported, while in Padang, Sumatera, 249 people have been taken
ill with 3 deaths from January 2005 till now.

Dengue breeding places spotted
------------------------------
Health inspectors have discovered large numbers of dengue mosquitoes
in the Currajong area.
Staff from the Townsville and Thuringowa city councils are working
closely with mosquito control experts from the Tropical Public Health
Unit to conduct house-to-house inspections and mosquito eradication.
Experts hope they can contain the dengue outbreak which has so far
affected 4 people, with several more cases suspected.
3 cases have been confirmed in Currajong and one in Kirwan. There are
also 2 suspected cases in Kirwan and Railway Estate. Acting director
of environmental health with Queensland's Tropical Public Health Unit
Damien Farrington said it was vital that twin cities residents took
immediate steps to prevent the outbreak from escalating.
Dengue victim and Townsville's Deputy Mayor Councilor Ann Bunnell
urged residents to do all they could to stop the outbreak from
spreading. "Dengue is the [worst] illness I have ever had in my life,"
Cr. Bunnell said. "My husband and daughter got it at the same time;
my daughter got a serious blood problem from it. We were very ill,
terribly ill." Cr. Bunnell said she believed she was still
experiencing some health problems as a result of the disease. "It can
be fatal. It is different [from] Ross River fever; the mosquito which
carries Ross River can travel 40 km while the dengue mosquito can
only travel 200 m. So if you get it, it has come from your own home
or the people you visit."
Mr. Farrington said that, to protect themselves, residents had to
check their yard for mosquito breeding. "Tip out, flush out, throw
away or store dry any containers holding water in which mosquitoes
can breed, such as old tires, buckets, toys, pot plant bases, and
blocked roof gutters," he said. "Use insect repellent: wear personal
repellent if you are being bitten during the day, and use surface
insect spray, mozzie [mosquito] zappers and coils around the house."
People with symptoms of dengue -- such as fever, headache, rash, loss
of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea, and fatigue -- should see a
doctor immediately. The serious form of the disease, dengue
hemorrhagic fever, can be fatal, especially in young children.
