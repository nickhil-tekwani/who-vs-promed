Heroes de Chapultepec elementary school in Estacion Corral [Sonora state] was closed because of 7 cases of hepatitis A, according to some parents, but only 5 cases had been confirmed, according to local health authorities. Parents are concerned because they fear the occurrence of a widespread outbreak.

Since last Tuesday, some parents started noticing some symptoms in their children, and some of them had a confirmed diagnosis (of hepatitis A) made by private physicians. Parents of affected children state that 'the virus is present in the school's toilets'.

Ms. Juliana Atienzo-Alcaraz, head of the Parents Union of the aforementioned school pointed out that it was decided to close the school because of fear that other children may acquire the disease.

A similar situation has been observed in Tajimaroa Elementary School, where 5 cases of hepatitis were detected in a population of 24 children, so the facility was closed, according to Ms. Maria Petra Onamea-Gonzalez, head of this school.
