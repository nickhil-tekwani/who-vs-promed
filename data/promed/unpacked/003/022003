---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A survey of all major pome fruit growing regions was conducted during
2005 and 2006 to establish whether _Erwinia amylovora_, the causal
agent of fireblight, was present in Syria. Samples were collected
from quince (_Cydonia oblonga_), pear (_Pyrus communis_), and apple
(_Malus domestica_) trees suspected of being infected with _E.
amylovora_. A total of 75 isolates of _E. amylovora_ were recovered,
mainly from quince and some from pear but none from apple.

All isolates produced typical symptoms of fireblight when tested on
immature pear fruit. Two isolates were shown to induce a delayed
hypersensitivity reaction on tobacco. All the isolates were confirmed
to be _E. amylovora_ by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] specific for
this bacterium.

Fireblight was found to prevail in the Al-Zabadani region (Rif
Damascus district), an area with a moderate temperature range (10-29
deg Celsius/50-84 deg F) and high relative humidity (above 70
percent) during the blossom period. However, the disease was found to
be restricted within Syria and observed only in isolated foci near
the Lebanese border.

This is the 1st isolation and identification of _E. amylovora_ from Syria.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is
considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees
worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible,
although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only
members of the _Rosaceae_ sub-family _Pomoideae_ are affected. The
host range covers more than 180 species from 39 genera, including
also loquat, ornamental roses, hawthorn, and firethorn.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of
the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend
forming black hooks, cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees
invariably die. Fruits can also be infected, appearing oily and often
exuding droplets of bacterial ooze. The bacteria are highly
infectious and are spread by insects (aphids, flies, bees, etc),
wind, water, mechanical means, and on plant material (including
budwood). They enter the host plant through wounds, often on flowers,
and can move quickly through host tissue, which can lead to the loss
of an entire tree in a single growing season. The pathogen can
survive on the host as an endophyte or epiphyte for variable periods
of time depending of environmental factors, and it is apparently
quiescent through the dormant period of the host.

_E. amylovora_ was originally described from the USA as the 1st
bacterium causing a plant disease. It is now widely distributed in
northern America, Europe, some areas of western Asia, and is endemic
to New Zealand. The pathogen has been placed on the quarantine alert
list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Strict
quarantine regulations, including an import embargo on all host
material including fruit from infected countries, are enforced in
Australia to prevent the introduction of fireblight. The costs of
fireblight to national agricultural industries due to yield losses
and disease management requirements (monitoring and phytosanitation
programmes, removal of all host plants in areas of outbreaks) are
potentially enormous.

The disease has been reported from a number of countries in the
Eastern Mediterranean region. It was suspected to be present in
Syria, and this has now been officially confirmed by the survey
reported above.
