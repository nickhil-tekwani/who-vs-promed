Similar to last year [2008], cases of equine encephalosis have
commenced in various parts of the country. During the last disease
season, clinical cases appeared between October 2008 and January
2009. The clinical signs in current cases are similar to those seen
last year, mainly elevated body temperature and inappetence for
several days. 90 percent of the affected horses recover without
complications. No vaccine is available. For diagnosis, 2 serum
samples should be sent to the laboratory, the 1st one during the
acute stage of disease, the 2nd a fortnight later. For virus
isolation/PCR, entire, non-coagulated blood should be sampled during
the acute disease phase.

Equine encephalosis, a high morbidity, low mortality orbivirus
disease transmitted by _Culicoides_ species, is a febrile illness of
all equids and sometimes elephants, initially known from South Africa
for several decades. EEV was identified in Israel for the 1st time in
the fall of 2008. Most probably, the virus is circulating in other
countries in the Middle East/Eastern Mediterranean area. Its seasonal
occurrence is expected to be similar to other _Culicoides_-borne
orbiviruses such as bluetongue and EHD, traditionally between July
and December, peaking October-November.

EEV deserves to be included in sero-surveys in the region. If
serological investigations have already been performed, in local
equines or in horses transported by racing clubs in the Near East,
transparency should be exercised, the test results becoming publicly
available.

Gerdes, and Mr R Meiswinkel in posting 19990428.0708 and the
commentary in posting 20090401.1254. - Mod.AS]
