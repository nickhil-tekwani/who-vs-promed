China has developed vaccines that block the spread of the deadly H5N1
strain of bird flu among birds and mammals, Xinhua news agency
reported, as scientists in the west warned of a possible global
pandemic killing millions.
Scientists fear that avian flu, which is infectious in birds but does
not spread easily among humans, could mutate into a form more capable
of passing from animals to people.
The H5N1 strain first surfaced in poultry in Hong Kong and China 8
years ago and has killed 37 people in Vietnam, 12 in Thailand and 4
in Cambodia.
Global health officials fear it could mutate into a strain that could
rival the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed between 20 and 40
million people.
"Experiments show the efficiency rate of the newly developed vaccines
in preventing infection by the H5N1 virus is 100 percent," Chen
Hualan, director of the China National Bird Flu Reference Laboratory,
was quoted as saying in an overnight report.
China's Ministry of Agriculture had given its approval, and a sales
permit, for the vaccines, Xinhua said, without mentioning whether the
treatments had been evaluated outside the country.
The agency said supplies of the new vaccines had already been sent to
far-flung western Qinghai province, where China has been scrambling
to contain its 1st breakout since late 2004, after 178 geese were
found dead of the H5N1 virus on 4 May 2005. [In the official
notification to the OIE, China reported that this outbreak involved
519 "migratory birds", of 5 different species, one of them being
bar-headed geese, but no specific figures were included. Uniform,
accurate reporting would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
Health departments in the provincial capital Xining and prefectures
around the province had been mobilised to prevent the spread of the
disease, Xinhua quoted Ai Keyuan, an official with the provincial
health bureau, as saying.
Local departments were being told how to dispose of bird droppings,
and hospitals in the affected county had opened separate departments
for screening patients with fever and to observe people who had close
contact with the birds.
"All hospitals have been told to set up a task force and put aside
medication and facilities for the treatment of any avian flu cases
that might be detected," Ai said.
The new vaccines also prevented the spread of avian flu from migratory birds
to waterfowl, which could easily pass the disease to domesticated birds,
Xinhua said. [Since free-roaming birds are not vaccinated, this claim needs
explanation. Probably, the authors refer to "waterfowl" when they mean
domestic waterfowl, such as domestic ducks and geese, while "domesticated
birds" means chickens and turkeys. - Mod.AS]
China was willing to provide technical anti-epidemic support to other
countries, and poultry farms in Vietnam had begun experimenting with
the Chinese vaccines, it said.
"Time is running out to prepare for the next pandemic," said Michael
Osterholm, of the University of Minnesota, on Wednesday [25 May 2004]
in a special section of the journal Nature* devoted to avian flu.
"There is a critical need for comprehensive medical and non-medical
pandemic planning at the ground level that goes beyond what has been
considered so far."
Scientists say any bird flu pandemic will likely start in Asia and
could kill many millions. New influenza strains have caused pandemics
in the past, most recently in 1956-1957 and 1967-1968, killing a
combined 4.5 million people.

[The current newswire provides some of the information on vaccines as
requested in a previous posting; it may be assumed that the vaccine
sent to western China is the recently developed reverse genetics AI
vaccine, which reportedly renders satisfactory protection to ducks
and geese.
In the meantime, no response has been received to recent allegations
of the occurrence of human cases of avian influenza in Qinghai
province. We repeat our request for official, 1st-hand information;
alternatively, scientifically-based data from non-official, reliable
sources. The rumors might be false; there is no way to verify them,
or to prevent further dissemination of inaccurate data and their
damaging consequences -- except by providing accurate data on avian
influenza in animals and humans, according to international codes and
in a timely manner. - Mod.AS]
[I don't believe any vaccine has ever been made that has 100 percent
efficiency (or efficacy) as claimed, but in the face of a massive pandemic,
even 50 percent would help. - Mod.JW]
