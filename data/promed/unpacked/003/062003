Smoking Tied to Pneumonia Cases in War Zones
-------------------------------------------------
The puzzling cluster of pneumonia cases among American troops in Iraq and
other countries in the war region seems to be partly related to the fact
that many had taken up smoking shortly before they became ill, Pentagon
officials said 9 Sep 2003.
2 teams of military and civilian epidemiologists and environmental health
specialists have been investigating a cluster of 19 cases of severe
pneumonia, including 2 deaths, that occurred from 1 Mar through August
2003. No new cases have occurred since 20 Aug 2003, and the earlier
patients have all been discharged from the hospital.
"We do not have an epidemic," and there is not an unusual number of
pneumonia cases among troops in the war area, Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr.,
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, told reporters in a
telephone conference call.
He said the military has investigated the cluster because of the particular
severity of the pneumonia -- all patients needed assistance from mechanical
ventilators to breathe. Most responded "fairly dramatically" within days
after such therapy and antibiotics, said Col. Bob DeFraites, the Army's
chief of preventive medicine.
The SARS coronavirus, adenovirus, parasites, and vaccinations against
smallpox or anthrax have been ruled out. Though the specific cause of the
outbreak has not been identified, "we have a somewhat improved
understanding" of what the phenomenon is, Dr. Winkenwerder said.
The investigators found that 4 of the 19 patients had suffered bacterial
pneumonia. Of the other 15 cases, 10, including the 2 men who died, had
markedly increased numbers of a certain type of white blood cell known as
an eosinophil. The eosinophil count was from 4 to 11 times higher than normal.
The investigators are leaning towards a noninfectious cause and are
focusing on one finding "that has jumped out at us," that 9 of the 10
patients with high eosinophil counts reported that they had started smoking
recently, Dr. DeFraites said.
Tobacco smoke is a prime suspect because it is known to damage lungs and
increase their susceptibility to pneumonia. Also, at least one published
paper has reported a similar link between smoking and severe pneumonia. A
combination of stress, heat, dust, and other factors may have acted in
concert with smoking to cause illness, Dr. DeFraites said.
Pentagon officials provided no information on what cigarette brand the sick
individuals smoked but said such information could come from additional
studies that are being planned.
13 of the patients became ill in Iraq. 3 became ill in Kuwait, and one each
in Qatar, Uzbekistan, and Djibouti. There has been no evidence of
person-to-person spread of the illness. Only 2 of the cases involved
members of the same battalion, and the onset of their illness was 4 months
apart.

Severe Acute Pneumonitis Among Deployed US Military Personnel - Southwest
Asia, Mar-Aug 2003
-------------------------------------------------
During March-August 2003, a total of 19 US military personnel deployed in
the Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility had bilateral
pneumonitis requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation [see figure at
above website - Mod.LL]); 2 patients died. This report summarizes the
results of the US Army's investigation of these cases and describes the
ongoing investigation to determine the cause(s). Cases of rapidly
progressive respiratory failure among former or current CENTCOM personnel
should be reported to state health departments and to the Department of
Defense (DoD).
Of the 19 patients (median age: 25 years; range: 19-47 years), 18 were men;
12 were full-time active duty personnel, and 7 were in the Reserve
Component or National Guard (based in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Missouri, New Mexico, and North Dakota). 17 were in the Army, one was in
the Navy, and one was in the Marine Corps; 11 were junior enlisted
personnel, 7 were noncommissioned officers, and one was an officer.
Military specialties included combat arms (8), engineering (3),
transportation (2), signal corps (2), medical services (2), supply (one),
and military police (one). Illness onset occurred a median of 81 days
(range: 1-189 days) after arrival in the area of responsibility.
10 patients had evidence of elevated eosinophils in at least one of the
following: peripheral blood (8), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (3),
pulmonary tissue (1), or pleural fluid (1). Among the 8 patients with
peripheral eosinophilia, the maximum absolute number of eosinophils was
2000-6600 in microL of blood (normal: <600). The peripheral eosinophilia
was detected a median of 6 days (range: 4-11 days) after illness onset.
An interim case definition has been established. A confirmed case of severe
acute pneumonitis with elevated eosinophils is defined as an illness
occurring in a current or former member of the US armed forces or a US
government employee deployed to the CENTCOM area of responsibility who had
1) bilateral pneumonitis (i.e., radiographically confirmed pulmonary
infiltrates) that required mechanical ventilation and that did not result
from a complication of another medical condition and 2) elevated pulmonary
eosinophils (identified histologically, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [>5
percent] or in pleural fluid [>5 percent]). A probable case is defined as
an illness in a person deployed to the CENTCOM area of responsibility who
had bilateral pneumonitis requiring mechanical ventilation and the presence
of peripheral eosinophilia (>600 microL blood absolute count). A suspect
case is defined as an illness in a person deployed to the CENTCOM area of
responsibility who had bilateral pneumonitis requiring mechanical
ventilation only.
As of 8 Sep 2003, 4 cases were confirmed, 6 were probable, and 9 were
suspect. 4 patients had laboratory evidence of infection with a microbial
agent. _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was isolated from sputum culture in one
probable case. 3 patients with suspect cases showed evidence of infection
(_S. pneumoniae_ based on urine antigen, _Coxiella burnettii_ based on
serology, and _Acinetobacter baumannii_ from bronchoscopic culture).
[ProMED previously posted a cluster of community-acquired _Acinetobacter_
infections in Iraq - Acinetobacter, drug resistant - Iraq: RFI
20030417.0934 - Mod.LL]
All patients were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and 6 received
corticosteroids, including 2 patients whose cases were confirmed and 3
whose cases were probable. The course of illness varied (median duration of
intubation: 6 days; range: 2-35 days). For some patients, infiltrates and
respiratory failure resolved rapidly (i.e., 2-3 days) with or without
steroids, and other patients required longer periods of mechanical
ventilation. All 17 surviving patients either have been placed on
convalescent leave or have returned to duty.
When they became ill, 13 patients were in Iraq, and 6 were in other
countries (Kuwait [3], Djibouti [1], Qatar [1], and Uzbekistan [1]). Other
than 2 patients from the same unit with suspect cases and with onset of
illness 4 months apart, no apparent geographic or unit-level clustering has
been identified. Of the 19 patients, 15 (79 percent) smoked cigarettes or
cigars, including the 10 patients whose cases were either confirmed or
probable. 9 of these 10 patients had begun smoking tobacco after
deployment, compared with none of the 9 patients whose cases were suspect.
2 recent-onset smokers reported smoking non-US-brand cigarettes. All troops
in the CENTCOM area of responsibility have been exposed to heat, dust, and
various amounts of environmental pollution (e.g., smoke).
The US Army is conducting a clinical and epidemiologic investigation to
identify the cause(s) of this disease, including intensive testing of
clinical material (i.e., blood, urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and
acute and convalescent sera) to identify potential microbial pathogens and
toxins. In addition, military personnel are interviewing patients
systematically to identify any common exposures or practices. Environmental
testing to identify potential toxins will be guided by clinical,
diagnostic, and patient surveys. Initial data analysis suggests that
medications, vaccines, and biologic weapons are not associated with the
disease.

MMWR Editorial Note:
The majority of cases of acute lower respiratory illness (LRI) among US
military personnel in Southwest Asia have been comparable clinically and
have occurred at a rate similar to those in other military populations and
settings (1). In contrast, the rapidly progressive LRI cases described in
this report were life-threatening and required intensive medical care,
including mechanical ventilation with high-end expiratory pressures.
Although investigations are ongoing, preliminary findings suggest a subset
of these cases are compatible with the diagnosis of acute eosinophilic
pneumonia (AEP). AEP is an acute febrile illness without an identifiable
infectious cause that is characterized by the rapid onset and progression
of respiratory failure, diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs,
and elevated eosinophils in lung biopsy specimens or bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid (2).
Cigarette smoking (particularly of recent onset) is a risk factor for AEP
(3-7), and some affected persons have experienced acute respiratory
distress when exposed to cigarette smoke in a laboratory setting (5,6). The
finding that 9 of the 10 persons whose cases were severe and who had
documented elevated eosinophils started smoking cigarettes after
their deployment suggests the possibility of a toxin or allergen exposure;
however, no single brand of cigarette or location of production has been
implicated in this association. DoD has advised CENTCOM personnel that
cigarette smoking, particularly the initiation of smoking, might be
associated with the development of severe acute pneumonitis with elevated
eosinophils.
In 1997, 2 US soldiers had rapidly progressive acute respiratory distress
syndrome and elevated eosinophils shortly after returning from field
training in the Mojave Desert in California (8). The occurrence of these
cases in troops who were not deployed overseas suggests that exposures
unique to Iraq (e.g., abandoned buildings, unexploded ordnance, and
war-damaged vehicles or equipment) or to any of the countries in which the
cases occurred (e.g., indigenous food, water, and materials) might not be
necessary or sufficient for the development of this disease.
No US-based military personnel are known to have had severe acute
pneumonitis with increased eosinophils during this period. However, the
return of troops from Southwest Asia raises the possibility that US
health-care providers might be the first to observe members of this
population who experience otherwise unexplained acute respiratory failure.
Clinicians should elicit the travel histories of patients with rapidly
progressive respiratory failure of unknown etiology and report cases among
persons -- particularly military personnel -- who have returned recently
from the CENTCOM area of responsibility to their state health department
and to the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine,

[This newly available CDC paper is the most detailed report regarding the
clinical and microbiological aspects of the cases. It may well the case
that recent onset of tobacco smoking may play a role in the cases. Data on
smoking habits of totally unaffected personnel would be instructive. It is
not clear whether rechallenge with cigarettes (if they contain the
potential immunogen) would cause a relapse. One 1997 report from Japan
suggested it might (1), but one later report from the same group reported
that it did not (2).
