Universal precautions for the management of bat white nose syndrome
(WNS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence suggests that white nose syndrome is likely caused by the
cold-growing fungus, _Geomyces destructans_ (Blehert et al, 2009;
Cryan et al, 2010; Blehert et al, 2011). This fungus infects bats and
produces large numbers of reproductive structures (spores) that can
persist and remain viable on the surfaces of caves and mines where
bats hibernate (Puechmaille et al, 2011; Blehert et al, 2011). Thus,
infested caves and mines are potential sources for disease spread by
humans that enter these sites and come into contact with fungal
spores.

Infectious diseases such as WNS spread rapidly when a pathogen can
persist in the environment without the need for host organisms,
abundantly reproduce itself, and readily infect large numbers of
animals. Regardless of the infectious agent (fungus, bacterium, or
virus), standard procedures known as universal precautions can be
implemented to reduce disease transmission and spread (Thrusfield,
2005; USDA National Animal Health Emergency Management System
Guidelines: Biosecurity). These standard disease management procedures
as applied to WNS include decontamination procedures, equipment
restrictions, and limitation of access to contaminated environments.
The primary objective for implementing universal precautions is to
prevent human-assisted movements of pathogens to unaffected
locations.

Evidence suggests that human-assisted movement of the abundant spores
produced by the WNS fungus plays a role in the spread of this disease.
This evidence includes long-distance jumps in the occurrence of the
fungus, which exceed the known natural migratory distances of
hibernating bats within North America (although surveillance bias
cannot be ruled out). In addition, ongoing laboratory studies suggest
the WNS fungus was introduced to North America from Europe (no bat
species migrate between the continents), viable fungus has been found
to persist in bat guano and on the floors and walls of contaminated
hibernacula, and spores of the WNS fungus have been found on the
surfaces of equipment removed from a contaminated site (Okoniewski et
al, 2010; Puechmaille et al, 2011; Blehert et al, 2011). Other fungal
pathogens that persist in the environment, such as _Cryptococcus_ in
the Pacific Northwest (MacDougall et al, 2007) and the chytrid fungus
among amphibians globally (Daszak et al, 1999; Kriger and Hero, 2009)
can likely be transported by humans, thus human-assisted movement of
the WNS fungus is not unexpected.

Although both bats and humans likely contribute to the spread of WNS,
reduction of risk for the accidental translocation of fungus by humans
is an important management objective. Universal precautions relevant
to the management of WNS and other diseases include implementing
effective decontamination procedures prior to leaving potentially
contaminated sites, prohibiting movement of clothing and equipment
between contaminated and unaffected locations, and restricting
unnecessary human access to sensitive habitats (Thrusfield, 2005; USDA
National Animal Health Emergency Management System Guidelines:
Biosecurity). These measures represent standard components of a
disease management program in veterinary medicine and serve to reduce
risk for both intra- and inter-continental spread of WNS.

A variation to the recommendation to implement management actions
(decontamination procedures, equipment restrictions, and site
closures) across all habitats suitable for maintaining viable WNS
fungus is to develop a targeted or zoned disease management program.
However, instituting management actions only at locations known to be
contaminated by the WNS fungus may increase risk for disease spread,
because: 1) there is currently no diagnostic method to rapidly and
routinely screen environmental samples (such as cave soil) to identify
contaminated sites (Lindner et al, 2010); and 2) identifying
contaminated sites based solely upon the observation of sick bats is
unreliable. Furthermore, as the WNS fungus has been found in
environmental samples collected in caves and mines where WNS occurs
(Puechmaille et al, 2011; Blehert et al, 2011), universal precautions
indicate that presence of fungus must now be assumed unless absence
can be proven.

Decontamination procedures, equipment restrictions, and site closures
are currently in place to reduce the potential for humans to transfer
the WNS fungus. These guidelines are based upon scientific standards
routinely employed for the management of animal diseases and represent
a responsible approach to minimize risk to important natural
resources. We cannot yet rapidly screen sites for the presence of WNS
fungus when visibly infected bats are absent, we cannot safely and
effectively treat wild bats for WNS, we cannot decontaminate fragile
cave ecosystems upon which bats rely, nor can we limit the natural
movements of bats. Modifying human activity by implementing
decontamination procedures, equipment restrictions, and site closures
are the options currently available for managing the spread of WNS;
these procedures will be reviewed as indicated by additional
scientific findings.
