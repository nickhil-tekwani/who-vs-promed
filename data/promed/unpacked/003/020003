A new campaign to warn gay and bisexual men about the risk of _Shigella_ dysentery [that is, shigellosis] is being launched today [30 Jan 2014] by Public Health England (PHE) in partnership with Terrence Higgins Trust (THT), as new figures show a surge in cases likely to have been sexually acquired over the past 12 months.

In the UK, _Shigella flexneri_ [infection] usually affects similar numbers of men and women and is linked with overseas travel, but 2013 data show an excess of more than 200 cases of the infection in men with no or unknown travel history, compared to women. London is most affected.

Interviews with gay and bisexual men who caught the infection through sex found links to high numbers of partners, often met anonymously online or at sex parties. For many, using drugs, such as mephedrone, methamphetamine (crystal meth), ketamine and GBL [gamma-butyrolactone], before or during sex led to lowered inhibitions and riskier sex. Worryingly, one in 3 men using these drugs had injected them (known as 'slamming'). Most of the men interviewed had not heard of [shigellosis] before and thought they had food poisoning.

One of the men interviewed, who got shigellosis through anal-oral sex ('rimming'), said: "Getting _Shigella_ was the lowest point in my life. I suffered uncontrollable bloody diarrhoea with severe stomach cramps. The ferocity of symptoms and dehydration, headaches made me think I was going to die. Initially I blamed it on a bad curry and held off visiting my GP for a week, but really wish I had gone straight away. Although it was treatable with antibiotics, the illness cost me a fortune as I had to take 6 weeks off work on statutory sick pay."

As part of the awareness campaign, posters and leaflets are being distributed in nightclubs, saunas, and other gay venues, plus sexual health clinics, highlighting the symptoms of [shigellosis], how it is transmitted and how to avoid it.

Dr Gwenda Hughes, PHE head of STI [sexually transmitted infection] surveillance, said: "[Shigellosis] is on the rise, so it is vital gay and bisexual men know about it and how to avoid getting it. We're also seeing increasing HIV and gonorrhoea diagnoses among gay and bisexual men in the UK -- indeed, most of the men with [shigellosis] had been diagnosed with other STIs including HIV. This is a reminder how important it is to use a condom when having sex with casual and new partners."

Cary James, Head of Health Improvement at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "Although on paper the number of documented cases of [shigellosis is] quite small, the concern is that not all cases are being reported. Men with symptoms who haven't heard of [shigellosis] before might assume it's a particularly bad case of food poisoning. However, the infection can be dangerous, even more so if you're already living with HIV or hepatitis C. We would urge anyone who is experiencing symptoms, or who's concerned they may have been at risk, to call our free helpline THT Direct or visit http://www.tht.org.uk/shigella."

Dr Hughes continued: "The [shigellosis] awareness campaign is part of a broader commitment to helping improve the health of gay and bisexual men, including exploring the links between health and drug use. The level of injecting drug use is a particular concern as we know that this puts men at greatly increased risk of blood-borne viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C"

Individuals worried about [shigellosis] or their drug use can find out more on the Terrence Higgins Trust website -- including finding a local service to visit for further advice (http://www.tht.org.uk/shigella).

[Sexual transmission of shigellosis was first described in the USA during the 1970s and since then, several outbreaks of sexually transmitted shigellosis among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in North America, Europe, and Australia. (Please see ProMED-mail post Shigellosis, flexneri serotype 3a - UK: MSM 20120330.1085814 and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5433a2.htm).

There are 4 species: _Shigella dysenteriae_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella sonnei_; each species has several serotypes. The strains circulating among MSM have been found by molecular subtyping with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to be different from those circulating in the rest of the community, indicating unique transmission (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5042a3.htm). Subtyping by PFGE also has also been used to identify epidemiologically related shigellosis clusters in the U.K. among MSM due to _S. flexneri_ serotype 3a (see ProMED-mail post Shigellosis, flexneri serotype 3a - UK: MSM 20120330.1085814).

Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease. Shigellosis is acquired by fecal-oral transmission from someone who is excreting _Shigella_ in the stool. The risk for sexual transmission shigellosis has been found to be direct oral-anal contact (rimming) during the week before onset of shigellosis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15307964). Other enteric pathogens, such as hepatitis A, _Entamoeba histolytica_, _Giardia lamblia_, _Campylobacter_, and _Salmonella_, also can be transmitted sexually; but, possibly because _Shigella_ withstand the low pH of gastric juice, the low number of _Shigella_ required for transmission of shigellosis (as few as 10 to 200 organisms), as compared with that of many other enteric pathogens, facilitates person-to-person transmission of shigellosis. However, because feces can contain multiple pathogens, polymicrobial infections can result from a single sexual exposure.

_Shigella_ invade the colonic mucosa and cause an acute inflammatory and ulcerative reactive. The incubation period, the duration of which is inversely proportional to the load of ingested bacteria, varies from 12 hours to 7 days, but is typically 2-4 days. Patients develop sudden onset of severe abdominal cramping and pain, high-grade fever, diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, and the repeated urge to defecate, even though little stool may be passed (rectal tenesmus). The disease is communicable as long as _Shigella_ are excreted in the stool, which can last for up to 4 weeks from the onset of illness. Persons who receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy will be culture negative at 72 hours.

Prevention of sexually transmitted shigellosis involves avoidance or mitigation of sexual practices that might result in fecal-oral transmission. - Mod.ML
