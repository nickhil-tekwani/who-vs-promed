Epidemiological comments: As a result of ongoing monitoring activity,
it was found that 45 pigs from the fattening group 135-155 days old
were sick. The building contained 1800 heads. The possible source of
infection is not determined, but there is assumption that the swine
infection took place because the personnel had been down with signs
of acute respiratory disease. A ban on trade of live pigs and swine
products from the establishment without thermal treatment is applied.
Regular aerosol disinfection, including in the presence of animals,
is being implemented. Vaccination is not carried out.

Control measures. Measures applied - Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); No vaccination; No treatment of affected animals
