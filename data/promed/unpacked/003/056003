Additional Suspected Ebola Fever Deaths in Republic of Congo
------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials feared on Mon 4 Feb 2002 that Ebola hemorrhagic fever
might still be spreading in the Republic of Congo after 6 people died in a
remote northeastern district that had previously escaped the deadly
disease. The suspect fatalities were reported last week in Kelle, a
district that borders Mbomo, where the outbreak began in this central
African country, said Dr. Ebata Mongo, head of the government's campaign
against Ebola fever.
The latest victims came from 2 villages and were believed to have eaten
monkey meat, Mongo said. They had developed symptoms of the disease, but
officials were still waiting for laboratory confirmation. If Ebola proves
to be the cause of their deaths, it would bring the death toll in the
country to 18, Mongo said. An additional 23 people have died on the other
side of the border in Gabon since the outbreak began in October, according
to World Health Organisation figures.
WHO said last week [see the ProMED-mail post archived as "Ebola hemorrhagic
fever - Gabon/Congo Rep (13) 20020131.3451" - Mod.CP that it was satisfied
the outbreak was under control after all those who had contact with known
victims cleared the disease's 21-day incubation period without developing
symptoms. But the new deaths raised the possibility that Ebola fever was
still spreading in the densely forested region, inhabited by Pygmy and
other hunter tribes, Mongo said.

[WHO actually said the epidemic was "calmed"-- it only declares an epidemic
ended after twice the incubation period has elapsed without further cases,
a wise precaution in the circumstances. - Mod.JW
