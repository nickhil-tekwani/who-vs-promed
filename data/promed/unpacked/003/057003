Bird flu epidemic abating in Vietnam, official says
---------------------------------------------------
Vietnam's latest bird flu epidemic is showing signs of abating, an
agriculture department official said, and the country hopes to have
the current outbreak under control by the end of February 2005.

An international expert dismissed the statement and said bird flu in
parts of Asia is here to stay. Bui Quang Anh, head of the
department's animal health department, said Vietnam has become more
experienced in coping with the disease, which this time had broken
out only on small farms. "The situation of the epidemic shows signs
of reduction due to the positive response of the concerned
authorities and tough measures applied," he told reporters.

The virus that has killed 13 people in the country since late
December [2003?] is now reported in 35 of the country's 64 cities and
provinces. [In February 2004], 56 provinces had been hit. Rearing of
poultry could resume in March if the sanitary situation is good
enough, Anh added.

A medical source said the last 2 patients in Vietnam with the deadly
H5N1 strain of bird flu were discharged from hospital on Monday.

Vietnam declared in October 2004 that it had brought its latest
outbreak of avian influenza under control. It first made such an
announcement in March 2004 but had to admit later that the
declaration had been premature. Experts say avian influenza has
entrenched itself in much of Asia and is unlikely to disappear
anytime soon.

"What is happening this year is not an outbreak, it is an endemic
recurrence of a disease that is here to stay," said Anton Rychener,
representative of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.

"I would not pay much attention to this statement, ["the country
hopes to have the current outbreak under control by the end of this
month"]" he added. "Vietnam wants to reassure people before (lunar)
new year."

Anh said a new decree issued by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on 3 Feb
2005 controls more strictly the rearing of ducks, which are
considered a reservoir of the virus. "The breeding of waterfowl and
quails, the main source for bird flu transmission, is banned
throughout the country between 9 Feb and 30 Jun 2005," he said,
adding some provinces could extend the ban.

"Anyone who wants to restore poultry flocks this year must firstly
register with the local animal health department," Anh also said,
implying that the rampant raising of poultry in 2004 might have
contributed to the spread of the virus. The slaughtering of poultry
in small markets around the country will be banned and major
abattoirs established in the longer term, Anh added.

Vietnam also said it would soon try to use vaccines produced in China
and the Netherlands on its poultry flocks. Vietnam had about 208
million poultry in December 2004, according to official estimates.

"If tests are successful, we will use the vaccine on the poultry en
masse by the end of 2005," said To Long Thanh, vice director of the
National Center for Veterinary Diagnosis.

Since the start of the latest outbreak more than 1.4 million birds
have been killed, only 1/10 of those culled during the 1st epidemic
which began in parts in Asia in December 2003.

12 people died in Thailand and 20 in Vietnam during that outbreak
[1st semester of 2004]. Another 13 died in Vietnam since the end of
December including a Cambodian woman. A regional meeting discussing
the fight against the virus will be held in Ho Chi Minh City from 23
to 25 Feb 2005, under the sponsorship of the United Nations's FAO and
the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE].

In Vietnam, chickens continue to roost at home:
Few people appear concerned about threat of Asian bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
Nguyen Thuy Lan sits on a tiny plastic stool just inches from the
sidewalk, crouched over a steaming bowl of duck noodle soup at a
street-side restaurant.

As she works her spoon and chopsticks, chickens peck the ground for
scraps at her feet. One scraggly white bird even steals a couple of
bites from a nearby pan of freshly made fritters for sale.

No one bats an eye. This is life in Vietnam.

As bird flu rages across the country, killing 12 people here and 1 in
Cambodia in the past 6 weeks, Vietnamese continue to live among
poultry as they have for centuries. And while some say they've
stopped eating fowl until the current bird flu outbreak wanes, many
defiantly vow not to change their habits.

"I've heard of bird flu, but I'm not scared," said Lan, slurping the
last bit of juice from her bowl. "There may be bird flu outbreaks
elsewhere, but not here."

Poultry, especially chicken, is everywhere in Vietnam. Birds hang by
the neck, roasted golden brown, for sale on bustling sidewalks. They
roam freely inside dirt-floor huts in the most remote countryside
villages.

Prized fighting cocks are a common sight in parks or on grassy
medians as their owners squat beside them, egging them on in fierce,
often deadly battles. Owners will even suck blood or phlegm out of
the birds' mouths following a fight.

Experts say bird flu, which has killed 45 people from Vietnam,
Thailand and Cambodia over the past year, has become entrenched in
Vietnam's poultry population, where more than a million birds have
died or been slaughtered so far this year. But the country's culture
and traditions make wiping out the disease nearly impossible.

2 brothers tested positive for the disease [in January 2005] after
eating raw duck blood pudding, a delicacy in Vietnam. The older
brother died, while the younger man, Nguyen Thanh Hung, fought the
disease for a week before recovering.

From his hospital bed, Hung said it was a tradition to eat the dish
while drinking rice wine at family reunions. Since the duck showed no
signs of disease, no one thought there was cause for worry.

"When I was first admitted, I did not remember I had duck blood
pudding," said Hung, who now insists he'll eat only blood pudding
that's cooked. "I thought my older brother and I suffered some kind
of acute pneumonia."

Vietnamese health officials and the World Health Organization have
tried to tell people they must give up certain habits to protect
themselves from the virus, which has killed about 70 percent of those
infected.

Scientists have said they believe people become infected through
physical contact with sick birds -- dead or alive -- and their
droppings, though it is still a mystery exactly how the virus is
transmitted. However, well-cooked poultry is not a risk.

"We have no problems with these cultural habits, but in these
circumstances we think that the people should be more careful," said
Peter Cordingley, spokesman for WHO's Western Pacific Regional Office
in Manila. "It seems to suggest to us that perhaps the messaging
still needs to be made a little bit stronger -- that there are some
cultural habits that might be best temporarily suspended."

Poultry is a major source of cheap protein for much of Vietnam's 82
million population. Nearly every household in the countryside raises
a handful of chickens or ducks to supplement meager incomes or to
keep for eggs or food. Chickens roam freely in most yards, and flocks
of ducks waddle or swim in rice fields, fattening themselves while
spreading their own natural fertilizer -- and potential disease.

"In certain parts of Asia, ducks are being moved from field to field,
from rice paddy to rice paddy," said Malik Peiris, the Hong Kong
University professor who discovered the SARS virus. "This
dramatically increases the opportunity for the spread of infection."

Most human bird flu cases have been traced back to contact with sick
poultry, but the WHO fears the virus will eventually mutate and
become easily spread person-to-person, sparking a global flu
pandemic. So far, there is no evidence the virus has changed.

Despite nearly 3 dozen deaths among their countrymen, few Vietnamese
have been seriously deterred from consuming poultry.

Le Thi Sang lost her 3 children during last year's outbreak after the
family served 66 pounds of chicken at her son's wedding. Her 2
daughters tested positive for bird flu, while her son died of similar
symptoms. Despite her loss, Sang still buys poultry a couple times a
week and insists her children were not infected with avian influenza.

"My son and daughter died of pneumonia, while the other daughter died
of stomach [bleeding]," said Sang, 58. "It's not bird flu."

The WHO has also warned that slaughtering poultry can be risky if
protective gear isn't worn. A 35-year-old woman and her 13-year-old
daughter both died of bird flu in January 2005 after they killed a
chicken together.

But in a busy Hanoi market, vendor Nguyen Kim Hue says she's not
worried. Standing over a mound of chicken carcasses at her stall, she
says she slaughters about 50 birds a day, a routine she's been
following for the past 20 years.

"I do not wear protective gear -- no mask, no gloves. I'm OK because
I bought healthy chickens," she said. "I'm selling traditional
Vietnamese chickens."

Hue is especially busy this time of year. The Lunar New Year is
Wednesday, and chicken is the traditional centerpiece of the meal
offered to a family's ancestors on New Year's Eve.

In 2004, Vietnam banned the sale and transport of poultry over the
holiday season as bird flu raged across 10 Asian countries, killing
or forcing the slaughter of 100 million birds. No such bans are in
place this year, but some wary shoppers say their ancestors will have
to accept another dish instead to ring in the Year of the Chicken.

"I stopped eating poultry a long time ago when I heard about the
flare-up," said Tran Thu Ha who stood in a marketplace near a heaping
pile of chicken carcasses.

She selected a plump fish from a tub of water.
