Ministry of Health reiterates recommendations for
prevention of yellow fever following confirmation
of the 1st case in humans
--------------------------------------

Following the official confirmation of a case of
yellow fever in the town of San Vicente, Misiones
province, and then to know the analysis provided
by the National Institute of Human Viral
Diseases, Pergamino, the Ministry of Health
reiterated the recommendations and preventive
actions carried out in conjunction with the
provinces involved.

The 24-year-old patient was in good general
condition and remains in the hospital Samic of
Ober√°. He is a native of St. Vincent and had been
working in the jungle area where the monkeys died
last January [2008].

Importantly, following the strengthening of
epidemiological surveillance for febrile
syndromes, over 100 suspected cases from
throughout the country have been investigated, of
which many have been discounted as not yellow
fever, leaving other cases awaiting test results .

Recommendations for preventing the disease,
disseminated by the Ministry of Health and the
Pan American Health Organization regularly since
the disease was detected in Brazil earlier this
year [2008], were repeated.

[Human cases might have been expected to follow
the monkey deaths from YF in the area -- see
ProMED refs for Argentina below. A conference of
most S. American countries on how to confront the
spreading YF menace was held beginning 28 Feb
2008 at the Iguazu Falls. There is growing
concern internationally that the massive
diversion of YF vaccine stocks to the outbreak
area will leave endemic areas of Africa short of
vaccine this year.
