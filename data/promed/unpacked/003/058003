[Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the spread and maintenance of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey.

Laridae (gulls, terns, and kittiwakes) play a role distinct from Anseriformes in AIV epidemiology. A 2015 review article on the role of Laridae in AIV dynamics concluded the following: "For physiological and ecological reasons, airborne transmission may occur more frequently in Laridae than in Anatidae, which could favor the evolution of taxon-specific strains in the 2 families. As Laridae generally live longer than Anatidae, they may have evolved stronger immune responses that could lead to different temporal infection patterns across the 2 groups. The numerous Laridae species that migrate long distances may play a major role in intercontinental AIV gene flow, given that a high proportion of North American-Eurasian reassortant AIV strains have been detected in this group. Finally, opportunistic Laridae species, which have recently colonized urban areas worldwide, are in close contact with both humans and their domestic animals, which could favor AIV exchanges even if such exchanges have rarely been reported thus far. Overall, the Laridae thus constitute an AIV host group that should not be neglected. Further research is clearly needed to clarify AIV epidemiological dynamics in aquatic birds, and it would greatly benefit from incorporating evolutionary ecology and ornithological knowledge."
