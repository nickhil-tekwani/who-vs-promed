The [Cambodian] Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has reported that in early December [2017] the bird flu (H5N1 virus) appeared in Kampong Cham province. The ministry informed Prime Minister Hun Sen on [Fri 8 Dec 2017], of the outbreak.

Prey Chor district's [map at https://tinyurl.com/ybsklyly] Trapaeng Preah commune was hardest hit, with some 200 chickens perishing.

After the alert from local authorities, the ministry immediately dispatched experts to inspect the site in Trapaeng Preah, and they took away 2 dead chickens to be sent to a laboratory in Phnom Penh.

"The tests on [Wed 6 Dec 2017] confirmed that those chickens had contracted the avian influenza H5N1," the lab report said.

Agriculture Minister Veng Sakhonn asked the provincial governor and local authorities to strictly prohibit the transport of fowl in any form, living or dead, as poultry or as meat/meat product. This measure should contain the spread of this virus.

The ministry also appealed to the general public that they maintain a high standard of hygiene in their households - and be extra diligent when dealing with poultry.
