Influenza update number 340 (based on data up to 14 Apr 2019)
------------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity decreased overall.
- In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease with influenza A(H3N2) the dominant virus, followed by influenza B.
- In Europe, influenza activity decreased across the continent. Both influenza A viruses co-circulated; influenza A(H3N2) was the most frequently identified subtype.
- In North Africa, influenza detections were low across reporting countries.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity appeared to decrease overall, with exception of Saudi Arabia where activity remained elevated.
- In East Asia, influenza activity was reported in some countries, with influenza B viruses most frequently detected, followed by influenza A(H3N2). A 2nd wave of influenza activity was reported in the Republic of Korea.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low overall.
- In the Caribbean, Central American countries, and the tropical countries of South America, influenza and RSV activity were low in general.
- In West and Middle Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries. Influenza activity continued to be reported from Eastern Africa although in decreasing trend with predominantly influenza A(H3N2) followed by B detections.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza detections increased in southern Australia and South Africa. The influenza activity in South America remained at inter-seasonal levels.

Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 124 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 1 Apr 2019 to 14 Apr 2019 (data as of 26 Apr 2019 03:51:00 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 137 187 specimens during that time period. A total of 20 772 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 17 422 (83.9 percent) were typed as influenza A and 3350 (16.1 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 1917 (32.8 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3922 (67.2 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 108 (8.3 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 1196 (91.7 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced this month [April 2019] that this flu season in the United States is the longest we have seen in about a decade.

Arizona is also feeling the sickness stretch on.

The Arizona Department of Health Services reports that the week of [21 Apr 2019], there were 562 cases reported. That is compared to 283 cases as the 5-year average for that same time frame.

So far this season, the department said there have been 19 769 reported cases of the flu. That is pretty close to the 5-year average for the entire season, but this season is prolonged.

"There's no 'normal' flu season," said Jessica Rigler with AZDHS. "2 seasons ago we saw cases well into June, which is certainly something we could be seeing again this season."

Rigler said people may have put their guard down against the flu because they think the sickness is not spreading anymore.

"I think there is a couple of things here that people should know. One is that flu season is not over," Rigler explained. "We are still seeing hundreds of cases reported every week, which means people are still at risk. If you haven't gotten your flu shot yet and your doctor's office still has some available, you can go get it and that can help protect you against the flu."

Rigler said that preliminary data from the CDC states the vaccine is nearly 50 percent effective.

[Individuals belonging to any high-risk group for developing influenza-associated complications should receive influenza vaccine. Influenza antiviral medications are recommended for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza as an adjunct to influenza vaccine (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm). WHO recommends oseltamivir for severe illness due to confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection in critically ill hospitalized patients (http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/20th_EML2017.pdf). - Mod.UBA

[4] India (Maharashtra): H1N1, fatalities
Date: Tue 30 Apr 2019 16:32 IST

https://www.theweek.in/news/health/2019/04/30/two-women-succumb-to-swine-flu-in-mumbai-bmc.html


As per information shared by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), 2 women from Mumbai -- a 30-year old from Agripada and a 65-year old from Mazgaon -- succumbed to [influenza A/H1N1] virus last month [March 2019]. BMC's executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar said the 2 deaths were confirmed during the death committee review meeting held this month [April 2019].

While the 65-year-old woman, who was also suffering from diabetes, breathed her last after over a week of hospitalisation, the 30-year-old woman spent over 10 days in the hospital. While these make the 1st 2 deaths due to swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] virus in the city [Mumbai], according to official estimates, Maharashtra has recorded 1346 positive cases of H1N1 and 120 deaths so far in the past 4 months alone.

Although there is a vaccination against [influenza A/H1N1], not everyone is aware about it and that is one reason for the high number of positive cases. While the year [2019] started on a good note with not a single case reported in the month of January [2019], there were 40 cases of [influenza A/H1N1] caused by the H1N1 virus in February [2019], 80 in March [2019], and 14 such cases in April [2019].

More than 8 lakh [800 000] patients were screened for the H1N1 virus in the past 4 months. Of them, about 15 500 patients suspected to be carriers of the virus were given oseltamivir -- the drug known to work against the virus. About 1000 patients completed the treatment and successfully fought type A influenza virus, which causes the respiratory disease whose initial symptoms include nasal congestion, sore throat, diarrhea, cough, fever, chills, vomiting, body ache, and high-grade fever.
