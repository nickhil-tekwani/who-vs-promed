Some 5500 pigs will be slaughtered at a farm in eastern Croatia which was
hit with a new outbreak of classical swine fever, the worst so far in the
country, the agriculture ministry said.
"The farm where the presence of swine fever virus was confirmed earlier
this week is located only some 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) away from the
farm which was hit by the disease in October [2006]," agriculture
ministry spokesman Mladen Pavic told AFP. At the time 3600 pigs had to be
slaughtered.
Veterinary officials say that pigs at the Lipovaca farm, near the eastern
town of Osijek, were infected due to weak bio-security measures and
uncontrolled transport of the animals from the farm where the disease was
detected in October.
Classical swine fever broke out in Croatia in July 2006 for the first time
since 2003. It turned into an epidemic but the veterinary authorities
managed to bring it under control.
Since then more than 6000 pigs have been slaughtered in eastern parts of
the Balkan country.
Swine fever is a highly contagious disease which is passed on through
excrement or saliva. It does not affect other animal species or humans.
