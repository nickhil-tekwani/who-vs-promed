Rot infects Gelephu ginger
--------------------------
A rot disease afflicting rhizomes has cut into the prospects of
ginger farmers [in Gelephu (Sarpang) district]. "There is a small
white and yellowish worm that infects [the rhizomes] and reduces
yield," said a farmer. "Once infected, the ginger leaves turn
yellowish and the rhizome rots in the soil." He said that more than
40 percent [of his ginger crop] was affected by the fungal disease.

Agriculture officials said that they are helpless since there is no
control over rhizome rot. "Once the disease incubates in the soil, we
can't do anything," said an extension officer. He, however, said that
there are precultivation measures like soil solarisation -- with the
help of polythene bags, the heat of the sun is used to [sterilise]
the soil. "But such things aren't practical here."

Officials said that changing seeds does not help. "The people
complained about the disease in 2000, but it's worsening every year."
They are seeking advice from experts and researchers.

[Rhizome (soft) rots of ginger due to several bacterial (_Ralstonia_
and _Erwinia_ species) and fungal pathogens (including _Fusarium_ and
_Pythium_ species) have been reported from various locations, and
occasionally nematodes have also been reported to be associated. They
are serious diseases which may lead to total crop losses. Symptoms
generally include yellowing and wilting of leaves, rotting of leaf
bases and rhizomes, and death of the plants. The pathogens are mostly
soil borne and also spread with infected plant material including
seed tubers, water, and by mechanical means. Rhizome rots are
favoured by humid conditions and high soil moisture. Disease
management includes the use of well-drained planting sites, crop
rotation, and preventative chemical treatments of rhizomes for
planting. However, in affected areas, even plants derived from
disease-free rhizomes have a very high risk of being infected from
local pathogen reservoirs.

In India and the surrounding region, _Pythium_ species are most
commonly reported as the cause of soft rot of ginger (as well as
related crops like cardamom) and may also be responsible for the crop
damage in Bhutan. All of the commercial ginger germplasm available
today is highly susceptible to _Pythium_ soft rot. The "worms"
reported above are likely to be symphylids, wingless soil inhabiting
arthropods, which feed on root tips of ginger and are thought to
facilitate entry of _Pythium_ into the plant. It may be worth
considering if an undiagnosed wilt disease of ginger reported
elsewhere in Bhutan (ProMED-mail post 20100226.0636) may be due to
the same pathogen.
