"Famous last words............."
-------------------------------------
"A dead bird does not represent a health risk to anyone. It cannot transmit
West Nile virus to people or pets". This statement must surely qualify for
listing in any future collection of famous last words. Certainly the heat,
acids, etc., generated during the process of putrefaction will inactivate
viruses rapidly enough to frequently frustrate epidemiologists, but this
epizootic is probably unique in that, unlike other avian flaviviruses, the
host is falling out of the sky; dead. Unless they are dying during
convalescence in the presence of antibodies, which,in the field, no-one
should assume, a fresh carcass might well be loaded with virus,
particularly in the blood and brain, and should be handled defensively with
appropriate gloves and transportation bags. Statements like the above
always remind me of Semliki Forest virus (SFV); an alphavirus adapted to
laboratory life by endless adult and infant mouse brain passages. For many
years it was regarded as a model alphavirus for use in every aspect of
laboratory investigation, and it established a perfect record for benign
laboratory infections of humans. Then a researcher investigating aerosol
infection of mice by intra-nasal droplets of SFV in saline apparently
inhaled the suspension and, via rapid transit to the brain, succumbed to
encephalitis. Never trust a virus!
