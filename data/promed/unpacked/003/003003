Bali's Agricultural and Food Security Agency announced today [4 Jul 2022] that it had eliminated 55 out of 63 cows on the island that have tested positive for the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). "In total there are 63 cases, 55 eliminated, leaving 8 cows," the agency's chief I Wayan Sunada said over the weekend.

Wayan explained that 38 of the diseased cows were found in Medahan Village, Gianyar, and all of the cattle had been slaughtered. The 8 remaining diseased cows, located in Karangasem and Buleleng, are set for slaughter. The official said culling is the best measure to stop the spread of the disease to other cows, with quarantine and treatment unlikely to be sufficient to contain the highly transmissible virus.

The FMD outbreak in Indonesia began in May this year [2022] -- decades after the eradication of the disease in 1986.

Bali authorities are currently investigating the cause behind the FMD outbreak reaching the island. The island's provincial government has placed a current ban on any cattle to be transferred to other regions in Indonesia, as well as preparing vaccines.

[Indonesia has submitted on 23 Jun 2022 its 1st follow-up report on the FMD event to the WOAH. The disease recurred for the 1st time since 1983. The epizootic had started, according to the official report, on 13 Apr 2022. It was caused by FMD virus O/ME-SA/Ind-2001e.

Since the start of the FMD event in Indonesia, the disease has spread throughout the republic's main islands Sumatra, Java, Borneo, the island-province Bangka-Belitung and the island Lombok of the province West Nusa Tenggara. Bali island/province, situated between the infected territories of Sumatra on its west and Lombok on its east, has been applying considerable efforts to maintain its freedom of FMD, which is of particular importance for the island's tourism industry. Unfortunately, preventive vaccination does not seem to have been included among them.

Culling of the detected cases reflects Bali's authorities wish to eradicate the outbreak. Since the disease has been recognised in 3 separate locations, it may already have gotten a foothold on Bali. Terminating the outbreak will require vaccination, combined with biosecurity measures.

Eid al-Adha 2022 is expected to be celebrated these days (9-10 Jul 2022). The extensive trade in (unvaccinated) livestock for the ritual sacrifice, which has been taking place during the recent weeks, may have contributed to the spread of FMD throughout Indonesia's territories. - Mod.AS
