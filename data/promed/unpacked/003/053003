Brunei recorded its 1st hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) casualty
with the death of a 2-year-old boy yesterday.
The Ministry of Health said 16 mild cases have also been detected.
The disclosure comes in the wake of a similar outbreak in Sarawak,
Malaysia where 4 children have died.
"All the 16 cases are mild and they are improving after receiving
treatment," said Datin Paduka Dr. Lim Meng Keang, Specialist
Paediatrician at the Department of Paediatrics of RIPAS hospital in a
media briefing yesterday.
"We have received inquiries from members of the public concerning
this disease. A more serious case was detected in Brunei and a
2-year-old boy died of HFMD yesterday. The case was detected in
Brunei-Muara District. However, the public should not panic," Dr.
Meng Keang said.
Asked about the last case that was detected in Brunei, Dr. Meng Keang
said it occurred in February 2006, but in small numbers: 2-3 cases.
It is a common infection among children under 5 years old, he said.
The disease is caused by an enterovirus. It is a common infection but
complications can cause death.
Signs include red spots on the palm, leg surface and blisters in the
mouth and tongue [URL for picture of hand lesions included below. -
Mod.RY]. It really hurts the tongue and those afflicted will
experience discomfort when swallowing food or drinking fluids.
Parent have been advised to consult a doctor if their child has any
of the following conditions: persistent high fever, repeated vomiting
and poor appetite, extreme tiredness and sleepiness, irritability,
abdominal distension, urine retention, shortness of breath, fast
heart beat or pulse (of more than 160 per minute), unsteady gait or
limb weakness, muscle jerks, abnormal eye movement and cold sweating.
The disease spreads through direct contact via patient's mucus, fluid
from running nose, saliva, and liquid from blisters and stools.
There's no specific treatment for the disease. The treatment given is
to decrease the intensity of the symptoms.
The public, especially parents and those at childcare centres, are
advised to take precautionary steps. Personal hygiene is most
important in avoiding to contract and transmit enterovirus infection.
These include washing hands thoroughly before eating, after going to
the toilet or handling nappy/excreta, covering mouth and nose when
coughing or sneezing, cleaning thoroughly surfaces of toys and other
appliances and maintaining cleanliness among children, especially
those under 5 years old. Infected children should stay away from
public places like schools and childcare centres. Parents should not
bring their children to the affected areas.
Should parents come across these symptoms in their children, they
should bring them to the nearest hospital or go to emergency wards in
the 4 districts after office hours.
For further information on the disease, the public can contact
2242424 extension 393.
HFMD FACTBOX
What is HFMD?
HFMD is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease among cattle,
sheep and swine. Although the names are similar, the diseases are not
related and are caused by different viruses. Viruses from the group
called enteroviruses cause HFMD.
HFMD, caused by coxsackievirus A16 infection, is a mild disease and
nearly all patients recover without medical treatment in 7-10 days.
Complications are uncommon.
Is HFMD contagious?
It is moderately contagious. Infection spreads from person to person
by direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from
blisters, or the stool of infected persons. A person is most
contagious during the first week of the illness.
The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days.
Fever is the first symptom of HFMD.
Who is at risk of HFMD?
Children under 10 years old are at risk but it may occur in adults
too. Infants, children and adolescents are more likely to be
susceptible to infection as they are less likely than adults to have
antibodies and be immune from previous exposures to them.
What are the symptoms?
Persistent high fever, repeated vomiting and poor appetite, extreme
tiredness and sleepiness, irritability, abdominal distension, urine
retention, shortness of breath, fast heart beat or pulse (of more
than 160 per minute), unsteady gait or limb weakness, muscle jerks,
abnormal eye movement and cold sweating.
How it can be prevented?
Washing hands thoroughly before eating, after going to the toilet or
handling nappy/excreta; covering mouth and nose when coughing or
sneezing; cleaning thoroughly surfaces of toys and other appliances
and maintaining cleanliness among children especially those aged
under 5 years. Infected children should stay away from public places
like schools and childcare centres. Parents should not bring their
children to the affected areas.

[Brunei has experienced the first death out of a total of 17 cases of
HFMD -- a rough case fatality rate of 5.9 percent. HFMD is caused by
enteroviruses, among which coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is the most
common etiologic agent. Usually no complications of HFMD are caused
by CA16 infection, although aseptic or viral meningitis may occur
occasionally. A second common cause of HFMD is enterovirus 71(EV71).
In addition to HFMD, EV71 may also cause aseptic or viral meningitis,
encephalitis, or a polio-like paralysis. EV71 meningitis or
encephalitis may on rare occasions be fatal.
Cases of fatal encephalitis occurred during widespread outbreaks of
HFMD in Bulgaria in 1975 (29 deaths), Malaysia in 1997 (29 deaths)
and Taiwan in 1998 (78 deaths). In the 1998 epidemic several
enteroviruses were involved. However, enterovirus 71 infection was
associated with most, if not all, of the serious clinical
manifestations and with nearly all deaths. Most of those who died
were younger than 5 years, and the majority died of pulmonary edema
and pulmonary hemorrhage.
No effective treatments are available. General treatment is
palliative. Preventive measures are focused on enforcement of
personal hygiene and public awareness campaigns.
Since the advent of the 1998 outbreak, Department of Health (DOH) of
Taiwan has determined the pattern of the annual seasonal HFMD
epidemic, the peak of which tends to fall in the beginning of July.
The DOH schedules the reminder campaign according to this pattern.
The disease has been brought under control. The Taiwan example can be
used as a role model for any countries which may encounter the same
problem.
Situated in Southeastern Asia, bordering the South China Sea and
Malaysia, Brunei is a tiny independent country with an area of 5770
sq km. Brunei is known chiefly for the astounding wealth of its
Sultan, its tax-free, subsidised society, and the fact that
(statistically at least) its population enjoys one of the highest per
capita incomes on earth. Map of Brunei can be accessed at:
