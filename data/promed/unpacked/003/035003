HANTAVIRUS - FINLAND (2)
===========================
The summary by Pertti Arstila of the Puumala virus situation in Finland
is quite valuable. As far as I know, there have not been detailed
national studies of hantavirus attack rates for any country.
It is interesting that only 1150 cases were diagnosed but that 5,000 were
estimated to have occurred. I wonder whether this is due to underdiagnosis
or whether the apparent:inapparent case rate is truly 23:77 (1150/5000;
about 1/3).
Also, it was not clear whether the 6% infection rate, as determined by
serosurvey, is stable. If few or many people are acquiring infection with
Puumala virus each year, one cannot tell from such a point prevalence rate.
Very useful information.
