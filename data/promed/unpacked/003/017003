2 die from fish poisoning in Pangasinan
---------------------------------------
2 people died while 23 others are confined at Region I Medical Center
(RIMC) here Monday night after they ate spotted goby fish, _Gobius
criniger_, locally known as bunog or biya.
Dr. Allan Laguardia and other physicians of RIMC said 2 victims, both of
Barangay Capan-tolan in Sual Pangasinan, died hours after eating the fish.
Laguardia said residents of the barangay bought the goby from [the same
vendor] and had the fish for lunch. "All of us had the same meal, we cooked
paksiw bunog but after a few minutes, our lips began to feel numb and we
started vomiting," said one victim, adding that they did not know the fish
was poisonous.
Laguardia said the victims' symptoms were those exhibited by people
suffering from goby and puffer-fish poisoning. Medical employees have sent
samples of the fish to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR)
for examination.
Marina Dumol, officer in charge of BFAR's Fish Health Laboratory, confirmed
that the fish the victims ate was indeed poisonous and people have been
warned against gathering or eating them.
"The bunog they ate has been permanently banned since year 2000," Dumol
told The Manila Times. "It contains a toxin, called tetrodotoxin or
puffer-fish toxin, which renders the species unfit for consumption. There
is no antidote for tetrodotoxin," she said, adding that the brown-spotted
goby fish came from Cagayan where the 1st poisoning case was documented.
But Dumol said poisoning cases are not limited to the Cagayan Valley
region. There have been reports of poisoning in other regions.
"That's why [the] BFAR issued an advisory to permanently ban harvesting and
eating this goby fish," she said.
Dumol said the BFAR has ordered its offices to disseminate information that
brown-spotted goby fish and puffer fish are poisonous.
"Maybe people are still not aware of this BFAR advisory. Many are still
eating the said species of fish, that's why we are calling their attention
to it, as cases of goby poisoning are increasing," Dumol said.
RIMC doctors identified 13 other victims ranging from 6 to 56 years old. 5
other victims were sent home Tuesday morning..

[Tetrodotoxin, a very potent toxin, selectively blocks the
voltage-sensitive sodium channels of excitable tissues and neuronal
transmission in skeletal muscles. In humans, paresthesias begin 10-45
minutes after ingestion, usually as tingling of the tongue and inner
surface of the mouth. Other common symptoms include vomiting,
lightheadedness, dizziness, feelings of doom, and weakness. Paralysis
spreads, and death can occur within 6-24 hours, often due to paralysis of
the muscles of respiration. Other signs include salivation, muscle
twitching, diaphoresis, pleuritic chest pain, dysphagia, aphonia, and
convulsions. Severe poisoning is indicated by hypotension, bradycardia,
depressed corneal reflexes, and fixed dilated pupils. There is no specific
antidote and treatment is often supportive.
There are a number of different species of puffer fish or blow fish, each
of which produces a different concentration of the toxin. - Mod.TG]
