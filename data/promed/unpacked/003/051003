Cormorants are casualties at Salton Sea, viral poultry disease suspected in
mysterious deaths of 6,000 birds
By Steve La Rue
MULLET ISLAND -- About 6,000 double-crested cormorants have perished in the
second die-off in two years at this island, which is considered the largest
cormorant rookery in the Salton Sea. Scientists with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service are analyzing the corpses of black cormorant chicks from
this 20-acre, sun-bleached island in the salty inland sea, about 120 miles
east of San Diego.
"We have lost the entire colony. Just about every bird out there is dead,"
said Ken Sturm, wildlife biologist for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Hundreds of cormorant nests, made of twigs and about the size of overturned
hub caps, sit vacant on the island, except for a carpet of the chicks'
black-and-white-speckled down, and, often, the stiff corpses or the
bleaching bones of the chicks themselves. Those parent cormorants that
survived have abandoned the nests.
"You could hear the birds from 50 yards offshore when the birds were there.
It was a great rookery," Sturm said. "At some point last month, they were
wiped out by a disease that is yet to be identified. It is depressing."
Other, much smaller, cormorant breeding areas around the sea do not appear
to have been affected by the outbreak, he said.
Newcastle disease is the suspected cause because it was confirmed as the
cause of last year's die-off of 1,600 cormorants at the island. Some of
Newcastle's symptoms -- principally paralysis -- also appear to have
occurred in this incident.
Cormorants are plentiful, but Newcastle [disease is troubling. The 1997
die-off was one of the first incidents in which Newcastle disease is known
to have attacked wild bird populations west of the Rockies, Sturm said. For
some reason, double-crested cormorants are far more vulnerable to the
disease than commercial poultry. Preserve managers now regard Newcastle
disease as a potential threat to wild bird populations in the West.
If Newcastle disease is confirmed as the cause of this spring's die-off, a
federal wildlife laboratory in Maryland will perform genetic studies to
determine whether the strain of the virus that killed the Mullet Island
cormorants also could pose a threat to Southern California's poultry
industry. The strain of Newcastle that caused last year's cormorant deaths
was not considered highly dangerous to commercial poultry.
Successive environmental crises have vaulted the Salton Sea into prominence
as a rich waterfowl habitat that is in critical need of scientific study.
In an incident that alarmed scientists, about 150,000 eared grebes and ruddy
ducks died in 1992 for largely unexplained reasons. In 1996, 1,600
endangered brown pelicans and about 8,500 white pelicans died from avian
botulism. It was one of the first outbreaks in which this disease is thought
to have passed from dying fish to fish-eating birds.
So far this year, avian botulism has not been a major problem.
