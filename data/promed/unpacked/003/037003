Latest Information (as of 23 Aug 2006 - 12:00 EST): Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) was today confirmed by the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA) in a mature beef cow from Alberta. No part of the animal's
carcass entered the human food or animal feed systems.
Preliminary information provided by the owner and an examination conducted
by a private veterinarian estimate the animal's age was between 8 and 10
years. Based on this range, exposure to the BSE agent likely occurred
either before the feed ban's introduction or during its early implementation.
A CFIA investigation is underway to locate the positive animal's birth
farm. As has been done previously, the CFIA will conduct a complete
epidemiological review of this case, the results of which will be made public.

[A recent study indicated that the type of BSE in older cattle in the US
(and potentially in Canada) are the same type as the atypical BSE that has
been identified in France. (Baron et al. (2006) Transmission of new bovine
prion to mice. Emerging. Infect. Diseases. 12, 1125-1128.) The kind of BSE
found in the US may not be the same type, or dare I say, strain, as that
found in Europe. - Mod.TG]
