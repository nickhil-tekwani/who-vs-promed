Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, Laos
---------------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 6 Jul 2010 from Dr Khambounheuang
Bounkhouang, General Director, Department of Livestock and Fisheries,
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Vientiane, Laos

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 16 Jun 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 2 Jul 2010
Report date: 6 Jul 2010
Date submitted to OIE: 6 Jul 2010
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [PRRSV]
Nature of diagnosis: suspicion, clinical, laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: Ban Nahay, Hatxaifong, Vientiane Capital
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Jun 2010
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: swine
Susceptible: 600
Cases: 65
Deaths: 5
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: since 21 June 2010, the animal health staff of
the farm reported to the animal health officer of Vientiane Capital
that some sows aborted and some pigs were sick. The farmer has given
antibiotics to sick animals and some of them have become healthy but
some still showed clinical signs. Eventually, the animal health staff
of the farm submitted samples to the National Animal Health Centre
for testing.

Outbreak 2: Ban Phao, Hatxaifong, Vientiane Capital
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Jun 2010
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: swine
Susceptible: 190
Cases: 80
Deaths: 43
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: a pig showing clinical signs was reported to the
animal health officer in Vientiane Capital on 16 Jun 2010. Most of
pregnant pigs aborted and some grower pigs showed coughing and died.
The animal health officer treated them with antibiotics and some of
the sick pigs recovered. 2 severely affected pigs were submitted to
the National Animal Health Centre for necropsy and samples were
tested positive using real-time PCR.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected
Species: swine
Susceptible: 790
Cases: 145
Deaths: 48
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0

Outbreak statistics
Species: swine
Apparent morbidity rate: 18.35 percent
Apparent mortality rate: 6.08 percent
Apparent case fatality rate: 33.10 percent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 6.08 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive; introduction of new live animals.
Epidemiological comments: the introduction of new live animals into
the farm and low biosecurity of the farm are the likely source of the
occurrence of the disease.

Control measures:
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country;
zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no
vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Animal Health Centre (national laboratory)
Species: swine
Test: real-time PCR
Test date: 2 Jul 2010
Result: positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[PRRS has been suspect previously in Laos but never reported there
prior to this report. The disease has never been reported in Cambodia
either. However, it has definitely been reported in the region
previously. PRRS, also colloquially known as blue ear disease in
parts of Asia, has become endemic in Viet Nam, being regularly
reported since its emergence in March 2007 in the northern Hai Duong
Province in Viet Nam. Its subsequent spread across the country
resulted in Viet Nam being declared endemic for PRRS in 2008. See
Mod.AS comment in Porcine reprod. & resp. syndrome - Viet Nam
20100414.1206.

According to the OIE WAHID database, China had massive problems with
the disease in 2007 with hundreds of outbreaks across the country.
There were also problems in 2008 when the number of outbreaks began
approaching 100 but no reports in either 2009 or 2010. Thailand had
outbreaks in 2007, 2008, and 2009 but none reported this year (2010).

The key concern here is the economic difficulties that could occur
now that the disease has spread into Laos. Reproductive diseases and
loss of piglets and weanlings from respiratory disease can have a
profound impact on producer productivity. Although variable in its
impact among herds, PRRS has caused significant economic damage when
newly introduced. Many countries have struggled with outbreaks, since
the emergence of this disease in North America and Europe in the mid
1980s and subsequent global spread. Introduction into previously free
countries most commonly occur through the movement of pigs and semen.
At the herd level, vaccines and gilt management are strategies for
control and elimination but implementing effective strategies can be
challenging. Biosecurity and management of replacement animals is, of
course, a key component in preventing introduction into the herd.

The location of the outbreak near the Thailand border can be seen
appended to the OIE WAHID report referenced above.
