EASTERN EQINE ENCEPHALITIS - USA (VIRGINIA)

In a telephone conversation with relatives in Virginia this evening, I was
informed of several cases of EEE in the tidewater region of Virginia. A
search of the Virginian Pilot Online Archives (http://www.pilotonline.com;
regional newspaper) confirmed that three cases have been diagnosed, with
one fatality in a 66 year-old male. I haven't seen this reported on
ProMED-mail yet, but I may have missed it. Excerpts from four recent
articles in the Virginian Pilot follow:

[On 26 September we received a message from Roland J. Soderholm,
Superintendent for the Deep Creek Mosquito Control Commission in
Chesapeake, Virginia (208 Luray Street, Chesapeake, VA 23323-3026. TEL:
(757) 558-0917, FAX: (757) 485-3404. e-mail: <deepcreekmc@juno.com>. He
was reporting the fatal case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in
Portsmouth (infection seems to have occurred in mid-July or early August)
but I chose to not post this single case because EEE is not rare in late
summer and early fall along the eastern seaboard of the U.S.
As far as we know, no additional human cases have been reported and
confirmed by laboratory tests, no sentinel chickens have been shown to have
antibody to EEE virus, and none of the mosquitoes tested for EEE virus have
been positive; larviciding and adulticiding has been conducted. If anyone
has further information, please let us know. If the first frosts have not
yet occurred, they will soon and this problem will be over, at least for
this calendar year.
One comment we have had, from two people, is that they have not seen a
report on this case on ProMED-mail and wonder "why it is being kept quiet".
It had not been reported because a single case of EEE is not evidence that
that disease is "emerging". It is not being kept quiet. It is quiet. In
addition, we could not report what we did not know. One newspaper report
said that local authorities had "performed autopsies on mosquitoes". Maybe
so, but if this is the extent of the data I receive, I have a tendency to
catch up on happenings in the world of sports. Data, folks, are needed.
Then again, if there aren't any data, there aren't any. - Mod.CHC]
