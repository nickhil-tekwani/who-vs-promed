It was a great surprise to find a one-year-old boy positive for [a]
hantavirus [infection] in Los Santos province. This case was
confirmed by the minister of health, Franklin Vergara, who indicated
that this child comes from the Guarare region. He indicated [the
child] was admitted to the Joaquin Pablo Franco de Las Tablas
Hospital last week [week of 4 Oct 2010], but the positive diagnosis
was recognized in the Hospital del Nino [Children's Hospital], where
he is currently admitted. [Authorities] ask that [people] maintain
the necessary measures to combat this disease.

[Although not stated in this report, in Panama, the hantavirus most
likely to be the etiological agent in this case is Choclo virus. As
mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389, hantaviruses
(and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio Segundo
(_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens
(costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda
(cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human
pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
