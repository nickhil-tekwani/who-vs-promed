The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) this week reported
a 7-month-old horse from Middleborough was diagnosed with eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE). Infection was confirmed by the William
Hinton State Laboratory Institute on 23 Jul 2010. The colt developed
clinical signs on 20 Jul 2010, his condition deteriorated very
rapidly, and he was euthanized on 21 Jul 2010.

The last Massachusetts horse confirmed to have EEE was in September
2009 in Essex County. There were no human cases of EEE during 2009;
however, there were 13 cases with 6 deaths from 2004 through 2006. The
disease is spread to horses and humans through the bite of an infected
mosquito. [Horses cannot spread the disease directly to humans. -

"We are seeing early indicators that lead us to believe this [2010]
may be a bad EEE year," said DPH State Epidemiologist Alfred DeMaria,
MD. "Evidence of EEE-infected mosquitoes and a horse with EEE this
early in the season is similar to what we saw in 2006, and we had 5
human cases that year. We urge people to take this seriously and do
what they need to do to protect themselves and their families."

Massachusetts EEE and West Nile virus testing results for 2010 and
risk category maps can be found on the DPH Arbovirus Surveillance
Information website (under "Arbovirus Daily Update") at

Michigan authorities say a viral brain disease that can kill humans
has been confirmed in 3 horses this year [2010] in the state.

Mosquitoes can spread eastern equine encephalitis to horses and
humans, and authorities say people should use repellent or stay out of
areas with heavy mosquito infestations.

The departments of Community Health and Agriculture said today [26 Jul
2010] that Michigan State University confirms a 3-month-old filly from
Calhoun County and a 12-month-old male from Barry County tested
positive for the illness.

One other horse case was confirmed last week in Cass County. The state
says there are several horses in Cass County "highly suspect" for the
disease.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a mosquito-borne virus that in
horses is very preventable with a vaccine. Several of the
encephalitides are combined into one vaccination. A vaccination
includes West Nile virus, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis, and
often tetanus. Although the vaccine needs to be repeated in about 3
weeks for the animal to develop complete immunity, it takes very
little to protect the horse. There are vaccinations available with
different combinations than those listed above. If a horse develops
EEE, it is not contagious to other horses or to humans. It is the
mosquito that transmits the virus.

Some states started their EEE season much earlier than July. These
northern states are fortunate the cases did not turn up in May.

The season for EEE is starting early this year (2010). Horse owners,
please vaccinate your animals. Eastern equine encephalitis virus
(EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.
Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a rare illness in humans, and
only a few cases are reported in the United States each year. In those
cases that do occur, they are generally located in the Atlantic and
Gulf Coast states (see map at
<http://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/tech/epi.html#map>).

Most persons infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe cases
of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin
with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting.
The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma.
EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the
United States with approximately 33 percent mortality and significant
brain damage in most survivors. There is no specific treatment for
EEE; care is based on symptoms. You can reduce your risk of being
infected with EEEV by using insect repellent, wearing protective
clothing, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active. If you
think you or a family member may have EEE, it is important to consult
your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis.
