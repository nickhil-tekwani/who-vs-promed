Tomato production areas are widely distributed across China. According to some farmers, the production volume in Inner Mongolia declined by 40%-50%, while the production volume in Shandong decreased by 30%. The main reason for this is plant disease.

The new tomato plants are promising. The price is expected to stabilize and would not have been this high if it was not for widespread plant disease.

[A number of tomato diseases and pathogens have been reported from the region, many of which can also affect potatoes and other solanaceous crops. For example, _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ has recently been reported for the 1st time from China in Shandong province (ProMED-mail post 20190903.6654138); and a severe strain of late blight (_Phytophthora infestans_ strain A2-Blue 13) is spreading in the region (ProMED-mail post 20180418.5755980).

Reliable molecular diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved will be needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the reported problems. Without phytosanitation or other forms of disease management, there is a high likelihood for most pathogens to get carried over to a new crop. Thus, the statement above that plants for the next crop look 'promising' does not provide a guarantee for a healthy crop in the following season.
