Bird flu returned to southern Viet Nam this week after an absence of 2
months, and officials warned farmers of more outbreaks as the weather cools.
Tests performed at a laboratory for the Mekong delta region confirmed the
H5N1 virus in the samples taken from ducks at the farm in Tra Cu district
in Tra Vinh province, Tien Phong (Vanguard) newspaper said. At least 5
ducks were dead among 300 at the farm, officials said. A Tra Vinh Animal
Health Department official said by telephone that authorities were
contacting the farm owner to get more details. He said the last bird flu
outbreak was found among ducks in the same district in late August [2007].
Agriculture minister Cao Duc Phat on Tue [9 Oct 2007] urged animal health
authorities to step up vaccinating poultry because bird flu would soon
return among unvaccinated birds, especially as the weather cooled in autumn
and winter in northern provinces.
Bird flu has infected 7 people in Viet Nam so far this year [2007], 4 of
whom have died, bringing the death toll since late 2003 to 46. Globally,
the H5N1 virus has killed 202 people out of 330 known cases, according to
the World Health Organisation. Hundreds of millions of birds have died or
been slaughtered.
But Viet Nam's poultry stock has been increasing, with 226 million birds
reported at the end of August [2007], up 5.3 per cent from a year ago
[2006], of which the waterfowl stock expanded 8.7 per cent to 68 million,
government figures showed.
