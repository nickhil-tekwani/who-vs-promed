Polio (VDPV) paralysis in infant in Maharashtra, India
------------------------------------------------------
Some local news papers report a case of poliomyelitis from Maharashtra State suspected to be caused by vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV). The virus involved in this case is reported to be vaccine derived poliovirus 2. There is some conflicting news about the vaccination status of the infant involved. An official from the ministry of health is reported to have said that this is an isolated case, hinting that the virus is not circulating. It is also reported that health teams are collecting samples from the local people to ascertain the immunity status of the population. India has been off the list of polio endemic countries for the last 2.5 years.

Following are some of the links for reports about this case in local newspapers:

WHO investigating Maharashtra's polio case
------------------------------------------
A team from the World Health Organization is investigating how an 11 month old infant has been infected with poliovirus in Maharashtra's Beed district, in spite of stringent efforts by the Health Ministry to control its spread.

It is the 1st time since March 2012 that the state has registered a polio case. Health minister Suresh Shetty told The Hindu that he had ordered an investigation and would get the WHO report on Saturday morning [8 Jun 2013].

The infant, hailing from Kanhapur village in Dharur tehsil [county], has been found to have the vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV) type 2, a rare strain which is genetically mutated from the strain contained in the oral polio vaccine [OPV].

The infant was initially admitted to the government medical college in Ambejogai, Beed, on [3 May 2013]. "The child had high fever and suffered paralysis in all 4 limbs," said AK Singare, residential medical officer of Swami Ramanand Teerth Hospital, Ambejogai. The child was then transferred to the Latur government medical college on [16 May 2013] and tested positive for VDPV on [1 Jun 2013].

VDPVs are further classified into circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived poliovirus (iVDPV), and ambiguous vaccine-derived poliovirus. It is still unclear which form of the virus has infected the child.

Officials in charge of the case said the child having been ill for prolonged periods indicated the possibility of iVDPV, which could be further linked to lack of sanitation and health facilities.

Though the case has rung alarm bells, health experts say this does not threaten India's polio-free status. Detecting VDPV is part of the surveillance system but only infections caused by wild poliovirus [WPV] strains like P1 and P3 are taken into account when declaring a country polio-free, and not a P2 strain which is caused by the oral polio vaccine and hence causes VDPV infection.

India's last case of wild polio infection was reported on [13 Jan 2011] from West Bengal.

[ProMED-mail thanks Panduranga Rao for these communications.

The report of a case of polio due to infection with a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) in a country is always a concern as the possibility of circulating VDPVs (cVDPV) is there, an indication of pockets of low vaccination coverage that permit the circulation of these viruses.

In the newswire report above, there is mention of the possibility that this case may represent an immunodeficiency related VDPV infection, and not represent an infection with a cVDPV.

According to the latest information on the India National Polio Surveillance Project website:

Vaccine derived polioviruses
- A vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) has been confirmed in a 10 month old boy in Dharur block of Beed district in [Maharashtra]. VDPVs are extremely rare and occur in children with immunodeficiency or in populations with low levels of immunization.
- This is the 3rd case of VDPV in 2013. Earlier, VDPV was reported in an 8 month old boy in a village in Jaipatna block of Kalahandi district of Odisha and a 5 month old girl in Kako block of Jehanabad district of Bihar. All 3 cases are of VDPV type 2.
- In 2012, VDPV was reported in an immunodeficient child in Murshidabad district of West Bengal. In 2011, 7 cases of VDPVs were reported -- 3 in children with immune deficiency in Dhamtari (Chhattisgarh), Barnala (Punjab), and Jajpur (Odisha) and 4 in areas with low routine immunization coverage in Udaipur (Rajasthan), Ghaziabad, and Badaun (Uttar Pradesh) and Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh).
- The Government of India and the States have been effectively responding to the VDPVs in the past. The response to VDPVs that are detected in areas with low routine immunization coverage involve conducting catch up routine vaccination campaigns. The response is consistent with the global strategy. As a result, none of the VDPVs detected in India during the past 3 years have shown any evidence of circulation.
- In the current situation of polio eradication, an importation of wild poliovirus remains the larger threat to the children in India. OPV has reduced the polio incidence globally by greater than 99 per cent and has helped India stop transmission of wild poliovirus. India has not reported any case of polio for over 2 years, the last case being in January 2011. (The full report is available at http://www.npspindia.org/VDPV.doc).

We await more information on the final classification of the type of VDPV in this case -- immunodeficiency related, circulating, or ambiguous. (This moderator was hoping there might be more specific information to report on this case prior to posting, but alas, not.)
