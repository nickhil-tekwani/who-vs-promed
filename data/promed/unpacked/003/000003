[1] US: mortality

A new study [see comment below] estimates that the number of people who have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. is more than 900 000, a number 57% higher than official figures.

Worldwide, the study's authors say, the COVID-19 death count is nearing 7 million, more than double the reported number of 3.24 million. [http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths]

The analysis comes from researchers at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [IHME], who looked at excess mortality from March 2020 through 3 May 2021, compared it with what would be expected in a typical non-pandemic year, then adjusted those figures to account for a handful of other pandemic-related factors.

The final count only estimates deaths "caused directly by the SARS-CoV-2 virus," according to the study's authors. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.

Researchers estimated dramatic undercounts in countries such as India, Mexico, and Russia, where they said the official death counts are some 400 000 too low in each country. In some countries -- including Japan, Egypt, and several Central Asian nations -- the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's death toll estimate is more than 10 times higher than reported totals.

"The analysis just shows how challenging it has been during the pandemic to accurately track the deaths -- and actually, transmission -- of COVID. And by focusing in on the total COVID death rate, I think we bring to light just how much greater the impact of COVID has been already and may be in the future," said Dr. Christopher Murray, who heads the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

The group reached its estimates by calculating excess mortality based on a variety of sources, including official death statistics from various countries, as well as academic studies of other locations.

Then, it examined other mortality factors influenced by the pandemic. For example, some of the extra deaths were caused by increased opioid overdoses or deferred health care. On the other hand, the dramatic reduction in flu cases last winter and a modest drop in deaths caused by injury resulted in lower mortality in those categories than usual.

Researchers at UW ultimately concluded that the extra deaths not directly caused by COVID-19 were effectively offset by the other reductions in death rates, leaving them to attribute all of the net excess deaths to the coronavirus.

"When you put all that together, we conclude that the best way, the closest estimate, for the true COVID death is still excess mortality, because some of those things are on the positive side, other factors are on the negative side," Murray said.

Experts are in agreement that official reports of COVID-19 deaths undercount the true death toll of the virus. Some countries only report deaths that take place in hospitals, or only when patients are confirmed to have been infected; others have poor healthcare access altogether.

"We see, for example, that when health systems get hit hard with individuals with COVID, understandably they devote their time to trying to take care of patients," Murray said.

Because of that, many academics have sought to estimate a true COVID-19 death rate to understand better how the disease spreads.

The revised statistical model used by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation team produced numbers larger than many other analyses, raising some eyebrows in the scientific community.

"I think that the overall message of this (that deaths have been substantially undercounted and in some places more than others) is likely sound, but the absolute numbers are less so for a lot of reasons," said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, in an email to NPR.

Last month [April 2021], a group of researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University published a study in the medical journal JAMA that examined excess mortality rates in the U.S. through December 2020.

While that team similarly found the number of excess deaths far exceeded the official COVID-19 death toll, it disagreed that the gap could be blamed entirely on COVID-19 and not other causes.

"Their estimate of excess deaths is enormous and inconsistent with our research and others," said Dr. Steven Woolf, who led the Virginia Commonwealth team. "There are a lot of assumptions and educated guesses built into their model."

Other researchers applauded the UW study, calling the researchers' effort to produce a global model important, especially in identifying countries with small reported outbreaks but larger estimates of a true death toll, which could indicate the virus is spreading more widely than previously thought.

"We need to better understand the impact of COVID across the globe so that countries can understand the trajectory of the pandemic and figure out where to deploy additional resources, like testing supplies and vaccines to stop the spread," said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins.

Researchers at UW also released an updated forecast for the COVID-19 death count worldwide, estimating that roughly 2.5 million more people will die of COVID-19 between now and 1 Sep 2021, driven in part by the dramatic surge of cases in India.

In the United States, researchers estimated that roughly 44 000 more people will die of COVID-19 by September 2021.

[See Woolf SH, Chapman DA, Sabo RT, Zimmerman EB. Excess Deaths From COVID-19 and Other Causes in the US, March 1, 2020, to January 2, 2021. JAMA. 2021;325(17):1786-1789. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.5199.

"The 22.9% increase in all-cause mortality reported here far exceeds annual increases observed in recent years (2.5% and less). The percentage of excess deaths among non-Hispanic Black individuals (16.9%) exceeded their share of the US population (12.5%), reflecting racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality. Excess deaths surged in the east in April 2020, followed by extended summer and early winter surges concentrated in southern and western states, respectively. Many of these states weakly embraced, or discouraged, pandemic control measures and lifted restrictions earlier than other states.1,6

"Excess deaths not attributed to COVID-19 could reflect either immediate or delayed mortality from undocumented COVID-19 infection, or non-COVID-19 deaths secondary to the pandemic, such as from delayed care or behavioral health crises. Death rates from several non-COVID-19 diseases (e.g., heart disease, Alzheimer disease) increased during surges. The model does not adjust directly for population aging, which could contribute to an overestimate of excess deaths. Other study limitations include reliance on provisional data, inaccurate death certificates, and modeling assumptions."

It is not straightforward to determine death rates from COVID, as it exacerbates some disease processes (coronary disease, Alzheimer's, etc.) and alleviates others by virtue of personal protective measures (e.g., lockdown, masks, hand washing).

"The investigators [in IHME] approach to estimating the total COVID-19 death rate is based on measurement of the excess death rate during the pandemic week by week compared to what would have been expected based on past trends and seasonality. However, the excess death rate does not equal the total COVID-19 death rate. Excess mortality is influenced by 6 drivers of all-cause mortality that relate to the pandemic and the social distancing mandates that came with the pandemic. These 6 drivers are: a) the total COVID-19 death rate, that is, all deaths directly related to COVID-19 infection; b) the increase in mortality due to needed healthcare being delayed or deferred during the pandemic; c) the increase in mortality due to increases in mental health disorders including depression, increased alcohol use, and increased opioid use; d) the reduction in mortality due to decreases in injuries because of general reductions in mobility associated with social distancing mandates; e) the reductions in mortality due to reduced transmission of other viruses, most notably influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and measles; and f) the reductions in mortality due to some chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease, that occur when frail individuals who would have died from these conditions died earlier from COVID-19 instead. To correctly estimate the total COVID-19 mortality, we need to take into account all 6 of these drivers of change in mortality that have happened since the onset of the pandemic."

[2] Japan: Olympics
Date: Fri 7 May 2021
Source: AP News [abridged, edited]
https://apnews.com/article/tokyo-japan-olympic-games-coronavirus-pandemic-sports-48952a3a614559dbc247aaca317b059a


As the coronavirus spreads in Japan ahead of the Tokyo Olympics starting in 11 weeks, one of the world's least vaccinated nations is showing signs of strain, both societal and political.

The government -- desperate to show a worried public it is in control of virus efforts even as it pushes a massive sporting event that a growing number of Japanese oppose hosting in a pandemic -- on Fri 7 May 2021 announced a decision to expand and extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas through 31 May 2021.

For Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, the emergency declaration is both a health measure and a political tightrope walk as domestic criticism rises of Japan's seeming determination to hold the Olympics at any cost.

"I understand there are concerns about hosting the Olympics," Suga said. He said foreign athletes and other participants will be strictly separated from the Japanese public and that "it is possible to hold a safe and secure Olympics while protecting the people's lives and health."

Suga said a donation of vaccines by Pfizer Inc. to the International Olympic Committee for athletes will be "a big contribution" to a safe games.

A speculated mid-May 2021 visit by International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach has become "extremely difficult" because of the extension of the emergency, Japanese organizing chief Seiko Hashimoto said at a news conference on Fri 7 May 2021.

The government has also been criticized over its snail-paced vaccination rollout, which has fully covered less than 1% of the population since inoculations began in mid-February 2021.

Suga pledged on Fri 7 May 2021 to speed up inoculations so all 36 million elderly Japanese can be fully vaccinated by the end of July 2021. He set a daily target of one million shots, more than 20 times the current daily average, but did not explain how that would be possible amid a dire shortage of medical workers who can give vaccinations.

Japan has avoided implementing a hard lockdown to curb infections, and past states of emergency have had little teeth, with people and businesses free to ignore the provisions. These measures have since been toughened, but they come as citizens show increased impatience and less desire to cooperate, making it possible that the emergency declaration will be less effective.

The current state of emergency in Tokyo and Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures in the west was scheduled to end on Tue 11 May 2021. Suga said his government has decided to extend it in those areas and expand it to Aichi in central Japan and Fukuoka in the south.

On Fri 7 May 2021, 2 days after "Golden Week" holiday-makers returned to their daily routine, Tokyo logged 907 new cases of coronavirus infections, up sharply from 635 when the state of emergency began in the capital last month [April 2021], but far above the target of 100 that some experts recommend.

Officials and experts say significantly fewer people may have been tested for the virus during the holiday, when many testing centers and hospitals were closed, and caution that the numbers during and right after the holiday period may not reflect reality.

During the holidays, significantly more people than last year [2020] were seen at tourist spots in Kyoto and Nara despite stay-at-home requests. With drinking places closed, younger people carrying canned beer and snacks gathered in parks and streets in downtown Tokyo. When the holiday ended, many defied requests for remote work and returned to their offices on packed trains.

The extension deepens uncertainties over a speculated 17 May 2021 visit by International Olympics Committee President Thomas Bach, and whether Japan can safely host the Olympics postponed from last year [2020] and currently scheduled for 23 Jul-8 Aug 2021.

Despite criticism for being slow to take virus measures, Suga has been reluctant to hurt the already pandemic-damaged economy and pledged to keep the state of emergency "short and intensive," though experts said just over 2 weeks would be too short to effectively slow the infections and even the extension may be insufficient.

Dr. Shigeru Omi, head of a government taskforce, cautioned officials Fri 7 May 2021 that a hasty lifting of the emergency would only invite an immediate resurgence.

The ongoing emergency is Japan's 3rd and came only a month after an earlier measure ended in the Tokyo area.

Less stringent, quasi-emergency measures will be expanded to 8 prefectures from the current 6, where bars and restaurants are required to close early.

Japan has had about 621 000 cases including about 10 600 deaths since the pandemic began.

Medical systems in hardest-hit Osaka have been under severe pressure from a COVID-19 outbreak there that is hampering ordinary healthcare, experts say. A number of patients died at home recently after their conditions worsened while waiting for vacancies at hospitals.

Past emergency measures authorized only non-mandatory requests. The government in February 2021 toughened a law on anti-virus measures to allow authorities to issue binding orders for nonessential businesses to shorten their hours or close, in exchange for compensation for those who comply and penalties for violators.

Shutdown requirements will be eased somewhat. Bars, karaoke studios, and most other entertainment facilities will be required to remain closed until the end of May 2021, but department stores will be able to operate for shorter hours, and stadiums and concert halls will be allowed to have up to 5000 people or half their capacity.

Wearing masks, staying home, and other measures for the general public remain non-mandatory requests.

[There is pressure on both sides, i.e., to hold the Olympics or to postpone/cancel the Olympics to another year. The decision seems to be based more on politics and economics than science. Japan would lose billions of dollars in revenue, and the Olympic organizers, major sponsors, and television networks would all suffer losses. Pfizer's donation of vaccine to the athletes through the International Olympic Committee will contribute to safer games if there is sufficient time for them to become immunized before arriving in Japan. Only approximately 2% of the Japanese population is immunized because the country had been highly successful at controlling virus spread. The games are scheduled to start in about 11 weeks, so there is little time to make a decision. - Mod.LK]

[3] Vaccines: Pfizer-BioNTech
Date: Thu 6 May 2021

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01222-5?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=fa19a72f28-briefing-dy-20210507&utm_medium=email&u¬tm_term=0_c9dfd39373-fa19a72f28-46250418


Qatar's 2nd wave of COVID-19 was a double whammy. In January 2021, after months of relatively few cases and deaths, the Gulf nation saw a surge driven by the fast-spreading B.1.1.7 variant, which was 1st identified in the United Kingdom. Weeks later, the B.1.351 strain, which is linked to reinfections and dampened vaccine effectiveness, took hold.

Amid this storm, researchers in Qatar have found some of the strongest evidence yet that current vaccines can quell variants such as B.1.351. Clinical trials in South Africa -- where B.1.351 was 1st identified -- had suggested that vaccines would take a hit against such variants. But this study offers a fuller picture of what countries battling such variants can expect.

People in Qatar who received 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were 75% less likely to develop a case of COVID-19 caused by B.1.351 than were unvaccinated people and had near-total protection from severe disease caused by that strain.

The findings -- published on 5 May 2021 in The New England Journal of Medicine (1) -- suggest that current RNA vaccines are a potent weapon against the most worrisome immune-evading variants. Pfizer, based in New York City, and BioNTech, in Mainz, Germany, are developing an updated RNA vaccine targeting B.1.351, as is Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Early results from Moderna's efforts suggest that a booster shot of the updated vaccine triggers a strong response against B.1.351.

"I think this variant is probably the worst of all the variants we know," says Laith Jamal Abu-Raddad, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar in Doha, who led the Qatari study. "We have the tools, despite these variants, to control at least the severe forms of infection, and this should work quite well on transmission."

Researchers in South Africa identified B.1.351 in late 2020, and it's now the predominant strain there. Laboratory studies show that the variant harbours mutations that blunt the effects of virus-blocking antibodies, and trials suggest that some COVID-19 vaccines are significantly less effective against the strain than against others.

Early lab research suggested that RNA vaccines, including the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, would be weakened by B.1.351, but probably not fully compromised. In April 2021, the companies announced that a small trial in South Africa had found the vaccine to be fully effective against B.1.351, but the study of 800 people recorded a total of just 6 infections caused by B.1.351 in the placebo group, so efficacy might have been much lower.

Abu-Raddad's team analysed tens of thousands of COVID-19 cases that occurred between the start of Qatar's vaccination campaign in late December 2020 and the end of March 2021. Genome sequencing showed that B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 were the predominant coronavirus lineages during this period and, from mid-February 2021, each accounted for about half of the country's cases.

The researchers compared SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in vaccinated people with those in unvaccinated controls. People who received 2 vaccine doses were about 90% less likely to develop an infection caused by B.1.1.7, echoing findings from Israel, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. The researchers identified around 1500 breakthrough infections caused by the B.1.351 variant in vaccinated individuals, but only 179 of these occurred more than 2 weeks after the 2nd dose. There were hardly any severe cases of COVID-19 caused by either B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 among fully vaccinated individuals.

"Even though there were breakthrough infections, they didn't lead to hospitalization and death, except very, very rarely," says Abu-Raddad. Two people died of COVID-19 caused by B.1.351 after receiving their 2nd vaccine dose, but it is very likely that they were infected before the protective effects of the booster shot began. "If, a year ago, I told somebody we would have 75% effectiveness against the worst variants we had, they would consider this extremely good news," Abu-Raddad added.

Shabir Madhi, a vaccinologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, says the Qatari results are promising. The comparatively high levels of virus-blocking antibodies triggered by 2 doses of an RNA vaccine probably explain why it confers better protection against B.1.351 than do other vaccines, such as the one developed by the University of Oxford, UK and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in Cambridge, UK.

But Madhi expects that other vaccines will also prevent severe disease caused by that variant. In another 5 May 2021 New England Journal of Medicine study (2), his team reported that the jab produced by biotechnology company Novavax in Gaithersburg, Maryland lowered the risk of getting COVID-19 by 60% in participants without HIV in a South African trial involving more than 6000 people. As-yet unpublished data show that the vaccine was highly effective against severe cases of COVID-19 caused by B.1.351, with no cases in vaccinated individuals and 5 in the placebo arm.

If vaccine efficacy is lower against B.1.351, even highly successful immunization programmes in countries affected by the variant might not reduce cases to the same extent as in countries dealing with less troublesome strains, says Madhi. "Nevertheless, by protecting high-risk individuals, we could still return to a relatively normal lifestyle, even with ongoing circulation."

Qatar, where more than 1/3rd of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, might provide an early glimpse at how the worst coronavirus variants can be controlled. Abu-Raddad says there is evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine might also be highly effective at blocking transmission of B.1.351. And after cases of the variant peaked in mid-April 2021, he says, "things have been going extremely well; the numbers are going down very, very rapidly" (https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-01222-5).

[4] Prior dengue association with COVID-19

Ref. Nicolete VC, Rodrigues PT, Johansen IC, et al. Interacting Epidemics in Amazonian Brazil: Prior Dengue Infection Associated with Increased COVID-19 Risk in a Population-Based Cohort Study, Clin Infect Dis, 2021; ciab410, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab410


Abstract.
"Background: Immunity after dengue virus (DENV) infection has been suggested to cross-protect from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mortality.

"Methods: We tested whether serologically proven prior DENV infection diagnosed in September-October 2019, before the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinically apparent COVID-19 over the next 13 months in a population-based cohort in Amazonian Brazil. Mixed-effects multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of infection and disease, adjusting for potential individual and household-level confounders. Virus genomes from 14 local SARS-CoV-2 isolates were obtained using whole-genome sequencing.

"Results: Anti-DENV IgG was found in 37.0% of 1285 cohort participants (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.3% -- 39.7%) in 2019, with 10.4 (95% CI, 6.7 -- 15.5) seroconversion events per 100 person-years during the follow-up. In 2020, 35.2% of the participants (95% CI, 32.6% -- 37.8%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and 57.1% of the 448 SARS-CoV-2 seropositives (95% CI, 52.4% -- 61.8%) reported clinical manifestations at the time of infection. Participants aged 60 years old were twice more likely to have symptomatic COVID-19 than under-5 children. Locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates were assigned to the B.1.1.33 lineage. Contrary to the cross-protection hypothesis, prior DENV infection was associated with twice the risk of clinically apparent COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with P values between 0.025 and 0.039 after adjustment for identified confounders.

"Conclusion: Higher risk of clinically apparent COVID-19 among individuals with prior dengue has important public health implications for communities sequentially exposed to DENV and SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.

[These findings contrast with those published earlier in Silvestre OM, Costa LR, Lopes BVR . Previous Dengue Infection and Mortality in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Clin Infect Dis. 2020;, ciaa1895, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1895.

The main finding of [the Silvestre] study was a "decreased mortality at up to 60 days [median follow-up] among patients with COVID-19 who had a previous history of symptomatic dengue infection. Participants were included from the community and had a case-fatality rate of 1.6%, similar to previously published data [1]. In a recent ecological study, the spread of COVID-19 was linked to the distribution of dengue cases in Brazil and Asia [4]. Notably, regions with a higher incidence of dengue had a lower number of COVID-19 cases and lower COVID-19-related mortality.

"Symptoms of COVID-19 were more prominent among persons who had a history of dengue despite their lower mortality. This might be due to an enhanced inflammatory response, perhaps similar to the severe symptoms associated with a 2nd episode of dengue or severe primary dengue in previously uninfected persons who received the tetravalent dengue vaccine Dengvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) [8]. Whether deleterious effects from immune enhancement will occur in COVID-19 reinfection or after COVID-19 vaccination remains to be determined."

It is important to study the impact of prior dengue infection on COVID, and prior dengue vaccination on COVID, as well as vis versa, since the 2 occur in the same regions in the Americas and Asia, particularly. These 2 studies differ in their results and conclusions. The difference could lie in the study population or design (e.g., days post-infection). - Mod.LK]
