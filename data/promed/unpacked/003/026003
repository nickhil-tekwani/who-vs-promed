3 pet cats have died of bird flu and a white tiger has been infected by the
virus at a zoo in Thailand, an official said Friday, raising concerns about
the spread of the avian disease among mammals.
It was unclear whether the virus could spread from felines to humans, but
the veterinarian who announced the latest confirmed infections advised
people to avoid contact with pet cats in areas with poultry, which are at
high risk of catching the disease.
"At this moment we know that felines can get infected for sure," Dr.
Teeraphon Sirinaruemit, a veterinarian at Kasetsart University, told a news
conference. "It is best for owners not to have direct contact with cats if
there are chickens in the neighborhood."
So far, cases in people have been traced largely to direct contact with
birds sickened by the H5N1 virus that has decimated poultry stocks through
wide swaths of Asia. It has jumped to humans in Thailand and Vietnam,
killing 22. The pet cats are the first domesticated mammals known to have
contracted the disease in the current outbreak.
World Health Organization viral expert Dr. Prasert Thongcharoen said this
development is "very dangerous because pets are very close to humans.
Because this disease is new to the world, nobody knows how far it can go,"
the WHO expert said Thursday, after reports of the cats' possible
infections surfaced.
Teeraphon said Friday that the carcasses of the 3 pet cats who died were
tested, along with [samples from] a white tiger at the Khao Khiew zoo in
Chonburi province near Bangkok. All were found to have the H5N1 virus.
He said the white tiger has since recovered and is in good health. The Khao
Khiew zoo is the same one where a clouded leopard died of the bird flu [in
January 2004], the first mammal apart from humans to die in this year's
outbreak. Teeraphon said lab tests on 3 house cats and the tiger
has "confirmed 100 percent identical genetic code to the bird flu virus found
in chickens."
Health experts are concerned about the bird flu sickening other animals, in
part because that could prompt mutations in the virus that in turn makes it
easier to pass among people. That concern holds especially for pigs because
of their genetic similarities to humans [see comment below].
Teeraphon said the 3 cats were among 15 owned by a Thai woman in Nakhon
Pathom province outside Bangkok. One of them ate a chicken carcass on a
farm where there was a bird flu outbreak, he said. The cat disappeared and
the remaining 14 became weak, started vomiting, and coughed blood before
dying. 3 were sent for necropsy on 11 Feb 2004, which confirmed they had
the virus, he said. It was not clear what happened to the remaining 11, but
Teeraphon suggested that they had been buried by the owner. The owner is
healthy but is being monitored because one of the cats used to sleep in her
bed, he said.

the situation should be carefully watched, since after 1st passage through a
mammal, transmission to another mammalian species, including humans, may be
easier. - Mod.JW]
