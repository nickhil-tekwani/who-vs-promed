A major biosecurity failure likely led to an outbreak of white spot disease in Queensland that cost prawn farmers more than USD 40 million, Australia's inspector-general of biosecurity has found.

Helen Scott-Orr's report, released today [11 Dec 2017], details a litany of failings in biosecurity that led to the outbreak of white spot disease in Logan River prawn farms in south-east Queensland, in October 2016.

Dr Scott-Orr said the failed import biosecurity system had allowed huge quantities of white spot-infected raw prawns to be sold in supermarkets.

She said there was proof fishermen were using the prawns as bait in the Logan River upstream from the affected prawn farms.

She described a system of import conditions by a number of prawn importers to escape testing. Dr Scott-Orr concluded the biosecurity risk of uncooked prawns had been poorly managed, and it had broader implications for Australian biosecurity.

She said there has been a 25 per cent reduction in front line inspection staff in the last 5 years, which is a critical weakness in confronting the challenges of increased imports of goods.

The outbreak of white spot disease was 1st detected in October 2016 and confirmed on 30 Nov 2017.

Biosecurity authorities killed the prawns on all 7 prawn farms on the Logan River, and emptied the ponds.

The cost has been enormous:
- Logan River prawn farm industry production losses -- estimated at USD 43 million in 2016-17
- Federal Government assistance to control the spread of white spot disease -- USD 22 million in 2017-18
- The Queensland Government spent USD 17 million on response and USD 9 million on follow-up measures
- Federal and Queensland Government assistance and reimbursement to industry of USD 21 million and USD 30 million in concessional loans.

"During this review, I found several deficiencies in the management of the biosecurity risk of uncooked prawn imports, with broader implications for Australia's biosecurity risk management more generally," Dr Scott-Orr said in the report.

She said the specific policy elements and their implementation had sowed the seeds of failure many years earlier, "while progressive and cumulative acts, omissions and systemic factors at many levels exacerbated risks over time."

Dr Scott-Orr praised the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for acting swiftly since banning the imports in January [2017] and putting in place testing measures for the future. But she made several recommendations, and said the only way to improve biosecurity was with long-term adequate resourcing. The recommendations include boosting funding, especially with imports of high-risk goods increasing.

Queensland prawn farmer Ian Rossman, whose entire stock was wiped out, welcomed the findings but said he was concerned about future outbreaks of white spot.

"We are dealing with a virus, and the thing about a virus is it only takes a little bit of product to get into the wild, and there it starts," he said.

Mr Rossman said it had been "very clear" to farmers that the disease had come from overseas imports. However, he said it was unlikely affected farmers would pursue compensation through the courts, because of a USD 20 million reimbursement package announced earlier this year [2017].

Ponds on Mr Rossman's farm that once housed up to 8 tonnes of prawns are now dry and covered in weeds, but he hoped to re-stock next year.

Once the finger was pointed at imported prawns, imports were suspended in January 2017 and later resumed in July 2017 with new restrictions. They included prawn testing prior to export, and sealed shipments that are now screened on arrival in Australia.

The federal Department of Agriculture and Water Resources has agreed to put in place the recommendations, including reviewing the various pathways for white spot disease to enter and establish in Australia.

The department said it had begun improved sampling for consignments of imported uncooked prawns.

The report recommended the department apply direct penalties for serious non-compliance.

It has also agreed to recommendations that it improve communication with industry about exotic aquatic diseases.

[ProMED-mail reported on this outbreak in 2016 and 2017. Improved biosecurity should help prevent the situation again.

White spot disease, which is a highly contagious viral disease of prawns, has been detected on a prawn farm south of Brisbane, in South East Queensland. White spot disease is caused by a virus known as white spot syndrome virus. The disease, and the virus that causes it were both exotic to Australia, and pose a significant threat to the Australia's crustacean industries.

"The disease causes prawn mortality but does not pose a threat to human health or food safety. Prawns from this farm will not enter any domestic or international markets, nor will they be processed for human consumption."
