Human Enterovirus 71 Outbreak in Sarawak; Emerging New Sub-
genogroup
--------------------------------------------------
Sarawak is currently experiencing a large outbreak of human
enterovirus 71 (HEV71) that began in February 2003. Most cases
have uncomplicated hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), but a
small number include neurologic disease.
More than 70 strains isolated this year have been sequenced in the
VP4 gene region. The results show that 80 percent of the strains
belong to genogroup C1 (which has been seen sporadically in the
Asia-Pacific region since 1997) and suggest that the next big
outbreak of HEV71 in the region will likely be due to strains from this
genogroup. The remaining strains belong to a distinct cluster within
the B genogroup and may represent an emerging new sub-
genogroup.

[Human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) was first isolated in 1969 and is
most often associated with outbreaks of the mild childhood
exanthem, hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). HEV71 is closely
related to Coxsackie virus A16, the other major causative agent of
HFMD, but unlike Coxsackie virus A16, HEV71 is also associated
with cases of acute neurologic disease including poliomyelitis-like
paralysis, encephalitis, and aseptic meningitis.
Although HEV71 outbreaks associated with small numbers of cases
of severe neurologic disease were reported in the 1980s in
Australia, Asia, and the United States, mortality associated with such
outbreaks was low, unlike earlier outbreaks in Bulgaria in 1975 and
Hungary in 1978. 20 years later in 1997, deaths associated with
epidemics of HEV71-associated HFMD in Sarawak, Malaysia,
followed closely by outbreaks with high mortality in Taiwan in 1998
and 2000, raised considerable public concern about the virulence of
this virus and the disease syndromes most recently attributed to it.
Now a comprehensive overview of the molecular epidemiology of
HEV71 in the Asia-Pacific region from 1997 through 2002 has been
published by Cardosa et al., in the journal Emerging Infectious
Diseases, Vol. 9, No. 4, April 2003.

Phylogenetic analysis of the VP4 and VP1 genes of recent HEV71
strains indicates that several genogroups of the virus have been
circulating in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. The first of these
recent outbreaks, described in Sarawak in 1997, was caused by
genogroup B3. This outbreak was followed by large outbreaks in
Taiwan in 1998, caused by genogroup C2, and in Perth (Western
Australia) in 1999, where viruses belonging to genogroups B3 and
C2 co-circulated. Singapore, Taiwan, and Sarawak had HEV71
epidemics in 2000, caused predominantly by viruses belonging to
genogroup B4; however, large numbers of fatalities were observed
only in Taiwan. HEV71 was identified during an epidemic of hand,
foot and mouth disease in Korea; that epidemic was found to be due
to viruses constituting a new genogroup, C3. - Mod.CP]
