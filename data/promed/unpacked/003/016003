Health officials confirm an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Orillia has claimed one life as cases continue to climb. The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit said one person in their 60s died, and 35 others are infected.

"Our hearts go out to the person who died. Unfortunately, _Legionella_ does have about a 10% fatality rate," said the health unit's associate medical officer of health, Dr. Colin Lee.

Of the 35 infected individuals, 31 sought hospital care, 29 were admitted, one is in the ICU, while 6 others remain hospitalized.

The outbreak is affecting an already stretched healthcare system. "It is that added cumulative effect that is adding pressures of COVID patients, and now this respiratory illness that is causing pressures," said Carmine Stumpo, President and CEO of Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital.

Experts note the risk of contracting _Legionella_ is believed to be low, as all of the water cooling towers in the city, which are the likely source, have been cleaned and inspected.

Still, the health unit says people should look out for cold and flu-like symptoms that last longer than usual. Any trouble with breathing could also be a sign of Legionnaires' disease. Dr. Lee says if you are concerned, to seek medical advice.

The health unit continues to investigate to pinpoint the exact location for the spread, with results expected over the next 2 weeks.

[There are now 36 cases of Legionnaires' disease in Orillia, up from 27 confirmed cases on 13 Oct 2022. One patient has died.

The city's 11 cooling towers are suspected as a likely source of the outbreak; 6 were shut down, and the other 5 were in the process of being cleaned and disinfected on or about 13 Oct 2022. There may still be some people incubating the disease after the source was eliminated; with up to a 2-week incubation period for Legionnaires' disease, there should be no additional cases about 14 days after the last cooling tower has been remediated.

Genotyping of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of isolates of _Legionella_ from the cooling towers can help confirm the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

Orillia (pop., 33 411 residents in 2021) is a city in Simcoe County, in a densely populated and industrialized region of Ontario, Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcoe_County), between Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, about 87 mi (140 km) north of Toronto.
