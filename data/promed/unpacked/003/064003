Manitoba Pork says there has now been 60 cases of the PED [porcine epidemic diarrhea] virus confirmed in 2019 (24 finisher, 11 nursery, 24 sow, 1 quarantine). 48 of those are in southeast Manitoba, 9 west of the Red River in the Lowe Farm/Morris Area, 2 in Whitemouth, and 1 in Notre Dame de Lourdes.

Producers are reminded to follow strict biosecurity procedures and to sign up for the Manitoba Coordinated Disease Response (MCDR) Program.

To register for the MCDR, or for any other swine health concerns, contact Jenelle Hamblin, Manitoba Pork's Manager of Swine Health Programs, at <jhamblin@manitobapork.com>.

[PEDv has spread within the swine industry in both the US and Canada. In early 2014, an additional related virus, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), appeared in the US. Infections with these novel SECD (swine enteric coronavirus disease) viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.

PEDv causes severe dehydration and diarrhea in pigs and is generally fatal in young animals. It does not transmit to humans or other animals and is no risk to food safety.

However, diseases such as this, impact all the workers with ill and dying piglets and pigs. While biosecurity is important, it can also take a toll on workers through investigations into where a biosecurity lapse could have occurred.

Thorough cleaning and attention to biosecurity of the premises are helpful in controlling these diseases. Viruses are impossible to see, and what cannot be seen can more easily slip through a biosecurity protocol. Someone forgets to wash the boots or the truck. It almost takes 2 people at a time to remember to do it every time until it becomes a habit.

This disease spreads easily, rapidly, and can be devastating to young pigs, which can have a long lasting effect on the price of pork in the province and the nation. We certainly hope this situation is resolved and does not spread. Furthermore, we hope this is not a new strain of the virus representing an impending outbreak in other areas.

Finding it west of the Red River may indicate a relaxation of biosecurity on some premises, or is it a more robust disease making a vicious come back? (see 20190613.6517596)

While tightening biosecurity is often mentioned, it is not mentioned what it means. It is possible people have forgotten what needs to happen to biologically secure a premise. Perhaps, one of the Canadian organizations or agencies should host a meeting to remind and show people. - Mod.TG
