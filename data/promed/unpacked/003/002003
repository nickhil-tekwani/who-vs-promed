CJD-BSE CONNECTION? - UK (10)

> Would ordinary cooking deactivate the infective agents ?

Hello Robert and welcome to the list :-). I'll give my contribution to
answer just one of your questions.
I think the short answer to this one is no. Ordinary cooking is not
enough for deactivation -- but read on and judge for yourself. Please
remember, that the putative agent is not supposed to be in the meat,
but in other parts of the animal, mainly the brain.

You know that it is believed, that the infection of cows originates
from the feeding with meat and bone meal (MBM) produced from the
carcasses of infected sheep and cows. If this assumption is true, it
must follow that the infective agents are able to withstand the
rendering process that leads to the production of MBM.

J.W. Wilesmith and coworkers described the different rendering processes
in their article:

'Bovine spongiform encephalopathy: epidemiological studies on the origin,
The Veterinary Record, March 2, 1991'.

The following information is derived from this article.

There was a gradual change (1971-1984) in the UK from Batch processing to
Continous processing systems, which may have led to less heat treatment of
MBM, but Wilesmith concludes that this gradual change cannot explain the
*sudden* occurence of BSE. The epidemiological model he uses is only
consistent with a rather quick change in the period 1980-1982.

The only sudden change in the rendering process that fulfills this, is
the cessation of a hydrocarbon solvent extraction step that was used to
remove more fat from MBM. This change happened in a brief span of years
from 1977-1982, and is believed to have triggered BSE.

The solvent extraction exposed the MBM to the organic solvents themselves,
and it also included an additional heating (105-120 C for 45-60 minutes)
to remove the organic solvent, and a final stage with direct application
of steam for 15-30 minutes to remove the last traces of solvent.

If the theory is correct, the solvent extraction and the heating connected
with it took care of what was left of the infective agents, whereas the
following processes were *not* sufficient alone:


Batch processing:
0.5 to 15 tonnes raw material is heated in a steam jacketed vessel under
agitation with steamheated paddles. The mean particle size of the raw
material entering is 10 cm. The heating time varies, but a mean time of 155
minutes is taken to reach the max. temp. which ranges from 100 to 150 C.
In most of the plants operating this way, the material is discharged as
soon as the max temp. is reached, else it is held at max. temp for 10-20
minutes. Finally fat is drained off and the solids (greaves) are pressed or
centrifugated to extract more fat. The dried greaves are then ground to
produce MBM.

Continous processing systems:

In these systems the raw material is continously entering the treatment
system, and tallow and greaves are likewise continuously harvested from
the end of the system. The mean particle size for raw material is 3 cm.
Four types are in use:

a) Stork Duke: The rendering vessel contains a high proportion of liquid
fat, and the heat is applied by a steam jacket and steam heated paddles.
The max.temp. ranges from 135 to 145 C. The total residence time is
estimated to 65 minutes, but the residence time at max. temp. is unknown.

b) Stord Bartz: The raw material is heated by passing through a system of
steam heated discs down the length of the rendering vessel. The max.temp.
ranges from 100 to 145 C. In one plant that was examined, the minimum
residence time was 60 minutes, and the time at max.temp. was estimated to
35 minutes.

c) Anderson Carver-Greenfield: Finely minced raw material is mixed with
recycled tallow to a slurry, which passes a system of heat exchangers and
vapour chambers under diminished pressure before centrifugation and
pressing. The heating process takes 30-40 minutes to a max.temp. 104-
123 C. The time at max.temp. is estimated to 15 minutes, but material is
recycled so the residence time at max.temp. is in fact somewhat longer.

d) Protech:(a few plants installed in 1987 and 1988). Raw material 1.0 cm
diameter is heated to 95 C for 3-7 minutes. The liquid phase is removed by
centrifugation and the solids is dried with hot air initially at 800-900 C
then at 110 C, or dried in batch cookers at 120-130 C.
