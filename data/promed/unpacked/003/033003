Black leaf streak disease lands in Martinique
---------------------------------------------
The disease better known as black sigatoka continues its progression
through the Caribbean region. Martinique was one of the few islands
still free of black leaf streak disease (BLSD) when the air-borne
fungus was detected in September 2010 on plantain in the southwestern
part. The disease was confirmed both by observation of the anamorph
form of the pathogen and by molecular analysis.

Symptoms have since been observed in several other locations on the
island and on other susceptible varieties. Scientists believe that
ascospores were carried to the island by southerly winds over a 2-week
period in August [2010] and that heavy rains that followed favoured
disease development. The arrival [of the fungus] in Trinidad in 2003
opened up the front that is now threatening Dominica and Guadeloupe.

BLSD is dreaded because of the ever increasing cost of controlling
it. Growers manage the problem with fungicides so that the plants
retain at least 3-5 leaves. Bunches that come from plants with less
leaves at harvest are usually not exportable, as they would ripen too
quickly. Compounding the problem, the fungus evolves resistance to
fungicides. In Costa Rica, for example, the number of fungicide
applications went from 30 a year in the 1990s to 50 in 2007.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by
the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species and
hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf
diseases of bananas, with yield losses of 50 percent or more. BS
seriously affects plant vigour, and fruit can ripen prematurely during
commercial shipment causing further losses. It is spread by water,
wind, and contaminated materials including suckers for planting.
Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitary measures to
reduce inoculum, and cultural practices.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS). YS is
considered less damaging because it affects older leaves and therefore
has less impact on plant vigour. BS, and also YS, have been causing
serious crop losses in the Caribbean and continue to spread there. A
regional integrated approach is likely to be the best control option
since wind-borne spores may spread between neighbouring islands
despite quarantine measures taken by individual states.
