As of 6 December, the Federal Ministry of Health reported to WHO a total of
565 cases, including 143 deaths with a case fatality rate of 25.3%. These
cases were reported from different localities in South Kordofan State, most
recently from Dilling, Kadugli, Rashad and Talodi. The number of cases is
declining.
As of 4 December, 82.2% of the target population in Kadugli town and 19.8%
of the target population in South Kordofan have been vaccinated.
WHO, International Committee of the Red Cross, International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Medecins sans Frontieres (France),
MEDAIR and UNICEF are working with the Federal and State Ministries of
Health in the vaccination campaign, social mobilization, vector control,
case management, surveillance and laboratory support. Additional assistance
is also being provided by an international team from the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network.
The European Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO) will be
providing 2 million EUROS to support the vaccination campaign, treatment,
surveillance and vector control activities.

[Yellow fever (YF) is common in West and Central Africa and in parts of
South America. Periodic epidemics in Africa lead to hundreds of thousands
of cases. The current rampant outbreak in Sudan is a vivid example. There
has been a dramatic re-emergence of YF in Africa and South America since
the 1980s. Caused by the YF virus, which belongs to flavivirus group, this
tropical viral disease is spread to humans by infected mosquitoes.
There are 2 kinds of YF, spread by 2 different cycles of infection. Jungle
YF is mainly a disease of monkeys, spread from infected mosquitoes to
monkeys in the tropical rain forest. People get jungle YF when they put
themselves in the middle of this natural cycle and are bitten by infected
mosquitoes (mainly _Aedes aegypti_). Jungle YF is rare and occurs mainly in
persons who work in tropical rain forests.
Yellow fever is preventable by vaccination. Travelers should get vaccinated
before trips and avoid mosquito bites when traveling in endemic
areas. Many infections are mild, but the disease can cause severe,
life-threatening illness. YF is difficult to recognize, especially during
the early stages, and can be confused with malaria, typhoid, and other
haemorrhagic fevers such as dengue. A laboratory analysis is required to
confirm a suspected case. The YF virus has an incubation period of 3-6 days
before manifesting itself. - Mod.RY]
