GAUHATI, India: Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has broken out in northeastern
India, threatening, among other animals, the world's largest concentration
of one-horned rhinos at a game reserve in Assam state, officials said
yesterday. "There is an outbreak of the disease in the state. Our research
team has visited affected animals at several places near Gauhati and has
administered first aid," said DK Sharma, who heads the government-run FMD
project at the College of Veterinary Sciences in the state capital, Gauhati.
Reports of the disease have frightened conservationists because the
airborne virus can affect rhinos, pigs, deer, and elephants. Throughout the
world, FMD breaks out every year. There has been no suggestion [that]
India's cases are connected to the [large] outbreak in Britain. British
visitors to India do not have their shoes checked or sprayed as they do
when landing in European countries.
