Today, 27 Jan 2015, the Ministry of Health [of Belize] is working to contain a localized outbreak of hepatitis A at a government school in Buena Vista, Cayo. According to reports, there was one case of the viral infection reported before Christmas and, since then, at least 20 more cases, which have resulted in much concern.

The outbreak in a public school has been kept under the radar by the Ministry of Health. In fact, today [27 Jan 2015], when the media asked C.E.O. Peter Allen about it, he was surprised by the fact that the news had gotten out.

Mr. Allen said, "I don't know why I am surprised that the media knows more about these things than I ever expect them to, but indeed, we appear to have an outbreak of hepatitis A in that particular school. Hepatitis A is a food or waterborne disease. Our staff has been working with the school for the last week, and we were presenting with a parent-teacher association meeting just last night in the village. We believe that the outbreak is controlled, but we are still searching for what in these types of cases we call the index case, the primary case from which the other cases may have become infected. So, we are still working on that, but we do believe we have it under control. We are actively engaged [with] the ministry of health, with the staff of the school, with the parents of the children, and of course with the children themselves."

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread by fecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. The infection has an incubation period averaging about 28 days. An epidemic curve showing the date of onset of cases would be helpful to assess whether most of these cases are from a point source exposure (perhaps from the initial case).

Casual contact among people does not spread the virus. In developing countries (where sanitary conditions are poor), most children experience infection in early childhood. As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon, because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are generally rare, although one seems to have occurred here. - Mod.LL
