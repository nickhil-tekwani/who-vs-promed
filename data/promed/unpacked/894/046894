I regret that the intent of my e-mail re: diagnostic techniques used in
surveillance programs was misconstrued as criticism. It was meant to
initiate a dialog about the cost effectiveness of different approaches to
control the spread of viruses, and not to criticize the NYS lab. What I
really meant to say is that the costs must be weighed of conducting
surveillance by cell culture vs. RT-PCR alone. In the former, one can check
positive cell cultures for virus which is expected in an area, e.g. by in
situ EIA or IFA, but through which one also will pick up unexpected viruses
which replicate in the cell culture and cause cytopathology. Those samples
which cause cytopathology but do not react with the antibodies against
which one regularly is testing, could then be identified. This might
provide an early warning of an unexpected virus and then appropriate
control measures could be taken. It is initially a more expensive
procedure, but needs to be weighed against testing only for specific
viruses by RT-PCR and on occasion, having the unexpected situation escalate
to involve humans and require extensive spraying of pesticides.

[As I was the one who commented on Laura's remarks, I must have been the
one to have misconstrued them. Laura still is quite right, that virus
isolation is a more general method of detecting viruses than would be, for
example, most PCRs, which are rather specific and only detect what one is
looking for. No surveillance system looking specifically for St. Louis
encephalitis virus, even had there been one in NY City, likely would have
detected West Nile virus. However, given a virus isolate, the probability
of the identification of same would have been greatly increased. One
cannot identify a virus until one has a virus. PCR identifies nucleic acid
sequences, not viruses. - Mod.CHC
