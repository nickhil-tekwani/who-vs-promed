The WHO Country Office in Juba, South Sudan is seeking field epidemiologists with experience working in fragile/conflict-affected settings to provide surge support to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in South Sudan. The approximate terms of reference are below. Placements are preferred to be 2-3 months minimum. Either secondments or consultant contracts will be entertained. Expressions of interest should be directed to Dr Yoti Zabulon <yotiza@who.int> and Dr Olushayo Olu <oluo@who.int>.

Background:

Following political conflicts, the humanitarian situation in South Sudan (SSD) has dramatically deteriorated since 15 Dec 2013. The security situation in all the 10 states is volatile, especially in the countryside. An estimated 743 000 persons have been internally displaced with another 170 000 fleeing into the neighbouring countries of Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Sudan.

The event was initially declared as Grade 2 in December 2013. The grading was revised upwards to Grade 3/Level 3 emergency on 12 Feb 2014 by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Principles. The high level of insecurity continues to restrict the humanitarian response. The existing health systems are affected by the conflict.

Communicable diseases are among the increasing health threats during the emergency. These include measles, malaria, diarrheal diseases, and meningitis, among others. The capacity for humanitarian response is being strengthened through the deployment of surge staff. Additional surveillance officers are needed to strengthen the Early Warning Systems (EWARS) and outbreak response.

Responsibilities:

Overall, in close collaboration with the South Sudan Ministry of Health, WHO ERT, and the Health Cluster, the incumbent will provide technical guidance on disease surveillance. S/he will provide expertise and advice for the collection, validation, analysis and dissemination of data, the design and implementation of EWARS, and coordination of related activities. This involves application of related policies and procedures, as well as extensive collaboration with partners and district authorities.

Specifically:
- Coordinate EWARS implementation with all partners at field level, including district, state and national authorities and MOH officials;
- Secure information from a broad range of health sectors, analyze and recommend actions;
- Provide evidence-based data for development of plans of work and strategies, including consolidating health data in trends assessment, with particular attention to surveillance, monitoring and early warning;
- Conduct training for the national and NGO staff working on surveillance data collection and analysis, including plans of action for long-term support and follow up of EWARS in order to sustain implementation of surveillance and assessment activities;
- Identify gaps in EWARS implementation and recommend appropriate actions for reinforcing infrastructure, improving information flows, adapting existing guidelines and/or developing new ones;
- Contribute to the development of appropriate information products such as Weekly Epidemiological situation reports, Health Cluster Bulletins, etc.
- Participate in rapid health assessments and apply the existing strategies and guidelines to ensure the quality and usefulness of the assessments.

Candidate specifications:

1. Education and special training
- Degree in medicine and/or postgraduate degree in epidemiology, mathematics, or statistics, with specialization in public health and studies in computer sciences.
- Degree or knowledge of emergency response relief operations is desirable.

2. Experience (length and type)
- At least 7 years' hands-on experience in establishing and leading surveillance and monitoring projects, combined at the national and international levels, including experience in developing countries.
- Experience in international organizations and responding to public health emergencies is desirable.

3. Language, Knowledge and Skills

- Excellent knowledge of English language is a definite asset. Computer literacy with emphasis on data assessment and analysis as related to epidemiological research and applications and excellent report writing skills are required.
