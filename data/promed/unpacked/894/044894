1st Report of lettuce big-vein virus and Mirafiori lettuce virus in Chile
-----------------------------------------------
I. M. Rosales, P. Sepulveda, and A. Bruna, Instituto de Investigaciones
Agropecuarias (INIA), Centro Regional de Investigacion La Platina, Casilla
439/3 Santiago, Chile. Plant Dis. 88:1286, 2004; published on-line as
D-2004-0914-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication 11 Aug 2004.
Lettuce big-vein disease (BVD), a species in the genus _Varicosavirus_, is
a serious virus disease of lettuce. Recent evidence has brought into
question the role of Lettuce big-vein virus (LBVV) in the etiology of BVD,
and suggested that Mirafiori lettuce virus (MiLV), a species in the genus
_Ophiovirus_, and not LBVV is the causal agent of BVD (1,2). Lettuce plants
(_Lactuca sativa_ L.) with symptoms similar to those of BVD were observed
during the winter of 2003 in open-field and hydroponic-grown lettuce plants
located in the Chacabuco Province of central Chile.
Symptomatic plants exhibited leaves with chlorotic vein banding that became
ruffled and distorted. Symptoms were usually accompanied by reduced plant
size and absence of head formation. Roots from symptomatic plants were
analyzed by light microscopy-acid fuchsin staining. Zoosporangia and
resting spores of _Olpidium brassicae_ were identified on the basis of
their morphology and structure.
Additionally, soil transmission experiments were performed with 50 healthy
lettuce seedlings replanted into contaminated soil collected from lettuce
fields having symptomatic crops. After 3 weeks, one-half of the seedlings
showed differing degrees of big-vein symptoms, and the presence of spores
of _O. brassicae_ was confirmed in the roots by light microscopy. Seedlings
raised in sterilized soil showed no symptoms after the same period of time.
On the basis of nucleotide sequences of LBVV and MiLV from the GenBank
database, primers specific to the coat protein genes of each virus were
designed as follows:
MiLVV-CP1: 5(prime)-CAAATCTGTCCACAATTCC-3(prime);
MiLVV-CP2: 5(prime)-TCTCACTTGAAAACCTTCC-3(prime);
MiLVV-CP3: 5(prime)-TTGCAACGTGATGAAACC-3(prime);
MiLVV-CP4: 5(prime)-AAAGAAGAGAAGCCTGTTCC-3(prime);
LBVV-CP1: 5(prime)-AAGCTTTCCGTACTGTCC-3(prime);
LBVV-CP2: 5(prime)-CCTTGATACAGTTTTTGACC-3(prime);
LBVV-CP3: 5(prime)-GTATGCTGATTTCTGTAGACC-3(prime);
LBVV-CP4: 5(prime)-TAGATGTTCTTCGCCACC-3(prime).
The primers were used in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) assays with dsRNA as a template. Amplicons of the expected size
were obtained in each of the 5 symptomatic plants analyzed using each of
the designated primer sets: MiLVV-CP1/MiLVV-CP2: 562 bp;
MiLVV-CP3/MiLVV-CP4: 743 bp; LBVV-CP1/LBVV-CP2: 485 bp; and LBVV-CP3/
LBVV-CP4: 570 bp. No amplicons were obtained from healthy lettuce plants.
The identity of both viruses was verified by cloning and sequencing of the
amplicons. Nucleotide sequences were compared with those in the GenBank
database. Sequences derived from the Chilean isolates resulted in
identities of 87 to 97 percent for MiLV and 97 to 99 percent for LBVV. All
samples analyzed were from the Chacabuco Province, where 43 percent of the
lettuce crops in Chile are grown. Thus, the impact that BVD may have on
lettuce availability for local consumption may be significant.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of Lettuce big-vein disease and
Mirafiori lettuce virus infecting lettuce, and the 1st report of BVD, in Chile.

[The gist of this piece is that MiLV, not LBVV, causes big-vein symptoms in
lettuce. Moreover, LBVV apparently plays no etiological role in disease
expression and does not affect the outcome of MiLV infection. LBVV and MiLV
are vectored by the soil-inhabiting fungus _Olpidium brassicae_. LBVV
virions are fragile, somewhat rigid rods (320-360 nm long). Those of MiLV
are highly kinked filaments, about 3 nm in diameter, that form masses of 2
classes of particles differing in length that appear to be closed circles,
suggestive of tenuiviruses.
A recently described virus, Ranunculus white mottle virus, is similar to
known tenuiviruses such as citrus psorosis-ringspot virus (CPsV) and tulip
mild mottle mosaic, members of the genus _Ophiovirus_, family
_Bunyaviridae_. Comparison of the core RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp)
motifs of negative-stranded RNA viruses supports grouping CPsV, Ranunculus
white mottle virus (RWMV), and MiLV in the _Ophiovirus_, creating a
monophyletic group separated from all other negative-stranded RNA viruses.
Disease management basically requires strict measures to kill the vector in
the plastic growing trays. Other strategies include developing resistant
cultivars using a wild lettuce (_Lactuca virosa_) in crosses with
cultivated lettuce and a range of biological control agents.
