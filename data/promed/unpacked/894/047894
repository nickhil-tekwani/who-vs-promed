Over 40 000 life-threatening malaria cases predicted in flood-hit Pakistan
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A new health crisis is looming in Pakistan as the peak of the deadly
malaria season approaches. As of 17 Sep 2010, the World Health
Organization states that a total of 195 000 cases of suspected
malaria have been reported.

WHO, Merlin [see below], and Save the Children are working in
partnership with the National Malaria Control Program (DoMC) to
address the onset of this emergency. WHO and Merlin estimate 2.2
million new cases of malaria are expected over the course of the next 6 months.

"Action is needed now and over the next 3 weeks before we get to the
peak transmission season in October and November," says Naeem
Durrani, Merlin's malaria expert, said a press release received by
'Pakistan Times' [daily e-Newspaper] from Merlin's Senior
Communications Officer Jacqueline Koch on Wednesday [22 Sep 2010].

"Essential disease control measures need to be in place to reduce the
risk of an epidemic." Merlin is responding and scaling up, working in
close cooperation with partners. Coordinating partners for Pakistan's
malaria response within the UNOCHA [UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs] health cluster, alongside the DoMC, have
identified a USD 9 million total funding gap for malaria disease
control, surveillance and outbreak response in flood-hit areas. The
USD 9 million needed is in addition to current support from USAID and
the Global Fund."

The DoMC has mobilized all its resources to respond to potential
outbreaks," says DoMC Director Aslam Khan. He adds that at the
national level, malaria control program implementation has been
supplemented with adequate Global Fund support in 19 high-risk
districts in Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Punjab, and
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).

"Working together over the last 2 years, we've made exceptional
strides, and this has built the foundation for a more effective
emergency response today," Durrani said. By working closely with
national and provincial programmes, Merlin is helping to build and
broaden existing malaria coverage, which in 2 years has expanded
Pakistan's capacity to implement malaria control and effective
outbreak response.

The national programme has established 140 net distribution outlets
for 800 000 nets, 300 rapid diagnostic centres, 276 malaria
microscopy centres, alongside the training of 3800 health care
providers on malaria diagnosis, treatment. and surveillance.

Durrani said: "We have to be prepared for an estimated 40 000 severe
cases that could likely lead to cerebral malaria and very possibly
death. Without these building blocks in place, our response wouldn't
be nearly as effective, and vulnerable populations would pay the high
cost." The coordinating partners have stated that the supply pipeline
for malaria testing and treatment is in place, yet will take 3 to 4
weeks for delivery. However, there is an immediate need for 60 000
doses of malaria treatment.

Urgent support is also needed to establish a surveillance system in
flood-affected areas through 10 sentinel sites in 3 of the 4
provinces. WHO reports that all malaria control and outbreak response
measures are in place and funded, with the exception of indoor
insecticide spray, known as IRS [indoor residual spraying].

The funding shortfall for IRS along amounts to USD 1.7 million. "We
need to secure the funds for this vital component of our malaria
strategy," Durrani stated, noting that IRS is a priority since it is
the most effective way of reducing risk and decreasing the number of
cases, particularly in IDP settings. "People cannot use nets inside
tents, and we know that IRC is the most effective proven vector
control tool available for preventing or reducing outbreaks."

Durrani stressed the need to act before the peak occurs. "This is
exactly the right time for this particular control measure." Mosquito
nets are effective but only for those who are living in houses and we
estimate 1.5 million nets are needed to cover the most vulnerable in
this population.

Merlin has called for greater funding to match a growing need. In
collaboration with national program and other stakeholders Merlin
will respond effectively to prevent a significant proportion of
projected malaria morbidity before it occurs. Continued donor support
will play a vital role in reaching the scale needed for a successful
joint response.

Merlin is an international medical aid organisation delivering
essential health care in Pakistan since the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.
Merlin, with WHO support, is working with the National Malaria
Control Programme (DoMC) and together they have achieved the following:
- provided 100 per cent of case management coverage as sub-recipient
of a Global Fund grant in 8 high-risk districts through 150 diagnosis
and treatment centres;
- established and implemented an effective disease surveillance
system in parts of KPK, Baluchistan, and FATA;
- trained more than 1000 health care providers on malaria case management;
- established an effective outbreak response capacity in 8 districts.

Statistics measuring the sheer scale of the Pakistan flood disaster
continue to climb. Floods have forced 4 million people from their
homes, doubling previous figures. Over 8 million people are in urgent
need of food, shelter, and clean water, and nearly 21 million have
been impacted. Merlin's malaria projects are integrated into an
ongoing primary health care program and emergency flood response,
which includes 28 static health facilities and 17 mobile health units
offering essential health care to conflict- and flood-affected
populations. Merlin health and medical teams, over 800 strong
together with logistics and support staff, are treating over 6500
people a day, the press release said, adding that Merlin has been
working in Pakistan since 2005 and continues to build on extensive
country experience to improve the health of millions of people and save lives.

Merlin is an international aid agency that specialises in improving
health where it is most needed. It's work -- from saving lives in
times of crisis to supporting the long-term delivery of essential
care -- is geared towards building a health system that can cope with
needs on the ground now and in the future.

[The efforts to treat almost 6 million flood affected people in
Pakistan is described in the 23 Sep 2010 news release from WHO
available at
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2010/pakistan_floods_20100923/en/index.html>.

The latest data on malaria in Pakistan from WHO (2008) can be found
at
<http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_pak_en.pdf>.
2 558 998 cases were reported in total. From the slide of positive
cases approximately 40 percent were _Plasmodium falciparum_. The
recommended treatment of confirmed or suspected _P. falciparum_
malaria cases is artesunate in combination with sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine.

ProMED-mail will post evidence of an increasing number of malaria
cases in the flooded areas if available. - Mod.EP]
