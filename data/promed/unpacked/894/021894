PENGUINS - SOUTH AFRICA (3)
===========================
Ian:
In the 'acute' phase of the oil spill the CNS signs you describe are
likely due to volatile substances that are part of the crude. After a
while (depending on weather conditions) the volatile substances
dissipate into the atmosphere and some into the water, leaving the
non-volatile 'tarry' fraction of the crude, which also causes problems.
Treatment of toxicity from the volatile fraction is geared toward
treatment of hydrocarbon ingestion. However, in most cases you're limited
to supportive care and allowing the body to deal with the volatiles as
best it can. Some cases will inhale the crude, causing subsequent
respiratory problems, which can manifest themselves in signs you're
describing, so this is also a differential.
As time goes by, birds become susceptible to aspergillosis and other
secondary infections, so you should get geared up to deal with those now.
The reality of the spill is that those birds ingesting the most crude
with the most volatile substances will likely die despite what you do.
Those that get sublethal doses will succumb to inhalation pneumonia,
aspergillosis, bacterial infections, gastrointestinal-related disorders
(burns from the volatiles), renal problems, or liver disease. Beyond that
who knows what effects this will have long term (ie neoplastic
transformation and/or teratogenesis).
Regarding aspergillosis treatment we've had some good success using a comb.
of protocols:
1. Clotrimazole in polyethylene glycol - nebulized for 30-60 minutes per
day for as long as it takes to cure the problem.
2. Add to this itraconazole at 10-20 mg/kg/day (once a day). We have the
itraconazole compounded into an oral suspension.
Personally I think the clotrimazole does more than the itraconazole and
only because the itraconazole does not seem to be absorbed to the degree
needed to raise serum levels to truly therapeutic levels. You can acidify
the itraconazole using a protocol written up by Dr. Susan Orosz and Donita
Frazier. The final pH comes out to be somewhere around 5.5-6.5 and the
dose is given with a meal. Acceptance of this protocol is slow due to the
labor involved and the unwillingness to feed birds this substance at such
a low pH. Also, per Dr. Frazier the initial solution needs to be sonicated
in HCl to get it into solution, and many people don't have this ability.
So, sorry to be so long-winded about this. Hope you find this info useful,
and if you need more help I'd be glad to provide whatever information I
can for you.
