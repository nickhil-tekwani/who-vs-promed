Thousands of adult white bass have been killed in one Minnesota lake
in the past several weeks. _Trichodina_, a microscopic parasite
[a ciliated protozoon that occurs naturally, is to blame. No other
species of fish were affected. The parasite is not harmful to humans.

[It seems there are 15 miles of shoreline and in a grid of a
PORTION of the shore there was a count and then an estimate
of at least 1000 fish, which it is emphasized is ONLY an estimate.
This means there were 5000-14 000 dead fish, plus nobody knows
how many went over the dam/spillway area and were washed away.
There was some difference in the size of the fish, but overall the
fish were believed to be adults. Physically the fish appeared fine,
but the gills were infested by a ciliated protozoon, _Trichodina_.
The laboratory is indicating this as the probable cause of the fish
deaths, but they are still checking for bacteria and viruses.
The fish began dying 5 days ago. The rapid warming of water may
be a factor in the increase in _Trichodina_ and be a contributing
factor to the death of the fish.
My grateful appreciation to all the kind folks in the various
Minnesota departments that tried to help me track down the
correct information. I am especially indebted to Marilyn Dank
and Al Schmidt. - Mod.TG

_TRICHODINA_
A genus in Peritrichia, a subclass of freshwater, estuarine and marine
ciliate protozoa (class Oligohymenophorea); one order: Peritrichida.
In mature peritrichs, the somatic ciliature is limited or absent, but the
oral ciliature is well developed and includes rows of cilia which --
looking into the buccal cavity -- spiral downwards towards the
cytostome in a counterclockwise direction.
According to species, individual cells may be shaped like an egg, bell or
bottle etc; in some species the cell (zooid) is attached to the substratum
either directly or by means of a contractile or non-contractile stalk.
Some species are loricate, and some form colonies. Asexual
reproduction in sedentary species may occur, e.g. by budding with the
formation of a motile, ciliated 'larva' (telotroch).
The mobile peritrichs (all ecto- or endoparasitic, occasionally
pathogenic, in freshwater or marine vertebrates and invertebrates) are
placed in the suborder Mobilina (e.g. genus _Trichodina_).
