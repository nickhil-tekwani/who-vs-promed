Tainan reports 1st encephalitis case of year, farmer ill
--------------------------------------------------------
The 1st indigenous case of Japanese encephalitis infection in Tainan this year was confirmed on Friday [17 Jun 2016].

The Centers for Disease Control said that a 64-year-old farmer developed a high fever on 9 Jun [2016] and was admitted to hospital after vomiting and complaining of confusion on Sunday last week [12 Jun 2016].

The hospital reported the case to the centers on Wednesday [15 Jun 2016] and the center's laboratory on Friday [17 Jun 2016] confirmed that the man had Japanese encephalitis, the centers said.

The Tainan City Government Department of Health said that the man had not traveled abroad prior to becoming infected and had not been vaccinated.

The department said that the man worked near 2 pig farms and a large rice field, which are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

The man's family members showed no signs of infection, it said, adding that the department has investigated the family's home and workplaces and enhanced mosquito-prevention measures.

The _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito is the main vector of Japanese encephalitis, and infections most often occur in Taiwan from May to October, with June and July being the peak period of the disease, the department said.

[The Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus transmission season in Taiwan has begun. JE virus is endemic in Taiwan and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; there is no indication of whether the affected individual above had been vaccinated, but they probably had not been, at least recently. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.
