There is a large literature on the subject of tuberculosis in patients with
HIV infection, and a review on the subject in the New England Journal of
Medicine 1991;324:1644-1650. There a numerous articles on the subject of the
clinical presentation of tuberculosis in HIV infected patients, including a
study on the clinical and radiographic presentation in patients in Kigali,
Rwanda, in the Am Rev Respir Dis 1992;146:53-56. These indicate that more
x-ray findings in HIV-infected patients are the rule, rather than less,
although the presentation is often atypical, particularly in those with severe
immunosuppression who tend to resemble immunocompetent patients with primary
TB, with hilar adenopathy, pleural effusions, and a milary pattern; those with
well-preserved immune function resemble immunocompetent patients with
reactivation TB (cavitation and upper-lobe infiltrates). Only a minority of
ptaients have normal chest x-rays or have interstitial infiltrates. There are
numerous experts on this subject here in California (e.g., Philip Hopewell at
San Francisco General Hospital) and resources at the county and state level to
provide assistance.
An addendum: in the review by Barnes et al. , NEJM 1991;324:1644-1650,
it is noted that 26 to 42 percent of blood cultures performed
with the lysis-centrifugation system are positive in
patients with HIV infection who have tuberculosis.

Was the organism M. avium-inracellulare complex (which would explain
constant treatment failure), M. tuberculosis, or another mycobacteria?

This is very interesting. There are some small studies suggesting that
Kinyoun staining of buffy coat smears is helpful in rapid diagnosis of
M. avium infection, but I am not aware of this in tuberculosis.
Were any of the subjects treated with corticosteroids in addition to
TB therapy?
