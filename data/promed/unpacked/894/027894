Outbreak of deadly horse disease in Saskatchewan, but worst may be over: CFIA

Prince Albert, Sask. - The number of cases of a disease that can be deadly in horses continues to rise in Saskatchewan.

But the federal agency that monitors the disease says the worst of a recent outbreak may be over.

An outbreak of Equine Infectious Anemia, or EIA, began in January and, over the last 3 months, positive cases have turned up on 20 farms in 6 different rural municipalities, mainly around Prince Albert.

Ten positive cases were reported in January and 48 in February, but last month, there were only 3.

Deer and horse flies are mainly responsible for the spread of the disease from animal to animal, so Alex McIsaac, with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, says the province will likely see cases through the spring and summer.

The agency says increased testing is the main reason behind the larger number of cases this year; testing has become mandatory at shows and race events.

"When you do that your increasing the surveillance which means you're looking for the disease more which means you'll probably find the disease more," McIsaac says.

While there is no cure or vaccine, McIsaac says it's important that horse owners have their animals tested so other animals aren't put at risk.

"Carriers don't really show any outward signs that they have the disease and the only way you would know a (horse) is positive is by doing a blood test," McIsaac says.

[EIA is a "reportable disease" under the ‘Health of Animals Act’. This means that all suspected cases must be reported to the CFIA for immediate investigation by inspectors.

Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a potentially fatal viral disease affecting horses and other members of the equine family, such as donkeys and mules.

EIA-infected animals remain carriers of the virus for life and can be a source of infection for other animals.

The incubation period is generally 2 to 4 weeks, but may range from 1 week to 3 months. Infected horses may show the following signs: anorexia; depression; general weakness; intermittent fever up to 41ºC; jaundice; small hemorrhages under the tongue and eye; swelling of the extremities; and weight loss.

In some cases, a loss of coordination may be the only clinical sign.

A tentative diagnosis can be made based on clinical signs, but blood tests are necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

Many animals show temporary recovery from the severe stage of EIA and may even appear normal for two to three weeks before relapsing with similar, but less severe signs. Episodes of clinical illness are often associated with the use of steroid drugs or with periods of stress such as hard work, hot weather, racing or pregnancy.

Transmission of EIA occurs mainly through the transfer of contaminated blood from one animal to another. Insects such as horse flies, stable flies, and deer flies aid in the disease spread. Transmission may also occur when blood-contaminated objects (e.g., needles, syringes, or surgical instruments) are used on more than one animal.

EIA can also be transmitted through the semen of an infected stallion. Foals can be infected before birth. Foals infected prior to birth are often aborted, or die within 2 months of birth.

At this time there is no cure for EIA, nor is there a vaccine that will prevent an animal from becoming infected. Supportive therapy may alleviate clinical signs in individual cases, but it is critical to remember that infected horses serve as a reservoir of infection for other horses.

The control of the disease is based on surveillance testing, identification and destruction or life-long quarantine of infected animals, mandatory testing of imported horses, and efforts to prevent the spread of the virus by controlling insect and mechanical vectors.

Horse owners can take the following precautions to reduce the risk of infection:
• use strict hygiene practices when vaccinating or collecting blood samples from horses;
• use disposable needles and syringes, and do not use the same needle on more than one horse;
• implement insect control measures;
• test horses as per horse industry standards (i.e., race tracks, shows, events, breeding stables, etc.) whenever horses from different sources will intermingle;
• isolate all new horses until they have been tested for EIA;
• do not breed EIA-positive horses;
• abide by the national EIA control program; and
• consult your veterinarian if you suspect your horse may be infected with EIA.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) imposes strict regulations on the importation of animals and animal products from countries where EIA is known to occur. These regulations are enforced through port-of-entry inspections done either by the Canada Border Services Agency or the CFIA.

Owners whose animals are ordered destroyed may be eligible for compensation.
