There is a high probability that bluetongue, detected Thursday (17
Aug 2006) in the Netherlands and Saturday (19 Aug 2006) also in
Belgium, has been present in the region for a longer period. The
disease infects initially cattle before manifesting itself
[clinically] in sheep. This has been said by the Dutch minister of
agriculture Cees Veerman in a letter sent Friday [18 Aug 2006] to the
parliament.
Cattle do not become sick by the infection but serve as carriers of
the bluetongue virus [BTV] and thus as source for further infection.
"According to the literature, cattle are the 1st animals to get
infected; this means that in [the Dutch province of] Limburg, a large
number of cows might have already been infected," says the minister.
Veerman also had good news. He notified the parliament that "it is
highly unlikely that the disease will survive the winter in the
Netherlands; this is related to the fact that the vector is not
active during the winter months, enabling the livestock to recover,"
said the minister. He emphasized that control measures are not
necessarily directed at the early eradication of the disease, but at
limiting the losses.
In the meantime, the farmers organization "LTO-south" reported that
the vector is, probably, not a south-European midge [_Culicoides
imicola_, - Mod. AS] but a "usual" local midge [For reference, see
commentary]. This information was related to the LTO-south by
researchers from the university of Wageningen. The midges might have
become infected with BTV by feeding on an infected imported animal,
transmitting it further to other ruminants.
So far, the disease has been confirmed in 3 farms in Limburg: one in
Kerkrade and 2 in Nuth. [A map showing both places is available at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=50.9178&lon=5.8847&scale=500000&icon=x>].
It is suspected in 13 other farms. In Belgium, the disease has been
confirmed, so far, in 11 farms in the province Luik [Liege] and in
the Voeren region [a hilly region within the Belgian province
Limburg, south of Maastricht; see clickable map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?action=showmap&country=116_9005_5&language=1>.
- Mod.AS].
On Monday [21 Aug 2006], veterinary experts from 25 member states of
the EU will meet in Brussels to discuss the issue. They might decide
to extend the zones, where no transport of animals is allowed, to 50
or even 100 km [around disease foci]. Within these zones,
vaccinations may be applied.

Sheep holders fear the worst by bluetongue
-----------------------------------------------
[Mr. X] is a big sheep breeder in [the province] Limburg. His farm,
in Epen, includes 1300 sheep. They graze on pastures maintained by
diverse organizations and authorities. 13 sheep have died already; 6 are sick.
The laboratory results are still on wait, but the bearded sheep
breeder will not be surprised if the investigation confirms
bluetongue, a south European sheep disease, affecting his flock of
"mergelland" sheep [a rare local breed; see picture at
<http://www.vildaphoto.net/photo/5351>].
[The sheep breeder] says, "This is totally new. One has, obviously
heard about the disease, but its introduction here seemed rather out
of consideration. The vet also did not recognize it. Initially, we
suspected pneumonia, trying penicillin. I suspected also, in view of
the change from dry to wet weather, protein intoxication, which might
occur when there is a speedy growth of the grass."
All symptoms indicate bluetongue: difficult breathing, stiff legs,
swollen lips, and blue tongue.
He is not allowed to sell sheep, similarly to all farms in the
vicinity of Kerkrade, where the 1st case was discovered. In addition
to Kerkrade, the disease has already been confirmed in 2 sheep farms
in Nuth. 12 other farms are still "suspected."
[The sheep breeder] could not sleep last night, fearing his sheep
should be culled; but he is now relieved to hear that this is not the
case. "A flock of Mergelland sheep is not easily put together; I have
been engaged for years building it up."
Limburg's sheep breeders emphasize that cows can be the virus
carriers, while only sheep get sick. Not everything is clear; the
farmers have diverse speculations on the route of introduction. [The
above mentioned sheep breeder] hints that the midges may have been
introduced by incoming flight passengers. There are other local
theories, such as the transfer of midges on clothes of Dutch tourists
returning from Spain.
[Another individual] from Simpelveld is also affected. He was, until
his retirement last year [2006], a big sheep breeder. Now he
maintains only 100 sheep, 5 of them already dead. [This 2nd sheep
breeder] thinks that the midges have reached north Europe during
recent years due to the climate changes. "It has been said that due
to the climate changes, we are going to get malaria here. Well, this
midge is the forerunner of the malaria vector." He maintains that the
infected midge is not restricted to the Netherlands. "I cannot
believe it has jumped over the Alps, in one leap 1000 kms, landing
just in Limburg. It must be found also in countries such as France,
Belgium and Luxemburg, where they keep quiet about it."
What is the chance for an improved situation? "I hope that the
temperatures drop shortly," says [the 1st sheep breeder]. "Then the
midge will disappear, and the disease [will be] extinguished."
