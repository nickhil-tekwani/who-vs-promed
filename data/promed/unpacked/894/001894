A rare public appeal went out on Wednesday [15 Feb 2006] to Israeli
pet owners to bring their dogs to donate blood to help save more than
a dozen canines poisoned by toxic American pet food.
Approximately 23 dogs have died in Israel in recent weeks from liver
failure after eating Nutra Nuggets Performance, manufactured by the
U.S.-based Diamond Pet Food company. Veterinarians say at least
another 17 pets have been poisoned and that only a handful were
expected to survive.
At the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
Beit Dagan, where 14 dogs are being treated for poisoning,
veterinarians said dozens of people had brought in their pets to give
blood after [the vets] made their appeal on Israeli television, radio
and newspapers.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered a recall of several
Diamond Pet Food products in December [2005] after tests showed many
bags were contaminated with aflatoxin, a potentially lethal chemical
found on grains.
Diamond estimated that more than 75 dogs died in the United States.
Israel's Agriculture Ministry recalled the products in February [2006] after
several dogs in Israel died.

The Veterinary Department of the Ministry of Agriculture on Tuesday
[14 Feb 2006] ordered the Diamond Pet Food company to remove its
entire range of products from the shelves.
The call came after test results confirmed that their dog food was
hazardous to the animals' health.
Agriculture ministry officials decided to withdraw their seal of
approval from the products and issue a warning to the general public.
They added that the ban applied to all the of the U.S.-based
company's products.

We are trying to learn more of the epidemiology of the present
outbreak of aflatoxin toxicosis in dogs in Israel (about 25 dead
animals so far) induced by dog food produced by the Diamond company
in the USA. What we would be interested to learn is:
1. Whereas the FDA reported that "some of the recalled product was
exported to at least 29 countries, including countries in the EU", it
seems strange that there were cases of aflatoxicosis in dogs recorded
only in Israel (as far as we know). Does anyone know of other cases
occurring outside the USA?
2. Which countries have imported dog food from Diamond in the last 3 months?
3. Which of these countries routinely examine imported dog food for mycotoxins?
4. Have there been analyses for aflatoxin or other mycotoxins in
these countries in suspect Diamond feeds since the USA recall?
5. Have there been recalls of suspect Diamond feed in these countries?

[According to today's (16 Feb 2006) information from the Teaching
Veterinary Hospital, 42 dogs have been hospitalised there so far, all
showing typical clinical and clinico-pathological signs of aflatoxin
poisoning. 23 of them have died, 6 recovered and released, 13 remain
hospitalised.
The number of pet dogs in Israel is estimated to exceed 200 000.
According to official state regulations, dog owners are required to
identify their dogs by approved electronic chips. At present, more
than 144 000 electronically identifiable dogs are included in the
Central Dog Registry, maintained by the State Veterinary Services.
