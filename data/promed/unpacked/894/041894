KINSHASA, Congo (AP) - Lab results have confirmed a deadly illness
outbreak in southeastern Congo as Ebola fever, officials said Monday
[10 Sep 2007].
The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and another lab in Gabon
confirmed the disease as a hemorrhagic fever, and specifically as
Ebola, Health Minister Makwenge Kaput said on national television.
More than 100 people have died of illness in the affected region

Congo confirms Ebola outbreak; more than 100 have died since late August [2007]
---------------------
Lab results have confirmed a deadly illness outbreak in southeastern
Congo is Ebola fever.
Congo Health Minister Makwenge Kaput says the U-S Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta and another lab in Gabon have
confirmed the disease as a hemorrhagic fever and specifically Ebola.
Provincial chief medical inspector Jean-Constatin Kanow says more
than 160 people have died of the illness in the affected region since
late August [2007] and nearly 400 have been infected.
He says the infections are mostly in 2 areas, Mweka and Luebo and the
majority of the deaths occurred at the beginning of the outbreak.
Makwenge did not say whether the outbreak has been contained.
Spokesperson Kelly Keith confirms hemorrhagic fever experts at
Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg have been
following the situation and are prepared to deploy a team to the area
if requested.
Experts from the Winnipeg laboratory - which is part of the Public
Health Agency of Canada - are often tapped by the World Health
Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network to help
contain these types of outbreaks.
The special pathogens team has developed a portable lab that can be
safely operated in remote locations with few resources. Being able to
accurately identify cases early has been critical to containment
efforts, because the initial symptoms of hemorrhagic fevers are
similar to those of other diseases which commonly strike in affected areas.
Medical inspectors had previously said people began dying after
high-profile funerals of 2 village chiefs in the region where
relatives usually wash the bodies of the deceased by hand.
Ebola is spread through direct contact with the blood or secretions
of an infected person, or objects that have been contaminated with
infected secretions. It is not known where the initial infection came
from, though medical researchers say it is likely from contact with
an infected animal.
In the past, Congo has seen large outbreaks of Marburg and Ebola,
both hemorrhagic fevers caused by viruses that, in severe cases,
attack the central nervous system and cause bleeding from the eyes,
ears and other parts of the body.
By the end of August [2007], 4 villages had been affected and 217
people had come down with the illness, including 103 who died. About
140 000 people live in the Mweka area.
Congo's last major Ebola outbreak struck in Kikwit in 1995, killing
245 people. Kikwit is about 300 kilomertres from the site of the
current purported outbreak.

[Ebola virus, a filovirus, has one of the highest case fatalities (up
to 80 percent) of any viral disease except rabies. ProMED-mail
requests further information about the actual numbers of people
infected and fatalities, as well as the specific location and
circumstances of the outbreak in the southeastern part of the
DRC. One hopes that this is not part of the eastern DRC that has
been torn by civil strife and violence, preventing intervention that
would further describe the outbreak and work with local inhabitants
to prevent spread from infected individuals to those in contact,
through exposure to bodily fluids.

[It is curious that according to the above mentioned newswire, the
case fatality rate (CFR) of this outbreak seems to be fairly low for
Ebola hemorrhagic fever with the report of 103 deaths out of 217
cases (CFR 47.5 percent) by the end of August, and now approximately
160 deaths and 400 cases (CFR 40 percent). One is curious to know
the true numbers of cases and deaths, and if information on the viral
strain is available. For a good summary of prior outbreaks of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever outbreaks see the WHO Ebola outbreak chronology
table available at:
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/index1.html>.
Outbreaks of Ebola-Sudan virus have had lower CFRs as a rule than
Ebola-Zaire virus associated outbreaks.

above mentioned affected areas of Mweka and Luebo, see

(the areas are visible if resolution of the map is increased. One
can also see where they are in relation to Kikwit where the above
mentioned outbreak occurred in 1995. - Mod.MPP]
