Taranaki's 1st case of the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_ has been confirmed by the Ministry of Primary Industries [MPI]. A dairy farm has been designated as the region's 1st 'restricted place' after test results and animal movements showed a risk of spreading the bacterial disease, _M. bovis_ director Geoff Gwyn, from the Ministry of Primary Industries, said in an emailed statement.

A 'restricted place' is a farm where there is either confirmed disease or a very high suspicion of disease, and it requires that all cattle be culled. The bacterium is spread animal to animal through close contact and bodily fluids, "_M. bovis_ is tested at a herd level and in this case the herd has tested positive for _M. bovis_," Gwyn said. The bacterium is easily spread through animal contacts or drinking infected milk, so any cattle which have mixed with infected animals are considered to be at risk of infection even if the individual animals do not show clinical signs.

"The _M. bovis_ response team has worked extremely hard to establish whether the property is at risk of being infected and have established the risk is high, as is the risk of spreading it to other properties," he said. Further tests would be done after the animals were slaughtered to confirm the infection. He would not reveal any details about the farm involved or the number of animals being culled. "This is a sensitive situation and extremely trying for the farmers involved," he said. "We have not taken this decision lightly and it is necessary for the response to eradicate _M. bovis_ from New Zealand."

He said MPI was working with the farmers concerned and their support networks to help them through the process. "We are well aware that the effect of this eradication response has on individual farmers," he said. "We are wrapping as much welfare support around the owners of the property as possible."

The Government announced in May [2018] that it would attempt to eradicate the disease at an estimated cost of $886 million [about USD 608 million] over 10 years.

It was discovered in a South Canterbury dairy herd in July last year [2017].

[Taranaki is a coastal and mountainous region on the western side of New Zealand's North Island. Its landscape is dominated by Mount Taranaki, its namesake volcano, which lies within the rainforested Egmont National Park. The port city of New Plymouth is the area's hub. It hosts green spaces like Pukekura Park, with lakes and formal gardens that grow rhododendrons and king ferns. For a description of Taranaki go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taranaki.

And on New Zealand North Island it is as far as one can get from Northland region; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northland_Region This disease now seems to have reached almost the entire country, as cases are found on both islands. _M. bovis_ is clearly an efficient traveler and the MPI will be well tested as they go about eradicating this pathogen from New Zealand. - Mod.MHJ
