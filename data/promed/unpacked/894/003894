Confirmation of the Identity of the SARS Agent
----------------------------------------------
An international team of scientists say they have conclusively identified
the virus responsible for SARS. As suspected since the height of the
outbreak, a [novel] coronavirus is responsible for the disease. "The
significance of the paper [published online in the journal "The Lancet" on
Tue 22 Jul 2003; see below. - Mod.CP] is confirming that this [novel]
coronavirus does produce very serious disease," said Frank Plummer,
Scientific Director at the National Microbiology lab in Winnipeg. The
researchers [confirmed the identity of] the virus by looking at clinical
and post-mortem samples from 436 SARS patients in 6 countries. They also
injected the virus into 4 macaques (a species of monkey common in Southeast
Asia), 3 of which went on to develop SARS-like symptoms.
"Collectively, these results of laboratory studies of SARS patients and
experimental infections of macaques prove that the newly discovered
SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the primary causal agent of
SARS," said the study's lead author, Prof. Albert Osterhaus of Erasmus
University, the Netherlands, in a press release.
Plummer's team at the National Microbiology Centre was able to find
SARS-CoV in only 60 percent of samples from SARS patients that they
examined. He thinks there's something else going on that scientists don't
yet understand. One possibility is that some people listed as probable
cases actually had something else that looked like SARS. Microbiologist Dr.
Donald Low of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto said that it is vital to have
a definitive diagnosis for SARS. "That's going to help us, especially if we
see clusters of cases where we were able to get a number of different
samples and if they come back negative, being able to say this is not
SARS." Furthermore, SARS could be a seasonal disease, poised to return
later this year along with the usual cases of cold and influenza.

The paper is entitled "Newly discovered coronavirus as the primary cause of
severe acute respiratory syndrome", authored by Thijs Kuiken, Ron A M
Fouchier, Martin Schutten, Guus F Rimmelzwaan, Geert van Amerongen, Debby
van Riel, Jon D Laman, Ton de Jong, Gerard van Doornum, Wilina Lim, Ai Ee
Ling, Paul K S Chan, John S Tam, Maria C Zambon, Robin Gopal, Christian
Drosten, Sylvie van der Werf, Nicolas Escriou, Jean-Claude Manuguerra,
Klaus St√∂hr, J S Malik Peiris, Albert D M E Osterhaus. The Summary of the
paper reads as follows:
"The worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is
associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV). We carried out clinical and experimental studies to assess the
role of this virus in the causation of SARS. We tested clinical and
postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in 6 countries for infection with
SARS-CoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens. We
infected 4 cynomolgus macaques (_Macaca fascicularis_) with SARS-CoV in an
attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection.
SARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75 percent) of 436 patients
fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in
41 (12 percent) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only
sporadically. SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of
SARS. The 4 SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth,
and pharynx from 2 days after infection. 3 of 4 macaques developed diffuse
alveolar damage similar to that in SARS patients and characterised by
epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline
membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia.
SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and
was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by
immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. We conclude that
replication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in
human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV
infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that
SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS."
These data establish the principal role of the SARS-associated coronavirus
in the causation of SARS. However, they do not exclude the participation of
other co-factors or agents such as Human metapneumovirus, although the role
of the latter can probably be discounted in view of its high prevalence in
the respiratory tract of the general population. As Dr. Low points out,
these concerns will persist until an accurate diagnostic test becomes
available. - Mod.CP]
