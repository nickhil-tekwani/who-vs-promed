To date, through the tick surveillance efforts of a variety of state and local agencies and institutions, _Haemaphylus longicornis_ (the imported "Asian longhorned tick") has been found in 18 different counties and cities in Virginia. A large proportion of these collections have been made on domestic livestock or wild animals, such as the tick removed from a hawk by the Virginia Wildlife Center and identified through efforts of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS). Additional collection records have been made in new jurisdictions through tick surveillance programs conducted by local and state health department personnel, including drag sampling; through collection from animals at animal shelters; or by CO2 trapping. There have also been several county collection records made by an academic researcher doing tick surveys across southwestern Virginia.

To date, most of the jurisdictions where these ticks have been found have been in the higher-elevation western counties and cities in Virginia's mountainous regions. There have only been a few collections in counties east of the Blue Ridge mountains, and those "upper Piedmont" counties have been adjacent to the Blue Ridge or were relatively close to mountain counties. Thus far, tick surveillance efforts in the coastal and lower Piedmont regions of Virginia have not yielded any of these ticks.

Although the movement of livestock around the USA in trucks is certainly a potential means of _H. longicornis_ dissemination, these ticks are also known to feed on birds in the larval stage, and it is possible that the widespread dissemination of these ticks has been on migratory birds. It is not clear why the ticks are mostly being seen in the upper Piedmont and mountain regions of Virginia, but a few possibilities are that the bird species that the larval stage ticks feed on use the mountainous regions as their migratory flight paths, or that livestock agriculture appears to be much more common in the western areas of Virginia than in the eastern areas. One other possibility might be that the ticks survive better in the cooler, higher-elevation regions of Virginia than in the much hotter, lower-elevation terrain to the east. Certainly, we will know more in the coming years.

[Dr. Gaines is thanked for providing this overview of the longhorned tick situation in Virginia. It is interesting that, so far, the tick has been found at higher elevations in the state. By whatever means -- birds or livestock movement or both -- the tick has been spread around and now is found in 8 states. It doubtless is now established in the eastern USA. As noted earlier, either the tick is spreading rapidly, or surveillance has been intensified, or both.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. Fortunately, so far there is no evidence for this tick transmitting the tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. All tests for the presence of these pathogens in the ticks have been negative so far. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional longhorned ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
