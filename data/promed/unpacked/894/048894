Suspect Meat Had Anthrax, Says Permanent Secretary
--------------------------------------------------
The suspect meat that caused the death of one person and left several in
critical condition was infected with anthrax. The Health Ministry PS, Prof
Julius Meme, confirmed this yesterday. A pupil at Naaro Primary School,
died at midnight after he ate meat from a dying cow slaughtered by a local
farmer on Thursday. In a telephone interview, Meme at the same time said
the Government has started vaccination of livestock in Central Province to
curb the spread of the disease.
And the Kenya National Butchers Union (KNBU) yesterday raised the alarm
over rampant sale of uninspected meat in Nairobi. The union chairman, Mr
Gerishon Kirima, revealed that some unscrupulous butchers are selling meat
from dead cows and goats to unsuspecting consumers. In a statement, Kirima
feared that the meat poses a serious problem in the face of an anthrax
threat in parts of the country. Kirima revealed that the meat is supplied
late at night or early in the morning and called for a crackdown on
unlicensed butchery operators in makeshift kiosks. Some unlicensed butchers
are using fake stamps to make the meat pass as being fit for human
consumption. Kirima appealed to the Government to search buses, vans and
lorries as they are being used to supply the meat using fake transport
permits.
The Maragwa farmer who slaughtered a cow suspected to have been infected
with anthrax, was arrested. Meanwhile, a retired veterinary officer who
passed the meat as fit for human consumption has since gone underground,
according to Maragua police boss, Mr Mbithi Jason.
A total of 441 villagers from the village in Maragwa District have been
treated after eating the meat. According to the Central Provincial Medical
Officer (PMO), Dr Olang'o Onudi, 10 other people are still admitted at
Thika District General Hospital. Onudi said 391 of the victims have been
treated at Thika District Hospital while 50 others have received medication
at Naaro Dispensary in Kandara. He said the 10 still hospitalised were
responding positively to antibiotics and they could be discharged any time
if their recovery progress improves.

[I wonder in how many other towns in West and East Africa this scenario is
being replayed. There is a horrifying consistency to this pattern of
disease exposure elsewhere, as in India and Central Russia, and Central
Asia. - Mod.MHJ
