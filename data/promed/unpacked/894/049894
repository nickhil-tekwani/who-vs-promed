In January 1990, the worlds worst outbreak of botulism occurred in two beef
feedlots on the Darling Downs in Queensland, Australia. A total of 5,500
head of cattle died from a total population of approximately 30,000 head.
The cause of the outbreak was Type D botulism produced when cattle were fed
the spent litter out of broiler chicken laying sheds which was contaminated
with dead birds, as a source of non-protein nitrogen. This was a common
practice at the time but is no longer practiced in Australia as a result of
this episode. One of the interesting findings from this outbreak was that
deaths continued in one feedlot long after contaminated feed had been
removed from the ration. It was thought that the cattle had eaten botulinum
spores, which then grew in the ideal conditions of the rumen and produced
toxin, therefore amplifying the effects of a minimal ingestion of infected
material.
Given that the Californian outbreak has stemmed from what appears to have
been a point source of infection which was then well mixed into the ration,
it is possible that this outbreak may also have been due to
toxico-infectious botulism. It would be interesting to view the epidemic
curve for mortality by day as this could give some clues as to whether this
was indeed toxico-infectious botulism, without doing lots of fancy tests. In
normal botulism, a very rapid peak in mortality should have occurred after
feeding the contaminated feed, with a rapid drop off in new cases once the
feedstuff was removed. In toxico-infectious botulism, the time to peak
mortality and the subsequent decline in new cases would be somewhat prolonged.
