Provigo grocery sushi in Montreal may be contaminated with hepatitis A, according to news reports quoting Montreal Public Health. That store is located at 6600 Saint-Jacques street in Montreal's Notre-Dame-de-Grace neighborhood.

The sushi products were made between [17 and 20 Nov 2021] and [24 and 25 Nov 2021]. While the risk of transmission is low, this virus is quite contagious. People can get sick through person-to-person contact, through touching contaminated surfaces, and by eating contaminated food.

If you ate sushi prepared at that particular store on [24 or 25 Nov 2021], you can still get a hepatitis A vaccination or immune globulin if you act quickly. That vaccine is only effective if given within two weeks of exposure. You can contact Info-Sante at 811 for a free vaccination appointment. Bring your Medicare card and vaccination record. If you have already been vaccinated against the virus, or if you have had hepatitis A in the past, you should be protected; check with your doctor to be sure.

If you ate Provigo grocery sushi made between [17 and 20 Nov 2021], however, it's too late for a vaccine. You should monitor your health for symptoms of hepatitis A for the next 50 days, or through [13 Jan 2022]. If you do feel sick, see a doctor.

Symptoms of hepatitis A include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fever, lethargy, pale clay-colored stools, diarrhea, dark urine, and characteristic jaundice, which is yellowing of the eyes and skin. Most people start feeling ill within a couple of weeks, but the incubation period for this virus can be longer.

The best way to prevent transmission of the virus is to get vaccinated. Since people who are infected will not have any symptoms for the first 2 weeks, they can unknowingly spread the virus. You should also wash your hands thoroughly before eating or preparing food for others, and stay home from work or school if you are sick.

[It is likely, but unstated, that there is a food handler index case here who was un-immunized, and any cluster of 2ary cases could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers were the rule. An outbreak of hepatitis A with 23 confirmed cases was traced to a food handler who worked in the kitchen of a private Morris County, NJ, country club in 2019 and this year's (2021) outbreak in Virginia of more than 50 cases with 3 deaths related to a food handler bear witness to the fact that while the risk of HAV in food handlers may not be high, if infected the food handler represents a real risk to those eating in the restaurant. If such cases occur, the public relations and financial damage to the restaurant could be very significant. Although vaccine mandates in today's world are problematic, restaurant-associated food handler-related outbreaks of HAV are preventable. - Mod.LL
