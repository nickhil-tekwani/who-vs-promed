Avian influenza virus infection and age-related severity
-----------------------------------------------
Health officials and physicians in Indonesia are to be commended for their
proactive testing of children for H5N1 influenza in cases where there are
no obvious symptoms of severe respiratory involvement (see ProMED-mail post
entitled "Avian influenza, human (160): Indonesia 20061006.2870). [It
should be noted that, as yet, there has been no confirmation by laboratory
testing that any of the 7 children below the age of 10 identified in this
report have contracted avian influenza virus infection. - Mod.CP]

There is good reason for increasing the focus of H5N1 surveillance efforts
on children and adolescents: WHO data published on 3 Oct 2003 indicate that
age-specific morbidity and mortality rates are skewed towards the younger
age cohorts, with approximately half of all WHO confirmed cases coming from
individuals who were less than 20 years old
<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/csr/data/data_Graphs.htm>.
[The highest number of cases and deaths were observed in the 10 to 39 years
age groups, and only about a quarter were in the less than 10-year-old age
bands. - Mod.CP]

Data collected from human cases in Viet Nam and Thailand since 2003 show
that disease and mortality from H5N1 avian influenza tend to be more severe
among children than adults
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su5501a2.htm> and
<http://www.prbo.org/cms/docs/birdflu/deJong_and_Hien_2006_J%5B1%5D._Clinical_Virology.pdf>,
a factor which is complicated by the fact that severe and fatal H5N1
infections in children and adolescents have been shown to occur in the
absence of respiratory presentations or marked respiratory involvement
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su5501a2.htm>,
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids==15716562>,
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no7/04-0415.htm> and
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/353/13/1374>.
This represents an apparent change in the epidemiology of the H5N1 virus in
humans subsequent to the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong, where severe disease
symptoms were seen less frequently among children than adults (see
ProMED-mail post entitled "Avian influenza, human (82): age-related
severity 20060613.1648").

Studies in Viet Nam and Thailand have shown that fatal H5N1 infections in
children may occur as gastroenteritis or encephalitis syndromes in the
absence of any marked respiratory symptoms
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su5501a2.htm>,
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/350/12/1179>, and
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no7/04-0415.htm>.
Studies in Thailand, Viet Nam, and Hong Kong have found that children
infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus often presented symptoms resembling
those typical of other more common fatal diseases of children in Southeast
Asia, such as dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, cholera, or dysentery
<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/csr/data/data_Graphs.htm>,
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su5501a2.htm>,
<http://www.prbo.org/cms/docs/birdflu/deJong_and_Hien_2006_J%5B1%5D._Clinical_Virology.pdf>,
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/350/12/1179>,
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no7/04-0415.htm>,
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/353/13/1374>,
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050459.htm>.

The apparent higher frequency of non-respiratory disease syndromes and
symptoms among children and adolescents reported in the recent literature
on human H5N1 cases suggests that H5N1 infections in children are more
likely to be confused with other more common diseases, and children are
therefore more likely to be overlooked as possible bird flu cases when they
are not associated with infected adults exhibiting classical severe acute
respiratory collapse or "cytokine storm" syndromes.

Taken together, I believe that these studies indicate that there is a need
for an increased focus on children and adolescents for human bird flu
surveillance programs, and the explicit targeting of gastrointestinal and
encephalitis symptoms as a differential diagnosis criterion for H5N1
testing of children or adolescents with a history of exposure to poultry.
