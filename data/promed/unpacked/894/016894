Decrease in incidence of HFRS in Republic of Bashkortostan
----------------------------------------------------------
The regional office of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for
Customers' Rights, Protection and Welfare] has announced surveillance
data for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) for the first
quarter of 2011, which has created some grounds for optimism. There
were 188 HFRS cases during the first quarter of 2009, compared with
140 cases in the same period of 2010 and only 38 cases this year.

An outbreak of HFRS is not expected this year. The capital city of
the Republic, Ufa, has published the same favorable prediction as the
Republic overall on the basis of similar surveillance data for the
first 4 months of this year.

However, sporadic cases are expected to occur during the peak period
for gardening and outdoor activities, which starts about the beginning
of April. It is predicted that spring floods may have considerably
reduced the rodent population. In addition, the harsh weather of the
winter may have further reduced the rodent population. Furthermore,
according to Rospotrebnadzor, a vigorous programme of rodent control
throughout the Republic may have further reduced the potential of the
rodent population to cause disease.

[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of
clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses classified in the
family _Bunyaviridae_. HFRS is found throughout the world, widely
distributed in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and
Korea.

Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and Russia.
Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents. People can become
infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after exposure to
aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after
exposure to dust from their nests. The bank vole (_Clethrionomys
glareolus_) is the reservoir for Puumala virus.

The Republic of Bashkortostan is a federal subject of Russia (a
republic). It is located between the Volga River and the Ural
Mountains. Its capital is Ufa. Its location is shown in the map at
