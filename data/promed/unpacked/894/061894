I reported:
>"The Ministry of Health and Welfare warned of the spread of the _E. coli_
>O157 infection and advised the following precautions: _E.coli_ is sterilized...

I did not report the background of the announcement.
At the first step of the investigation, a reproducing experience was done
at the Oku lunch supply center, OKAYAMA. And the result was that
when hamburger steaks were cooked, about 20% of them were not cooked enough
because of the uneven temparature of the equipment.
In response to this result, the health ministry announced the warnings mentioned
above. They were vague, but it means all cooks must be careful about
the uneven temperature of the cooking device.
>It is better to give clear, practical advice that everyone can follow.
I agree with this opinion.

But it is rare for the government to announce such a direct warning in
public. It's (notorious) Japanese style.
A training course for local health officers was already held by the Health
Ministry this month. I suppose the ministry gave clear instructions to
the local health offices directly, and the local health offices
gave them to all of the lunch supply centers.
