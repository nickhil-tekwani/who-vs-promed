[1] Canada: in race to provide rapid testing in West Africa
Date: Mon 15 Dec 2014

http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ebola-outbreak-canadian-company-in-race-to-provide-rapid-testing-in-west-africa-1.2872775


A Toronto-based company is on the leading edge of developing rapid Ebola testing and managing health data in West Africa.

Buoyed by a USD 700 000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Fio Corporation is adapting its mobile devices to provide Ebola test results in minutes, instead of hours or days, as well as crucial management of the data collected.

"If this device is in remote areas in Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone, you'll be able to get point-of-care tests quickly," Dr. Elias Sory, a director at Fio, said at his Accra-based office.

Fio's devices could also help front-line workers effectively trace the disease. "We can ask how many people you live with, who you have seen, where they, are and it can be tracked," said Sory.

Fio's device is called a Deki Reader. It was recently approved and put into commercial use in Ghana, among dozens of other countries, to detect malaria. In many African countries, malaria is the go-to diagnosis. Anyone complaining of a headache, muscle stiffness or fatigue is often treated for the virus [sic] without any testing whatsoever. At Lesson Pharmacy, a bustling dispensary in Accra, the test is being used several times a day to check for malaria. "It's a waste. In terms of cost, probably you're buying it to treat malaria, and you don't have malaria. You're experiencing side-effects (from the malaria treatment), which make you uncomfortable," said pharmacist Kwaku Ankamah...

The test is simple; it requires just a drop of blood, drawn by pricking the ring finger. That tiny sample of blood is dropped into a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) strip, and the strip is placed into Fio's Deki Reader. In just 18 minutes, an insistent beep indicates the results are in. The strip reads much like a home pregnancy test. If there are 2 lines showing, the test is positive for malaria; one line indicates a negative result... - more

[2] Netherlands: 50 Dutch laboratory techs to go to Ebola region
Date: Mon 15 Dec 2014
Source: Relief Web [edited]
http://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/fifty-dutch-laboratory-technicians-go-ebola-region


The Netherlands is sending 3 teams of specialised laboratory technicians to Liberia and Sierra Leone to help fight the Ebola outbreak there. They will be working in mobile laboratories, purchased by the Netherlands and transported to the region by the Joint Support Ship Karel Doorman, conducting blood tests to establish whether patients are infected with the disease.

According to Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Lilianne Ploumen, this fulfils an important need. "The UN has announced that they are in desperate need of laboratories and specialised personnel," she said. "Our contribution will boost these countries' medical testing capacity considerably, a crucial contribution to the Ebola response." ... - more

["Better Ebola tests expected within months," months during which hundreds more may die because the wait for test results delays the start of treatment.

Since dehydration due to D&V (diarrhea & vomiting) precipitates organ failure, and knowing that health workers were accustomed to blanket treat fever cases for malaria, why not treat all severe fever cases in those countries now with ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) as long as they can still take liquid by mouth, just as is done for diarrhea in infants and cholera patients? ORS packets could be made up locally as required, recognizing that some health centres reportedly do not have a water supply or even jugs and cups. - Mod.JW
