Fresh market tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.) cultivars are
grown in field and greenhouse areas in Baja California Sur from
October to June for international markets. During March and April
2001, field-grown tomato plants showing external necrotic stem
lesions and hollowed necrotic pith were observed in a 50-ha field 30
km south of La Paz. The average disease incidence in the field was 3
percent.
Most infected plants presented necrotic lesions in the main stem 20
to 30 cm above the soil line. A few plants also presented necrotic
lesions in lateral branches. Transversally cut sections in the
necrotic stem area showed rotting of the vascular system with hollow
cavities, [a] typical symptom of pith necrosis.
...5-cm-long transverse portions of diseased stems were excised,
washed with soap and brushed, ... rinsed with tap water, ...soaked in
10 percent bleach for 2 min, blotted dry on sterile paper, and
[small] sections were cut to include the margins of the necrotic
pith. These sections were plated on nutrient agar and incubated at 28
to 30 degrees C. Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria were consistently
isolated from stems with pith necrosis. They were identified as
_Pseudomonas corrugata_ [Pc] using Biolog analysis (carbon source
utilization at 37 degrees C), with a similarity index of 1.0.
... Pathogenicity experiments were conducted twice in a screenhouse
on a total of 24 2- month-old tomato cv. Rutgers plants (50-60 cm
tall). Bacteria were injected [by] ...a syringe into the stems above
the point of lateral branching at 2 different sites, using 0.25 to
0.5 ml of a bacterial suspension (100 000 CFU/ml). Injection points
were sealed after inoculation with a small amount of petroleum jelly.
Necrotic lesions surrounding ... [injection points] were observed 10
days after inoculation. 4 weeks after inoculation, plants showed
necrotic pith symptoms similar to those observed on field-grown
plants, and Pc ... was recovered from the margins of areas with
necrotic pith. Control plants, ... injected with water, remained
healthy throughout the experiments.
Pc ... [was] ... reported to cause pith necrosis in tomato plants in
California (3), Florida (2), and the northern part of the Baja
California peninsula (1). This report confirms the presence of Pc ...
in the Baja California peninsula, and to our knowledge, this is the
first report of Pc ... causing pith necrosis in tomato plants in the
southern state of Baja California Sur, Mexico.

[According to Wesley Chun of the University of Idaho, Pc causes pith
necrosis disease only in tomatoes and a few cultivars of pepper. This
bacterium is also a strong antagonist of certain phytopathogenic
bacteria and a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi. Pc can be
formulated as a dry powder with talc as a carrier for use in
biological control of pea diseases. It increased yield of peas and
decreased root and crown disease incidence, whether used alone or in
combination with fungicides.
In the original report, the word "pitch" was used instead of the
correct word ("pith"); the corrections have been made. - Mod.DH]
