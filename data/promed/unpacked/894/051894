[2] Spread, northern Israel
Date: Sat 22 Jun 2019
Source: Hachaklait Clinical Veterinary Services, head veterinarian's weekly report no. 25/2019 [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, summ., edited; subscription required]
http://www.hachaklait.org.il


Lumpy skin disease [LSD]: during the past week, a case of LSD was suspected by the attending practitioner in the dairy operation of Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk and has been confirmed. The long leap [exceeding 50 km/31 mi] of the virus from the previous outbreaks [Golan/eastern Galilee] to western Galilee may be explained by the proximity of Kfar Masaryk to the all-country incineration plant for animal carcasses and waste, "Bioecology," in the neighboring Kibbutz "Ein Hamifratz." Immediately after confirmation, the affected herd was vaccinated.

Another practitioner has reported 2 suspected cases in fattening calves in Mevo-Chamah [southern Golan]; the veterinary services are investigating a suspected outbreak in Tubba-Zangariyah [eastern Galilee]. The Field Veterinary Services are said to consider application of compulsory LSD vaccination of cattle in northern Israel.

[On Thu 20 Jun 2019, the (acting) director Field Veterinary Services, Dr Avi Vasserman, submitted a circular to the district veterinary offices and to stakeholders informing the confirmation of LSD in the dairy operation of Kfar Masaryk; announcing the relevant biosafety, animal movement, and quarantine requirements; and adding a map of the region liable to the said restrictions. Vaccination is not mentioned; however, according to the above "Hachaklait" circular, vaccination is to be applied within the outlined region. The circular (in Hebrew) is available at https://tinyurl.com/y39lrjcu (for the map, scroll down).

For the location of Kfar Masaryk, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/zeq6sFFEhuLLNGNJ7. To view the location of the incineration plant in adjacent Ein Hamifratz, zoom in. The website of the Bioecology incineration plant is available at https://www.bioecology.co.il/. The operation of such enterprise, which collects animal carcasses and animal waste from the entire country while located in proximity to animal farms, prescribes severe biosafety measures, including permanently maintained immunity/vaccine coverage against regional infectious diseases, in the said farms. LSD is known to be transmitted by various insect vectors, in particular the stable fly, _Stomoxys calcitrans_.

The LSD outbreaks in eastern Galilee are close to Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese territories. While Jordan maintains LSD surveillance and, if/when necessary, applies vaccination, the situation in Syria remains unreported. Most likely, LSD has been circulating there for an extended period. The LSD situation in Lebanon deserves to be visited.

Past field trials have shown that the Neetling (attenuated) LSD vaccine strain is the most effective and safe one. - Mod.AS.
