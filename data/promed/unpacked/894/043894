A sample from a dairy farm in Eliad, southern Golan, HaZafon district, received at the Veterinary Institute, has been identified, by sequencing, as a field strain of _Brucella abortus_.

[In case definitely confirmed, this is to become the 1st occurrence of _B. abortus_ in Israel since 1984. On 11 Nov 2021, the Field Veterinary Services informed about 2 brucellosis cases discovered in aborting dairy cows in Eliad (https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/brucella-11-11-2021/he/beef_brucella-11-11-2021.pdf, in Hebrew). This was followed by serological tests of all cattle in the 3 dairy operations in the village; 2 of them had, eventually, to be totally culled due to their high (nearly 50%) infection rates.

Since the final eradication of bovine brucellosis (_B. abortus_) in Israel in 1984, _B. melitensis_ continued its circulation in the country, affecting predominantly pasturing sheep and goats with several spillovers to dairy cattle farms and causing considerable human infection. Vaccinations of all dairy female calves between the ages of 2-6 months with "strain 19" brucellosis live attenuated vaccine were continued compulsorily for years. This, in view of the continued circulation of _B. melitensis_ in the sheep and goat herds, and despite the fact that no clear evidence for this vaccine's cross-protection was available. In infected cattle herds, seropositive animals had to be slaughtered in the framework of "test and slaughter" policy, and in several events entire herds had to be culled. _B. melitensis_ causes, in particular, udder infections in cattle with the resulting exposure of humans; its abortifacient effect in cattle is much lower than that of _B. abortus_ (which is also named "contagious abortion").

After its eradication, the continued absence of _B. abortus_ in Israel was monitored by compulsory surveillance of all farms, which included periodic bulk milk testing. In the event of a positive reaction, the test was repeated on bulk milk from groups of cows, and the cows of a suspected group underwent individual blood testing. Cows with positive test results were slaughtered with full state compensations, and their organs bacteriologically examined in the State Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis in the Kimron Veterinary Institute.

Following a risk assessment, vaccination with "S19" vaccine was officially discontinued on 1 Jan 2014 (see ProMED archive no. 20151103.3762268). Subsequently, the routine, periodic performance of the bulk milk testing was discontinued in 2015.

Details of the tests applied in the described case, the tissues tested (foeti?), and the suggested origin of the bacterium, will be helpful.

Eliad (map at <tinyurl.com/2p99hns2>) is about 6 and 8 km (~3.7 and 5 mi) distant from the Syrian and the Jordanian borders, respectively. In both countries, _B. melitensis_ and _B. abortus_ are endemic. Populations of wild boars and gazelles are present within the 3 adjacent territories. - Mod.AS
