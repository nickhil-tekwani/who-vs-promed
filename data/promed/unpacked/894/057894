Since the publication linking PPR with sudden camel death in Sudan
(ref.), this condition warrants consideration and would be easily
verified. There is certainly plenty of PPR in Pakistan.

in camels in the Sudan. Acta Tropica, Vol 116 (2), 161-165.

[Dr Taylor's authoritative comment is highly appreciated.

The recent paper referred to includes the following information on
the camel disease in Sudan, eventually diagnosed as PPR:

Mortality rates were up to 50 percent. The main features of the
disease were bloody diarrhea of affected camels, sudden death of
apparently healthy animals and abortion of she-camels. In general,
the clinical feature of PPR in camels, as described in this
communication, was not different from that reported in sheep and goats.

The severity of PPR in camels seemed to be much higher in adult
animals since more than 50 percent of deaths were reported in adult
animals (mostly recently-delivered and pregnant females) in
comparison to calves and young camels. The main post-mortem findings
included lung congestion and consolidation mostly in apical lobes,
paleness and fragility of liver. Lymph nodes were enlarged and
inflamed, and small intestine and stomach showed inflammation and
hemorrhage. In one case, the lips were swollen, and hemorrhagic
ulcers were seen on the tongue.

In line with a comment from a subscriber, we remind readers that the
camels in Pakistan (and in Sudan) are dromedary (single-humped)
camels. - Mod.AS]
