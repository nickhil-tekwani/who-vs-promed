Employees of kiosk encounter the vector of Chagas Disease in Santa Catarina
------------------------------------------------------
The Secretary of Health of Santa Catarina confirmed this Thursday [31 Mar
2005] that a barbeiro [triatomid bug] was found in the kiosk Barracao da
Penha 2, in Navegantes (113 km from Florianopolis), which was infected with
the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_ (the cause of Chagas disease). According
to the agency, 91 percent of the infections [cases of Chagas disease] that
were confirmed occurred through the ingestion of cane juice from this
establishment. The test, conducted by the Department of Microbiology and
Parasitology of the Federal University of Santa Catarina, proved the
presence of the protozoan in this insect. The insect was found by employees
of the establishment, which is located on the margins of the BR-101 highway
at km 111, this past Wednesday [30 Mar 2005]. It was hidden in a towel --
a product that is also sold in this kiosk.
In addition to the barbeiro [triatomid bug], an adult opossum and four
young that were captured near to the local [the kiosk] were also positive
[for _Trypanosoma cruzi_]. The animals were trapped in one of the 40 traps
behind the kiosk, an area where part of the sugar cane was
stored. According to the Director of the State Epidemiologic Surveillance
Unit, Luis Antonio Silva, the search for infected animals is continuing and
will be extended for a radius of 4 kilometers.
"The situation is being clarified, providing a sense of security as to
which persons have been exposed to the source of infection" he
said. According to Silva, all of the sick individuals had ingested the
sugar cane juice on 13 Feb 2005. The surveillance unit is still
investigating 2 residents of Joinville (180 kms from the capital), who were
confirmed with the disease, but did not have contact with the kiosk at
Navegantes.
In addition, the form of transmission was not pointed out. One hypothesis
is that the sugar cane had been infected by the opossum or the barbeiro
[triomatid bug] in the storage area or that the insect was crushed during
the preparation of the drink.
The Epidemiologic Surveillance unit revealed this past Thu [31 Mar 2005]
that only 24 cases [of Chagas disease] were confirmed. There have been 9
days during which the number [of cases] has reached 30 [but confirmation is
still pending]. According to Silva, 4 of the cases were chronic carriers of
Chagas disease (they were already in an advanced state of the disease). Of
these, 2 had undergone testing to donate blood, and the other 2 were organ
recipients.
Another 2 cases will return for analysis, and therefore cannot be linked to
the outbreak [as yet]. According to the Secretary of Health of Santa
Catarina, Luiz Eduardo Cherem, there cannot have been a mistake. "I do not
want to say that this was an error. Perhaps as a result of the
overwhelming number of examinations performed there has been some
confusion." According to him, although the transmission was accidental, all
of the State agents involved in capture of the mosquito responsible for
dengue fever will also be trained to capture the vector for Chagas
disease. This will be the responsibility of the municipal surveillance units.
The ANVISA (National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance) divulged this past
Thursday [31 Mar 2005] the launching of a line of credit for the vendors of
sugar cane juice who want to make improvements in their establishments.

ANVISA (the National Sanitary Surveillance Unit), in response to the
outbreak of Chagas Disease in Santa Catarina, has announced an additional
screening step for blood donations. All persons who drank sugar cane juice
from the kiosks along highway BR-101, between Picarras and Italjai, during
the period 1 Feb 2005 through 23 Mar 2005 are to be considered
inappropriate for blood donation. Questioning about this exposure history
is to be added to the pre-existing questioning on health status and
medication use. One person to date has been blocked from donating blood.

[The fact that the infections have been pinned down to exposure on a single
day will be comforting to people living in or passing through Santa
Catarina State. Precise information on exposure can now be given.
The outbreak has disclosed an unknown potential for transmission of
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ to many people in a very short time. - Mod.EP]
