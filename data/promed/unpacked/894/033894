AMANTADINE FOR INFLUENZA (2)
============================
[The query concerned estimating creatinine clearance to determine
whether a patient could safely receive amantadine]
There are some neat algorithms that allow you to estimate creatinine clearance
from serum creatinine and body weight. I used to have one when I was a
resident. It that was on one of those plastic rulers that drug companies were
always giving away. You might find one in a nephrology textbook or perhaps
your local neighbourhood nephrologist can help.
