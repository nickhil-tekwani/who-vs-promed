There were just 18 cases [of measles] confirmed in the whole of 2011 in the North East. Now more than 100 people have, or are suspected to have, measles in one of the worst outbreaks in the North East in recent years. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said the disease was mainly spreading among unvaccinated schoolchildren and it was "seriously" concerned. Since September 2012, there have been 49 suspected and 56 confirmed cases, compared to just 18 confirmed in 2011. Almost a quarter of those affected have been hospitalised, the HPA said.

Parents are being urged to make sure their children have the required 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, the 1st at 12 months and the 2nd dose at around 3 years and 4 months. HPA North East spokeswoman, Julia Waller, said: "This measles outbreak is very serious, and we are likely to see many more cases before it's over. The sad thing is that most, if not all of these cases could have been avoided if people had been up-to-date with MMR vaccination. There are still too many children and young adults who were not vaccinated. People with measles could also be a risk to those who are not able to protect themselves, such as babies who are too young to be vaccinated."

Earlier in January 2013, the HPA issued similar guidance in the North West after there were 35 confirmed cases since September 2012.

The most common symptoms are fever, cough, sore eyes, and a rash that develops 3 or 4 days after the onset of illness, starting with the face and head and spreading down the body.

87 cases of measles were reported on Monday [28 Jan 2013] in the province of Adrar, according to the head of the Department of Preventative Medicine of the State Health Department.

The epidemic occurred in the districts of Bordj Badji Mokhtar [in southwestern Algeria (in Adrar province) near the border with Mali], with 72 cases so far, and in Reggane, with 15 cases, which include 6 cases in the town of Sali and 9 cases in the town of Reggane. A vaccination campaign has been launched in Bordj Badji Mokhtar and Reggane, according to the Director of Public Health at Reggane.

There are fears of a larger outbreak, since people 6 months to 60 years of age can contract measles. Containment measures are now in place to prevent further expansion of the disease.

Blood samples have been sent to the Pasteur Institute emergency department to establish the status of other patients, according to doctors in Adrar. The DSP has sent a medical team to the affected area to initiate a vaccination campaign. So far, 700 people have been vaccinated.

The health department has not released any figures with regard to fatalities, but the situation remains serious, especially in Bordj Badji Mokhtar, which is located 800 km from the capital city of Adrar province.

The Kinshasa Office of the United Nations DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo] Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA/DRC) announced on Wed 23 Jan 2013 that more than 100 measles cases and 11 deaths had been recorded since 13 Jan 2013 in the Djolu Health Zone in the Tshuapa District (Equateur province).

UNICEF, in collaboration with the Provincial Inspectorate of Health has prepared 25 measles emergency kits for distribution to the 32 Health Zones affected. These will be distributed to the affected Health Zones in the province. However, rapid distribution of these kits may be delayed by difficulties associated with poor access roads. In 2012, more than half of the Health Zones of the province were affected by measles.

The epidemic of measles reported in Maniema is continuing, where 1691 cases were reported in 2012, particularly in the Health Zones of Kabambare, Lubutu Obokote, and Punia. Since the beginning of this year [2013], 68 cases including 3 deaths have been recorded in the Health Zone of Kunda.

In North Kivu, UNICEF launched a 5-day campaign on Tue 22 Jan 2013 to vaccinate 1.2 million children aged 6 months to 15 years. It is being conducted in the Health Zones of Binza, Karisimbi, Kirotshe Masisi, Rutshuru, and Rwanguba, all of which have been affected by population movements. The Health Zone of Beni has been reporting measles cases for several weeks.

More than 27 000 displaced children in North Kivu were immunized against measles virus infection last week, said OCHA spokesman Sylvestre Mudingayi. This campaign was conducted by the Ministry of Health, UNICEF and Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF). Between January and November 2012, outbreaks of measles were reported in 10 of 11 provinces.

The World Health Organisation believes that nearly 55 000 cases and 1509 deaths have occurred in North Kivu. 650 cases have been confirmed, 6 times more than in December 2011. Recent civil unrest has caused displacement of populations and looting of health centres, and general insecurity is threatening significantly the outcome of the revaccination campaigns. In November 2012, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health, Pierre Lokadi, announced that measles epidemics had been recorded in Kinshasa and the 2 Kasai provinces Orientale and Equateur. He explained that this was due to several factors, including the shortage of vaccines, and promised that his ministry would cooperate with partners to fight the epidemic throughout the DRC. "It is planned to organize follow-up campaigns to prevent further epidemics of measles. But this has not been achieved yet on account of shortage of vaccine."

The measles outbreak that was earlier confined to villages in Omuthiya Constituency has spread to the Oniipa Constituency, Oshikoto region, according to Director of Health Peter Angala. Angala stated that 6 new measles cases have been confirmed in Omadhiya village, 4 in Onguma, 3 in Ompugulu, one in Okankuzi/Oshigambo, one in Ohadiwa/Onamunkulo, one in Onalulago, one in Onaame, and one in Onamulunga village, all of which are located in Oniipa Constituency. So far, Angala said, 30 cases have been confirmed. Some of the affected people are receiving treatment at the Onandjokwe and Oshakati hospitals. Angala told "The Namibian" that they have sent health teams to the Omuthiya and Oniipa Constituencies to vaccinate people between the ages of 6 and 35.

According to him, thousands are flocking to the fixed and mobile clinics to be vaccinated. He said some of his health workers are in the villages and clinics gathering information about how the people contracted measles. Angala said that veterinarians treating anthrax are also travelling with the health officials. There is also an anthrax outbreak in the region, with more than 20 confirmed human cases at Oniipa and 2 deaths.

"We are hard at work. As we are talking, the 2 outbreaks are under control. We are in contact with all community leaders, such as village headmen, church leaders, councilors, and the governor of Oshikoto, Penda yaNdakolo, who are all giving us their support in the eradication of these 2 diseases," Angala said.

A mobile clinic was set up at Omulunga village, which is centrally located, and is covering a lot of people in the Oniipa Constituency. The campaign should be finished by Friday [1 Feb 2013), Angala said.

[Oshikoto is one of the 13 regions of Namibia. The northern part of the region is agricultural, whereas the main economic activities in the southern part are cattle rearing and mining. The 2 areas have important cultural and historical links in that the Ndonga people have extracted copper at Tsumeb since the earliest times in order to make rings and tools.

More than 100 children have died of measles in Pakistan this month [January 2013], the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on 23 Jan 2013, calling the outbreak "alarming." "Some 103 Pakistani children have died from 1-19 Jan [2013] this year because of post-measles complications such as pneumonia, post-measles encephalitis, and diarrhoea," WHO spokeswoman Maryam Yunus told AFP. 63 of the cases occurred in Sindh province, which was hit by severe flooding in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The flooding is thought to be a factor.

More than 300 Pakistani children died of measles in 2012, a staggering increase from the previous year, when 64 children died of measles, according to the WHO. "It is certainly an alarming situation," Yunus said. She said WHO and UNICEF had provided a combined 4.4 million doses of measles vaccine since last year [2012] to target the children in Sindh's flood-affected areas.

The deaths of scores of children in the recent measles outbreak in different parts of the country has exposed the weak routine immunisation system in Pakistan in general and the province of Sindh in particular.

Regional Manager of the Society for Protection of the Rights of Children (SPARC) Iqbal Detho, while talking to APP, stated that Pakistan is among the 10 countries that account for almost 2/3rds of the world's un-immunised children. He said that 53 percent of children in the province of Sindh had not received the vaccine despite its availability. He said that Child Rights Movement (CRM), Sindh chapter is concerned about the enormous difference in routine immunisation coverage between the provinces, districts, and cities, which he maintained is at the root of the measles outbreak in the country.

Prominent consultant pediatricians have put the blame of these under-5 child deaths due to measles on mismanagement at the district level, neglect of routine immunisation, and lack of awareness among parents regarding routine immunisation.

WHO presented a report to the government which stated that the primary reason for the outbreak was a failure to complete the immunisation programme. The report also confirmed that the country's continuous struggle with a fraught health care system, unsanitary conditions in many regions, and lack of education about how to prevent children from getting the disease contributed towards this outbreak as well.

Iqbal Detho maintained that no medical teams or vaccinators had as yet visited the affected areas of the districts despite the reporting of deaths on a daily basis and complaints of a large number of children having been affected by measles. He claimed that villagers are helpless, as neither the vaccine nor the medical staff are available at the local health facilities, and numerous children are suffering, but their helpless parents can do nothing but wait for the vaccinators or doctors supposed to be sent to the village by the health department. He said that it is high [time] to respond to the situation effectively and take steps that may strengthen the routine immunisation system in Pakistan on a sustainable basis, which will also help eradicate polio from the country.

He recommended that the Sindh Health Department should launch a high quality, widespread vaccination campaign against measles across the province and ensure the availability of vaccines at vaccination centres to eradicate the disease from the province.

He said that the federal and provincial governments should start allocating specific resources to scale up routine immunisation targeting uncovered areas and children from the poorest segments. The government and the donor agencies should launch awareness raising campaigns to highlight the importance of routine immunisation and to get the children vaccinated with 2 doses to eliminate their chances of contracting the viral disease.

There are approximately 10 000 vaccinators throughout Pakistan, strongly limiting immunisation coverage, he said, and added that the Sindh government needs to increase the number of vaccinators so that there is one vaccinator for every 5000 people in order to reach sufficient numbers of children. He said that it is essential for the provincial government to use and expand the set of responsibilities of LHWs to include the administration of vaccinations, particularly in the uncovered areas and poor segments.

Health officials ask anyone who visited the Klahanie neighborhood QFC [Quality Food Centers supermarket] or Klahanie Starbucks [coffee shop] in the Issaquah-area suburb to be aware of measles symptoms. A local person who recently visited Klahanie QFC and Klahanie Starbucks has been confirmed to be the 2nd area resident with measles in King County over the last few days.

Local public health officials reported today [30 Jan 2013] that they have learned of a newly confirmed case of measles in King County, an Issaquah area resident. This is the 2nd person with confirmed measles in King County since 25 Jan 2013. The newly diagnosed case of measles, a King County resident, was exposed to a contagious traveler at Sea-Tac Airport.

Before receiving the measles diagnosis, the local resident was in locations in the community where other people might have been exposed. Anyone who was at the following sites during the following times was possibly exposed to measles:

QFC; 4570 Klahanie Dr S, Issaquah:
- 23 Jan 2013 between 3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.
- 24 Jan 2013 between 3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.
- 25 Jan 2013 between 3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.
- 29 Jan 2013 between 12:00 p.m. - 2:30 p.m.

Starbucks; 4566 Klahanie Dr SE, Issaquah
- 26 Jan 2013 between 9:00 am -11:30 a.m.

If you were in these areas at the times above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick is between 30 Jan 2013 and 19 Feb 2013.

Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease caused by the measles virus. It is mainly spread through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes. Because most people in our area have immunity to measles through vaccination, the risk to the general public is low. However, people who were at the same locations at the same time as the contagious individuals should:
- Find out whether they have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously, and
- Call a health care provider promptly if they develop an illness with fever or illness with an unexplained rash.

The 1st confirmed measles case was a traveler who made a stop at Sea-Tac Airport on 18 Jan 2013. Persons who were in the same areas as this traveler at Sea-Tac Airport between 11:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. on 18 Jan 2013 were possibly exposed to measles. More information about exposure locations at Sea-Tac Airport is at http://1.usa.gov/SO0esu. Public Health has notified affected locations where community members may have been exposed.
