Researchers from the Emory Antibiotic Resistance Center describe the 1st strain of carbapenem-resistant, hypermucoviscous _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ exhibiting colistin heteroresistance and enhanced virulence isolated from a patient in the United States. The research is presented at ASM Microbe, the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, held from [7 to 11 Jun 2018], in Atlanta, Georgia.

"The problem of antibiotic resistance is becoming increasingly alarming. The combination of increased virulence and multidrug resistance makes the situation worse," said Dr David Weiss, director of the Emory Antibiotic Resistance Center.

The researchers showed that the _K. pneumoniae_ isolate was heteroresistant to the last resort antibiotic colistin. This means that a small subpopulation of cells showed resistance. Heteroresistance is more difficult to detect with standard antibiotic susceptibility tests in clinical microbiology labs, and this isolate was classified as susceptible to colistin by standard methods. This discrepancy is particularly important, as Weiss' lab has shown that such undetected colistin heteroresistance can cause antibiotic treatment failure in mice.

In a hospital in Hangzhou, China, a 2016 deadly outbreak of carbapenem-resistant, hypervirulent _K. pneumoniae_ was recently reported in Lancet Infectious Diseases. [ProMED-mail. Antibiotic-resistant klebsiella - China: (ZJ) fatal, hypervirulent strain, ICU 20170910.5307210.]

"The isolate we are studying is not nearly as virulent (able to cause disease) in a mouse model as the bacteria from China," said Dr Weiss. "However, finding the combination of antibiotic resistance and enhanced virulence from a clinical isolate in the United States (New York) is still alarming." The previously reported hypervirulent forms were largely antibiotic susceptible. Carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_, part of the carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) superbug family, is considered an urgent (top 3) threat by the CDC.

The researchers are urging more monitoring for this form of bacteria, which have the potential for increased virulence and may be especially worrisome in healthcare settings.

Jessie Wozniak, a microbiology and molecular genetics graduate student at Emory University School of Medicine, and her colleagues examined 265 isolates of carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ from the Emerging Infections Program's Multi-site Gram negative Surveillance Initiative, using a simple "string test".

"The string test is very low-tech," Wozniak says. "You take a loop, touch it to the bacterial colony, and pull back. The hypermucoviscous one looks like a string of cheese being pulled from a pizza." The stretchiness observed by the string test is a sign that the bacteria produce more capsule polysaccharide, and has been associated with enhanced virulence previously. Wozniak verified that the isolate was approximately 10 times more virulent in mice than other isolates of the same sequence type.

She also used whole-genome sequencing to discover that the US isolate carried several antibiotic resistance genes, along with a new arrangement of virulence genes, but not the same set seen in similar _K. pneumoniae_ isolates from Asian countries.

[Colistin (polymyxin E) is a cationic polypeptide that targets anionic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria, which leads to leakage of cell contents and cell death. Colistin is one of the last-resort antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, Gram negative bacterial infections. Resistance to colistin is associated with LPS modifications of the binding site, efflux pumps, and overexpression of outer membrane proteins (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00643/full). Heteroresistance, which denotes the presence of subpopulations of bacterial cells with higher levels of antibiotic resistance than those of the rest of the population in the same culture, may go undetected when traditional in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing is used. However, these colistin-resistant subpopulations may emerge in the patient during colistin therapy. Colistin heteroresistance has been previously described in clinical isolates of ESBL-producing _K. pneumoniae_ in an ICU outbreak (http://aac.asm.org/content/60/11/6837.full) and in carbapenemase-producing _K. pneumoniae_ (http://mbio.asm.org/content/9/2/e02448-17.full?utm_source=TrendMDmBio&utm_medium=TrendMDmBio&utm_campaign=trendmdalljournals_0). The above report now describes colistin heteroresistance in carbapenem-resistant, hypermucoviscous _K. pneumoniae_.

_K. pneumoniae_ is an enteric Gram negative bacillus that has been known to cause hospital-acquired infections and infections in debilitated or immunocompromised patients. However, a distinctive syndrome caused by _K. pneumoniae_ was 1st seen in Taiwanese patients in the 1980s (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7613255?dopt=Abstract). Cases have since been reported worldwide.

The syndrome is characterized by life-threatening community-acquired _K. pneumoniae_ infection in relatively healthy hosts that includes liver abscess and bacteremia complicated by the ability of the responsible _K. pneumoniae_ to spread hematogenously to the lungs, brain, meninges, eyes, prostate, bones, joints, and psoas (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2732457/). About half of the reported patients had diabetes mellitus, with the remainder displaying no apparent underlying diseases. The _K. pneumoniae_ strains were susceptible to many antibiotics, but mortality rates were as high as 10 per cent for liver abscess and 30-40 per cent for those with metastatic meningitis.

Colonies of the strains causing this illness were noted to be unusually mucoviscous with a positive "string test", defined as the formation of a mucoviscous string of over 5 mm in length when using a bacteriology inoculation loop to touch and stretch a colony grown overnight on an blood agar plate at 35 C [95 F] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685062/). The strains were called hypervirulent _K. pneumoniae_ or hvKP, and their capsular polysaccharide serotypes were found to be either K1 or K2. Whole genome sequencing indicated that the hypervirulent K1 isolates belonged to clonal complex 23 (CC23) that grouped into a distinct monophyletic clade, with global spread by multiple international transmissions (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26199326). The hvKP carried siderophores, which confer the ability to more efficiently acquire iron in iron poor environments. A large virulence plasmid, which encodes the siderophores and a regulator of the mucoid phenotype, was detected in all hvKP clonal lineages (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26199326). The latest development noted in the above report is the acquisition of the virulence plasmid by multidrug resistant hospital-associated ST11 _K. pneumoniae_.

Klebsiella have been known to develop multiple antimicrobial drug resistance, commonly due to production of beta-lactamases that destroy the class of beta-lactam antibiotics known as carbapenems, as well as all other beta-lactam antibiotics. These carbapenemases are referred to as KPCs -- that is, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases. Some multidrug resistant strains have also been found to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The genes that encode KPCs and ESBLs are plasmid-mediated, which readily facilitates horizontal gene transfer between bacteria. The genes that encode these beta-lactamases are often linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics. The principal reservoir for these organisms is the gastrointestinal tract, and spread occurs from there on the contaminated hands of healthcare workers and environment. - Mod.ML
