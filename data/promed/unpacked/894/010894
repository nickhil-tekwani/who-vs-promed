A bacterial canker which threatens to financially wipe out a New
Zealand-owned gold kiwifruit orchard in Italy may trigger an
assessment of the potential risks the disease would pose to orchards
in New Zealand.

An 84 hectare Newgold [variety] orchard in the Lazio region of Italy
has suffered a continuing outbreak of a bacterial disease, Opotiki
Packing and Coolstorage Ltd (Opac) said. The disease, commonly known
as "vine canker" had hit hardest gold cultivars, but this year [2010]
had also occurred in green cultivars. The whole of their Newgold
investment -- valued at USD 7.16 million in 2008 -- should be written
off, putting the company in the red. Managing director Craig Thompson
said: "It's potentially a quite significant risk to the whole Italian
industry."

New Zealand scientists had suggested a colder winter than normal
combined with a wetter spring than usual triggered a surge in
infections. The disease has never been identified in New Zealand. Mr
Thompson said his company had taken great care to ensure the bacteria
were not carried to New Zealand, with no tools or other equipment
brought back from Italy. The severity of this outbreak was such that
normal measures such as removing and burning infected vines have not
been sufficient to control it.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species) caused by
_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ was originally described in
Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain. Symptoms include
discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting,
stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse
and eventually death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool
temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in
spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to
occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected
to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including
animal and human activities) and infected planting material. Spread
with infected fruit cannot be excluded. Generally, disease management
of bacterial diseases may include cultural practices, crop rotation,
phytosanitation to prevent spread, and use of clean planting material
and resistant crop varieties, but specific control strategies for
kiwi canker are being developed. Chemical control (copper compounds,
antibiotics) is used in Japan, but resistant pathogen strains have
emerged.

In Italy, the disease was 1st reported in the north in 1992. It
appears to be spreading southward, and in 2009 it is reported to have
affected 25 percent of the Zespri Gold variety vines. Economic losses
for the country (including impact on trade) are estimated to have
reached 2 million euros. The pathogen has been included on the
quarantine alert list of the European Plant Protection Organisation
(EPPO) since kiwifruit is an important crop in several countries in
the region.

Other pathovars of _P. s._ are known to cause leaf specks, blights
and cankers on a range of different crops, including tomato, bean,
maize, mango, soybean, citrus and stone fruit.

Lazio is a region in west-central Italy including the provinces of
Frosinone, Latina, Rieti, Rome and Viterbo.
