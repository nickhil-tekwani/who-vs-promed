PENGUINS - SOUTH AFRICA
=======================
During the 'Apollo' oil spill some African Penguins, apparently healthy,
would suddenly go into spasms accompanied by continued breying. The
spasms could not be arrested and the birds were PTS. There have been a
number of cases since then.
Post Mortem results showed nothing out of the ordinary.
Last night (17:00) the first bird showing exactly the same signs was found
on a beach. i.e. Direct from the wild population. The bird was given valium
by the veterinarian which calmed it down. Bird was dehydrated, perspiring,
PCV 12. Bird was also given Iron Dextron, 20ml Ringers SC and placed on
hourly 50ml darrows. It died 08:00.
Has anybody had similar experiences with other birds?
Any ideas wrt the cause?
Any suggestions wrt treatment other than the above?
Thank you.
Ian.
