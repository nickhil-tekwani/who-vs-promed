Chagas disease is spreading in the Americas
-------------------------------------------
Chagas disease, caused by parasites transmitted to humans by blood-sucking insects, has been named "the new AIDS of the Americas" in a lengthy editorial published in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases.

The authors, several of whom are tropical disease experts from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, argue that the dangerous spread of Chagas through this hemisphere somewhat resembles the early spread of H.I.V. [human immunodeficiency virus infection].

Chagas is also known as American trypanosomiasis, because the bugs carry single-celled parasites called trypanosomes. (Their best-known relative, spread by tsetse flies in Africa, causes sleeping sickness.) Like AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome], the authors say, Chagas disease has a long incubation time and is hard or impossible to cure. Chagas infects up to 8 million people in the hemisphere, mostly in Bolivia, Mexico, Colombia and Central America. But more than 300 000 of the infected live in the United States, many of them immigrants.

The disease can be transmitted from mother to child or by blood transfusion. About a quarter of its victims eventually will develop enlarged hearts or intestines, which can fail or burst, causing sudden death. Treatment involves harsh drugs taken for up to 3 months and works only if the disease is caught early. The drugs are not as expensive as AIDS drugs, but there are shortages in poor countries. Because it is a disease of the poor, little money is spent on finding new treatments.

"Both diseases are highly stigmatizing," the editorial noted. Immigrants may not get medical treatment, making Chagas more likely to spread.

[The article refers to an editorial: Hotez1 PJ et al. Chagas Disease: The New HIV/AIDS of the Americas- PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2012; 6(5): e1498. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001498

It is important to point out that the modes of transmission are different between HIV and Chagas, and thus the epidemiology is much different. It is now known that Chagas is transmitted by food and from mother to child, besides the transmission by triatomine bugs, blood transfusions and organ transplants. To control and combat Chagas, strategies to identify pregnant women with Chagas need to be developed so the mother to child transmission is stopped, and more research needs to be done to quantify the risk from foodborne transmission. - Mod.
