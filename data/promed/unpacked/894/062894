Present situation of _Erwinia amylovora_ in Switzerland
-------------------------------------------------------
Fire blight (FB) ([caused by _Erwinia amylovora_ - EPPO A2 quarantine
pest) [was discovered in Switzerland in 1989, in the eastern part of the
country (Solothurn and Zürich cantons), [and has ... spread in ... eastern
Switzerland [with increased ... incidence. In 1999, isolated outbreaks
were observed for the first time in ... western [Switzerland (cantons of
Vaud, Jura, Fribourg, Neuchatel, Geneva and Ticino), mainly on ornamentals
(_Cotoneaster salicifolius_) and also in a few commercial fruit orchards.

2000 was a very favourable year for FB ... and severe attacks were noted in
the German-speaking part of Switerland, [particlarly in ... apple orchards
in Thurgau. In the French-speaking part and Ticino, FB ... spread (65
communes), ... and only the Valais canton remained free from Fb (Cazelles &
Hasler, 2001).

... As of mid-August, 2001 ... in French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino
only a few outbreaks were observed on ornamental ... [cotoneaster. [Fruit
trees in 8 communes located in 3 cantons were [infected (1 in Neuchatel,

1 in Ticino and 6 in Vaud). ...[No commercial orchards [were found [to
be infected in 2001.

FB severely [affected fruit trees in the [German-speaking part of
Switzerland. [Affected cantons and disease incidence per commune were:
Aargau (11), Appenzell Innerrhoden (4), Appenzell Ausserrhoden (20), Bern
(7), Basel (2), Luzern (20), St Gallen (46), Schaffhausen, Schwyz (2),
Thurgau (64) and Zürich (40). [In Thurgau canton, about 30 orchards were
infected, and 2 showed high levels of infection. In [St Gallen canton, 2
of 6 ... orchards ... were severely infected. Infected fruit trees
[were... found in several cantons of the eastern part. [Numerous
_Cotoneaster dammeri_ and _Crataegus_ sp. were infected.

Measures ... taken to prevent further [disease spread [include
...destruction of ornamental plants and [application of ... copper
compounds [has been recommended in orchards where a high risk of infection
is expected. Apparently, no [FB ... has been reported from nurseries in 2001.

The situation of FB ... in Switzerland can be described as follows:
Present, mainly in the German-speaking part of the country, but isolated
outbreaks have been found since 1999 in French-speaking cantons (except
Valais) and in Ticino.

[Ea can cause severe losses primarily in apple and pear. Types of loss
include (1) death or severe damage to trees in the nursery; (2) death of
young trees in the orchard; (3) delay of bearing in young trees due to
frequent blighting of shoots and limbs; (4) loss of limbs or entire trees
in older plantings as the result of girdling by fire blight cankers; and
(5) partial loss of the crop by the blighting of the blossoms and young
fruits.

The bacterium has a very extensive host range which includes other pome
fruits (e.g. quince) and shrubs and trees. Disease management involves use
of resistant cultivars, good cultural practices, strict sanitation and
close control of antibiotic, pesticide and fertilizer applications.
Biocontrol of the disease using antagonistic bacteria may offer some degree
of control.
