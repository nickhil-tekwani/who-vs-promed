A malaria outbreak has killed 15 people in North Horr in one week, with 129 others infected.

Marsabit County Director of Health Dr Boru Okotu said there were 186 people with similar symptoms, with 136 testing positive. Dr Okotu said that even though Marsabit county is considered a low-risk malaria zone, the wards affected have been experiencing heavy rains from July 2017, providing a fertile ground for mosquito breeding.

Affected areas include Konye, Kubi Adhi, Diid Gole, Gorwole and Daka Baricha, all of them in the North Horr sub-County.

Marsabit governor, Mohamud Mohamed Ali, has dispatched health officers in the 3 wards -- Illeret, Dukana and North Horr -- to provide relief to affected residents.
