"One victim is already dead and 4 are under medical treatment..."
An elderly couple were hurriedly sent to Pusan National University Hospital
early Saturday morning after showing symptoms of anthrax. The two had eaten
beef from a cow found dead in a swamp.
This recent incident brings the number of those suspected of having
contracted anthrax to 5, the Changnyong County Public Health Centre said.
One victim is already dead and 4 are under medical treatment. The health
centre referred to the patients simply as 56-year-old S. & his wife Y., 49.
The two were brought to the hospital at around 0400 (local time) after
blisters were noticed on the hands. They had eaten beef provided by a
resident of Machon-ri, Changnyong County. Doctors from the centre found the
blisters while conducting medical check-ups of 22 local residents who
consumed the beef of a cow which was found dead on 30 Jun 2000.
The medical authorities disinfected the kitchen utensils and houses in the
village to prevent further spread of the disease. Changnyong Police
meanwhile booked without physical detention the owner of the cow, who had
distributed the meat in violation of health and safety laws.
Quarantine authorities Sat 8 Jul 2000 inoculated cows in areas near
Changnyong, South Kyongsang Province, against anthrax since the number of
victims is increasing. Quarantine officials of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry also sampled beef and soil in the area where the anthrax cases
occurred and took measures to prevent cows and other livestock from being
taken out of the region.

[Korea has not reported any anthrax cases since 1995. This "swamp" cow
suggests that cases may have been occurring unofficially in the meanwhile
with the additional possibility that this swamp was a dumping ground for
dead animals. - Mod. MHJ]
