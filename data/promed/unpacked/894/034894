Measles transmission during 2012 season lower than in 2011 and 2010
------------------------------------------------------------
The latest European monthly measles monitoring shows that during the period 1 Jan to 28 Feb 2012, 1447 cases of measles were reported by the 29 contributing EU [European Union] and EEA [European Economic Area] countries. This number is considerably lower than the same 2 months of 2011 (5731 cases) and 2010 (5752 cases).

Fewer outbreaks have been detected in EU Member States in 2012 compared to the same period last year, with the exception of 3 countries: the UK, Romania and Spain. In the neighbouring Ukraine, as of 24 Apr 2012, 8082 cases of measles were recorded in 6 districts. Romania is the only European country exceeding one case per 100 000 population in the reporting period and accounted for 56 percent of all cases. Twelve countries reported zero cases in January and February [2012].

Measles is a highly infectious and potentially fatal disease which can be prevented by a safe and effective vaccine. When given in two doses, at least 98 percent of vaccine recipients develop life-long protective immunity against the disease. As the measles virus only infects humans, the disease could be eradicated. The countries in the European Region of the World Health Organization, which includes all EU and EEA/EFTA countries, have committed to eliminate measles transmission by 2015. Elimination of measles requires sustained vaccination coverage above 95 percent with 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine.

[The following supplementary background information has been extracted from from the ECDC web-site: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/1205-SUR-Measles-monthly-monitoring.pdf:

"It is generally believed that the human measles virus evolved from a zoonotic virus in communities where humans lived in close contact with cattle and that it was established as an endemic human disease about 5000 to 10 000 years ago in the Middle Eastern river valley civilisations. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a more recent divergence from cattle rinderpest virus in the 11th or 12th century. Measles virus is related to canine distemper virus. Measles is an antigenically stable virus and infection confers lifelong immunity. There is just one measles serotype and 23 identified genotypes which can be used to track transmission. The genetic difference between these lineages is small, and changes in the genotypes have no practical influence on the protective efficacy of the measles vaccines currently in use. Today's measles vaccines are based on viruses attenuated decades ago.

Measles was an expected life event in the pre-vaccine era. References to measles can be found as far back as the 7th century A.D. In the 10th century, a Persian physician and philosopher known in the West as Rhazes described measles as being 'more dreaded than smallpox'. The clinical manifestations of measles were described by the English physician Thomas Sydenham in the 17th century. The 1st major advance in the study of measles was in 1846 when Danish doctor Peter Parnum observed and carefully described a measles outbreak in the Faroe Islands. Parnum confirmed the infectiousness of measles, defined the incubation period of 2 weeks, and noted that individuals became immune after having had the disease. In 1954, Enders and Peebles isolated the virus and succeeded in growing it in tissue cultures. Serial passage of the virus through tissue culture reduced its virulence for humans, and in 1963 the 1st live, attenuated vaccine was licensed for use. Subsequently in 1971, a combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) as well as a combined measles and rubella vaccine (MR) were licensed. Since measles vaccine became available, the number of measles cases dropped by 99 percent.

When a person becomes infected with the measles virus, there is a cell-mediated immune response followed by an antibody-mediated response at the time of the rash. Measles antibody titres may diminish over time but measles virus-specific cellular immunity is thought to persist. Vaccine-induced immunity lasts at least several decades, if not longer. Decreasing antibody concentrations do not necessarily mean a complete loss of protective immunity, because a secondary immune response usually develops after re-exposure to measles virus, with a rapid rise in antibody titres without overt clinical disease.

Young infants are usually protected against measles until 6-9 months of age due to passively acquired maternal antibodies. The protection of maternal antibodies may sometimes be insufficient if the infectious dose is large enough and, as a result, infants as young as 3-4 months old can contract measles. The antibody levels are usually higher after natural measles infection than after measles vaccination. Infants in non-endemic countries born to mothers who have been vaccinated against measles and have never been exposed to circulating measles virus may receive less maternal antibodies and therefore lose protection against measles earlier than infants born to mothers with a history of measles disease.

Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the individual components are similar when MCVs (measles-containing vaccines) are administered as combined products or simultaneously at different anatomical sites with other vaccines, such as diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, poliovirus vaccines, varicella vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, or heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine." - Mod.CP]

Outbreak of measles in Lipetskaya Oblast reported
------------------------------------------
The Department of Health Administration of Lipetsk Oblast announced on 11 May 2012 that several cases of measles had been diagnosed in the Gryazi area. "Measles is a dangerous viral disease that has been absent in the Lipetsk region since the late 90s", the report stated. Protection from the disease can be achieved by vaccination. Doctors recommmend that inhabitants of the region shold attend their local clinic to be vaccinated. Children should be vaccinated in their 1st year, and at 6 years. Adults in the age range 18 to 35 who are uncertain of their vaccination status should also seek vaccination.

Measles is highly infectious and can probably be contracted by air-borne transmission perhaps even in the course of conversation with an infected individual. Complications as a result of measles virus infection can be very serious; including blindness, otitis media, and bronchopneumonia.

Measles can be contracted at any age in unvaccinated individuals. Symptoms 1st appear 7 to 14 days following exposure. The 1st symptoms are similar to those of the common cold -- fever, intoxication, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. After 24 hours a characteristic body rash in the form of red spots develops. If there is the slightest suspicion of measles infection, medical attention should be sought immediately.

Measles Outbreak Among Foreign Job-Seekers
---------------------------------------
Several cases of measles have been reported among foreign job-seekers and their children since January [2012], the Health Ministry reported Wednesday [9 May 2012]. Seven foreign citizens living in Tel Aviv were diagnosed with measles in the past week, 6 of them babies who required hospital care.

The Ministry has begun a campaign to vaccinate the young children of foreign job-seekers and their parents. Babies as young as 6 months will be given the vaccine in hopes of preventing the spread of the illness.

The Minister of Health denies existence of outbreak of measles in Venezuela
-------------------------------------------------
The Venezuelan Minister for Health, Eugenia Sader, stated that currently there is no outbreak of measles in the country, despite rumours to the contrary [See Measles update 2012 (19) 20120506.1124592, parts 4 & 5]. She explained that the person who traveled to Lebanon with his family developed a fever on the return flight, but no other symptoms. The Minster stated that: "This passenger had previously been in contact with a person who had measles."

The Minister observed that the Pan American Health Organisation had declared Venezuela free of measles and rubella as far back as 2007 on the basis of the program of free vaccination of the entire population, that contrasted with the situation then pertaining in some European countries.

Eugenia Sader stated that the febrile passenger had sought treatment at a private clinic where he was administered antibiotics and his clinical samples were sent to the National Institute of Hygiene for diagnostic testing. "A positive [measles diagnosis] was confirmed on 30 Apr 2012 and on 01 May 2012 the 160 people who had travelled on the same flight were contcted by the epidemiological surveillance team.

The Minister reiterated that there is no risk for the general population, since this is an imported case, not an indigenous case of measles. She recalled that last year in Venzuela 18 million people had been vaccinated.

[ProMED-mail welcomes this clarification of previous confusing reports..It would seem, however, that the Venezuelan traveller who contracted measles in Lebanon was a person not covered by the nation's vaccination programme. - Mod.CP]
