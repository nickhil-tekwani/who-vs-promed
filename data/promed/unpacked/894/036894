Joint DOI and USDA News Release: Avian Influenza Tests Complete On Wild
Green-Winged Teals In Illinois
The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior today announced final test
results, which confirm that a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus
was found in samples collected last month [September 2006] from wild
Green-winged Teals in Illinois. LPAI has been detected several times in
wild birds in North America and poses no risk to human health.
The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the
presence of H6N2 through virus isolation in a pool of 5 samples of the 11
samples collected from wild Green-winged Teals in the Rice Lake
Conservation Area of Fulton County, Illinois. Initial screening results
announced on 29 Sep indicated that H5 and N1 subtypes might be present in
the collected samples, but further testing was necessary to confirm the H
and N subtypes as well as pathogenicity.
The initial rapid screening tests are highly sensitive and can detect
active and inactive viruses in samples. Varieties of this test can screen
for the presence of all strains of avian influenza virus. Because these
rapid screening tests are highly sensitive, it is not uncommon to have
positive results for a specific subtype on the initial screen test and yet
not be able to isolate a virus of that subtype. This was the case for these
samples, which tested as a weak positive for both H5 and N1 in the initial
screen tests. During confirmatory testing, H5 and N1 subtypes were not
found but instead H6 and N2, confirming that the virus is LPAI.
Low pathogenic strains of avian influenza occur naturally in wild birds and
typically cause only minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in
birds. These strains are common in the U.S. and around the world. Low
pathogenic avian influenza viruses are very different from the more severe
highly pathogenic H5N1 circulating in parts of Asia, Europe and Africa.
Highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza spread rapidly and are often
fatal to chickens and turkeys.
The Departments of Agriculture and Interior are working collaboratively
with States and academic institutions to sample wild birds throughout the
United States for the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
