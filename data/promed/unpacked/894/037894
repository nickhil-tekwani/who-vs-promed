[1] Cholera - West and Central Africa

UNICEF is calling for a redoubling of efforts to combat cholera
outbreaks that are claiming lives and affecting large numbers of
people across West and Central Africa.

2011 has seen more than 85 000 reported cases of cholera, resulting in
2466 deaths. The size and scale of the outbreaks mean the region is
facing one of the biggest epidemics in its history. In addition, case
fatality rates (CFR) are unacceptably high, ranging from 2.3 percent
to 4.7 percent and can reach much higher levels at district level in
many countries (ranging from 1 percent to 22 percent in Cameroon for
example). Children are more vulnerable to cholera, as they dehydrate
faster, and malnourished children are especially at risk.

The most significant increases in 2011 are in Chad, Cameroon, and in
western Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In addition there are
still challenges with getting access, ensuring staff presence in
medical facilities, and establishing surveillance systems to monitor
cases and numbers in parts of Northeastern DRC.

There are 3 major cross border cholera epidemic outbreaks in West and
Central Africa: the Lake Chad Basin (Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria, and
Niger), the West Congo Basin (DRC, Congo, and the Central African
Republic), and Lake Tanganyika (DRC and Burundi). Smaller cholera
epidemics in Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, and Togo
are under control.

UNICEF calls upon governments to coordinate the preparation and
response not only within their borders, but to ensure close
collaboration with neighbouring countries. Cross-border coordination
has to be encouraged at all levels, from the district to the national
level.

A cross-border epidemiological study covering the Lake Chad Basin
(Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, and Niger) was initiated by UNICEF in 2010,
and is now in its 2nd phase. The study provides critical evidence for
informing cholera prevention and response interventions, which have to
be coordinated across borders. Cross-border coordination between teams
in Kinshasa and Brazzaville has also been initiated for the more
recent cholera outbreak in the West Congo Basin.

Access rates to water and sanitation in West and Central Africa are
among the lowest in the world. Out of 24 countries in the region, not
a single one is on track to meet the MDG [UN Millennium Development
Goal] target for sanitation. This is the underlying cause for cholera
outbreaks in West and Central Africa. Although measures for cholera
response can help contain the spread of the disease and reduce the
number of fatalities, it would be much more effective if the
underlying cause of this 'poor man's disease' is tackled.

[2] Cholera - Somalia (Mogadishu)
Date: Mon 10 Oct 2011

Cholera and severe malnutrition have killed 32 more children in
Somalia as the conflict-plagued nation struggles against drought and
famine, Press TV reported. The victims died on Monday morning [10 Oct
2011] in Mogadishu's northern district of Karan. More than 117
children, suffering from cholera and waterborne diseases, were also
taken to hospitals, especially Banadir hospital in southern Mogadishu,
for medical treatment.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned in a
statement in late September 2011 that, "The situation in Somalia
remains highly critical. Hundreds of thousands of Somalis are still
displaced from their homes in search of security and food."

The Geneva-based humanitarian institution added, "Although
humanitarian aid has started to reach the drought- and
conflict-affected people, many are still struggling to survive."

"Much of the livestock has been decimated and there is no hope for an
improvement in the situation until the next harvest in December," it
added.

Meanwhile, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) has said that 4 million Somalis are in crisis, with some 750
000 at risk of dying in the next 4 months.

The UN body added it is also feared that the rains will also raise the
risk of diseases. "The onset of rains anticipated in October could
fuel the spread of cholera, measles, and malaria, thereby leading to
more deaths in a population already weakened by conflict and famine,"
OCHA noted.

[3] Cholera - Congo DR, Congo

(IRIN) report [edited]

There has been an increase in the number of cholera cases and deaths
in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo where an outbreak has
been ongoing since March 2011, say humanitarian agencies. At least
6910 cases and 384 deaths had been reported as of 3 Oct 2011,
according to a report by the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), compared with a total of 3896 cases and
some 265 deaths by 20 Jul 2011.

"We cannot know the exact cause of the disease but we know that it has
spread from one person to the other due to poor hygiene," said
Laurence Sailly, the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) assistant medical
coordinator.

The cholera outbreak was first reported in March 2011 in the
northeastern province of Orientale before spreading along the River
Congo to the capital Kinshasa.

Neighboring Republic of Congo has also recorded cholera deaths in an
outbreak that began in June 2011, according to officials. The
outbreak, which had led to about 20 deaths as of late August 2011, is
thought to have spread from the DRC, with most cases reported along
the Congo River, which forms the border between the countries.

[The continent of Africa continues to be a prime location for cholera.
Although the disease has been referred to as "Asiatic cholera" in
deference to the disease's continent of origin, as many as 95 percent
of the yearly burden of cases now occurs in Africa. - Mod.LL]
