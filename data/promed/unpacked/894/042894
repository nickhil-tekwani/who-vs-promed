Egyptian health authorities have confirmed an additional human case of H5N1 avian influenza [AI] in a 2-year-old child from Sohag [Suhaj] governorate, according to a Forbes report (computer translated).

The report notes the child was suffering from fever, cough and sore throat after exposure to birds. The toddler was admitted at a hospital in Sohag on Thursday [4 Dec 2014] and given the drug Tamiflu. H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed by the central laboratory of the Ministry of Health, and the child is currently in stable condition. This is the 15th H5N1 AI case reported by the Health Ministry in 2014.

Numerous health warnings have been issued by the Egyptian Ministry of Health in light of the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak to include the risks of trading in live birds, increasing awareness of avian influenza in rural districts and starting bird vaccination campaigns to slow the spread of the disease.

In Minya governorate, where the bulk of the human AI cases have been reported since November 2014, special ambulance crews dedicated to transporting and dealing with patients with suspected bird flu have been established.

[According to the WHO, the overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses is the following: Whenever influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases are possible, especially in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infections remain rare, and these influenza A(H5N1) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains low.

An epidemiological curve of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in humans by reporting country and month of onset is available at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_October14.pdf?ua=1. This reveals an overall decline in case numbers, Egypt excepted. - Mod.CP
