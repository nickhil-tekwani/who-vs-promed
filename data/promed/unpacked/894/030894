Bolivia declared a health alert Tuesday [24 Aug 2010] in northern La
Paz department after a 14-year-old boy died from bubonic plague, the
Health Ministry said.

An emergency plan will "increase health controls and prevention
programs... in communities where an increase of rodents and fleas has
been reported," regional Health Minister Rene Barrientos said.

So far, 8 cases of bubonic plague, including the death of the
teenager, have been reported in Apolo, a town with 5000 inhabitants
bordering Peru, where 3 people have died after an outbreak of plague
in the past 2 months.

The last outbreak of bubonic plague in northern Peru was in 1994,
which killed 35 people and infected over 1100 others.

[Indeed, the area of Bolivia where the _Yersinia pestis_ outbreak is
occurring is adjacent to eastern Peru. However, the La Libertad area
where the Peruvian cases occurred (see ProMED-mail Plague - Peru
(04): (LL) 20100814.2808) is on the north western side of the
country. - Mod.LL]
