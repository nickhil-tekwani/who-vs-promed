Human visceral leishmanaisis due to _L. martiniquensis_ in Thailand
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Since 1996, there have been several case reports of autochthonous visceral leishmaniasis in Thailand. Here we report a case in a 52-year-old Thai male from northern Thailand, who presented with subacute fever, huge splenomegaly and pancytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration revealed numerous amastigotes within macrophages. Isolation of _Leishmania_ LSCM1 into culture and DNA sequence analysis (ribosomal RNA ITS-1 and large subunit of RNA polymerase II) revealed the parasites to be members of the _Leishmania enriettii_ complex, and apparently identical to _L. martiniquensis_ previously reported from the Caribbean island of Martinique. This is the 1st report of visceral leishmaniasis caused by _L. martiniquensis_ from the region. Moreover, the majority of parasites previously identified as "_L. siamensis_" also appear to be _L. martiniquensis_.

[The paper is: Pothirat T et al. First Isolation of Leishmania from Northern Thailand: Case Report, Identification as Leishmania martiniquensis and Phylogenetic Position within the Leishmania enriettii Complex. PLoS Negl Trop Dis: 4 Dec 2014 DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003339.

The report underlines the importance of performing genotyping of _Leishmania_.

The are speculations that sand flies may not be the only vector of _Leishmania_, and especially biting midges have been suspected (Seblova V et al. Development of Leishmania parasites in Culicoides nubeculosus (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) and implications for screening vector competence. J Med Entomol. 2012;49:967-70).

If biting midges were the vector it could explain why a new subspecies of _Leishmania_ is found. - Mod.EP]

[From the Discussion: "Although the recorded history of illness was only 2 weeks, it was apparent that the patient had endured a longer period of illness because he looked chronically ill and had hypoalbuminemia (1.9 g/dL). The incubation period of VL typically varies from 2 months to longer than a year, so the infection can be asymptomatic for a long period." Paper received 28 Aug 2014. - Mod.JW
