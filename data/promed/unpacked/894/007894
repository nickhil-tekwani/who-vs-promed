[_Perkinsus_ are protozoans widespread in molluscs around the world. _Perkinsus olseni_ is a parasite of the abalone _Haliotis rubra_ in the South of Australia. _P. olseni_ was blamed for severe mortalities in _Haliotis laevigata_ (O'Donoghue et al. 1991; Goggin and Lester 1995) and was detected in the pearl oyster _Pinctada maxima_. This is the 1st report of _P. olseni_ in small giant clams, but there are previous reports of infections with _P. andrewsi_.
