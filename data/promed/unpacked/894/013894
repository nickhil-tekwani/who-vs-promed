A 2nd Onondaga County resident has been diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] and is recovering, the county health department announced today. The county said it was notified on 29 Oct 2015 by the state health department that an adult resident of the Town of Clay was diagnosed with the mosquitoborne virus. Lab results confirmed the diagnosis today [5 Nov 2015].

The patient was hospitalized in early September 2015, sent home in a stable condition, and is doing well, said Dr Indu Gupta, the county's health commissioner. She did not release any other information about the patient.

Gupta said it took a long time to confirm the EEE diagnosis because doctors initially thought the patient had bacterial meningitis, which was ruled out by tests. They then suspected the patient had viral meningitis, which was [also] ruled out by tests. A special blood test done by the state Health Department lab in Albany confirmed the EEE diagnosis, she said.

There is no longer a risk of mosquitoborne diseases this late in the season, according to the department.

A Salina man and a resident of Albion in Oswego County died of EEE in September 2015. There have been 7 reported EEE deaths in Central New York since 1971.

EEE, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, is a rare but potentially deadly viral infection. It can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain.

[This report is a follow-up to an earlier ProMED-mail report (archive no. 20151004.3689311) when this patient was hospitalized in September 2015. It is good to learn that the patient is doing well. Neurological sequelae following severe EEE virus infections are fairly common, but not reported for this case. There have been several equine EEE cases so far in 2015 in New York State as well as several human cases. The state Health Department stated that there was no longer any risk of additional EEE virus infections this late in the season, doubtless due to occurrence of killing frosts that have halted vector mosquito activity for the year.
