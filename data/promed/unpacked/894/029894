A further comment on rabies transmission by organ transplantation
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[This thread has been rejoined temporarily to enable Dr Burkhard Reike to
add an argument which has not arisen in the preceding discussion. - Mod.CP]
For several reasons, predominantly travel to a malaria-endemic country in
the preceding year, the organ donor would have been disqualified as a blood
donor according to German legislation. Then how could she qualify as an
organ donor, given the fact that organ recipients, unlike blood recipients,
are immunosuppressed, usually?
Rabies is just one risk -- dramatic but rare -- in this context.
Regulations by the Federal Chamber of Physicians furthermore stipulate a
special procedure for substance abusers -- after all the cause of death of
the donor.
A considerable legal aftermath can be anticipated.
