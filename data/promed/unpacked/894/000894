A deadly bacterial strain that attacks dogs in animal shelters has
struck for a 3rd time, and a shelter medicine expert credits quick
countermeasures for preventing more dogs from dying.

The latest outbreak was at the Humane Animal Welfare Society of
Waukesha County (<http://www.hawspets.org/>), 10 miles (16 km) west
of Milwaukee, where 7 dogs died over 10 days and 2 others became ill,
prompting the shelter to stop taking dogs in or adopting them out.

The Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison said Friday
[2 May 2008] that the dogs had the strain of bacteria --
_Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus_ -- that rapidly attacks the
respiratory system, although at least one of the 3 dogs the lab
examined also had parainfluenza virus. More tests were being done.

The case is just the 3rd documented outbreak of the illness that
causes dogs to become lethargic and feverish and then invades the
respiratory system, said Kate Hurley, director at the Kort Shelter
Medicine Program at the University of California-Davis
(<http://www.sheltermedicine.com>.)

One good thing is that the illness has been limited to shelters, and
only rarely occurred there, she said. "People's pet animals are
really at minimal risk," she said. "Even within shelters this is very rare."

The 1st outbreak was at a Las Vegas shelter where as many as a dozen
dogs a day had been dying in late 2006 until the illness was
diagnosed in February 2007. "The staff estimated that over 1000 dogs
had died with this bleeding from the nose and mouth and acute
respiratory disease that is characteristic of this," Hurley said.

The 2nd outbreak was last February [2008] in a Miami shelter where
about a dozen dogs died.

"It doesn't seem to have been able to escape from a shelter or a
greyhound kennel type of environment and spread into communities,"
Hurley said, "and it may be because the disease course is just so
rapid. Once they are symptomatic, they tend to go downhill very
rapidly and maybe there just hasn't been time for it to spread."

The exact mode by which the disease spreads isn't known, she said.
"It does seem to be highly contagious," she said. "It's possible that
it's airborne within a facility or it's spread on caretakers' feet
and on objects or on common surfaces," Hurley said.

It has not occurred in places such as dog day-care facilities, she said.

"It may be that there is some other compromise with stray animals
coming together in shelters with a poor vaccine history that
contributes to susceptibility to this kind of outbreak," Hurley said.

"Or it just may be luck that it hasn't struck in a doggy day care or
boarding type facility," she added. "The fact is we don't know
everything about this disease yet. But certainly it's not spreading
dramatically and it's not widespread in the United States."

The Waukesha case shows the value of recognizing the disease as soon
as a dog dies and then treating other dogs with antibiotics before
they start showing symptoms. "That's exactly what we recommended to
the shelter in Waukesha," Hurley said. "When we get on top of it
really quickly, then it's been a lot easier to get the outbreak under
control, so that's good news."

Lynn Olenik, executive director at the Waukesha County shelter, said
Friday [2 May 2008] that the 2 other dogs that showed early signs
responded to antibiotics and were expected to survive. No other dogs
or other animals at the shelter seem to be affected.

The bacterial strain is becoming better known among shelters and
veterinarians, according to Hurley. Still, "I think there's a number
of veterinarians and shelters who aren't aware of this because it's
so new and it's not widespread."

She recommended keeping dogs vaccinated for other canine respiratory
diseases and in good health to reduce chances of getting the disease.
Also, "keep your animal out of a shelter by making sure that it has 2
kinds of identification," she said. That way, if it winds up at the
shelter, it can be quickly identified and sent back home.

[Most often _Streptococcus equi_ is associated with horses. However,
this particular subspecies has been found in horses, dogs, people,
and other animals. In dogs it appears to be very virulent. Prompt
treatment is essential but no guarantee of survival. - Mod.TG]
