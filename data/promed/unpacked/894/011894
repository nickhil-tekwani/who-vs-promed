A British tourist, who had been travelling in the country [India] in 2003,
died in the United Kingdom from an infection hitherto unknown in India. The
matter came to light when the British High Commission informed the health
ministry that a 53 year old citizen had died in December 2003 from
legionnaire's disease.
This sent alarm signals ringing in the Union health ministry, as he had
come to India in November 2003, and had visited Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, and
Goa. Though he died in December 2003, the Union health ministry found out
about his death only last week. Immediately, the NICD was asked to send
teams to collect water samples from the places he had stayed in the 4 cities.
According to the itinerary sent by the High Commission, the tourist had
arrived in Delhi in the last week of November 2003. He then traveled to
Jaipur, then returned to Delhi, before going on to Agra. After seeing the
Taj Mahal, he went to Goa, by air, from Delhi. During each of his stays in
Delhi, he stayed at the Marriott hotel in Saket. He went back to the United
Kingdom on 5 Dec 2003 and died 2 days later. No previous occurrence of
legionnaire's disease has been found in India.

[This report claims that the case was the first acquired in India, but that
appears not to be the case. As discussed in several of the postings listed
below, other cases have been acquired in Eastern Asia, and in India,
specifically. There is no real reason why it should not exist there, and be
found, if it is looked for. - Mod.LL]
