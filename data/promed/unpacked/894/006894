A local [Ruidoso, NM] case of feline plague was reported this week
[10-14 Sep 2007] by Dr. Amanda Favis, a veterinarian with the Ruidoso
Animal Clinic.
On 6 Sep [2007], a cat was admitted to the clinic on Sudderth Drive
with a 1-week history of depression and a decreased appetite, she
said. Examination revealed that the animal was running a high fever
and showed an enlarged lymph node in the neck.
The attending veterinarian obtained fluid from the [enlarged] lymph
node and sent a sample to the New Mexico State Veterinary Diagnostic
Laboratory, Favis said. Test results were positive for plague. The
cat was started on the appropriate antibiotics and is recovering well
from her illness.
"It is important for all animal owners in New Mexico to be aware of
the risk of plague in our environment and the possibility of
infection in household pets," Favis said. "Plague is a bacterium most
commonly infecting rodents and rabbits, and is spread primarily by
infected fleas. Cats can be infected with plague by eating an
infected animal, being bitten by an infected flea, or by inhaling the
bacteria. Infection in dogs is very rare, because of an inherent
resistance to the bacteria."
Cats bitten by an infected flea or who eat an infected animal
typically will develop signs of illness within one to 6 days, Favis said.
Signs of plague in a cat include lack of appetite, fever, depression,
swelling in the neck region, draining abscesses, difficulty
breathing, and coughing.
Plague may develop in cats in 3 forms, she said. The most common and
most treatable form is bubonic plague, which results in swelling of
lymph nodes in the neck. Less common but more dangerous forms include
pneumonic plague, which involves respiratory infection, and
septicemic plague, which is an infection of the blood, Favis said.
Plague season in New Mexico includes spring, summer, and early
autumn, when above-freezing temperatures allow the flea population to
thrive, she said.
"The best way to protect your cat during this period is to utilize
flea control," the veterinarian said. "Plague can be transmitted to
humans by infected pets and the bite of an infected flea.
"Pets can transmit the bacteria to humans through human contact with
infected fluids or tissue, such as ruptured abscess and bite wounds,
handling of sick or dead infected animals, and, in pneumonic plague,
via respiratory secretions, although this is very rare and has never
happened in New Mexico."
If plague is suspected in any animal, immediate veterinary care
should be sought to achieve a diagnosis and receive treatment, Favis said.

The causative bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ is transmitted to people
through fleabite and direct contact with infected animals. Each
rodent species is host to one or more species of fleas which, when
infected, are carriers. These fleas generally do not infest other
animals unless their natural hosts are unavailable.
Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas.
They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially
cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea
treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some
products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for
an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your
veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and
puppies, even resulting in fatalities. - Mod.TG]
