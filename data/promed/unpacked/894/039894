Cyprus to kill 4000 animals to check brucellosis outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------
By the end of the year [2002] 4000 animals will be slaughtered in Cyprus in
an effort to stop the spread of brucellosis, a highly contagious cattle and
livestock disease. According to the local Sunday Mail newspaper, the
Cypriot government is forced to slaughter the animals, as at least 25 per
cent of the herd have been found to carry brucella.
Over the past 3 to 4 years, cases of brucellosis have been on the rise in
the island. State vets attributed the worsening situation to uncontrollable
livestock trading between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot farmers. They
said many of the traders were transporting animals from one area to another
without first receiving veterinary services approval or a clean bill of
health for the animals, an illegal practice.
Brucellosis causes abortion in cattle and livestock. Infected animals must
be slaughtered to contain the spread of the disease. However, the meat and
milk of the infected animals are not contaminated and [are] safe for human
consumption, according to local experts.
