Emu dies of EEE in Alstead
--------------------------
An emu, which died late this week from eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in
Alstead shows that for the 1st time the disease has spread to the south
west corner of the Granite State [New Hampshire, USA].

Until now most of the 59 communities that have reported positive tests for
EEE were located in the central or south east portions of the state, but
the fact that it has shown up in the Alstead area has shown state health
officials that the disease is likely being spread by birds (mosquitoes have
a range of just 3 miles [4.8 km]).

Mosquito traps will now be set up in Alstead beginning next week [week of
28 Sep 2009].

So far this season [2009], a llama and an alpaca in Candia have died from
EEE, as well as 2 horses, 1 in Henniker and 1 in Bow.

A 3 year old girl from Candia, who was diagnosed with EEE 3 weeks ago, is
recovering at home after a battle with the disease.

[The eastern equine encephalitis virus has a complex life cycle involving
birds and a specific type of mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, which lives in
acid water swamps. These mosquitoes feed only on birds; they do not
normally feed on humans or other mammals. Infected wild birds do not
usually become ill with the disease. The natural cycle for EEE virus occurs
nearly every year in some swamp habitats. In certain years the virus may
become amplified in this bird-mosquito cycle, however, and other species of
mosquitoes which feed on both birds and mammals act as "bridge vectors" and
are capable of transmitting the virus to mammals, including horses and
humans. The salt marsh mosquito, _Ochlerotatus sollicitans_, is the
principal bridge vector that is capable of spreading the virus to humans in
New Jersey. Both the salt marsh mosquito and a freshwater swamp mosquito,
_Coquillettidia perturbans_, are important as bridge vectors of EEE to
horses. The risk of becoming infected with EEE virus, while extremely low
at all times, is highest from late July through early October. The
mosquitoes that can transmit the virus are greatly reduced at about the
time of the 1st frost in the fall. The overwintering cycle of the virus is
not clearly understood.

While this may appear to be an extension of the disease, remember it has
been found in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, previously. Further
south it has also been found in Virginia and elsewhere. It is likely there
are other states that may have the disease and it has perhaps not yet been
recognized or an animal has not yet died of this disease.
