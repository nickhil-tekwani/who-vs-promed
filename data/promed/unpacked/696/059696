SH of Winchester was more than 2 hours away from her son when he called to say he had been attacked by an animal while hiking near Humpback Rocks on Friday. With traffic and congestion on Interstate 81, she was closer to 3 hours away. "When he called for his dad and me to pick him up he said 'I just got attacked by a big cat,'" she said. "I'm the one that called it a mountain lion when I called 911, because that is all I could think of at the time." SH said her son, KH, was actually attacked by a bobcat.

KH was on a 4-day hiking trip with his girlfriend when the attack occurred, his mother said. The couple was on their 2nd day of hiking when they sat down to eat their lunch, SH said. That's when KH noticed a large cat in a stalking stance walking toward his petite-framed girlfriend. "He said he thinks she was the cat's intended target," he said. Standing up, KH told his mother he put himself between the animal and his girlfriend. "He said as soon as he stood up he said he knew it was going to attack him," SH said. "It growled and sprinted at him and he threw his left arm up in front of his neck when the cat pounced on him."

The animal was later identified by KH through photos as a bobcat that had been seen by hikers in the area. "The cat was scratching and clinging to him and he is 6-foot-3 and 255 pounds of solid muscle," SH said. "At this point he said his adrenaline is flowing and he ripped it off him and stomped on it a couple of times." SH said the couple sprayed the bobcat with bear spray and it ran off.

Her son, however, was bleeding profusely from his wounds and the couple was covered in bear spray residue. After bandaging up KH's arm, the couple hiked about an hour to the Humpback Rocks picnic area where they met park rangers and her son was transported to Augusta Health, SH said. She said her son did not receive stitches at the hospital because they wanted the wounds to drain, but he did have 10 rabies shots and will need an additional 4 shots over the next 4 months. KH was treated and released from Augusta Health.

SH said they received a call from the park ranger the next morning who said they located the site where the attack occurred finding a clip from the bear spray the couple used. "The park ranger said it is extremely rare for a bobcat to attack a human," she said. "He wanted to make sure KH got the proper medical attention and started rabies vaccinations."

Kurt Speers, a ridge district ranger for the Blue Ridge Parkway, said he is responsible for the area where the animal attack occurred. He said he was also the 1st on the scene. "Based on interviews with those involved, it was almost certainly a bobcat --based on the description of the animal," he said in an email. "A bobcat attacking a grown male is highly unusual." Speers said he was the one to locate the site where KH was attacked, but they have been unable to locate the bobcat. He urged people to use caution in the area given the recent animal attack and heavy bear activity this time of the year.

Humpback Rocks is located at the northern end of Blue Ridge Parkway at milepost 5.8. The picnic area is about 3 miles away at milepost 8.5.

Rabies in Virginia is characterized by a significant portion being due to rabid wildlife and usually raccoons; see list below. We have a few reports of rabid bobcats, mainly from Vermont.

Bobcats are about twice the size of domestic cats and strong. Wikipedia has a fair description of them. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobcat. Clearly not a species to be fooled with. Young KH was lucky not to have been worse damaged. - Mod.MHJ
