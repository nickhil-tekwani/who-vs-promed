Dengue fever is emerging as a public health problem in many countries in
the American tropics (e.g., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and
northern South America) commonly visited by Canadian tourists. Anecdotal
single case reports of dengue in Canadians have been published in the past.
However, a better indication of incidence is dengue serology data from the
National Arbovirus Laboratory, Laboratory Centre for Disease Control,
Ottawa, and the Ontario Provincial Laboratory, Toronto. While dengue is not
a reportable disease, the annual number of serologically diagnosed cases
(confirmed and suspected) has increased considerably in this decade - 17
vs. 29.5 in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. The number is expected to
rise in coming years.
We report here an unusual single source outbreak of dengue in a group of 13
tourists, 11 of whom were Canadian, sharing the same holiday accommodation
on the west coast of Barbados during the 2-week period from 21 December
1997 to 4 January 1998. The outbreak is of interest because of the high
attack rate over a very short period of time, as well as for the questions
it raises concerning risks to tourists of second attacks of dengue, and the
associated risk of the serious consequences of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) / dengue shock syndrome (DSS).
Discussion: There are four distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DEN 1, DEN
2, DEN 3, and DEN 4). Immunity is serotype specific and lasts for life.
However, after a short period of cross-protection of about 6 to 8 months,
humans infected with one serotype are fully susceptible to infections with
the other serotypes. Moreover, sub-neutralizing levels of heterotypic
dengue antibodies place them at risk of developing DHF/DSS through an
antibody-dependant enhancement of viral infection.
In the Western hemisphere, this phenomenon has been illustrated by the
Cuban DHF/DSS epidemic of 1981. In 1977- 1978, a major outbreak of classic
dengue caused by DEN 1 virus occurred in Cuba and resulted in infection of
44% of the total population. In 1981, 3 years after the first outbreak, a
second outbreak caused by DEN 2 virus was unusually severe. A total number
of 116,000 people required hospitalization (1% of the Cuban population)
and, of these, 10,312 (including 158 fatal cases) were classified as
DHF/DSS. A seroepidemiologic study showed a ratio of DHF/DSS
hospitalizations to individuals with secondary infections to be 1/32 among
children and 1/80 among adults. Other studies, done in Thailand, have found
an incidence of DSS of 0.5% to 20% in children experiencing a secondary
dengue infection with any serotype. The greatest risk appeared when the
second infection occurred 6 months to 5 years after the primary one.
Recently, new data from Cuba are suggesting that DHF/DSS can occur even 16
years after a primary infection. After the 1981 outbreak, strict measures
of surveillance and controls eliminated dengue in Cuba for 16 years, until
January 1997. Since then, there has been an epidemic of 2,946 serologically
confirmed cases of dengue; 205 (including 12 fatal cases) were classified
as DHF/DSS. Preliminary studies indicate that 98% of these DHF/DSS cases
were due to secondary infection. Of concern is the fact that, apart from
one exception, all cases of DHF/DSS were equal to or greater than 17 years
of age, suggesting a longer period of antibody- dependant enhancement than
previously proposed.
This is the first report of a single point outbreak of dengue in Canadian
tourists. In this group of 13 tourists, living in a single building for 1
to 2 weeks, the attack rate for classic dengue was 77%. This attack rate
is consistent with reports in the literature for dengue epidemics in large
populations, but it is noteworthy for such a high attack rate over a
relatively short period of exposure. In fact, most of the tourists became
sick within a 4-day period, suggesting that a single mosquito may have
infected more than one person. _Aedes aegypti_ is known to be a "nervous
feeder" and can feed on multiple individuals during the same blood meal.
This outbreak points to an increasing health risk for tourists in popular
vacation destinations of the Americas. It also points out the need for
better education of tourists regarding classic dengue avoidance, and
equally importantly a clearer definition of the risks of haemorrhagic
dengue in tourists who have had classic dengue in the past and wish to
return to dengue endemic regions of the world.
The tourist's first line of attack in dengue prevention is the avoidance of
the day-biting _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Standard insect repellents, long
sleeves and trousers, and the use of insecticides in screened
accommodations can have an impact. _Ae. aegypti_ breeds in the still clean
water of discarded tires, cans, water storage containers, and flower pots,
and travels from its site only 100 metres during its life. The removal of
such breeding sites in the vicinity of tourist accommodation may reduce the
risk of dengue. Breeding sites that can not be removes can be treated with
larvicides. At present, there is no effective vaccine against dengue.

[ProMED-mail has posted numerous requests for information regarding dengue
cases, clusters, outbreaks, or epidemics in the Caribbean. Obtaining data
has been like pulling teeth, only with great resistance, political and
otherwise. These cases imported into Canada are an example of the likely
reason few countries are willing to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth. This, of course, is a disservice to humanity and
keeps tourists in the dark as to what is really going on in those countries
but is economically functional. Or, as Humphrey Bogart ("Casablanca")
said, "Well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out." -
