Update number - 335 (based on data up to 3 Feb 2019)
----------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity continued to increase.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to be reported, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating.
- In Europe, influenza activity increased and in most of the countries was above the epidemic threshold. Influenza A viruses co-circulated.
- In North Africa, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections sharply increased.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity remained elevated with increased activity in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon and appeared to have peaked in most countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
- In East Asia, influenza activity appeared to have peaked already, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating.
- In Southern Asia, influenza detections remained elevated overall. Influenza activity appeared to decrease in Iran (Islamic Republic of) with influenza A(H3N2) the predominant circulating virus.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels, with the exception of some parts of Australia where influenza activity remained above inter-seasonal levels.
Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 111 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 21 Jan 2019 to 3 Feb 2019 (data as of 15 Feb 2019 04:05:38 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 213440 specimens during that time period. A total of 69007 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 67733 (98.2%) were typed as influenza A and 1274 (1.8%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 25052 (72%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 9734 (28%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 83 (27.8%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 216 (72.2%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

A total of 65 people succumbed to [influenza A] H1N1 virus in the country last week [week of 11 Feb 2019], pushing the death toll due to swine flu [influenza A(H1N1) virus] this year [2019] to 377, according to the Union Health Ministry, while the number of those infected by it has crossed 12 000.

Rajasthan reported the highest number of cases (3508) and fatalities (127), the ministry data showed.

Gujarat was placed 2nd on the list with 71 deaths and 1983 cases. In Delhi, 7 people died while 2278 people were infected by the virus. Punjab reported 31 deaths and 410 cases, followed by Madhya Pradesh 30 deaths and 128 cases. In Himachal Pradesh, 27 people died due to the virus and 224 were infected. Jammu and Kashmir reported 22 deaths and 293 cases; Maharashtra 17 deaths and 330 cases; and in Haryana, 7 people died while 752 people were affected.

The remaining deaths and cases were reported from other parts of the country. The data showed 12 191 people tested positive for H1N1 virus in the country this year till [17 Feb 2019]. Last year [2018], 14 992 cases and 1103 deaths due to the [influenza A(H1N1) virus] were reported.

With [influenza A(H1N1) virus] cases rising alarmingly, the Health Ministry has asked state governments to bolster their surveillance for early detection of the disease and keep beds reserved in hospitals to deal with acute cases, which require ventilator facility.

States have been advised to involve district collectors in enhancing public awareness and outbreak response and issue regular health advice.

The drug controller general of India has been asked to coordinate with drug manufacturers and monitor the availability of oseltamivir, the medicine recommended by WHO, in various states. The ministry has recommended vaccination for healthcare workers and other priority groups.

According to the Epidemiology & Disease Control Division (EDCD), from the beginning of the January until 15 Feb 2019, at least 1334 patients who presented with influenza-like illness (ILI) were tested to identify/confirm influenza viruses at the national influenza center (through different hospitals). During this time period, at least 8 (0.6%) people died from flu related complications. Of these, 567 (43%) were tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, while 23 (1.8%) and 73 (5.5%) were identified as A(H3) and type B influenza virus, respectively. 561 (42%) out of 1334 samples tested negative for influenza virus. Some of the patients (8.2%) who tested positive for type A influenza were found untypeable by available primers. Currently, national influenza center is employing primers for H1, (H1N1)pdm09, H3, H5a, H5b, and H7N9 subtypes among ILI clinical samples.

Here, a major concern is that whether these untypeable strains are new or zoonotic influenza that need further attention, which may not so far be included in the laboratory testing.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sher Bahadur Pun for his update on seasonal influenza in Nepal. A small percentage of ILI or severe respiratory illness (SARI) samples may not be typeable on real-time PCR assays for a number of reasons, in addition to the possibility of emergence of a new or novel virus; the viral RNA in the sample may be insufficient --primers/probes are highly specific against the sequences and small changes in the viral genome may cause a mismatch, untypeable samples must be referred to WHO collaborating Centers for further testing. - Mod.UBA

The epidemic of influenza intensifies in metropolitan France and has already caused more than 1000 deaths, according to the health agency Public Health France. "About 1100 deaths of all ages are attributable to influenza, since the beginning of surveillance," it notes [Wed 6 Feb 2019] in its weekly bulletin based on figures as of 20 Jan 2019.

All indicators of influenza activity are increasing (consultations with general practitioners, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, etc), whereas the epidemic had already spread to all regions the previous week.

Among more than 12 000 patients who presented to the emergency last week [week of 28 Jan 2019], 1823 were hospitalized (+70% compared to the previous week), according to the Oscour network. These hospitalizations mainly concern people aged 75 years or older (43%) and children under 5 years of age (15%).

More generally, the share of hospitalizations for influenza or influenza-like illness [ILI] among hospitalizations is 30/1000, a "very strong increase" (18/1000, the previous week), underlines the health agency SpFrance.

Since 1 Nov 2018, 630 serious cases of influenza (including 139 last week) admitted to intensive care have been reported. Of these, 48 deaths were recorded, all in adults, particularly among those aged 65 and over (33).

In the city, the ILI consultation rate reached 536 per 100 000 inhabitants (+47% compared to the previous week), according to the Sentinel surveillance network.

In the more than 10 000 senior care facilities (nursing homes, long-term care units in hospitals, retirement homes) 160 outbreaks of acute respiratory infections have been attributed to influenza.

Moderate vaccine effectiveness
------------------------------
Among all people at risk, the effectiveness of vaccination in urban medicine is, according to 1st estimates, "moderate" (59%) against the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and "weak" (19%) against the A(H3N2) virus, says SpFrance.

These preliminary results come from the "Sentinel network that produces an estimate of the effectiveness of the vaccine to avoid an influenza infection leading to a consultation with a general practitioner," says the health agency. "These estimates will be refined in the coming weeks."

The Caribbean is now in the epidemic phase, while Mayotte remains below the epidemic threshold, despite an increase in emergency room visits for influenza or influenza-like illness.

Another serious influenza A case was confirmed at a state hospital on [Fri 22 Feb 2019], bringing the total number of patients in intensive care with flu-related complications to 10, the coordinator of the Health Ministry's unit for infectious diseases Maria Koliou told the Cyprus News Agency.

She said that since [1 Dec 2019] a total of 54 serious cases have been hospitalised in the large state hospitals. 12 of the patients have died, which is the highest number in a decade. Koliou said that the ministry had today taken delivery of new vaccines and urged all those who so wish to visit the medical centres on Monday to be vaccinated. Those who are under 65 must first visit their doctor to get a prescription.

The flu vaccine is considered the best protection, particularly for vulnerable groups. The public should also adhere to the standard preventive measures already announced, she said. Although the surge in flu cases has abated, the virus remains active and will continue to do so until the end of March [2019]. Therefore, the public must continue to adhere to preventive measures.

These include ventilating their living areas, avoiding crowded indoor places, use a tissue when coughing and sneezing, and washing their hands well and frequently. Children should not be sent to school until they have been temperature free for at least 48 hours and once their symptoms have abated.

Flu has left more than 2000 Britons needing life-or-death treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) this winter [2018-19], even though the virus is circulating at unusually low levels. Senior doctors said as many people were at risk of dying as during the pandemics of 2009-10 and 2010-11, despite the small numbers contracting the virus. One leading expert said the strain of flu this winter was so virulent that it had left people who were previously fit and healthy critically ill, some of whom hospitals have been unable to save. Those who have not had this year's winter flu vaccine appear to be most at risk.

Pregnant women and adults with a long-term medical condition who contract the virus are most likely to end up struggling to breathe so badly that they could die, said Public Health England (PHE). This strain of flu is following a dangerously different pattern than usual, with comparatively few people visiting their GP about it but large numbers becoming so unwell they risk dying.

In total, 2182 people in the UK have had to be admitted to an ICU or high-dependency unit (HDU) because of flu since the start of October [2018]. That is more than the 2045 who needed such care in the same period last year [2017], when the virus was much more prevalent. Flu has killed 195 this winter [2018-19], though that is down on the 241 deaths that occurred in the same period in 2017-18.

Dr Simon Ashworth, a consultant in intensive care at St Mary's hospital in London, who has specialised in such care for 25 years, said: "This is the worst flu season I have ever known." At least 6 of his ICU's 32 beds have been taken up with flu patients since mid-December [2018]. Ashworth said: "Although the overall incidence of flu reported by Public Health England is, if anything, lower than last year, our experience at St Mary's has been that we have seen more patients with severe influenza requiring intensive care than we saw even in 2010. "Colleagues from other hospitals have reported similar experiences, including those from ECMO [extra corporeal membrane oxygenation] centres, which have reported high levels of activity and running at close to capacity. Our impression is that patients who have ended up in ICU have generally not been vaccinated so even if the vaccine hasn't been completely protective, it has reduced the risk of life-threatening infection."

The most recent flu surveillance data, released by PHE [Public Health England] last [Thu 14 Feb 2019], showed that primary care services, mainly GP surgeries, were seeing low-intensity levels of the virus in the week ending [10 Feb 2019]. Only 23.1 people per 100 000 of population were reporting flu-like symptoms.

[7] WHO: Influenza vaccine composition for the northern hemisphere 2019-20
Date: Thu 21 Feb 2019

https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/201902_recommendation.pdf


The WHO Consultation on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2019-2020 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Season finishes today [22 Feb 2019] with the information meeting and round-table discussion on matters relating to influenza vaccine development and production.

It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2019-2020 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:
- an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;
- an A(H3N2) virus to be announced on 21 March 2019*;
- a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and
- a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage).

It is recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2019-2020 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.

*In light of recent changes in the proportions of genetically and antigenically diverse A(H3N2) viruses, the recommendation for the A(H3N2) component has been postponed.

The full report and a "Frequently Asked Questions" document are available on the WHO website at http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2019_20_north/en/.

The update "Antigenic and genetic characteristics of zoonotic influenza viruses and development of candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness" has also just been published on the WHO website at http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/characteristics_virus_vaccines/en/.
