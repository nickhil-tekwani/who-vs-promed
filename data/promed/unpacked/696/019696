Rinderpest in Mauritania: Invalidation of Serological Findings in Warthogs
-------------------------------
Translation of information received on 22 Jul 2003 from Dr Mokhtar Fall,
Deputy Director, Department of Animal Production and Agriculture, Ministry
of Rural Development and Environment, Nouakchott:
End of previous report period: 17 Jul 2003.
End of this report period: 22 Jul 2003.
Following the emergency report relating to positive serological findings in
2 warthogs killed in the localities of Gouere and N'Kheila, Keur Macen
district (moughataa), the results of competitive enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) carried out at Pirbright Laboratory, United
Kingdom (OIE Reference Laboratory for rinderpest), were received today,
indicating the absence of rinderpest antibodies and the presence of peste
des petits ruminants antibodies.
The provisional quarantine measures will be lifted with immediate effect.

[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is sometimes referred to as Kata. It is
caused by a paramyxovirus that is antigenically very closely related to the
Rinderpest virus, as well as the human measles and canine distemper
viruses. Differentiation of the viruses in the laboratory requires some
effort.
PPR is a disease mainly of goats and sheep, often producing little effect in
cattle. Morbidity is usually 100 percent, while mortality can vary greatly --
it can be 100 percent in susceptible groups of animals. Buying large
numbers of goats or sheep in local markets will almost guarantee an outbreak
by mixing animals with different exposure histories. PPR in goats appears
clinically very similar to rinderpest in cattle, including fever,
ocular/nasal discharges, stomatitis, diarrhea, and pneumonia. Upon post-
mortem examination, erosive lesions from the mouth to reticulo-rumen junction
are found, and typical "tiger-striping" hemorrhages of the intestines are
often seen.
PPR has been reported in wild ruminants, but pigs are thought to develop
inapparent infections. This is consistent with the original OIE report
(Rinderpest, wildlife - Mauritania (serology): OIE 20030720.1775), which
indicated there were no clinical signs in the warthogs. Rinderpest virus,
on the other hand, can produce disease in both warthogs and pigs.
PPR is very common in West Africa. Because it is a significant obstacle to
the effective production of a very common and good source of animal
protein, this disease dramatically affects the human health of the
region. Mauritania reported PPR to the OIE in 1999, 2001, and 2002, and
neighboring countries regularly report outbreaks of this disease. It is
also quite interesting to note that this is the second time in 2003 that
rinderpest surveillance activities have generated serological findings that
were later not confirmed. - Mod PC]
