1st Report of Pathogenicity Groups 3 and 4 of _Leptosphaeria
maculans_ on Canola in North Dakota.
-----------------------------------------------
C. A. Bradley, Department of Plant Pathology, North Dakota State
University, Fargo 58105; and P. S. Parks, Y. Chen, and W. G. D.
Fernando, Department of Plant Science, University of Manitoba,
Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada. Plant Dis. 89:776, 2005; published
on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0776C. Accepted for publication 18 Apr
2005.

Blackleg, caused by _Leptosphaeria maculans_ (Desmaz) Ces. & de Not
(anamorph = _Phoma lingam_), is an economically important disease of
canola (_Brassica napus_ L.) worldwide and was 1st detected in North
Dakota in 1991 (3). _L. maculans_ can be categorized into one of
several pathogenicity groups (PGs) on the basis of the interaction
phenotypes in differential canola cvs. Westar, Glacier, and Quinta by
using a standard screening protocol in the greenhouse (4). With this
system, PG1 strains are weakly virulent and PG2, PG3, and PG4 are
highly virulent.

The predominant strains of _L. maculans_ in North Dakota are PG1 and
PG2 (3). In cooperation with the Oilseed Pathology Lab in the
Department of Plant Science, University of Manitoba,
blackleg-infested canola stubble was collected arbitrarily from
fields in North Dakota during August and September of 2003. Isolates
of the pathogen were obtained by plating surface-sterilized (2
percent NaOCl), collected stubble on V8 agar containing 0.03 percent
chloramphenicol at 22 C under continuous cool-white fluorescent
light. Pycnidiospores were harvested from single pycnidia after 14
days of incubation with the Miracloth filtering method (2) and stored
at -20 C.

Each isolate was passed once through cv. Westar to maintain
virulence. Isolates were confirmed as being _L. maculans_ by the
presence of characteristic pink pycnidia formed on V8 agar and the
characteristic symptoms caused on inoculated cotyledons of cv.
Westar. The PG test was performed using a standard screening protocol
(4) and was repeated 3 times for each isolate. For each isolate, 12
7-day-old cotyledons of each differential cultivar were wound
inoculated with 10 microliters of a pycnidiospore suspension (10
million spores/ml). Disease severity on cotyledons was assessed 12
days after inoculation with a 0 to 9 scale (0 to 2 = resistant; 3 to
6 = intermediate; and 7 to 9 = susceptible).

A total of 106 isolates were obtained from the stubble collected from
47 fields. Of these isolates, 3 were characterized as PG1, 94 as PG2,
6 as PG3, and one as PG4; 2 isolates could not be characterized
according to the PG system as described (4). PG3 isolates originated
from 2 fields in Cavalier County and one field in Ward County. The
PG4 isolate was from Cavalier County.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st time highly virulent strains of PG3
and PG4 have been detected in North Dakota. PG3 and PG4 strains of
_L. maculans_ were found only recently in western Canada (1,2).

The discovery of these PGs in North Dakota and western Canada has
immense implication to canola breeding programs and blackleg control,
since these PGs may cause greater levels of blackleg severity on
canola cultivars that are resistant to only PG2 type isolates.

[Of the 106 isolates, the majority 94 were PG2 (89 percent), 3 were
PG1 (3 percent), 3 were PG3 (one percent) and one was PG4 (one
percent). But the most significant aspect of this report is that
these PGs have to be considered in plant breeding programs.

Most isolates of _L. maculans_ in western Canada belong to PG2, but
PG3 isolates were recently found in Manitoba, and, in this report,
PG4. PG3 isolates are aggressive to Q2 and Defender, and additional
susceptible cultivars will undoubtedly be identified in future. This
does not mean that all varieties will be attacked by PG3, because
genes conferring resistance to PG3 have been probably incorporated
into many current canola varieties.

Varieties originating from areas where PG3 is endemic have long been
used to breed Canadian canola, so resistance genes have almost
certainly been introduced. PG3 distribution in western Canada is
currently unknown, but the strain may already be present in Canadian
blackleg nurseries, so many varieties may have already been
"pre-screened" for resistance. The appearance of PG4 may be evidence
of pathogen population changes occurring under
high-selection-pressure exerted by resistance genes in commercial
cultivars, or through importation of PG4 isolates with canola seed.

Australian plant breeders identified a new source of blackleg
resistance _Brassica sylvestris_ [Bs], a wild relative of canola. The
resistance was successfully incorporated into canola, resulting in an
almost immune response to blackleg. After further breeding, Pacific
Seeds released varieties for the Australian market in 2000, and their
adoption by growers has led to substantially reduced yield losses
associated with blackleg. However, in early 2003, Pacific Seeds
issued a press release stating that blackleg stem cankers had been
observed on these varieties which had previously been immune to
blackleg. In addition to the 2 sites identified by Pacific Seeds
(Port Lincoln, SA and Cudal, NSW), Agriculture WA also reported the
breakdown of Bs resistance at Mt. Barker in Western Australia. During
2003, the strain of blackleg able to attack the Bs resistance spread
across Eyre Peninsula, causing an estimated cost of 20 million
dollars to local farmers. At some locations, varieties based on this
type of resistance are now very susceptible to blackleg and may
experience almost complete yield loss. Blackleg strains able to
attack plants containing the Bs resistance appear to be unable to
infect varieties containing polygenic resistance. This development is
of considerable concern to farmers and pathologists to the say the
least.
