Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? Apparently Israelis should be because a wolf is still on the run in the north of the country after it attacked 6 hikers, including a father and his 9-year-old son, on [Sat 9 May 2015].

According to Israeli daily Ha'aretz, the hikers were attacked in 3 separate incidents by a female wolf in the northern Golan Heights and were subsequently taken to hospital for rabies vaccinations and treatment for bite wounds.

Dr Amit Dolev of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel [SPNI] said he believed the wolf attacked because it was rabid.

Dolev said that park rangers were still searching for the animal. "Such an animal, which suffers from rabies, could be in its final hours, or its final days," he said, according to Ha'aretz.

According to The Times of Israel, one of the wolf's victims, 21 years old, said: "Our family went for a walk near the area of the Hermon by the Nimrod Fortress. We went down from the parking lot towards a spring. We originally did not notice that a wolf emerged from a thicket, but she ran at us once we saw her. We started to run away but she chased us and bit me in the thigh. She also went after my brother, but then somehow got lost," Menkes said, adding that the family managed to film the wolf while driving to the hospital.

The Agriculture Ministry has recorded 5 incidences of rabies in animals throughout the country this year [2015], including one wolf, according to The Times of Israel.

Last year [2014], the ministry said its goal was to rid the country of rabies with mandatory vaccinations for all dogs over the age of 3 months and recommended vaccinations for cats and ferrets.

[According to reliable information obtained earlier today (Wed 13 May 2015) the suspected wolf has not (yet) been found. This should not surprise in view of the thick vegetation in this mountainous, rocky region. The behaviour of the animal, however, was highly suspicious as rabid.

Until 2004, rabies was sylvatic in Israel, foxes being the vectors. The disease underwent a drastic change following the statewide implementation of oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of foxes and jackals. Experimental oral vaccination started during the 1990's. Since 2004, the project covers most parts of the country, practically eliminating cases in foxes (see map at http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2004-2011.html). Recently, the 2015 annual operation, with dispersion rate of 16-20 baits per square km, has been accomplished. It is essential that means for the continuation of this commendable activity be safeguarded, hopefully to be extended to neighbouring territories (such as Lebanon and Jordan).

Since 2009, a surge of rabies has been reported from northeastern Israel on the border with Syria, in spite of the oral vaccination. This has been found to be caused by the penetration of rabid stray dogs, and probably also wolves from Syria, infecting local pets (if unvaccinated) and susceptible domestic ungulates, particularly cattle, with the canine virus. For more details, see ref. 1 below and maps at http://tinyurl.com/pvfwqns and http://tinyurl.com/pascu29. It remains to be clarified if the oral vaccine baits used bait (physical size and palatability to the target animals, in order to be chewed and the vaccine ampule broken).are applicable to big canids, particularly wolves.

The number of lab-confirmed rabies cases in various animal species in Israel during the years 2002-2014 is included in the following table. Subscribers are referred to the cases in wolves, a phenomenon practically unknown prior to 2003. During 2014, 4 cases in wolves were diagnosed, all in the north-east, adjacent to the Syrian border.

No human case of rabies has been recorded in Israel since 2003.

The location of the "Nimrod Fortress" mentioned by one of the victims as the site of the incident can be seen in Israel's interactive map at http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html (select square one, see "Nimrod castle", north of Banias).
