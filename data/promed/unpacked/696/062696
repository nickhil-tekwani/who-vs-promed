Hepatitis E cases in Namibia have risen to over 6305 cases in the entire country, health officials said Monday [23 Sep 2019]. Health Ministry director of research Phelomena Ochurus said there is a need for the country to be concerned, as cases are being reported on a weekly basis.

According to statistics Ochurus provided, there have so far been 52 fatal cases since 2017, with pregnant women topping the list of deaths.

"Pregnant women are more susceptible, because when they are pregnant, their immune system is compromised," she said. She added that males are topping the number of cases reported, with 60% of them affected in a specific age group of between 20 and 39 years old.

"In the Khomas and Erongo regions, people affected are living in areas with limited water and sanitation facilities, especially in the informal settlements where there are no proper facilities," she said. Khomas region has so far recorded 3865 cases, while Erongo region has recorded 1358 cases.

Namibia experienced the 1st hepatitis E outbreak in 1983 in Rundu, where 9 cases were confirmed, and the last outbreak was experienced in 1995-1996, also in Rundu.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL
