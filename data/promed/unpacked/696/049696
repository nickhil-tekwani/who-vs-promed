New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Lot PT387, Sempang pantai, Merlimau, Melaka
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Jun 2018
Outbreak status: resolved on 30 Jun 2018
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: brackish water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-closed

Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Pacific white shrimp (_Penaeus vannamei_) (t) / 100 percent / 100 percent / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Affected population: The outbreak happened inside a closed area. The mortality only happened on a pond, and no other suspected outbreak occurred in another pond. Controls of movement restrictions and then disposal was carried out. Furthermore, continuous observation was done.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Pacific white shrimp (_Penaeus vannamei_) / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the control, surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone, surveillance within infected and/or protection zone; screening, traceability, quarantine; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type:
Fisheries Biosecurity Laboratory Johor (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
Pacific white shrimp (_Penaeus vannamei_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 7 Jun 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Infectious myonecrosis (IMN) is a viral disease of penaeid shrimp caused by infection with infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV).

The principal host species in which IMNV is known to cause significant disease outbreaks and mortalities is _Penaeus vannamei_.

Outbreaks of IMN with sudden high mortalities may follow stressful events such as capture by cast-net, feeding, sudden changes in salinity or temperature, etc.

This usually appears in early juvenile, juvenile, or adult _P. vannamei_, in regions where IMNV is enzootic, or in _P. vannamei_ introduced from infected regions or countries.

So far, the disease has been reported in northeastern Brazil (where the expected carriers are) and Southeast Asia, including the island of Java.

Due to a non-enveloped dsRNA virus structure, it is likely that IMNV will remain infectious in the gut and faeces of seabirds that have fed on dead or moribund shrimp at farms with ongoing IMN epizootics, and therefore the disease may be spread within and among farms by faeces or regurgitated shrimp carcasses.

IMNV has also been demonstrated to be transmitted from shrimp to shrimp by cannibalism. Transmission via water and vertical transmission from broodstock to progeny probably occurs.

With vertical transmission, it is not known whether the mode is transovarial or by contamination of the spawn eggs.

Shrimp in the acute phase of IMN disease will present focal to extensive white necrotic areas in striated (skeletal) muscles, especially in the distal abdominal segments and tail fan, which can become necrotic and reddened in some individual shrimp.

Severely affected shrimp become moribund, and mortalities can be instantaneously high and continue for several days. Mortalities from IMN range from 40 to 70 per cent. No effective vaccines for IMNV are available.

Disinfection of eggs and larvae is a good management practice recommended to reduce the potential of IMNV contamination of spawned eggs and larvae produced from them." https://thefishsite.com/disease-guide/infectious-myonecrosis. - Mod.CRD
