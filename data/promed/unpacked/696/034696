Soybean cyst nematode [SCN] is spreading rapidly. It was found in 24 new counties and municipalities in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec from 2017-2020; in the US, SCN was found in 55 new counties across 11 states. It is expected that the pathogen will continue to spread. However, SCN has not been reported so far in West Virginia or Prince Edward Island.

"There are 2 different aspects to SCN spread in Ontario," said Albert Tenuta, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. "The 1st is detection of SCN in new areas of the province, the most recent being . . . in 2020. The 2nd aspect is that the nematode has developed resistance to SCN-resistant bred soybean crops."

Iowa State University's [ISU] annual list of SCN-resistant soybean varieties contained 891 varieties in 2019, the majority of which had resistance from the Pl 88788 breeding line. However, the nematode has [overcome] P1 88788 resistance. Those varieties are not as effective at managing SCN as they were 20 or 25 years ago.

Gregory Tylka, ISU, recommended producers grow varieties with SCN resistance other than P1 88788. "These new SCN populations can reproduce on the P1 88788, resulting in . . . significant yield losses. If the same variety or resistance source is used, the potential for the [SCN population] to build and adapt to that crop variety increases rapidly." According to Tylka, there are US states where over 80% of fields have the P1 88788-adapted SCN population as the majority. In Ontario, around 30% of fields have over 10% of P1 88788-adapted SCN population.

Tenuta said that integrated management begins with genetics and SCN-resistant varieties including P1 88788 and some Peking varieties, which are more effective in controlling SCN but are not immune. Using the same variety consecutively or overuse will allow that portion of the SCN population type to reproduce, Tenuta said. This is what is occurring throughout the US Midwest and parts of Ontario. Crop rotation with non-host crops such as cereals, corn, forages as well as soil testing on a regular basis and recently registered nematicide seed treatments can all be used, he added.

[Soybean cyst nematode (SCN; _Heterodera glycines_) is considered one of the most destructive pests of the crop, with potential yield losses of more than 30%. Symptoms are distributed unevenly in affected fields; they may include yellowing and stunting of plants, as well as reduced nodulation of roots leading to loss of plant vigour. Symptom severity depends on nematode numbers and environmental conditions. SCN has also been reported to contribute to disease complexes such as sudden death syndrome and top dieback.

Cyst nematodes can often persist in the soil for many years. They are spread with plant material, soil, and water and by mechanical means (e.g., contaminated equipment). Once the nematodes have been established in an area, eradication is extremely difficult. Disease management is generally aimed at keeping nematode levels below economic thresholds. An integrated approach is required, including phytosanitation (exclusion), cultural measures (such as long crop rotation with non-host species), nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties.

Pathogen strains with resistance to agrochemicals, increased host range or an ability to overcome resistance of crop varieties are emerging frequently worldwide (for example, ProMED post 20170120.4778606). Ongoing crop breeding programmes are required to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

Other species in the genus can affect crops like maize (_H. zeae_), cereals (_H. avenae_), and sugar beet (_H. schachtii_).
