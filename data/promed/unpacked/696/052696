Measles outbreak in South Darfur's Otash camp
---------------------------------------------
Measles is spreading fast in the Otash camp for the displaced in Nyalalocality, South Darfur. "The 3 health centres at the camp daily are currently receiving more than 100 children under the age of 10," a sheikh told Dabanga from Otash camp, "while the centres are equipped to treat 30 patients each a day only." He explained that the 1st cases appeared mid-February [2015].

The camp sheikh appealed to the South Darfur state authorities to intervene "as soon as possible", and provide more staff and medicines to the health centres to contain the outbreak.

Seven new cases in California, now 130 in the Disneyland outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Seven more cases of measles have been reported in California, bringing the total to 130 since an outbreak that began at Disneyland in December [2014]. The latest figure was reported Friday [27 Feb 2015] by the California Department of Public Health. It's the 1st jump in a week. No new cases were reported on Wednesday [25 Feb 2015]. Health officials say 40 cases have been traced to the Disneyland outbreak and another 30 involve people who had close contact with infected people -- presumably also including those infected at the theme park. The agency says it's unclear how nearly 50 people were infected but the virus strain is similar to the one from the Disneyland outbreak. At least 2 dozen other measles cases in 6 states, Mexico and Canada have been traced to Disneyland.

Measles cases linked to Las Vegas restaurant
--------------------------------------------
154 cases of measles discovered in US from 1 Jan to 20 Feb 2015. Four cases of measles linked to a Las Vegas restaurant and 9 cases now in Clark County, Nevada.

Four cases of measles have been linked to a restaurant at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, the Southern Nevada Health District reported on Friday [27 Feb 2015]. A patron and 2 staff members of Emeril's New Orleans Fish House probably contracted measles from a contagious staff member, the health agency said on Friday in a press release, bringing to 9 the total number of people diagnosed with measles this year in Clark County, Nevada. An infant too young to have received protective immunization may have transmitted measles to the initial Emeril's staff member, the health district said.

154 cases of measles were discovered in the United States from 1 Jan to 20 Feb 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website. CDC said 118 cases were part of an ongoing, multistate outbreak linked to Disneyland in California. A record number of US measles cases -- 644 cases from 27 states -- were reported in 2014. That's the greatest number since measles elimination was documented in the United States in 2000. The Southern Nevada Health District said no measles cases had been reported in its district since 2011.

Emeril's put out a press release Friday, saying, "One of our team members was potentially contagious while working shifts beginning at 4 pm on Wednesday, 18 Feb 2015, Thursday, 19 Feb 2015, Friday, 20 Feb 2015, and Saturday, 21 Feb 2015. The affected employee has not been on site since then. ... In addition to the ongoing education of our staff, we are engaging in a cooperative effort with the health district to provide immunizations to all of our employees who believe they might be at risk." People who dined at the restaurant on those days, as well as people who dined after 4 pm on 4-7 Feb 2015, should review their immunization status and contact their doctors if they are not fully immunized or haven't already had measles, the health district said. The health district said a person with one of the newly identified cases visited 2 other Las Vegas businesses, a Walgreens and a Chili's Grill & Bar, on 22 Feb 2015.

BART, the transit system in the San Francisco area, on Wednesday said some riders may have been exposed last week after a San Mateo County resident with measles commuted. BART said the risk of "contracting measles via BART is negligible."

CDC: 170 measles cases identified around country
------------------------------------------------
More cases of the measles continue to pop up around the nation, with the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing 170 cases in 17 states and the District of Columbia.

According to CDC, 16 new cases were identified between 20 Feb and 27 Feb 2015. Most of the measles cases -- 125 of them -- seen across America have been linked to a single outbreak centered around Disneyland in Anaheim, California. Of the 16 newest cases, 7 were linked to that outbreak.

California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Nevada and Washington state were the sites of the latest confirmed cases of measles. CDC notes that its reports may not include all reported cases.

Metro brief: District of Columbia confirms 2nd case of measles in 2015
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The District of Columbia Department of Health has confirmed an additional case of measles, bringing the measles cases count in District to 2.

The recent case of measles in the District of Columbia is not linked to the outbreak in California, and there is no indication that the cases confirmed to date in 2015 are related. DOH officials have contacted all persons known to have been exposed to the infected person and recommend they be vaccinated if they are not already immune. All DC residents unsure of their vaccination status who have not previously had measles are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated. It is especially important that children over 12 months old get vaccinated.

"As we continue to monitor this situation, residents are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible," said DOH director, Dr LaQuandra S Nesbitt. "Adequate prevention and protection of measles requires we work together as a city to educate, inform and help ensure residents are equipped with the necessary tools and resources needed to reduce possible new cases of measles in the future. We are asking all healthcare providers to review their patients' immunization history at every visit to ensure that everyone is protected."

Measles can be prevented by a 2-dose vaccination. This is a safe and highly effective vaccine. The 1st dose of measles vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months of age. A 2nd dose of vaccine is given at school entry (4 to 6 years of age). Both doses are generally given as a combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Residents should contact their health care provider to discuss MMR vaccination history as well as possible exposure to measles. For more information, visit http://doh.dc.gov.

Measles outbreak leads to more vaccinations in Dane County
----------------------------------------------------------
New numbers released on Tuesday [3 Mar 2015] indicate more people in Dane County [Wisconsin] are getting vaccinated against the measles. According to Public Health - Madison and Dane County, measles vaccinations administered in Dane County from 1 Jan through mid-February of 2015 are up 38 per cent compared to the same time period in 2014. Immunization coordinator Diane McHugh said the county decided to study the numbers following the recent outbreak of the measles that began in California and spread to 17 states, including Illinois. McHugh said she thinks the outbreak inspired more people to receive vaccinations and/or call the health department to obtain more information about getting vaccinated against the measles.

CDC numbers indicate that roughly 9 in 10 people who are not vaccinated can contract the illness if they come into contact with it. The measles is spread through people coughing or sneezing. Symptoms include fever, rash, runny nose and red eyes. Children too young to be vaccinated, or those with pre-existing medical conditions are the most vulnerable to the measles. Unvaccinated people who are exposed to the measles can be required to remain in quarantine for up to 3 weeks.

According to CDC, the measles vaccine is administered in 2 doses. A child receives the 1st dose at one year of age. The 2nd part is administered when a child is 4 to 6 years old. The [MMR triple] vaccine also guards against the mumps and rubella.

[7] UK (Bermuda) - now 2 suspected cases

http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150227/NEWS06/150229726


Measles alert: 2 suspected cases revealed
-----------------------------------------
The Department of Health has confirmed that 2 suspected cases of measles are being investigated. The Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit was alerted this week -- the 1st on Wednesday [25 Feb 2015] and the 2nd yesterday [27 Feb 2015]. Those close to the pair are being informed and advised. Although neither case has been confirmed, the Department of Health has emphasised that it is important that the public consider their own immunisation status.

Documented prior vaccination or previous measles infection are the means of confirming protection, said the Department. Assuring adequate protection from measles and other vaccine preventable diseases is especially important in the event of a local outbreak and before travel abroad.

"If you have not had prior vaccination or a history of the disease, you are susceptible to measles infection. If you come into contact with a case of measles, or an individual suspected of having the disease, you are at risk of contracting the infection." People born before 1957 most likely had measles and are therefore most likely to be immune. Those who have no clear history of measles or vaccination, should consider themselves susceptible. If in doubt, they should discuss their immunisation status with a physician. The Ministry of Health, Seniors and Environment has said it wanted to particularly encourage parents to ensure that their children receive their recommended childhood vaccinations on time.

"Vaccine-preventable diseases can be eliminated," the ministry said. "The health, social and economic impacts of these diseases can be reduced through appropriate vaccination."

Five states account for 9 out of 10 measles cases in US
-------------------------------------------------------
The case tally now stands at 170 from 17 states and the District of Columbia. Nearly 90 per cent of cases reported are from 5 states -- California (113), Illinois (15), Nevada (8), and Arizona and Washington with 7 each.

Federal health officials link 125 cases, or 74 per cent, as part of a large, ongoing multistate outbreak linked to at least 2 Disney parks in California.

Illinois, Nevada, and Washington are reporting outbreaks that aren't linked to the Disney outbreak.

CDC suggests the outbreak has its genesis from a traveler who became infected overseas with measles, then visited the amusement park while infectious. However, no source has been identified.

The California Department of Public Health says that in addition to the measles genotype B3 (the type found in the large measles outbreak in the Philippines and elsewhere), new introductions of measles (D8 strain) have also occurred.

Last year, the United States experienced a record number of measles cases with 644 cases from 27 states. That was the most cases since measles elimination was documented in the US in 2000.

Between 1 Jan 2014 and 1 Mar 2015, WHO received notification of over 23 000 cases of measles in the WHO European Region. The most affected country is Kyrgyzstan with over 7000 cases reported in just the 1st 7 weeks of 2015. Significant numbers of measles cases have also been reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation and Serbia.

Measles virus D8 has been the most commonly identified circulating genotype.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages member states to scale up vaccination against measles across age groups at risk. This will help putting an end to the several outbreaks currently hitting countries of the European Region and preventing similar outbreaks in the future. At the same time, all countries need to maintain a very high routine measles vaccination coverage so that similar outbreaks will not happen again in the Region, and measles can be eliminated once and for all.

Travel information
------------------
An imported case of measles has been recorded in Minsk (Belorus). The patient had recently returned from a visit to Italy. The case was recorded in February [2015], It was subsequently established that the patient had never received measles vaccination. People who have had close contact with the sick man have been placed under medical surveillance.

Last year [2014] the capital of Belarus (Minsk) similarly received thresher measles case originating from Russia. Among another 20 contacts, 3 were imported cases of measles: travellers from Israel, Russia and Georgia. According to WHO, the measles situation in Europe overall remains unsatisfactory.

[11] Bosnia and Herzegovina - case count

http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21047


Summary
-------
Between January 2014 and the beginning of February 2015, the Federal Institute of Public Health in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has reported 3804 measles cases. Notable transmission has been observed in 3 Central Bosnia Canton municipalities: Bugojno, Fojnica and Travnik. Most cases were unvaccinated 2680 (70 per cent) or of unknown vaccination status 755 (20 per cent). Health authorities have been checking vaccination records and performing necessary prevention measures. The epidemic is still ongoing.

Background
----------
Since the beginning of 2014, a measles outbreak is taking place in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FB&H), including a total of 3804 measles cases up to the start of February 2015.

The 1st 2 cases were reported in Bugojno, Central Bosnia Canton, in siblings who were teenagers, both of whom had respectively visited the local health care centre in early February 2014, with a rash that had started 3 days earlier. They had recently travelled to Germany.

Conclusions
-----------
The probable causes of the outbreak described here, as well as its expansion, are insufficient vaccination and implementation of proposed control measures. The majority of those affected had not received necessary vaccination (2 doses of MMR) at the recommended time (up to 14 years of age). Our data demonstrate that most cases in the current outbreak either did not know their vaccination status (20 per cent) or reported being either partially (8 per cent) or not vaccinated at all (70 per cent).

In 2007, the measles genotype circulating in FB&H was D4, however in the current outbreak genotype D8 was found, a genotype reported in the western part of Europe (England, Germany, Italy) at the end of 2011. It cannot be ruled out that the genotype D8 found in this outbreak might have been imported by individuals who travelled to such countries a short time before the beginning of the epidemic. Molecular epidemiology is an important surveillance tool for routine monitoring of movement and the spreading of different virus genotypes across Europe.

In conclusion, FB&H is currently facing a large measles outbreak with 3804 cases by the beginning of 2015. This is probably related to disruption of routine MMR vaccination during the war and post-war periods, as well as the recent wave of vaccination controversies and the anti-vaccination movement that contribute to parental hesitance and in turn to lower immunisation coverage. Monitoring of the immunisation status and vaccine effectiveness is crucial. High vaccination coverage rates with 2 doses and advocacy and communication campaigns ensuring effective community involvement and public awareness are necessary to control the current epidemic and to avoid future outbreaks.

World health body records more than 3000 measles cases in Russia
----------------------------------------------------------------
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Russia has seen more than 3000 measles cases since the beginning of last year [2014].

WHO in Europe called on Wednesday for measles vaccination campaigns to be stepped up across the region after recording 22 000 cases of the highly infectious disease since the start of 2014. Saying she was "taken aback" by the high case numbers, Zsuzsanna Jakab, the UN health agency's European director, said the 22 149 reported cases from 7 countries threatened the region's goal of eliminating measles by the end of 2015. Even though measles cases fell by 50 per cent from 2013 to 2014, large outbreaks continue in both eastern and western Europe, WHO said. Italy has seen 1674 measles cases since the beginning of last year, while Germany has had 583, Kyrgyzstan 7477 and Russia more than 3240.

Measles is a contagious and sometimes deadly viral disease which can spread very swiftly among unvaccinated children. There is no specific treatment and most people recover within a few weeks, but, particularly in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia.

http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/150228/sweden-confirms-measles-case


Medical authorities in Sweden have confirmed the country's 1st case of measles following large outbreaks of the disease across Europe
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The infected individual was not vaccinated against the disease and contracted it during a trip in Germany, according to communicable disease control authorities in western Sweden, where medical centers have been told to be cautious since more people may fall ill and seek emergency care in the next few days. "If you are not vaccinated and you end up at airports or in large crowds in, say, Europe or the United States, then you run a great risk of contracting measles," Leif Dotevall, a communicable disease doctor, told news agency TT. According to Dotevall, most Swedes born after 1960 are protected against the disease. 98.5 per cent of the children who were born after the year 2010 have been vaccinated against measles.

Sweden has seen an unusually high number of influenza cases in February [2015]. Since the initial symptoms of measles -- high fever, coughing, a runny nose and red eyes -- are similar to flu symptoms, it is difficult to recognize the disease at 1st. However, the distinctive red measles rash develops after 2 to 4 days. Since the beginning of 2014, more than 22 000 cases of measles were recorded in 7 European countries, according to the World Health Organization.

Philippines measles outbreak 2014: 58 010 cases, 110 deaths
-----------------------------------------------------------
This represented a 9-fold increase in cases in the Philippines compared to 2013, when the total cases were 6497 and 26 deaths. The measles outbreak prompted Philippines health officials to institute a mass vaccination campaign last fall [2014], 'Ligtas sa Tigdas', in an effort to get the outbreak under control.

Measles exported from the Philippines has been linked to outbreaks in several countries to include the United States, Canada and others. An outbreak in Ohio last year [2014] that affected hundreds began with unvaccinated Amish travelers to the Philippines.

Some suspect that the Philippines may be the source of the Disneyland outbreak that started in California. The source of the initial Disney theme park exposure has not been identified; however, specimens from 30 California patients were genotyped; all were measles genotype B3, which has caused a large outbreak recently in the Philippines, but has also been detected in at least 14 countries and at least 6 US states in the last 6 months.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that travelers to the Philippines protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.
