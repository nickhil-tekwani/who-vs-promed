At least 112 people from Ogbadibo and Okpokwu local government areas of Benue state are reported to have died from yellow fever [YF] since the outbreak of the disease in September 2020 to date.

The state's epidemiologist, Dr. Terungwa Ngise, confirming the incidence in an interview, said that emergency interventions had been mobilized to the affected communities, including immunization, treatment of already infected persons, supply of mosquito nets, as well as depopulation of mosquitoes responsible for the spread of the disease.

Dr. Ngise, however, expressed worry that the spread of the disease had become heightened following the refusal of a section of the Ogbadibo population to submit themselves to the immunization over traditional beliefs that the deaths and disease were cause by the "gods."

Dr. Ngise regretted that such beliefs had frustrated interventions in the area. He, however, said that despite the people's resistance, the state government will not be deterred in efforts to stop the spread of the disease to other parts of the state.

He, therefore, advised residents in the 2 local government areas to attend to personal hygiene by removing all stagnant water found around them, keeping their environment clean, and availing themselves of the 2nd phase of the yellow fever immunization in the area.

[The yellow fever outbreak in Benue state continues. A 15 Nov 2020 report indicated that at that time, the state's epidemiologist reported that 26 people, 2 females and 24 males, had fallen ill with YF (see Yellow fever - Africa (16): Nigeria (BE) susp. 20201115.7945914). The Executive Secretary, Primary Health Care Board, Dr. Ben Ageda, indicated then that the state was moving to initiate a yellow fever campaign with the recruitment of 1586 staff members in an ambitious effort to vaccinate over 4 million people in 243 council wards.

The above report indicates that there are now at least 112 YF cases, and the vaccination teams have encountered resistance to vaccination in some local communities due to traditional beliefs that would be difficult to overcome. The outbreak is likely to continue in those areas. Continuation of the YF control and vaccination campaign in other parts of the state is prudent. - Mod.TY
