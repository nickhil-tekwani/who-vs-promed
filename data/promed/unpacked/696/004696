Brazil: 23 Deaths in Vampire Bat Rabies Outbreak in Maranhao State
-----------------------------------------------
23 people, including 18 children and teenagers, have been killed in a
human rabies outbreak in northeast Brazil in the past 2 months, the
Health Ministry said Tuesday [1 Nov 2005]. The disease is transmitted
to humans by blood-eating [vampire] bats, according to the Ministry.
All these cases were reported in the rural areas of the northeastern
state of Maranhao, said the Ministry. The 1st death happened in
August [2005]. Many houses in marshlands do not have screens in the
windows and have large holes in the floor and ceiling, making it easy
for vampire bats to break in, said the Ministry spokesperson. All the
cases [bat attacks] took place at night.

The state of Maranhao borders the state of Para, where a
human-vampire bat rabies epidemic occurred in 2004. 10 vaccination
and 5 bat-catching teams [are] working in the region to try to
prevent the spreading of the disease. From 1986 to 2004, a total of
703 people have been reported killed by rabies in Brazil, and 84 of
them were in the state of Maranhao, said the ministry.

Continued deforestation of the Amazon region has sent thousands of
displaced vampire bats carrying rabies fleeing across northern
Brazil. Rabies virus, which infects the central nervous system of
humans, can cause death within a day from the onset of symptoms.

[3 more deaths have occurred since the last report received from the
area on Thu 27 Oct 2005. Rabies viruses are transmitted to humans
from carnivores and chiropterans (frugivorous, hematophagous and
insectivorous bats). Whereas transmission from carnivores has been
controlled in many parts of the world by vaccination of domestic cats
and dogs and oral vaccination of wild-life, and in principle could be
controlled elsewhere, the control of bat rabies is more problematic
because of the variety of habitats occupied by bats and their
nocturnal habits. Nonetheless, control is feasible in favorable
situations, since current vaccines (all derived from canine rabies)
do provide protection against bat rabies viruses. - Mod.CP]
