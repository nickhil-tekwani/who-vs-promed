2 elementary school children in Riverside County [California] could have Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy, according to health officials.

Nursing staff at Indian Hills Elementary School in Jurupa Valley notified county officials Friday [9 Sep 2016] of the suspected infections, which will take several weeks to officially confirm, said Barbara Cole, director for disease control for the Riverside County Department of Public Health. "We have to keep stressing it's not confirmed," Cole said. "We're just at the beginning of the investigation."

Jurupa Unified School District officials sent a letter home to parents Friday [9 Sep 2016] to inform them about the unconfirmed cases and provide resources to learn more about the rare disease, said district Superintendent Elliott Duchon. Duchon said a parent notified the school's nursing staff of a preliminary diagnosis of Hansen's disease for a student at the school. He would not say whether the 2 suspected cases were in the same family.

Cole said the children were not hospitalized and lived in the western part of Riverside County, which is where the school is located.

As of Tuesday afternoon [6 Sep 2016], Cole hadn't yet followed up with the children's parents to find out if they'd recently traveled to another country or had contact with someone with leprosy.

Hansen's disease is transmitted through prolonged contact, often between people living in the same household. If someone is taking antibiotics for the disease, however, the bacteria cannot be transmitted to other people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Duchon said the school had disinfected a few classrooms, but that they were taking no further precautions. He said the district would follow the health department's guidance. Cole said that national health guidelines don't consider schools or workplaces the types of environments where leprosy is likely to be transmitted. "Even if the cases were confirmed ... leprosy is not easily transmitted to others, and we don't feel like there's a risk in the school setting," she said. "It's not a highly contagious disease."

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_. This disease is still a major health problem in the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Western Pacific region. Transmission is thought to occur following close, prolonged contact with a case of lepromatous leprosy. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to spread the disease. Leprosy in children would indicate that there is recent ongoing transmission from an active case of lepromatous leprosy likely in the household of the children.

More information on these suspected cases of leprosy in children in Riverside County, California, would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources, as it becomes available.

A discussion of leprosy can be found in my comments in the ProMED-mail leprosy posts listed below.

Riverside County, with a population of almost 2.2 million residents, is located in southern California east of the Greater Los Angeles area to the Arizona border (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_County,_California). - Mod.ML
