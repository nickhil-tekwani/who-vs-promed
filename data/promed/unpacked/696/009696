Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Qatar 26 Dec 2019
-----------------------------
On [5 Dec 2019], the National IHR Focal Point for Qatar reported 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) infection to WHO.

The 1st case-patient (case #1) is a 67-year-old female from Doha, Qatar. She developed fever, cough, shortness of breath, and headache on [23 Nov 2019] and presented to a hospital on [25 Nov 2019]. On [27 Nov 2019], she went to the same hospital for follow-up. However, on [28 Nov 2019], her condition worsened, and she was admitted to the hospital. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on [28 Nov 2019] and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on [29 Nov 2019]. The patient had underlying medical conditions and passed away on [12 Dec 2019]. The source of her infection is under investigation. The patient had neither a history of contact with dromedary camels nor recent travel. Follow-up and screening of 7 household contacts and 40 healthcare worker contacts is ongoing, and 2 asymptomatic secondary cases have been identified so far.

The 2 contacts are a 50-year-old (case # 2) and a 32-year-old (case # 3), living in Doha. Both were identified through contact tracing and are asymptomatic. Case #2 is the son of case #1 and has an underlying medical condition. Case #3 was involved in direct contact with case #1 and has no underlying medical conditions. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on [29 Nov 2019] for both case #2 and case #3 and tested positive for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR on [29 Nov 2019]. As of [23 Dec 2019], both are in a stable condition in an isolation ward where protocols for infection prevention and control have been implemented.

Public health response
Upon identification of case #1, the case was isolated, the infection prevention and control protocols were implemented as per WHO guidelines, and investigation and contact tracing were initiated.

All 47 identified contacts of the patient have been monitored daily for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for a period of 14 days following their last exposure to the patient.

All contacts were tested for MERS-CoV, and test results were positive for 2 asymptomatic contacts (cases #2 and #3 mentioned above).

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (for example, in a healthcare setting or household contacts).

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

Early identification, case management, and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures, can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[If this patient had not deteriorated on 28 Nov 2019, she most likely would not have been tested for MERS-CoV infection, and the infection may well have been missed. It would be very interesting to see data from countries on the Arabian Peninsula outside of Saudi Arabia on what proportion of respiratory illnesses are being tested for MERS-CoV infection, and what are the criteria being applied to test for suspected MERS-CoV infection. This case outwardly did not have a history of contact with dromedary camels, nor did she have contact with known MERS-CoV-infected individuals. But how many of her known contacts had a history of a respiratory infection, and was any serology performed? Just musing out loud, falling back on the question, "Why is Saudi Arabia seeing so many cases, but not neighboring countries?"

According to the ECDC (European Center for Disease Control) rapid assessment of 29 Aug 2018, Qatar has previously reported 19 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 5 deaths, for a reported case fatality ratio of approximately 25% (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/RRA-Severe-respiratory-disease-associated-MERS-CoV-22nd%20update-29-aug-2018.pdf). The most recent case confirmed by Qatar prior to this announcement was reported on 23 May 2017 (see MERS-CoV (34): Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, WHO: 20170606.5087888). The inclusion of these 3 newly confirmed infections will bring this total to 22 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 5 deaths.

Qatar borders with the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia not far from Hufoof, where there have been cases reported since 2017. See map at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/Arabia-Map.htm. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Saudi Arabia, Phase 1b vaccine trial
Date: Sat 21 Dec 2019 [edited]
https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/chadox1-vaccine-candidate-be-tested-against-mers-cov-saudi-arabia


A Phase Ib clinical trial in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has launched to evaluate a vaccine candidate to protect people against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Announced on [19 Dec 2019], this limited study will be the 1st clinical trial focused on MERS-CoV to be conducted in the KSA.

This is important news since MERS-CoV has spread to different countries in the Middle East and other regions. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported that from 2012 through [30 Nov 2019], a total of 2494 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases and 858 associated fatalities have been recorded, with the vast majority of these cases confirmed in Saudi Arabia.

The number of MERS cases reported in KSA this year [2019] was more than 2018, but significantly less than the 2014-2017 corresponding period. The trial is a collaboration between the Jenner Institute and the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), funded by the Department of Health and Social Care.

MERS-CoV causes an emerging zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) viral respiratory disease that was 1st described in 2012. Dromedary camels are now recognized as the source of zoonotic infections. In a recent study, 54.9% of primary cases were associated with direct camel exposure. Human-to-human transmission, especially in hospitals, has been responsible for the majority of cases seen in recent outbreaks.

The new trial in KSA will replicate the design of the initial study performed in Oxford. In that study, 24 healthy adult volunteers aged 18-50 years received a single dose of vaccine with the aim of assessing the safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS. The ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine was found safe and well-tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to induce immune responses against MERS-CoV.

It is hoped that the trial in KSA will provide additional data to support these findings; conducting a clinical trial in a disease-endemic region is an important step in vaccine development. A vaccine against MERS-CoV could be used to prevent zoonotic transmission, especially in those frequently exposed to camels in the Middle East, to immunize healthcare workers in regions where hospital outbreaks have occurred or to respond to an outbreak in a healthcare setting or community.

Professor Sarah Gilbert, UK project leader and professor of Vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, said in a related press release, "I congratulate KAIMRC on starting the 1st phase I clinical trial of a novel vaccine ever to take place in Saudi Arabia. It is appropriate that the trial is of a vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome. I look forward to continuing the fruitful collaboration between the Jenner Institute at Oxford University and KAIMRC."

Naif Alharbi, vaccinologist and Co-PI on the Saudi MERS vaccine trial, said: "I am honored to lead the Oxford-KAIMRC collaboration that is now making historical progress as we are starting the 1st-ever phase I clinical trial in Saudi Arabia for this vaccine. It is essential that we conduct phase I trials for MERS vaccines in Saudi Arabia where MERS-CoV is endemic and considered a national health research priority. I am also thrilled to have worked on the vaccine from lab and mice testing in Oxford and then to have been leading its development in camels and humans in Saudi Arabia. This trial will pave the way to further development of MERS vaccines. This trial also comes in time with our recent successful completion of evaluating the same vaccine in camels in Saudi Arabia."

Mohammad Bosaeed, ID consultant and PI on the Saudi MERS vaccine trial, said: "It is a great pleasure to lead the MERS vaccine phase I clinical trial, 1st-ever Saudi phase I trial. We have also recently received approval for a state-of-the art clinical trial unit in our hospital (at the Saudi National Guard Health Affairs), the 1st of its kind in the country. We are now recruiting for the study, which assesses safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1-MERS vaccine in healthy subjects in Saudi Arabia. I have no doubt that this great milestone would open the doors for more clinical trials both in KAIMRC and in Saudi Arabia; we are excited and grateful for collaborating with Oxford University."

Previously, during July 2019, the GLS-5300 MERS CoV vaccine candidate was shown to be safe and well-tolerated and induced a robust immune response in a Phase 1 1st-in-human clinical trial. In this study, more than 85% of volunteers exhibited a detectable immune response to MERS CoV after 2 GLS-5300 vaccinations. This immune response persisted throughout the study and was similar in magnitude to the response seen in survivors of natural MERS-CoV infection.

This new research is funded by the Department of Health and Social Care (project number 16/107/01) as part of the UK Vaccine Network (UKVN), a UK Aid program to develop vaccines for diseases with epidemic potential in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The work was supported by the UK National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) through the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC). The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) provided funding for the extended 12 months of follow-up in this study.

Future development of the vaccine will be funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public-private coalition that aims to derail epidemics by speeding up the development of vaccines. CEPI will fund the vaccine for public health use. The commercial rights to this vaccine are held by Vaccitech, a University of Oxford spin-out company.

[We at ProMED-mail try to avoid publishing news on Phase 1 trials, as so many new drugs and biologics perform very well in Phase 1 but do not pass on successfully through Phases 2 and 3. But with a positive holiday spirit, it seems appropriate to mention this study will be ongoing, and the candidate vaccine will do well going on through phases 2 and 3. While there have not been any cases reported from Saudi Arabia in 12 days, we know the virus is there, and there are continued new introductions of the virus from the dromedary camels with continued transmission (hopefully just sporadically) in individuals with known camel contact, and those with as yet unidentified high risk exposures. - Mod.MPP]
