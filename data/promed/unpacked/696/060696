Rare form of scrapie found in sheep; United States documents 1st case
rare Nor98 scrapie strain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wyoming Livestock Board says a sheep from a flock in the
northeastern corner of the state has tested positive for a rare form
of the disease scrapie, the 1st time the particular strain has been
found in the United States.
The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS] notified the
state Friday [16 Mar 2007] that the ewe tested positive for a form of
scrapie consistent with the Nor98 strain, 1st diagnosed in Norway in 1998.
The livestock board said it doesn't expect the strain of the disease
to become a major problem for the Wyoming sheep industry. State and
federal officials intend to monitor the remainder of the flock, near
the Black Hills, to make sure the disease doesn't become established.
According to a release from the livestock board, the ewe was
slaughtered in Michigan as part of the USDA's regular scrapie
slaughter surveillance program and traced back to the Wyoming flock.
The release states that the Nor98 strain of scrapie is rare even in
Europe, with fewer than 300 cases diagnosed since it was identified in 1998.
Scrapie is a transmissible disease similar to chronic wasting disease
found in deer and elk. Scrapie is limited to sheep and goats and
takes years to affect an animal after it has been infected.
There are no known human health risks associated with scrapie.
"This provides evidence that the surveillance program is working,"
said Bryce Reece, executive director of the Wyoming Wool Growers
Association. "It also indicates that the program is on the cutting
edge of science to detect such a rare disease during standard
surveillance." An epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

[Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the central
nervous system of sheep and goats. It is among a number of diseases
classified as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE).
Infected flocks that contain a high percentage of susceptible animals
can experience significant production losses. Over a period of
several years, the number of infected animals increases, and the age
at onset of clinical signs decreases, making these flocks
economically unviable.
First recognized as a disease of sheep in Great Britain and other
countries of Western Europe more than 250 years ago, scrapie has been
reported throughout the world. Only 2 countries are recognized by the
United States as being free of scrapie: Australia and New Zealand.
The 1st case of scrapie in the United States was diagnosed in 1947 in
a Michigan flock. The flock owner had imported sheep of British
origin through Canada for several years. APHIS conducted a slaughter
surveillance study from 1 Apr 2002 to 31 Mar 2003, which determined
the prevalence of scrapie in mature U.S. cull sheep to be 0.2 percent
or one positive out of 500 cull sheep.
This particular strain was identified in Norway in 1998, in ARR/ARR
genotype sheep. Some would argue this raises important issues with
regard to control of scrapie infection in small ruminants. Of major
concern, ARR/ARR sheep can no longer be regarded as free of natural
TSE infection. The research on this particular strain can be viewed
in its entirety at
<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/102/44/16031>.
Much of this paper was done on transgenic mice. This moderator
contends that mice and sheep are a long way apart physiologically and
everything found in a mouse is not necessarily the final word for research.
