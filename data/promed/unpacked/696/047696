Health Ministry withdraws broad ban on local fish sales
--------------------------------------------------
A day after ordering that products raised by local fish farmers be
removed from supermarket shelves as a "precautionary measure," the
Health Ministry yesterday issued a series of contradictory and
confusing clarifications about the dangers posed by the use of a
disinfectant, malachite green, in fish ponds.
Reversing Monday's order, the Health Ministry said yesterday that it
was permitting the general sale of fish raised in local ponds. Dr.
Yitzhak Berlovitz, Health Ministry deputy director general, confirmed
to Haaretz that the ban had been lifted. The ministry, he stated,
"has drawn the conclusion that the ban issued yesterday should be
annulled, and that prohibitions in the future should be selective."
Berlovitz appeared to indicate, however, that the lifting of Monday's
across-the-board ban was conditional. He noted that fish raised in
local ponds will be cleared for marketing only after they are
examined by officials.
Health Ministry spokesman Robby Steinberg provided Haaretz with a
different clarification, saying that, starting tomorrow, fish raised
in most ponds will be cleared for sales, yet the marketing of fish
raised on 4 particular farms will be banned, due to high malachite
green levels in their ponds. The spokesman explained that the
ministry issued a ban last April on malachite green (used to
exterminate parasites in fish), since research studies indicated that
it might be carcinogenic. The Health Ministry spokesman said he could
not name the 4 problematic farms, apart from the pond at Kibbutz
Neveh Eitan, in which the malachite green affair was originally
exposed; and officials from the Agriculture Ministry withheld the
names of the 3 other fish farms.
Senior officials from the Agriculture and Health Ministries yesterday
reiterated sharp criticism of the latter's decision on Monday to
issue the wide-ranging ban on locally raised fish. "It's a disgrace
and a scandal," one senior Health Ministry official fumed. "The
ministry issues hysterical, confused statements to the public,
without any rhyme or reason."
Berlovitz, however, defended the Health Ministry's decision-making
process. He said Monday's ban was warranted, in light of information
possessed by the ministry at the time; when new information came to
light yesterday, he added, the ministry was compelled to change its
policy.
Dr. Oded Nir, director of veterinary services for the Agriculture
Ministry, said his office has a list of 9 fish farms whose ponds have
been shown by tests conducted in the past 2 months to be devoid of
malachite green.
Among those fisheries authorized to market their product is Kibbutz
Kfar Ruppin -- the largest fishery in Israel, which markets some 3000
tons every year. Fish from the kibbutzim of Gesher, Reshafim, Sdeh
Eliyahu, and also from Moshav Ein Tamar, have all been declared safe.
Nir said tests were conducted yesterday at 9 additional fish ponds,
and that their results will be available by the end of the week.
Ponds in all Israeli fish farms that market fish will be tested in
the coming weeks, Nir stated; farms whose ponds do not contain the
banned substance will be allowed to sell their fish, he added.
Ofer Zacks, the head of the Agriculture Ministry's aquaculture
department, told Haaretz yesterday that his department has set up a
supervisory system that will ensure that any fish containing the
banned substance cannot reach markets.
Zacks said he believed that a negligible number of fisheries used
malachite green after April 2003.

[Malachite green is a very effective parasite/fungus control in many
aquatic environments. It penetrates deeply into fish body tissues and
may have a use against Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD) in
salmonids. Because of this deep tissue penetration, malachite-green
is thought to be toxic to tetras, catfish, loaches, and some small
marine fish. It is also this deep tissue penetration that may lead to
concentrations higher than believed safe for human consumption.
Malachite green is presumed to be a carcinogen, and this is where the
concern stems from. The concern has resulted in a ban of malachite
green in the US, except in aquarium fish. Readers are to be reminded
that it is banned on the presumption -- not proof -- of its
carcinogenic potential. Nevertheless, there are a number of safety
precautions to be considered when handling malachite green, such as
gloves and eye protection.
According to the article, it seems that the Ministry has not
established or published what the tissue level was. It would also be
helpful if the regulations specify water concentrations that are more
likely to produce tissue residues above a limit, in which case those
fish having above the limit residues would be disqualified from the
food chain. - Mod.TG]
[The sharing of responsibilities and the need for harmonisation of
food safety measures adopted by different official authorities
characterise the situation in many countries. Several of them,
including the European Union, have established in recent years
independent Food Safety agencies/authorities.
In Israel, the Ministry of Health derives its authority for the
control of food safety and wholesomeness from the "Public Health
(Food) Ordinance". The authority of the Veterinary Services (Ministry
of Agriculture) over the testing and marketing of fish is derived
from article 2, "Marketing Prohibition" in the "Animal diseases
regulations (preventing biological residues)", which cover, among
others, "fish - up to their exit from the fish farm". The publication
of these regulations became possible following the approval by the
Knesset (Parliament), in 1994, of an amendment in the "Animal
Diseases Ordinance", authorising the Minister of Agriculture to make
rules "prescribing and regulating any examination, treatment,
disinfection, seizure, transfer, detainment, removal, killing or
destruction of animals, animal products or carcasses, due to which
the risk of damage to the health of human beings exists". - Mod.AS]
