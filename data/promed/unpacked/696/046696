Health authorities have uncovered an alarming surge in resistance to crucial HIV drugs. Surveys by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveal that, in the past 4 years, 12 countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas have surpassed acceptable levels of drug resistance against 2 drugs that constitute the backbone of HIV treatment: efavirenz and nevirapine.

People living with HIV are routinely treated with a cocktail of drugs, known as antiretroviral therapy, but the virus can mutate into a resistant form.

The WHO conducted surveys from 2014 to 2018 in randomly selected clinics in 18 countries, and examined the levels of resistance in people who had started HIV treatment during that period.

More than 10% of adults with the virus have developed resistance to these drugs in 12 nations [see Resistance Rises graphic at the source URL above]. Above this threshold, it's not considered safe to prescribe the same HIV medicines to the rest of the population because resistance could increase. Researchers published the findings this month [July 2019] in WHO report [1].

"I think we have kind of crossed the line," says Massimo Ghidinelli, an infectious-disease specialist at the Pan American Health Organization in Washington DC. Overall, 12% of women surveyed had a drug-resistant form of HIV, compared with 8% of men.

Particularly concerning, says the report, is the high level of resistance in infants with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2012 and 2018, about one-half of newly diagnosed infants in 9 of the countries in this region had a form of HIV that was resistant to efavirenz, nevirapine or both.

The causes of drug resistance remain elusive, says Silvia Bertagnolio, an infectious-disease physician at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland, and co-author of the report. But drug-resistant HIV might develop when people interrupt treatment, she suggests. For example, many women living with the virus might have taken antiretrovirals during pregnancy to prevent their babies from becoming infected, but stopped after delivery. The WHO recommended this practice until 2015, when it suggested that pregnant and breastfeeding women use the drugs for life.

The prevalence of resistance in people who restarted efavirenz and nevirapine after interrupting treatment was much higher (21%) than in first-time users (8%).

People living with HIV might go on and off the drugs for several reasons. Stigma plays a huge part, says Bertagnolio; they might not want to be seen picking up their medicines. Drug shortages at clinics could also contribute, the report noted.

In response to the evidence, the WHO has recommended that countries use dolutegravir, which is more effective and tolerable than other therapies, as the go-to HIV drug. The likelihood that the virus will develop mutations and, eventually, resistance is lower with dolutegravir than with other antiretrovirals, says Roger Paredes, an infectious-disease physician at the Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. "We have to encourage a worldwide transition to dolutegravir," he adds.

Bertagnolio agrees, but calls for caution. If treatment delivery is poor or patchy, resistance could emerge. "We don't want to find ourselves in the same situation we're in."

[The following is the Executive Summary extracted from the full WHO report referenced in the news report above that is available at https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/drugresistance/hivdr-report-2019/en/:

Executive Summary
-----------
"The rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest threats to global health. If it is not urgently addressed, it may result in millions of deaths, an increase in new and hard-to-treat infections and increased health-care costs (1). As a result, combatting AMR, including the threat posed by drug-resistant HIV, is a major goal for the global community. Prevention, monitoring and timely response to population levels of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is critical to achieving the WHO/UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets for 2020 that 90% of people living with HIV know their HIV status, 90% of those who know their HIV-positive status are accessing treatment and 90% of the people receiving treatment having suppressed viral loads. These targets reflect the global community's commitment to eliminating AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. In response to the threat of HIVDR to attaining these goals, the global health community launched a 5-year Global Action Plan on HIVDR (2017-2021) that details a roadmap to prevent, monitor and respond to globally increasing levels of HIVDR. In response to the Global Action Plan, countries and funders are increasingly focusing on establishing robust and routine population-level monitoring of HIVDR to accompany the scaling up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and supporting a safe transition to new antiretroviral (ARV) drugs in 1st- and 2nd-line ART.

"Substantial progress has been made in monitoring the population-level emergence and transmission of HIVDR. Between 2004 and 2018, 49 countries implemented surveys of HIVDR using WHO-recommended standard methods. A further 35 countries have plans to conduct surveys (Fig. 1). This report presents findings from 44 nationally representative HIVDR surveys implemented in 24 low- and middle-income countries using WHO standard survey methods (2).

"In 12 of 18 countries reporting survey data to WHO between 2014 and 2018, levels of pretreatment HIVDR (PDR) to efavirenz (EFV) and/or nevirapine (NVP) among adults initiating 1st-line ART exceeded 10% (Fig. 2). Overall, levels of NNRTI PDR are nearly twice as high among women as among men.

"These findings are important, since women comprise a larger proportion of the population living with HIV globally and especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest burden of HIV infection. Another subpopulation at high risk of PDR is individuals reinitiating 1st-line ART and reporting previous exposure to ARV drugs (for example, for preventing the mother-to-child transmission of HIV, previous ART for treating HIV infection, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) believed to have been taken since the person became HIV positive). Twelve of 18 surveys included both ARV drug-naive ART initiators and ART starters reporting previous exposure to ARV drugs.

"Among 1st-line ART initiators reporting prior ARV drug exposure, PDR to efavirenz and/or nevirapine is nearly 3 times higher than among ARV drug-naive individuals starting ART.

"These findings are relevant, since the proportion of people starting treatment reporting previous ARV drug exposure ranged from 1.2% to 26.3% in countries reporting data and is projected to increase with the continuing global scale-up of ART.

"A concerted global response to increasing levels of PDR is of paramount priority to WHO and its global partners. In 2017, WHO issued guidelines recommending using an alternative 1st-line regimen that does not contain efavirenz or nevirapine in countries in which resistance to these drugs exceeds 10% (1). In addition, 2018 WHO ARV guidelines recommended the rapid adoption of dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens as the preferred 1st-line treatment for adults and children that, if implemented, will help avert the negative effects of resistance to non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).

"The prevalence of PDR among children 18 months or younger diagnosed with HIV through national early infant diagnosis programmes is alarmingly high. Based on surveys conducted in 9 countries in sub-Saharan Africa between 2012 and 2018, over half of the infants newly diagnosed with HIV carry a virus that is resistant to efavirenz and/or nevirapine. Levels of PDR to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) also exceed 10% in some countries.

Since 2013, WHO has recommended using protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART regimens for children younger than 3 years old, and in 2018 WHO formally encouraged the phaseout of NNRTIs across age groups, with the introduction of DTG for children with approved dosing. However, in 2017, globally nearly 77% of young children were still receiving nevirapine in 1st-line ART because of limited supplies of child-friendly drug formulations (1). Continual efforts to expand the capacity of manufacturing lopinavir/ritonavir pellets formulations and to accelerate the investigation and introduction of DTG across lower weight bands are required since the very high levels of PDR make NNRTI-based ART highly suboptimal. Levels of PDR to NRTIs, including abacavir (ABC), are also high in some countries, underscoring the need to routinely monitor population levels of resistance, especially when ABC is given in combination with drugs with relatively low genetic barriers to selecting drug resistance such as NNRTIs or raltegravir (a 1st-generation integrase inhibitor).

"Achieving the third 90 target for maximal viral load suppression, thereby preventing the emergence and transmission of HIVDR, is critical for eliminating AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

"Three of the 9 countries reporting findings from acquired drug resistance (ADR) surveys among adults receiving HIV treatment between 2014 and 2018 showed levels of viral suppression exceeding 90%. Across all the surveys, the prevalence of ADR among people receiving ART ranged from 3% to 29%. Among populations receiving NNRTI-based ART with viral non-suppression, the levels of NNRTI and NRTI resistance ranged from 50% to 97% and from 21% to 91%, respectively. Estimates of dual class resistance (NNRTI and NRTI) ranged between 21% and 91% of individuals for whom NNRTI-based 1st-line ART failed.

"The high level of HIVDR among people with viral non-suppression on NNRTI-based 1st-line ART demonstrates the degree to which NNRTI-based regimens are compromised for people with viral non-suppression detected by a single viral load test, indicating the need for rapid switch to 2nd-line ART once failure to suppress viral loads is identified. Equally, the high levels of NRTI resistance at time of treatment failure, including dual-class NRTI resistance, support the need for optimizing the NRTI backbone during treatment switch, as recommended in WHO's 2019 antiretroviral guidelines.

"In addition to routine population-level monitoring of HIVDR, preventing drug-resistant HIV is one of the strategic objectives of the Global Action Plan on HIVDR. WHO recommends monitoring and responding to gaps in quality indicators at the clinic or programme level that are associated with the emergence of HIVDR. These indicators include appropriate prescribing practices, on-time ART pill pick-up (a proxy measure of adherence), retention on ART at 12 months, viral load testing coverage, viral load suppression, ARV drug stock-outs and timely switch to 2nd-line ART. Between 2014 and 2018, 44 of 45 countries with a high burden of HIV reported these data to WHO. Overall data reporting across all the indicators was incomplete, suggesting the need for strengthening systems for monitoring data indicating programme quality.

"Few countries are attaining the expected targets for quality-of-care indicators, suggesting the need for a proactive approach in addressing gaps in the quality of ART service delivery and minimizing the emergence and spread of HIVDR. Retention on ART at 12 months emerges as a programmatic area requiring significant attention and further improvement." - Mod.ML]
