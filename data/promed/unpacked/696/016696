Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) officials received confirmation of anthrax in a horse on an Armstrong County premises on 20 Aug 2021. This is the 3rd confirmed case of anthrax in Texas this year [2021].

The premises is located in the southern portion of the county and has been quarantined. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of other livestock on the premises prior to release of the quarantine.

"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation and encourage producers in the county to consult with their local veterinary practitioner if they have questions or concerns about anthrax," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC State Veterinarian and Executive Director.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. Cases in Texas are most often found in portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney and Maverick counties.

"This is not the first time we have seen anthrax in Armstrong County," said Dr. Schwartz. "Last September [2020], we received confirmation of the disease in a bull on another premises, which serves as a great reminder for producers in the area to vaccinate their animals with the proven and dependable anthrax vaccine."

It is common to see an increase in anthrax cases after periods of wet, cool weather, followed by hot, dry conditions. During these conditions, animals can ingest the anthrax bacteria when they consume contaminated grass and hay or inhale the spores. Outbreaks usually end when cooler weather arrives.

After exposure to anthrax, it typically takes 3 to 7 days for animals to show symptoms of anthrax. Once symptoms begin, death will usually occur within 48 hours. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are all common signs of anthrax in livestock. If you observe wild or domestic animals dying, more than 10 animals at a time, and carcasses show bleeding that is characteristic of anthrax, move livestock away from carcasses immediately.

[Armstrong County is in the Texas panhandle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_County,_Texas), well away from the Texas counties where anthrax has been seen and reported during 1974-2018 (https://dshs.texas.gov/idcu/disease/anthrax/information/data/).

My fellow moderator Mod.TG in Texas informed me of this outbreak in Armstrong County involving cattle, deer, and horses (plural). This TAHC [Texas Animal Health Commission] report is clearly dependent on a singular equine sample submitted to the state diagnostic laboratory in College Station. TAHC is reluctant to share information on disease outbreaks, claiming the need to maintain confidentiality. They define confidentiality strictly. As a result, we see only the shadows of events and can learn nothing of wider implications, which are needed for competent and efficient disease control and prevention.

The recent Texas outbreaks are well away from the areas where this disease is more usually seen, albeit in deer. The state veterinarian states that there had been a bull affected in Armstrong County in 2020. This suggests that anthrax may occur sporadically in the county but is rarely reported, and why they recommend vaccination. - Mod.MHJ
