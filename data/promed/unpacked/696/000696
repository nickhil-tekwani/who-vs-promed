Greenhouse bees spread disease to wild bees
-------------------------------------------
Disease spread to wild bumblebees from commercially bred bumblebees used for
pollination in agriculture greenhouses may be playing a role in the
mysterious decline in North American bee populations, researchers said
on Tuesday [22 Jul 2008].

Bees pollinate numerous crops, and scientists have been expressing
alarm over their falling numbers in recent years in North America.
Experts warn the bee disappearance eventually could harm agriculture
and the food supply.

Scientists have been struggling to understand the recent decline in
various bee populations in North America. For example, a virus,
Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, brought from Australia has been
implicated in massive honeybee deaths last year [2007] -- see ProMED
archives below.

Canadian researchers studied another type of bee, the bumblebee, near
2 large greenhouse operations in southern Ontario where commercially
reared pollination bees are used in the growing of crops such as
tomatoes, bell peppers, and cucumbers.

The researchers first observed that the commercial bumblebees
regularly flew in and out of vents in the sides of the greenhouses,
escaping from the facilities.

The researchers then devised a mathematical model to predict how
disease might spread from this "spillover" of runaway commercial bees
to their wild cousins. The model predicted a relatively slow build-up
of infection in nearby wild bumblebee populations over weeks or months
culminating in a burst of transmission generating an epidemic wave
that could affect nearly all wild bees exposed. The model also
predicted a drop-off in infection rates as you get further from the
greenhouses.

The researchers then sampled wild bumblebee populations around the
greenhouses, catching bees in butterfly nets, holding them in vials,
and taking them back to a laboratory to screen for pathogens,
including testing their feces.

The patterns that had been predicted by their mathematical model were
borne out by studying the wild bees, they said. Most of the parasites
in the wild bumblebees were found to be at normal levels except for
one intestinal parasite known as _Crithidia bombi_ that is common in
commercial bee colonies but typically absent in wild bumblebees.

The researchers found that up to half of wild bumblebees near the
greenhouses were infected with this parasite. "All of the different
species of bumblebees that we sampled around greenhouses showed the
same pattern: really high levels of infection near greenhouses and
then declining levels of infection as you moved out," said Michael
Otterstatter of the University of Toronto, one of the researchers.
"It was quite obvious that this was coming from the greenhouses and
it was a general adverse effect on the bumblebees," Otterstatter
added in a telephone interview.

He said the parasite weakens and often kills bees. The "spillover" of
disease from commercial colonies may be a factor in the decline of
bee populations in North America, he added.

The study, published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS
ONE, is available at

Between 1992 and 1994, queens of _Bombus occidentalis_ and _B.
impatiens_ were shipped to European rearing facilities, where
[bumblebees] were produced and then shipped back to the USA for
commercial pollination. [The Netherlands is the world's largest
commercial bumblebee producer]. Bumblebee expert Robbin Thorp
[Professor Emeritus, UC Davis Dept. of Entomology] has hypothesized
that these bumblebees acquired a disease (probably a virulent strain
of the microsporidian _Nosema bombi_) from a European bumblebee that
was in the same rearing facility, the Buff-tailed Bumblebee (_Bombus
terrestris_). The North American bumblebees would have had no prior
resistance to this pathogen. Dr. Thorp hypothesizes that the disease
then spread to wild populations from exposure to commercially reared
_B. impatiens_. In the late 1990's, biologists began to notice that
wild bumblebees were severely declining.

[Other countries are also concerned about their bees. It may be a
combination of factors. It may be disease and parasites, as this
article leads one to believe, or it may have something to with
chemicals, as ProMED-mail 20080613.1868 reports. It may take a
combination of actions to reverse the decline of the bee population.
This decline will likely affect the pollination of a variety of
foods, which could affect an already high price and even availability
of certain foods. - Mod.TG

This decline is different from CCD, Colony collapse disorder of
honeybees (see ProMED refs. below.) It's another example of the
consequences of the unintentional introduction of an exotic disease.
But it surprises me that greenhouse growers don't screen the vents to
prevent the escape of their investment.
