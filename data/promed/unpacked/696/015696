- Thu 12 Dec 2019. Disease outbreak news: Update
[WHO Disease Outbreak News (abridged, edited)]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-december-2019-ebola-drc/en/

27 new confirmed cases were reported from 4-10 Dec 2019 in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The confirmed cases this week were reported from 7 health areas in 4 health zones: Mabalako (67%, n=18), Beni (22%, n=6), Mandima (7%, n=2), and Oicha (4%, n=1). This is a substantial increase in the number of reported cases compared to the average of 7 confirmed cases for the previous 3 weeks. All of these cases are linked to 3 transmission chains. Of these 27 new cases, 20 (74%) were registered contacts, including 10 (37%) who were being followed up regularly. One community death was reported in an individual whose body was intercepted by response personnel at a point of control as they were being transported from Lwemba Health Area; a safe and dignified burial was performed. All other cases were referred to an Ebola Treatment Centre.

The majority of these new cases are linked to a single chain of transmission, in which one individual was a potential source of infection for 17 people. This is the 2nd documentation of EVD illness in this individual within a 6-month period. An investigation is ongoing to understand the circumstances around this case. Among the possibilities being investigated are reinfection and relapse. Reinfection would mean a person who has recovered from EVD is infected with EVD from another person; there has never been a documented case of this. Rare cases of relapse have been documented, in which a person who has recovered from EVD gets disease symptoms again.

In the past week, there were 6 new cases among health workers; 5 of which were traditional practitioners, bringing the total number of health workers infected in this outbreak to 169 (5% of all reported cases).

In Beni and Mabalako Health Zones, the overall average percentage of contacts under surveillance in the last 7 days has returned to levels seen prior to the security events in past weeks. The volume of alerts and the proportion of alerts investigated within 24 hours has made similar improvements.

In the past 21 days (20 Nov-10 Dec), 42 confirmed cases were reported from 15 of the 71 (21%) health areas within 4 neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (60%, n=25), Mandima (19%, n=8), Beni (17%, n=7), and Oicha (5%, n=2). The majority of the cases (95%, n=40) are linked to known chains of transmission. Mambasa Health Zone recently cleared 42 days without any new confirmed cases.

As of 10 Dec 2019, a total of 3340 EVD cases were reported, including 3222 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2210 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1881) were female, and 28% (n=941) were children aged less than 18 years.

Weekly Ebola cases spike, involve 3 transmission chains

The number of Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak for the week ending 10 Dec 2019 substantially increased, with 27 reported, up sharply from the average weekly total of 7 reported during the previous 3 weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest weekly snapshot of the epidemic.

The spike in cases underscores earlier WHO warnings that illness numbers could increase again, given suspensions in response operations owing to deadly security incidents that occurred about 2 weeks ago.

One chain sparked by patient with 2nd illness:
All of the new cases are linked to 3 transmission chains, and 20 of the patients were registered contacts of known cases, 10 of whom were under regular follow-up. The 4 main hot spots are Mabalako (18), Beni (6), Mandima (2), and Oicha (1).

17 of the new cases were part of a single transmission chain that was linked back to a patient who got sick with Ebola a 2nd time, with investigators working to determine whether the illness is a relapse or a reinfection.

Relapse has been documented before in a few patients, and the Ebola virus has been known to hide out in immune-protected areas of the body, such as the eyes and testes. So far, no cases of reinfection, in which a recovered patient contracts the virus from another person again, have been reported.

In another notable feature of the past week's cases, 6 involved health workers, including 5 traditional healers, bringing the number of health workers infected in the outbreak to 169. Yesterday [12 Dec 2019], the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said a new case was detected in Biena, involving a man who got sick after he visited traditional healers in Mabalako health zone.

One community death, an event that poses a high risk of virus spread, was reported involving a person whose body was intercepted at a checkpoint while being transported from Lwemba; outbreak responders conducted a safe and dignified burial.

In a promising development, response indicators in Beni and Mabalako over the past week have returned to levels seen before the security events.

Outbreak total holds at 3340
No new cases were reported today [13 Dec 2019] in the DRC outbreak, according to numbers reflected on the WHO online Ebola dashboard. Response workers are still investigating 424 suspected cases.

- Fri 13 Dec 2019. Spike in cases
The Guardian [abridged, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/13/spike-ebola-cases-alarms-health-officials-drc

[Byline: Peter Beaumont]

Health officials are investigating an alarming spike in Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with many blamed on a single individual who appears to have contracted the disease for a 2nd time this year [2019].

Amid the struggle to bring the 16-month outbreak under control, the World Health Organization noted an almost 300% increase in cases in the last 3 weeks, with 17 of 27 linked to a single chain of transmission.

According to officials, it appears to be the 2nd time the person has been documented as suffering from Ebola in 6 months. An investigation is being held to understand the circumstances around the case.

Ten cases were notified on Wed [11 Dec 2019] in Mabalako, North Kivu province, where the individual is believed to be from, after another 6 on Tue 10 Dec 2019, according to officials, who noted that 3 out of the 6 were practitioners of traditional medicine.

The spike -- and the worrying circumstances behind it -- appears to buck a trend towards a declining number of cases, although security issues in the key zones of Beni, Biakato and Mangina had recently paralysed the response after violent attacks on health workers.

Among the possibilities being examined are reinfection with the disease -- which would ring the most serious alarm bells as no case of reinfection has ever been recorded before -- or a relapse. While rare cases of relapse have been documented in which a person who has recovered from Ebola gets its symptoms again, reinfection would mean a person who has recovered has been infected anew with the virus by another person, a circumstance so far undocumented.

Experts have long been anxious about the risk of recurrence because the virus can persist for months in areas of the body that are immunologically protected, including semen, vaginal fluids, sweat, aqueous humor, urine, breast milk and even spinal fluid after initial onset and recovery.

That has led researchers to speculate about the continued risk of transmission in individuals not showing any symptoms, including through sexual activity, leading to reactivation of the illness.

Reinfection, relapse and recurrence are all sources of acute concern in controlling the outbreak, as Ebola survivors are employed widely in treatment centres in DRC on the assumption they cannot usually recontract or transmit the disease.

In July 2019, another patient died from what was also presumed to be a relapse or reinfection, calling into question the assumption that Ebola survivors have lifelong immunity from the virus.

DRC-Ebola: Armed attacks are the source of the increase in cases of the disease (Muyembe)

Recent armed attacks have caused an increase in cases of Ebola virus disease in the DRC. From 29 Nov-11 Dec 2019, 34 cases were recorded. The supplies, for example, in the Biena health zone in North Kivu have been weakened. This area, which remained 85 days without cases of the disease, recorded a case on 11 Dec 2019 from the Aloya health area. These figures were given this Sat 14 Dec 2019, by Dr. Jean Jacques Muyembe Ntamfum, technical secretary of the multisectoral committee of the response, in Kinshasa.

"It should be noted that after each armed attack, the necessary response activities to break the chain of transmission are interrupted, paralyzed, or are idle for an indefinite period. Therefore, an increase in cases is observed for a few days after each attack, " he said.

He also announced the resumption of response activities, including vaccination at Biakato Mines where, as of 11 Dec 2019, 12 people have been vaccinated, including 8 high-risk contacts and 4 contact contacts.

"There has been a slight improvement in the security situation in these areas. Threats to the response remain high, but there has been a reduction in incidents of community violence. The teams have resumed activities, despite the unstable and unpredictable security situation in the Biakato and Aloya districts and soon in Lwemba, which until then had been inaccessible by the response teams," he explained.

Since the start of the epidemic, 239 health areas in 29 health zones across the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri have recorded at least one case of Ebola, he added.

Ebola spreads in Congo after militants attack treatment camp: WHO

Cases of the deadly Ebola virus have risen in the Democratic Republic of Congo where health care workers remain largely cut off from the disease's hotspots since militants attacked their camp, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri 13 Dec 2019.

27 Ebola cases were confirmed in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the week through 10 Dec 2019, against an average of 7 in the last 3 weeks, WHO said.

Ebola is highly contagious and spreads through bodily fluids.

Militia fighters in eastern Congo killed 4 people and wounded several in attacks on 2 Ebola response centers 2 weeks ago, in what responders described as a serious setback to efforts to contain the epidemic.

"Insecurity is one of the main challenges that we are facing because it prevents us (from reaching) the communities to protect them against Ebola," Dr Michel Yao, WHO incident manager, told a Geneva briefing.

A helicopter is to be used as an air bridge to ferry epidemiologists and vaccinators to insecure areas and bring them back the same day, he said. More than 20 people from the stricken Biakato mine area were vaccinated on Thu 12 Dec 2019, he said.

"When we cannot access the community, we cannot perform surveillance activities, including vaccination, which has been one of the key innovations that help us really to stop the spread out of this country to others," Yao said.

Beni base managers take steps to avoid cases of Ebola virus contamination
-----------
In Beni, the basic authorities of the neighborhoods that welcome the displaced from the areas affected by the Ebola virus are taking steps to ensure that these people are properly followed in order to limit the risk of contamination. They must identify themselves upon arrival.

This is the case of the Bunzi and Pasisi districts which receive the most IDPs. The information was given by Pasisi district chief Jean de Dieu Kanzoka Siluhwere in an interview with KomaEbola. For this Thu 12 Dec 2019, for example, he said, 17 IDPs from the Mandima health zone were identified.

"To manage the situation of our visitors, we record them in a notebook as soon as they arrive. We have ready teams who follow up in their different plots every morning to find out who arrived, who fell ill," he explained before continuing.

"My citizens have understood all this. They are alerting me to say that there are visitors at their place. They are aware of the existence of Ebola virus disease. This morning, we received 17 visitors. The population sent me a telephone message and the cell heads went to register their names and then deposit them at my office," explained Jean de Dieu Kanzoka Siluhwere.

In recent weeks, displaced people from Ebola-affected areas have been arriving in Beni because of insecurity. So local authorities are taking steps to avoid cases of contamination. Among these people, there are high-risk contacts who are even confirmed positive for the Ebolavirus. The districts of Pasisi and Bunzi receive most of these people.

[Byline: Fiston Mahamba]

The messages circulating on social networks announcing that Japanese researchers will launch a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a new vaccine against the Ebola virus disease, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, are false. Congo Check has just conducted research on this subject.

"DRC: Japanese researchers announce the launch of a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a new Ebola vaccine in the east of the country. It has so far been tested on monkeys, not humans. It is based on an 'inactivated' form of the virus," said one of the publications on this list of information.

"In the phase 1 study in Japan involving 30 participants, 15 people will receive a low dose of vaccine, and 15 people will receive a high dose," said Kawaoka, who also works at the University of Tokyo, said the document.

If the vaccine turns out to be safe and effective, a larger study will be conducted in Africa, where Ebola outbreaks have occurred in recent years, including an ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, says the same source.

"The vaccine uses technology created a decade ago by Peter Halfmann, a scientist in the Kawaoka laboratory. The technology has been used safely to study the virus, identify potential drugs against it, and to make the vaccine," said the UW-Madison document seen by Congo Check.

Original Publication Date: 12 Dec 2019

Abstract
An association between malaria and risk for death among patients with Ebola virus disease has suggested within-host interactions between _Plasmodium falciparum_ parasites and Ebola virus. To determine whether such an interaction might also influence the probability of acquiring either infection, we used a large snapshot surveillance study from rural Gabon to test if past exposure to Ebola virus is associated with current infection with _Plasmodium_ spp. during nonepidemic conditions. We found a strong positive association, on population and individual levels, between seropositivity for antibodies against Ebola virus and the presence of _Plasmodium_ parasites in the blood. According to a multiple regression model accounting for other key variables, antibodies against Ebola virus emerged as the strongest individual-level risk factor for acquiring malaria. Our results suggest that within-host interactions between malaria parasites and Ebola virus may underlie epidemiologic associations.

[The authors point out that this epidemiological link between Ebola virus exposure and malaria is consistent with reports of high co-infection frequency during the 2014-2016 outbreak of EVD in West Africa (2) and suggest that ecological processes between the 2 pathogens potentially influencing patient survival (3,4) may also influence susceptibility or transmission. See publication for references. However, this report is examining co-existence of IgG antibody to Ebola virus and susceptibility to malaria. Since IgG is long lasting, it does not suggest co-infection. Thus, whether there is a relationship with time post-infection with Ebola virus needs to be determined for enhancement of susceptibility to malaria occur. There are implications for the Ebola treatment protocol if this association is borne out, but more research needs to be conducted to understand the apparent association between the 2 agents. - Mod.LK
