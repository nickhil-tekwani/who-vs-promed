A herd of 120 cross-bred Angus x Hereford cattle was grazing [in Laprida, Buenos Aires Province] a single pasture with very little vegetation supplemented latterly with grain. The zone had suffered excessive flooding during the 2012 winter. This farm had had no anthrax outbreaks in the previous 30 years, and the stock had not been vaccinated.

During the last week (10-16 Feb 2013), 9 animals died suddenly, 5 cows and 4 calves at heel. All suffered acute deaths with blood extravasation from natural openings, made worse by scavenging birds feeding on their eyes.

This event was reported to the Veterinary Services, and the carcasses were handled in the traditional manner by covering them with lime and then with a thick plastic tarpaulin weighted down along its margins. An Epidemiologic Alert was issued when one of the farm gauchos developed a skin lesion after skinning one of the calves. Such reports to the national authority SENASA are obligatory since 1930.

[Our thanks, yet again, to Ramon for this report. I apologise for the delay in posting, but I have been on the road.

Normally, one doesn't see anthrax with calves, mainly because they are suckling, not grazing, but these calves will have been some 7 months old. How these animals acquired their infections is not obvious, as the estancia had been free for some 30 years. One can propose that the winter flooding transported buried spores up to the soil surface, but then why the delay in onset?

My rancher friends tell me that they see outbreaks in their animals when it has been hot and dry -- which stresses the animals -- but usually around 10 days after a brief shower. This shower allows the short grazing to sprout, making it very attractive to graze, and the rain will have loosened the soil, ensuring that it is ingested along with the grazing, as cattle tug their feed out of the ground with their tongues. Normally, cattle eat 5-6 lbs of soil each day when the soil is loose enough to release the forage roots. The only other explanation would be that they were receiving contaminated bone meal in their feed supplement. - Mod.MHJ
