[Because of their careful grazing, horses are rarely the primary cases in an outbreak but are infected by female tabanid flies that had previously fed on an anthrax-infected cow. The flies then infect the horse(s) with their contaminated mouthparts when feeding on a horse on the same farm or in a neighbouring stable. We must await further outbreak reports to OIE for confirmation.

Zhambyl is in the midst of an area of Kazakhstan where livestock anthrax occurs. For a description of Zhambyl, go to http://spktaraz.kz/eng/jambul/ and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambyl_Region. To confirm we are in the right part of Kazakhstan on the southern border with Kyrgyzstan, go to Zhualy, the paired district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhualy_District). - Mod.MH
