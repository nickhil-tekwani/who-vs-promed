The federal Ministry of Agriculture has issued a phytosanitary alert
for an outbreak of a plant pathogenic virus threatening the
production of tomatoes and [chilli] capsicum in Sinaloa. To date,
over 200 hectares have been devastated by this virus.

The alert is for all vegetable crops susceptible to these pathogens.
If urgent measures are not taken, the disease may spread to all
stages of the cultivation cycle. It has been recommended that growers
must be licensed and only use certified disease free planting
material. In addition, a programme to eliminate all diseased crop
plants, as well as symptomatic weeds near crops, will be carried out
to remove virus inoculum. Unnecessary use of pesticides should be avoided.

[A number of virus diseases of tomato and capsicum have been reported
from Mexico or are rife in the region, including begomoviruses of the
leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clade and _Tomato golden mottle virus_
(ToGMoV). In addition, the new Tomato marchitez virus [ToMarV;
proposed new genus Torradovirus] was reported from Sinaloa in 2007 as
the cause of marchitez disease, which causes great damage to tomato
cultivation in Mexico. It is not clear which of the viruses or
combination of viruses is referred to above.

All these viruses can be transmitted by whitefly vectors (such as
_Bemisia tabaci_) and with infected plant material including
transplants for propagation (the "cultivation cycle" referred to
above). Whiteflies are widely distributed and many weed species can
serve as reservoirs for both vectors and viruses. Disease management
of these viruses relies on control of the vector and possible
pathogen and/or vector reservoirs by means such as the ones
recommended above. Pesticide applications for vector control have
occasionally caused problems with chemical residues on fruits, and,
therefore, farmers are cautioned in this alert. In some cases, crop
cultivars with increased virus resistance are available, but they
need to be assessed for their suitability to local requirements.
