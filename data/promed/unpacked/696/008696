Doctors in Sudan's Northern State have reported 27 deaths and 68 [abortions] among livestock in the area of El Nafaab in Merowe locality and warn of the emergence of cases of Rift Valley fever [RVF] and chikungunya, similar to last year [2020]. They have appealed to the Ministry of Health and the state government to deal with the potential epidemic in a safe manner.

In a press statement on Sunday [5 Sep 2021], the Socialist Doctors Association reported that a resident of the state arrived at Merowe General Hospital suffering from fever and low blood platelets [thrombocytopenia]. The association noted that in October [2020], Merowe locality recorded 4578 miscarriages and an unspecified number of deaths among livestock [see comment].

The Ministry of Health collected 40 samples last month [August 2021] [from human patients? - Mod.AS], but the results have not been announced yet. According to the report of the Ministry of Health, the number of [human] deaths last year reached 45 cases; however, other reports say that the number of deaths exceeded 189 cases, in addition to complications from the nervous system and blindness.

The association called on the resistance committees and professional bodies "to put pressure on the state government and the transitional authority so that samples are taken and the results announced in all transparency and that all preventive and curative interventions are taken."

[Rift valley fever [RVF] occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors. In fact, FAO's RVF monitoring/early warning tool views high precipitation as conditional for RVF epizootics in Sub-Saharan Africa.

According to SkyNews Arabia, dated 14 Sep 2021 (see <tinyurl.com/34nsep6x>), the Sudanese authorities announced Monday [13 Sep 2021] that the monsoon floods in the country this year [2021] have left more than 80 people dead and destroyed thousands of homes in whole or in part. According to UN estimates, more than 100 000 people have been affected by these heavy rains and floods since July [2021].

Notably, heavy floods during the same season in 2020 were accompanied by reports of RVF outbreaks, affecting humans and livestock (ProMED posts 20201102.7908919 and 20201018.7868637). Such conditions were observed also during earlier RVF events in Eastern Africa and Sudan.

Results of the tests applied in the samples collected, from human and animal, are anticipated.
