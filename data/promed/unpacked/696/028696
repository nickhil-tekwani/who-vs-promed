[Multiple outbreaks of LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) of several serotypes (H7N7, H7N1, H5N2) have been reported in commercial ostrich farms in South Africa, mainly in the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces, during recent years.

In addition to the new H7 outbreak reported in the above OIE initial notification, another epizootic, caused by LPAI H5N2, is still continuing during 2015 since its start on 28 Jan 2014. This H5N2 epizootic has caused, so far, 43 outbreaks in the 2 mentioned provinces; the most recent follow-up report, No. 10, was submitted to the OIE on 30 Oct 2015.
