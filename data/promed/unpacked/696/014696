Experts have expressed concern over the steady rise in the number of reported cases of leishmaniasis in the country.

Data from the Health Ministry show that the number of cases of the disease, also known as kala-azar, rose from 907 in 2018 to 1463 in 2019, before dropping to 1200 last year [2020].

The Head of the Division of Vector-borne and Neglected Tropical Diseases at the Ministry, Sultani Matendechero, now says that [the disease was believed to be prevalent in just 6 counties and now] at least 11 counties are experiencing ongoing transmission of [visceral leishmaniasis]. They include Marsabit, Mandera, Garissa, Turkana, West Pokot, Baringo, Isiolo, Wajir, Kitui, Nakuru, and Nyandarua. Recent reports indicate that Kajiado and Tharaka Nithi have also reported some cases.

Kenya now plans to reduce the number of cases by at least 60 per cent and reduce the incidence by 50 per cent in the next 5 years.

Kala-azar is classified as a neglected tropical disease and is caused by infection with _Leishmania_ parasites, which are spread by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies.

"For a very long time people were suffering from leishmaniasis especially in the arid and semi-arid areas but for some reason we were not able to detect and determine that it is leishmaniasis that is making people fall sick, killing them and making them unable to attend to their economic activities," Matendechero said.

The ministry on Monday [28 Jun 2021] launched the 1st strategic plan for control of leishmaniasis 2021-2025 that aims to guide the control and management of the disease and work towards elimination as a public health concern.

"We are not sure if these are the only counties that have leishmaniasis so as a programme one of the things that now we are reaching out to do in this strategy is to be able to correctly determine all the areas in the country where leishmaniasis is endemic so that we can be able to effectively bring it under control," he said.

The disease presents in 2 forms, visceral leishmaniasis [VL] and cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL]. Visceral leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar, is a chronic and potentially fatal disease of the viscera (particularly the liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes).

It attacks vital organs leading to failure. If left untreated, it can lead to death within two years with a fatality rate of 95 per cent.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis on the other hand is an immune-mediated skin pathology caused by the bite of sandflies infected with the _Leishmania_ parasite. It is characterised by skin lesions, mainly ulcers on exposed parts of the body, leaving life-long scars and serious disabilities.

Kenya has reported 53 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the counties of Nakuru and Nyandarua this year [2021].

"The strategy will guide the control and management of leishmaniasis with a focus on disease ecology and mapping, case identification and management, health systems strengthening, surveillance and vector control," Health CAS [Chief Administrative Secretary] Rashid Aman said.

In Kenya, the nationally recommended 1st-line treatment of VL is paromomycin and sodium stibogluconate combination therapy, while AmBisome [amphotericin B liposomal] is the 2nd line treatment for special VL cases as specified in the revised national guidelines.

[Visceral leishmaniasis, VL, in Kenya is caused by _L. donovani_. VL occurs in outbreaks that are associated with periods of drought when the rate of malnutrition is high. The outbreaks are probably related to people moving from high to low endemic areas due to the lack of food security. Risk factors for VL have been studied and a good correlation was established between the proximity of houses or temporary settlements to termite hills and the risk of transmission. Having a low socioeconomic status and treating livestock with insecticide were also identified as risk factors for VL (Alvar J, VÃ©lez ID, Bern C, et al; WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team.
