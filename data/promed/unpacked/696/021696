Whirling disease parasite found in hatcheries
----------------------------------------
A parasite that causes whirling disease has been detected in rainbow trout
at two state fish hatcheries in Dubois and west of Pinedale. The discovery
is the first known appearance of the spore in a Wyoming Game and Fish
Department hatchery, state officials said.
Whirling disease has been devastating rainbow trout populations in
hatcheries and rivers and creeks across the West. So far the impact in
Wyoming has been minimal. The spore was discovered in several fish during
routine fish health inspections, officials said. Mike Stone, fisheries
chief of the department, said additional testing is underway on other fish
at the two hatcheries. "Until the remaining groups of fish have been
cleared by this additional testing, no fish will be stocked from either
hatchery," he said. Stone said he is optimistic that water systems can be
devised to prevent future infections.
The department began covering hatchery water supplies and improving
facilities last year to reduce the chances of the disease.
