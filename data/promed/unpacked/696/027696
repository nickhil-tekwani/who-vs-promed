Measles outbreak in Burkina Faso
--------------------------------
A measles outbreak in Burkina Faso since late January [2009] has affected
more than 400 people nationwide and led to at least one recorded death,
officials from the Ministry of Health told IRIN. "This is atypical because
in recent years we have witnessed a decline in cases," said Ousmane Badolo,
the ministry's director of epidemiological surveillance.

The most recent reported cases were isolated infections in 2005 and 2006,
he told IRIN. The 2009 outbreak occurred in 4 health districts: Fada
(east), Bogodogo (centre), Sindou (west), and Batie (south west).

The outbreak affected those who had not participated in recent vaccination
campaigns, according to Badolo. The health director said he suspected an
increase in cases brought in from infected immigrants. "We need to put more
stress on a routine vaccination campaign for children under 9 months," he
said. As of 10 Feb 2009, the Health Ministry had sent teams to investigate
affected areas.

[According to the World Health Organization (WHO) measles deaths in Africa
fell by 91 per cent between 2000 and 2006, from an estimated 396 000 to 36
000, reaching the United Nations 2010 goal to cut measles deaths by 90 per
cent 4 years early. The spectacular gains achieved in Africa helped
generate a strong decline in global measles deaths, which fell 68 per cent
worldwide -- from an estimated 757 000 to 242 000 -- during this period.
The significant decline in measles deaths in Africa was made possible by
the firm commitment of national governments to fully implement the measles
reduction strategy, which includes vaccinating all children against measles
before their 1st birthday via routine health services and providing a 2nd
opportunity for measles vaccination through mass vaccination campaigns.
Burkina Faso has achieved considerable success in elimination of measles,
but as elsewhere the success of the vaccination programme is being
threatened by importation of infection from elsewhere and lapses in
maintaining comprehensive vaccination coverage.
