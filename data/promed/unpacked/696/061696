Another polio case has been reported from Bajaur district as the number of polio cases has risen to 6 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC), Islamabad notified the polio case from Bajaur district of the tribal districts.

The National Institute of Health isolated wild polio virus from the stool sample of a 30-month-old child from the village of Sheikhan, UC Tali, Tehsil Salarzai, Bajaur District.

A stool sample from the child was collected on [27 Dec 2018] to check for the presence of polio virus. Laboratory testing isolated wild polio virus from the stool sample and confirmed the polio case: which was notified by NEOC Islamabad today [12 Jan 2019]. The total count of polio cases in the tribal districts during 2018 reached 4 polio cases, and 6 in the province of KP.

The family of the child recently moved from Baluchistan to Bajuar, around a month before the date of onset (when the child became paralyzed because of polio virus). Due to the misconception held by the unfortunate family that the polio vaccine causes sterility, the parents of the child had been refusing vaccination and hiding their son during anti-polio campaigns while they stayed at Baluchistan for the last 28 months.

The family reached Bajour after the November [2018] campaign, and since the child and family were on the move in Bajour, the child was missed in the December [2018] campaign at Bajour as well.

Coordinator EOC Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Capt. Retd. Kamran Ahmed Afridi said: "It is sad that the misconceptions of a caregiver led to the paralysis of another child who had every right to live a healthy and productive life. It is a reminder to everyone that no excuses can save your child from paralysis if the child is not repeatedly vaccinated; it is more cumbersome when this paralysis is life long and not reversible."

He reminded parents that although virus was isolated from 3 other cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts earlier, they didn't develop paralysis, as the children had received full doses of polio vaccines.

He assured parents that polio vaccines are the safest vaccines and appealed to ensure vaccination of their children every month when a polio worker knocks at their door. He said that the virus circulates from core reservoir areas and could strike any unimmunized child anywhere.

The Coordination Unit, Tribal Districts convened an emergency meeting participated in by all stakeholders, and it was decided to launch an urgent mop-up campaign in response to the polio case in UC Tali from [Mon 14 Jan 2019].

[The addition of this case now brings the total number of WPV1 cases reported by Pakistan during 2019 to 10 and the global total of WPV1 associated cases with dates of onset in 2018 to 31.

Not only was this child a "victim" of the WPV1, he was also a victim of fake news leading to parental refusal to vaccinate and an example of the persistent challenges facing the polio eradication effort in the 3 remaining endemic countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria, where there remain pockets of unvaccinated children often due to parental refusal to vaccinate as a result of antivaccination rumors in the countries.

This case has been officially confirmed and appears on the Pakistan End-Polio website http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces under KPTD (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts). According to this website, this is now the 3rd case reported from Bajaur District during 2018, with 2 prior cases with dates of onset on [24 Sep 2018] and [7 Oct 2018] (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2018).
