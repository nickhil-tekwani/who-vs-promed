The number of people killed by the so-called "West Nile virus" [WN
virus] in northern Greece has risen to 8, which brings to 92 the
number of people infected by the bite of the "tiger mosquito," which
transmits the disease.

That is the new summary of the epidemic unleashed in early August
2010, published today [20 Aug 2010] by the Greek Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (KEELPNO), following the death yesterday of
the 8th infected person and registration of 15 new cases of the disease.

In the total of the 92 cases are included 44 patients who have been
discharged, 37 hospitalized individuals -- 8 of them in
intensive-care units -- and 3 infected individuals who have not been
interned in hospitals, in addition to the 8 fatalities. In more than
half the cases, the disease has affected the central nervous system
of patients, most of whom are elderly.

The West Nile virus, which is transmitted through mosquito bites,
causes encephalitis.

In the affected regions transfusions and blood donations have been
banned. The Greek Ministry of Health has also enacted a temporary ban
on the donation of blood by people who have been visiting the
northern states in recent weeks. In its report today, the Prefecture
of the highly touristic region of Jalkidiki says it is making
progress in the campaign to eradicate the problem by the use of pesticides.

[The number of infected people continues to slowly increase, with a
risk of continued WV virus transmission until cold weather arrives.
_Culex_ species are the usual WN virus vectors and several _Culex_
species occur in Greece. The Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes
albopictus_) has become established in Greece. This species is
capable of transmitting WN virus. It would be of interest to know if
WN virus has been isolated from mosquitoes collected in this
outbreak, and if _Ae. albopictus_ is abundant in the outbreak area.
