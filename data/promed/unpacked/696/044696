In a report to the county commissioners, Clinical Services Director Amber Frost said the [Swain County] health department had 21 reported cases of hepatitis B in 2015 compared to only 2 in 2014. "We're worried about it, and the state is also worried about it," she said. "Once you get it, you have it forever. There's not a lot that can be done, so prevention is a big thing."

The reality is if Swain County Health Department saw 21 cases in 2015, there are probably many more cases that are going unreported. Frost added that hepatitis B can also be passed from mother to baby. "Most people don't know they have it so they can pass along to others," she said. "People only go to the ER when they're sick, so they're passing it around without knowing. There's no telling how many cases go unreported."

Unfortunately, Frost said there is probably a strong correlation between the increase in hepatitis cases and the drug problems plaguing Swain and other communities.

Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. According to the CDC, it is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; or from mother to baby at birth. The virus can affect people differently -- some people have an acute, or short-term, illness but others can get a long-term, chronic infection. Risk for chronic infection is related to age at infection. The CDC reports that about 90 percent of infected infants become chronically infected, compared with 2 to 6 percent of adults. Chronic hepatitis B can lead to serious health issues, like cirrhosis or liver cancer.

According to the CDC, chronic HBV infection results in an estimated 2000 to 4000 deaths per year in the USA. There are several antiviral medications for persons with chronic infection but there is no cure. The good news is there is a vaccine to prevent HBV.

[Although not specifically stated, it is likely that the report is referring to new cases of acute hepatitis B infection rather that the discovery of cases of chronic infection. As with previous posts regarding hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B is easily spread through sharing needles among illicit drug users, and increasing transmission of all 3 of these viruses have been reported in 2015 among this cohort. Since hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination, it would be interesting to know the immunization status of the acute HBV cases. Education regarding these viruses and establishing needle-exchange programs can limit spread.
