99/137 First report of citrus tristeza closterovirus in Albania
A survey was carried out for the presence of citrus tristeza closterovirus
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) in the main citrus-growing areas of Albania. A
total of 543 samples was collected from individual trees (481 from
commercial groves and 62 from the varietal collection of the Research
Institute of Pomology of Vlora) and tested (DAS-ELISA, confirmation by
indexing on Mexican lime seedlings). As a result 19 samples were found
infected by citrus tristeza closterovirus. Infected trees from commercial
groves were satsumas (_Citrus unshiu_) and sweet oranges (_C. sinensis_).
In the varietal collection, CTV was found in a single tree of orange cv.
Navel and satsuma, 3 lemons cv. Meyer (_C. limon_) and 2 citrons cv.
Diamante (_C. medica_). Infected trees were scatted in the orchards and
none of them showed decline symptoms. The authors noted that urgent
eradication measures are needed. This is the first report of citrus
tristeza closterovirus in Albania.
