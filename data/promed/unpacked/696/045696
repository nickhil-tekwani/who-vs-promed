[In the past 4 days since the last ProMED-mail update, there have been no newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia. It is still too early to declare transmission interruption in Buraidah, where there was documented nosocomial transmission, as the most recent case was reported on 10 Jan 2017 (albeit we do not have information on the date of onset of the MERS-CoV illness in this individual). - Mod.MPP]

[As of 31 Dec 2016, the global tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported to WHO is 1879 cases including at least 666 related deaths. Of note is that the above WHO update contains information on a newly reported case that had not previously been reported on the Saudi MoH MERS-CoV website (case no.4 above). This case may well be the individual reported as a recovery on 6 Jan 2017, reported then as a 60 year old Saudi male from Madinah. If so, this would increase the official number of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by Saudi Arabia since September 2012 to 1538 cases.
