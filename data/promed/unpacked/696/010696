[Case count information as of 9 pm EDT, 7 Jul 2008]

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Indian Health Service, and the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration)
to investigate an ongoing multi-state outbreak of human _Salmonella
[enterica_] serotype Saintpaul infections. An initial epidemiologic
investigation comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons
identified consumption of raw tomatoes as strongly linked to illness.
Recently, many clusters of illnesses have been identified in several
states among persons who ate at restaurants. These clusters led us to
broaden the investigation to be sure that it encompasses food items
that are commonly consumed with tomatoes. Fresh tomatoes, fresh hot
chili peppers such as jalapenos, and fresh cilantro are the lead
hypotheses. However, at this point in the investigation, we can
neither directly implicate any of these ingredients as the single
source, nor discard any as a possible source.

Since April 2008, 991 persons infected with _S._ Saintpaul with the
same genetic fingerprint have been identified in 41 states, the
District of Columbia, and Canada. These were identified because
clinical laboratories in all states send strains from ill persons to
their State public health laboratory for characterization. One new
state, West Virginia, reported an ill person. The number of ill
persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (2 persons),
Arkansas (13), Arizona (47), California (8), Colorado (13),
Connecticut (4), Florida (2), Georgia (24), Idaho (4), Illinois (95),
Indiana (14), Iowa (2), Kansas (17), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (1),
Maine (1), Maryland (29), Massachusetts (24), Michigan (7), Minnesota
(10), Missouri (12), New Hampshire (4), Nevada (11), New Jersey (9),
New Mexico (98), New York (28), North Carolina (10), Ohio (8),
Oklahoma (24), Oregon (10), Pennsylvania (11), Rhode Island (3),
South Carolina (1), Tennessee (8), Texas (382), Utah (2), Virginia
(29), Vermont (2), Washington (4), West Virginia (1), Wisconsin (11),
and the District of Columbia (1). 4 ill persons are reported from
Canada; 3 appear to have been infected while traveling in the United
States, and one illness remains under investigation [see posting
below. - Mod.LL]

Among the 711 persons with information available, illnesses began
between 10 Apr 2008 and 25 Jun 2008, including 275 who became ill on
1 Jun 2008 or later. Many steps must occur between a person becoming
ill and the determination that the illness was caused by the outbreak
strain; these steps take an average of 2-3 weeks. Therefore, an
illness reported today may have begun 2-3 weeks ago. Patients range
in age from less than 1 to 99 years; 48 percent are female. The rate
of illness is highest among persons 20 to 29 years old; the rate of
illness is lowest in children 10 to 19 years old and in persons 80 or
more years old. At least 194 persons were hospitalized.

Only 6 persons infected with this strain of _S._ Saintpaul were
identified in the country during April through June of 2007. The
previous rarity of this strain and the distribution of illnesses in
all USA regions suggest that the implicated food is distributed
throughout much of the country. Because many persons with
salmonellosis do not have a stool specimen tested, it is likely that
many more illnesses have occurred than those reported. Some of these
unreported illnesses may be in states that are not reported to be
involved. [For current maps regarding case distribution, see original
URL. - Mod. LL]

Health officials have worked continuously since late May 2008 to
investigate this outbreak. CDC has sent 17 people to the field to
work with other public health officials. The investigation is complex
and difficult. One difficult aspect is that people often have
difficulty remembering exactly what foods they ate, and remembering
specific ingredients is even more difficult. Although laboratory
testing of foods might help, perishable foods that were consumed by
ill persons are often not available to test.

[Since ProMED's last posting on this still ongoing outbreak, 48
additional cases have been linked to the implicated strain of _S._
Saintpaul, one more state is involved (West Virginia) and 50 more
cases have occurred in June 2008 or later. To date, 275/991 (nearly
28 percent and increasing) of all cases had the onset of illness
essentially after the announcement of the tomato risk. Additionally,
3 more cases reported from Canada have occurred (but were acquired in
the USA, see below). - Mod.LL]

Health officials have confirmed that 4 Canadians have been infected
with the same strain of salmonella identified in a USA outbreak that
has sickened at least 943 people.

Public health officials said Monday evening [8 Jul 2008], 3 of the
people became ill after returning from a trip the USA.

"Cross-border cases are expected given the size of the outbreak in
the USA, and travel by Canadians to the USA," the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency and the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a release.

Canadian health officials confirmed the 1st case, which involved an
Ontarian who had travelled to the USA on 3 Jul 2008.

[This is the 1st time the onset of disease was reported to have
occurred in July 2008, a full month after the outbreak was announced.
In these individuals, it may be possible to link certain foods to the
outbreak more easily. So far, no cases have been acquired in Canada. - Mod.LL]
