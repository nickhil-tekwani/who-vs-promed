[We are very grateful to Ian Brown and Ruth Manvell for their following
expedient response to our enquiry. Mods. AS/CP].
To date 4 submissions from budgerigars showing this clinical condition have
been received at VLA Weybridge. From 3 we have isolated an apparently
non-haemagglutinating cytopathic agent on chick embryo primary cells and
Vero cells, but so far we have been unable to type/identify the agent. It
did not grow in embryonated eggs inoculated by the allantoic route. We are
working on characterisation: electron microscopy suggests there may be a
'paramyxovirus like agent' present. It seems extremely unlikely that the
causative agent is APMV-1, APMV-2, or APMV-3. Currently 9 types of avian
paramyxovirus (APMV-1 to -9) have been recognised and in some of these
there are a large number of subtypes. In the past APMV-1, APMV-2, APMV-3
and APMV-5 viruses have been isolated from naturally infected caged birds,
including budgerigars. Whilst in the past isolation of APMV-1, APMV-2, and
APMV-3 has always been relatively straight forward, APMV-5 has proved to be
more difficult.

The "new" virus disease affecting budgerigars -- by John R Baker
----------------------------------------------------------------
There appears to be a new virus disease of budgerigars which could possibly
become widespread in the population.
The disease was first seen in mid-November 2002 and, with the exception of
a possible case still under investigation, all the fanciers involved
purchased birds from a large supplier in the south east. Of the 6 cases
known to the writer [in March 2003] 4 are in that area, and 1 possibly 2
cases may have occurred in the East Riding of Yorkshire although I have not
personally been involved with these Â­ the information I have is that one of
the owners again purchased birds from the same supplier in the south east.
Obviously there may be other cases I am not aware of. So far as I know
there has been no spread from these original cases to the budgerigar
population as a whole, with the possible exception of a disease outbreak
still under investigation. The supplier of the birds has also had an
outbreak of the disease which presumably came to his premises with a bird
or birds which were obtained from elsewhere.
The disease is characterised by a very high death rate and in one case in a
large stud birds were dying at the rate of 6 birds a day. It appears to be
either stressful or immunosuppressive as the dying birds frequently have
other, secondary, conditions. Tests have been carried out to try and
establish the cause of the condition. Bacteriology, except in the case of
secondary infection, has been unrewarding; in one case Chlamydophila was
present but only as a secondary infection. Tests for polyoma virus,
psittacine beak and feather disease and Pachecos disease have been
negative, although further results for the last one are pending. No
evidence of fungi was found. It is assumed that disease is caused by
another virus but this has not been proven.
If this disease becomes widespread in the budgerigar population, which is
not yet the case, the effects could be serious. So steps need to be taken
to limit the spread of the infection.
[Elementary bio-security measures, including hygiene requirements,
decontamination and isolation measures are omitted here; they can be seen
at the <http://www.budgerigarsociety.com/> web-site - Mod. AS].
----- It is hoped that by instigating the above control measures the
disease will be kept under control and not become the potential threat to
the budgerigar fancy that it could be if no controls were used.

[It seems that the budgerigars disease, which remains so far undiagnosed,
has begun its unnoticed spread in the UK more than 7 months ago. This
should not surprise those familiar with the pet-animal multi-billion
industry. There are abundant examples of the uncontrolled evolvement of
diseases in pets, be they terrestrial, avian or marine. Fanciers and,
epidemiologically more important, handlers -- tend to keep health problems
to themselves, as reflected in the fact that only 4 submissions of affected
birds have reached the VLA avian-virology lab so far. Though the import of
budgerigars into the UK as family pets is legally regulated (see DEFRA's
document "Information about importing family pet birds into the UK"
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/regulat/forms/ahealth/inttrade/im98a.pdf>),
it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to effectively monitor their
health status and control their movements. Official or reliable data on the
number of pets and their owners are lacking; anecdotal, unofficial figures
from the UK mention 750 000 households with budgerigars and 260 000 with
canaries.
Disease outbreaks in pets come to light, in many cases, only when
farm-animals or humans get involved. The diseases may spread within and
between countries. Two recent examples may be mentioned, monkeypox (spread
by prairie dogs) in the USA and avian influenza (involving numerous
pet-avian holdings)in the Netherlands. There are many more.
Additional information from practitioners and bona-fide
animal-holders/fanciers or handlers, and more samples available for lab
investigations, might help in limiting further spread and losses. The
alertness of veterinary authorities and practitioners to similar incidents
in imported or endemic budgerigars in other countries is called upon. -

[The 9 types (species) of avian paramyxoviruses. which belong to the
sub-family _Paramyxovirinae_ , are obvious candidates for the etiologic
agent of the budgerigar disease. However, the family _Paramyxoviridae_ has
a second subfamily -- _Pneumovirinae_, with an additional potential
candidate, the avian metapneumovirus. This virus originally designated
Turkey rhinotracheitis virus but is now known also to be a pathogen of
chickens, and to infect pheasants and other birds. There are 4 genotypes of
avian metapneumovirus, one of which is closely related to the human
metapneumovirus recently discovered in the Netherlands. It is certainly
another virus that should be considered, together with the avian
coronaviruses. - Mod. CP]
