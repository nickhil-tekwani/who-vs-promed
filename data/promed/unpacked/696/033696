Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak - WHO Update 13
---------------------------------------------------
Data on cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in Angola are being
reclassified and no nation-wide data can be reported today.
Detailed data are available for Uige, the most severely affected
province, where surveillance has been steadily improving. As of Thu
14 Apr 2005, 224 cases have been reported. Of these cases, 207 were
fatal. Most cases have occurred in Uige municipality, which has
reported 175 cases and 163 deaths. Much smaller numbers of cases have
been reported from a further 7 municipalities in this province.
Improvement of public understanding of the disease and acceptance of
control measures has become one of the most urgent priorities. Today,
meetings were held in the WHO office in Uige with traditional
community leaders, known as Sobas, for all of Uige municipality. The
governor of the province and the director of its health services have
released the Sobas from their present duties for 7 days so that they
can accompany mobile surveillance and medical teams as they search
for cases and collect bodies.
This decision is welcomed as an important step forward in achieving
community acceptance of measures needed to bring the outbreak under
control. WHO staff in Uige now plan to systematically extend the same
procedures, using locally respected Sobas, to all other
municipalities known to be affected by the disease. This plan is
supported by the authorities.
Training to protect staff at the provincial hospital from infection
and reduce the risk of transmission is continuing. Today, training
was provided for 82 nurses in high-risk departments, including the
maternity ward and the laboratory. Heads of departments and doctors
were trained yesterday. Training for health staff in private clinics
and for health workers in the police force is planned for early next
week.
In response to an international appeal launched on 8 Apr 2005, WHO
has received pledges of funding, to support the outbreak response,
from Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the
European Union Humanitarian Office (ECHO).
