Based on the information provided to us, there are now outbreaks at
the Palliser Regional Care Centre (PRCC) and Shaunavon Hospital and
Care Centre (SHCC). Presently, no visitors are allowed into these
facilities. In the PRCC, we have identified the causative organism as
human metapneumovirus (HMPV), which is not vaccine-preventable and a
relatively new organism. Residents suffering from this illness are in
isolation. We are awaiting the identification of the causative
organism in the case of the SHCC.

To protect the employees, residents, and patients of our facilities,
we ask that if you feel under the weather, please refrain from
visiting our long-term care facilities. We are also asking that
visitors who are showing influenza-like signs and symptoms abstain
from visiting long-term care facilities until they are asymptomatic
for at least 48 hrs. "If you are unwell or have been ill during the
past 7 days, please do not visit our facilities within the health
region, except to seek medical care," says Dr. Khami Chokani, Medical
Health Officer for the Cypress Health Region. "Anyone visiting our
facilities should wash their hands prior to entering and upon leaving
the building in an attempt to minimize the risk of transferring any
virus to your loved one or the building they are in. Likewise, our
dedicated staff are also washing and are expected to wash their hands
between patients and procedures. If you do have a cough that requires
medical attention either at your family physician's office or the
hospital emergency room, our sincere request to you is to please ask
for a mask to cover your cough and to protect those that are around
you in the waiting room or attending to you from catching whatever
bug it is that you have!" Frequent and proper handwashing is the most
effective way to help control the spread of viruses. Alcohol based
hand sanitizers are an additional measure to assist in reducing the
risk of spread, but should never be considered a replacement for handwashing.

"The Cypress Health Region will continue to communicate outbreak
status in the affected facilities with the public through various
channels," says Trent Regier, Director of Population Health. "Visitor
restriction will be updated on the Cypress Health Region's website,
<http://www.cypresshealth.ca>, and announced though news releases. If
you are unsure about what restrictions are in place and where, we
suggest phoning the facility to see if visitation is allowed."

The health region would like to remind the public that if they
experience symptoms such as cough, fever, headache, general body
malaise, with or without nausea and/or vomiting, they should consult
their family physician or the province's HealthLine at
1-877-800-0002. HealthLine can also be accessed electronically via
the Internet by visiting

[Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was identified 1st in the Netherlands
as a novel human respiratory pathogen in 2001 and subsequently found
to be present worldwide. From serological studies, it was concluded
that by the age of 5 years, virtually all children in the Netherlands
have been exposed to HMPV and that the virus has been circulating in
humans for at least 50 years. _Human metapneumovirus_ is classified
now as a virus species in the genus _Metapneumovirus_ of the
sub-family _Pneumovirinae_ of the family _Paramyxoviridae_ based on
virological data, sequence homology and gene organisation. The type
species of the genus is _Avian metapneumovirus_, a pathogen of
poultry, and HMPV is closely related to the subgroup C avian
metapneumoviruses, which is present in the USA and in ducks in France.

Biologically, HMPV resembles its more distant relative human
respiratory syncytial virus, but is less prevalent. HMPV is similarly
associated with clinical symptoms in children ranging from upper
respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Both
viruses are responsible for outbreaks of significant respiratory
disease, which can be very severe in the elderly. This is reflected
in the situation in Saskatchewan, where the outbreak of disease is
affecting the Palliser Centre, a geriatric care unit, and the
Shaunavon centre, a general community hospital. November to March is
the peak period for both types of infection in the northern
hemisphere. - Mod.CP]
