An outbreak of salmonellosis cases in children on the northern beaches is being blamed on bandicoot droppings. Northern Sydney Local Health District director of public health Dr Michael Staff said cases of the potentially deadly bacterial infection were rare, but there had been an unexplained spike that began in February 2014.

"So far in 2014, we've had 19 cases confirmed, and while some have been traced to play area sand, it appears that many children may have been infected by contact with bandicoot droppings," Dr Staff said. The Northern Sydney Public Health Unit inspected the backyards of several patients and found that bandicoot droppings collected at a property tested positive for _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Java.

Dr Staff said the bacteria could be transferred by touch. "Young children tend to put their fingers in their mouths a lot, and this could transfer the bacterium to them if they have touched a contaminated surface," Dr Staff said.

To prevent further spread of the illness, the Public Health Unit recommends that parents of young children clear animal droppings from areas where their children play, discourage children from putting their hands or toys in their mouth when playing outside, and make sure their children wash their hands after playing outside. Chicken wire mesh at least 50 cm high [with 2 cm mesh] and buried 15 cm below the surface would stop bandicoots from entering backyards.

[The L (+) tartrate + variant of _S._ Paratyphi B is sometimes referred to as _S._ Java. The classical _S._ Paratyphi B has the tartrate negative phenotype and is generally invasive, causing an enteric, fever-like illness similar to typhoid fever. Although the tartrate positive variant can be invasive, it generally is less invasive and is associated with diarrhea.

The long-nosed bandicoot (_Perameles nasuta_) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-nosed_bandicoot) is a species of bandicoot found in Australia. It is the largest member of its genus, which also includes the eastern barred bandicoot and the desert bandicoot. The long-nosed bandicoot is much less colourful than its relatives, being primarily a brown color. It is distributed along the eastern coast of Australia from Cairns in Queensland to Naringal in southwestern Victoria. It is a nocturnal, solitary predator of invertebrates and tubers.

The bandicoot (http://australian-animals.net/bandi.htm) has 2 features which place it apart from other marsupials (mammals that carry their young in pouches):

1) Having many incisor teeth, as do all insect and flesh eating marsupials,
2) Their 2nd and 3rd toes are grown together (like the kangaroo).

Bandicoots hop around like kangaroos on their larger hind legs, though they are much smaller, ranging from 6 inches to 22 inches in length. Depending on the species, their fur can be orange, grayish, or brown or striped.
