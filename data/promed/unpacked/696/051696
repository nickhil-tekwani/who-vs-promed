This is an important report, as _Brucella melitensis_ has not been
previously reported from Thailand, and in fact Southeast Asia is considered
free from the disease (OIE Manual of Standards, 2000).
Although an epidemic of brucellosis due to _B. abortus_ would not be
expected in goats, especially in the absence of some concurrent abortion
outbreak in cattle, clearly a definitive identification of the causative
Brucella sp. is required to clarify the situation.
If this is a true introduction of an exotic agent into Thailand, then it
was most likely introduced by animal movement from an endemic area. Goats
move into some parts of Thailand from Myanmar (a single outbreak of caprine
brucellosis was reported in 1998 and 1999; OIE 'Handistatus'), but of more
concern would be if the animals came from further west, where other serious
diseases of goats are endemic, e.g., peste des petits ruminants and goat
and sheep pox.
As goats can also be carriers of FMD, there is potential for such animal
movement to shift strains from South Asia to Southeast Asia. This incident
is a marker for an important background event that hopefully will be
unravelled by the epidemiological and laboratory investigations conducted
by the Department of Livestock Development, Thailand.

[Laurence makes some excellent points. This posting has been forwarded to
colleagues in Thailand to obtain the identification and confirmation of the
brucella species involved, as well as the circumstances behind the
outbreaks. While Myanmar is regularly blamed for the introduction of
livestock diseases into Thailand, it is not necessarily the only
extra-national source. - Mod.MHJ]
