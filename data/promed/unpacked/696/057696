Following the 1st report of an outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in the state, the state veterinarian has advised livestock show managers and exhibitors to observe strict biosecurity. Dr Richard Wilkes, state veterinarian with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), has announced that Virginia has just received laboratory confirmation of its 1st case of PED.

In light of this case, which coincides with the beginning of the exhibit season for 4-H members, FFA [Future Farmers of America] students and other livestock exhibitors, Dr Wilkes says strict biosecurity is the most effective and most practical way to prevent the spread of PED and many other livestock and poultry diseases. He is encouraging every person involved in showing livestock to enhance their biosecurity efforts. He said: "We always urge livestock owners who show animals and managers of show and exhibition facilities to keep biosecurity uppermost in their minds but with swine, it is even more important now that Virginia has experienced its 1st case of PED. Good biosecurity can help keep the disease from spreading."

Any time animals are co-mingled at events, there is a risk they may be exposed to an infectious disease agent. Some states have cancelled pre-show weigh-ins or other animal commingling events to try to prevent PED infection of swine. Virginia show managers may want to consider voluntarily cancelling some of the higher risk activities.

The PED virus is highly contagious, and commonly spreads through pig manure. Consuming pork continues to be safe and the disease does not affect humans, but is often deadly to piglets. Practicing and implementing sound biosecurity measures is critical in keeping the state's animals disease-free and marketable.

Dr Wilkes said that good biosecurity and advance planning will reduce the chances of spreading an infectious disease by people, animals, shoes and clothing or equipment. Show managers should have a proper biosecurity plan ready to execute in the event that an animal disease is introduced at a major stock show or event.

VDACS offers the following guidelines to help minimize risk at events where animals co-mingle. Note that these general recommendations also apply to diseases that can be spread between humans and animals.

Biosecurity for animal exhibitors:
- consult your veterinarian to establish an appropriate vaccination program for your livestock prior to attending an event;
- before stalling your animal at an event, make sure the stall has been cleaned and disinfected and use clean, fresh bedding;
- minimize direct contact with other animals;
- use your own water and feed buckets. Avoid letting your animal(s) drink from a communal water trough. Fill water buckets from a faucet, not a shared tank;
- wash your hands thoroughly after handling other animals to minimize the risk of transferring a disease back to your animal;
- before returning home from an event, clean and disinfect your equipment (boots, tack, grooming supplies, buckets, etc) to help reduce the risk of transporting an infectious agent back home;
- isolate your returning animal(s) for 2 weeks or prevent contact with your other animals and watch for signs of illness in all of your animals.
When you come home from a fair/exhibition be sure disinfect your trailer;
- consult your veterinarian concerning these and other steps you can follow which may reduce the risk of your animal acquiring an infectious disease while travelling.

Biosecurity for event organizers:
- minimize contact between animals where possible;
- minimize spread by human hands (limit public access, provide hand sanitizer, establish restricted areas in front of stalls and trailers, post handwashing signs);
- minimize spread by shared equipment and post signs advising participants not to share equipment);
- where practical, provide solid, high-walled stalls to minimise spread of infectious nasal droplets.

Biosecurity when visiting an animal exhibit such as a fair or petting zoo:
- locate handwashing stations and use them often. Always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking;
- use running water and soap whenever possible. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available;
- keep food and drinks out of animal areas;
- never allow children to put their hands or objects such as pacifiers in their mouths while interacting with animals.

"Livestock exhibitions are an enriching and rewarding experience for our youth," said Dr Wilkes. "Implementing simple biosecurity measures to prevent disease spread and having an established plan of action to address disease outbreaks if they occur protects that experience for exhibitors and event managers alike."

[PED virus spreads extremely quickly. While it is sad news that another state has been diagnosed with this virus, the state veterinarian has provided some good biosecurity tips for several levels of a show. Let us hope that levels within the show industry heed these tips and all remain safe for the show season.
