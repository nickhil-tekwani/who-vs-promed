More than 100 cases of food poisoning caused by fish contaminated with parasites occurred in 27 autonomous regions in Japan, Japanese TV reported on 6 Jun 2022.

Mackerel scad, bonito, and sashimi are most likely to be problematic. Now the mackerel is in full bloom season while its body is often parasitic with anisakis. Humans will have food poisoning reactions such as severe abdominal pain and vomiting after eating contaminated fish. Supermarkets in Gunma and Saitama prefectures have stopped selling fish products and suspended fresh fish markets.

Japanese experts said that once the food poisoning caused by anisakiasis occurs, more than 90% of patients will have inflammation near the stomach and probably with long-lasting severe pain, also may have allergic reactions. In this case, the patient needs to see a doctor as soon as possible. The Japanese Association for the Prevention of Food Poisoning believes that global warming has increased the temperature of sea water in recent years, creating a favorable environment for the growth of anisakis.

[_Anisakis_ spp is found worldwide in saltwater fish, including in the arctic. The nematode lives between the intestines of the fish but migrates to the muscles once the fish is caught and killed. Therefore prevention of infection with _Anisakis_ depends on cleaning the fish of internal organs as soon as it is caught.

Raw fish is a common dish in Japan and infections with _Anisakis_ are well known; they have been reviewed recently by Suzuki J et al. (Current status of anisakiasis and anisakis larvae in Tokyo, Japan. Food Saf (Tokyo). 2021; 9(4): 89-100; https://doi.org/10.14252/foodsafetyfscj.d-21-00004). - Mod.EP
