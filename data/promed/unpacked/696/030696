The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 6 Aug 2018:
- a total of 43 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 16 confirmed and 27 probable;
- 46 suspected cases are under investigation;
- 2 deaths of confirmed cases, 1 in Beni, and 1 in Mabalako.

News from the Ebola response
- Since the declaration of the new Ebola virus epidemic in North Kivu province on Wed 1 Aug 2018, the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) has carried out a complete sequencing of the genome of the virus to determine whether it is related to the virus that caused the previous epidemic, which occurred a few months earlier in Équateur province. Although the 2 viruses that caused this year's [2018] outbreaks belong to the Ebola Zaire species, the sequencing results confirmed that the virus strains are completely different. This information is important because, on the one hand, it means that the current epidemic in the territory of Beni is a distinct epidemic, unrelated to the previous one in Équateur, and on the other hand, that the vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV can be used as a response strategy.
- The 1st teams of vaccinators will arrive in Beni this Wed 8 Aug 2018. They will begin by vaccinating primary care providers before vaccinating contacts and contacts' contacts.

[See URL above for table of cases. Remarks:
- To avoid the total number of cases varying (up or down) daily, the suspect cases have been placed in a separate category. Thus, suspect cases with positive laboratory tests will be added to the confirmed category, while negative ones (non-cases) will be removed from the table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation. The investigations will determine whether these deaths are related to the epidemic or not.

Note that the number of cases (deaths) reported from Ituri are now listed as 2 (including 2 deaths) rather the 5 reported earlier. See ProMED-mail Ebola update (61): Congo DR (NK) WHO, cases, response 20180806.5950109 for report on Ituri not having cases.

On 1 Aug 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo notified WHO of a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu province, in the eastern part of the country. The event was initially reported by the North Kivu Provincial Health Authority on 28 Jul 2018 when a cluster of 26 cases of acute haemorrhagic fever, including 20 deaths (mostly in the community), occurred in Mabalako Health Zone during mid-late July 2018. Local health officials additionally identified sporadic, antecedent deaths in the community since May 2018 (tentatively classified as probable cases), which are subject to ongoing investigations to determine if they are related to the current outbreak.

Blood specimens collected from 6 hospitalized case-patients on 31 Aug 2018 were shipped to the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. On 1 Aug 2018, 4 of the 6 blood specimens tested positive for Ebolavirus by GeneXpert automated-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The Ministry of Health Officially declared the outbreak on 1 Aug 2018. Further laboratory testing by INRB confirmed Ebolavirus in 3 of the initial 6 specimens using conventional PCR. The result of the genetic analysis by INRB confirmed Ebola Zaire strain, but not linked to the Équateur outbreak strain, meaning that we are dealing with a new outbreak.

As of 5 Aug 2018, a total of 43 EVD cases, including 34 deaths, have been reported. Between 3 and 4 Aug 2018, 12 specimens tested positive at the field-based laboratory in Beni City, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 16. A total of 27 cases are classified as probable. Of the 34 deaths, 7 occurred in confirmed cases. 2 healthcare workers have been affected, of which 1 died. An additional 31 suspected cases are currently being investigated and awaiting laboratory results to confirm or exclude EVD.

To date, 6 health zones in 2 provinces have reported confirmed and probable EVD cases, including Mabalako, Beni, Butembo, Oicha, and Musienene health zones in North Kivu province and Mandina Health Zone in Ituri province.

Context
-------
The province of North Kivu is among the most populated provinces, with 8 million inhabitants. It shares borders with 4 other provinces (Ituri, South Kivu, Maniema, and Tshopo) as well as with Uganda and Rwanda. The subregion has been experiencing intense insecurity and worsening humanitarian crisis, with over 1 million internally displaced people and a continuous efflux of refugees to the neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania.

The noted continuous efflux of refugees is very concerning since some may become infected and will inadvertently move the virus. It is critical that the bordering countries maintain extremely high vigilance for cases. - Mod.LK

[2] Response
- Tue 7 Aug 2018. Beni: vaccination
[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/08/07/actualite/sante/ebola-beni-la-societe-civile-plaide-pour-la-vaccination-de-toute-la

The civil society, urban coordination of Beni (North Kivu) pleads for a general vaccination of the whole population against the Ebola virus disease. In a statement to the press on Mon 6 Aug 2018, the president of this entity, reverend pastor Gilbert Kambale, thinks that a selective vaccination will not contribute to fight effectively against this disease.

"As you can see, there is a fluidity of transport between Beni and Mangina even in the former Orientale province. Therefore, we think that the collective vaccination would be the right way to stop any spread of this virus in this area," said Kambale.

The Ministry of Health has announced the start of vaccination against Ebola virus for Wed 8 Aug 2018, in Mangina, Beni territory in North Kivu. According to Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe, director general for disease control at the Ministry of Health, this vaccination should only concern healthcare workers, patients' contacts, and their contacts.

But for the reverend pastor Kambale, the royal way would be to vaccinate everyone, especially because of the proximity and flow of movement between the city of Beni and the agglomerations of the Mangina zone, the epicenter of the Ebola virus disease in the territory of Beni. "There are people leaving Mangina to go elsewhere. The spread may be fast. If everyone is vaccinated, it could stop the spread of Ebola in Beni," he said.

The Ebola outbreak was declared on Wed 1 Aug 2018 in Mangina. 43 cases were recorded, resulting in 33 deaths, including 3 confirmed cases.

- Fri 3 Aug 2018. Uganda: Ebola in Congo, bushmeat warning
[Daily Monitor, edited]
http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Ebola-Congo-wild-meat-Kasese-Bundibugyo/688334-4694830-r0n6bfz/index.html
[byline: Lilian Namagembe]

The Ministry of Health has warned Ugandans residing in districts bordering Ebola-stricken DR Congo, against the consumption of bushmeat through which the disease is said to be spread. Leaders in DR Congo on [Tue 31 Jul 2018] confirmed that 20 people had died from the haemorrhagic fever in and around Mangina, a densely populated town about 100 km [62 mi] from the Uganda's Mpondwe border post in the western district of Kasese.

Ms Sarah Opendi, the state minister of health in-charge of general duties, warned people in Kasese and Bundibugyo districts among others, neighboring Congo's Mangina town, against consuming wild animals such as monkeys and birds. The consumption of bushmeat is a common practice in the districts. "It is from where they get this Ebola and we have talked to the people in these districts to stop eating bats and monkeys. People should also ensure good sanitation and stop shaking hands," Ms Opendi warned in a telephone interview with Daily Monitor yesterday [2 Aug 2018].

Measures
--------
The ministry has also reactivated surveillance teams and task forces at Uganda's different border points with Congo to control movements and conduct screening for those entering the country. The same measures have been reinstated at the airport, according to Ms Opendi. "Fortunately, the government in Congo has taken up the matter seriously," the minister added.

The deadly haemorrhagic fever recurs in Congo hardly a week after the country declared the end of an earlier Ebola outbreak that occurred in the northwest Équateur province, where 54 cases were confirmed in May [2018].

- Mon 6 Aug 2018. Salama (WHO) interview
[Science, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), edited]
http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/08/out-frying-pan-fire-new-ebola-outbreak-congo?utm_campaign=news_daily_2018-08-06&et_rid=17103660&et_cid=2238621
[byline: Jon Cohen]

One week after celebrating the end of a potentially explosive Ebola outbreak in Équateur province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Peter Salama received startling news: It was time to again pack his bags and help mount yet another counterattack against an apparently new outbreak in the same country.

Salama, an Australian epidemiologist who heads the Health Emergencies Programme of the World Health Organization (WHO) and is based in Geneva, Switzerland, says he is "more concerned" about the new outbreak -- in North Kivu province, 2500 kilometers [about 1554 mi] east by road of the previous one -- because it appears to be growing rapidly, has already reached a city, and is in a conflict zone with many armed insurgents and refugees.

On 4 Aug 2018, 4 days after the official declaration of the new outbreak, a DRC Ministry of Public Health report tallied 13 confirmed Ebola cases, 30 probable cases, 33 suspected cases, 33 related deaths, and 879 contacts. Initial analysis of the virus shows that it's the Ebola Zaire species, one of 4 that cause disease in humans. Although that's the same one that spread in Équateur, there's no evidence of a link between the 2 outbreaks.

Local health officials first suspected the emergence of Ebola after a 65-year-old woman in the village of Mangina had classic symptoms of the disease, died, and was buried in an unsafe manner, which apparently led to the infection and death of 7 of her relatives. Confirmed cases already have been found in Beni, a city 30 kilometers [about 19 mi] from Mangina that is home to some 350 000 people and only 50 kilometers [about 31 mi] from the border with Uganda.

An experimental vaccine exists but despite performing well in a clinical trial held in Guinea in 2015, it has yet to receive regulatory approval in any country. Under "compassionate use" regulations that require formal research protocols, the DRC's Ministry of Public Health together with Salama's team and Médecins sans Frontières [MSF; Doctors without Borders] staged what is officially a clinical trial of the vaccine in Équateur. None of the 3300 people who received it developed Ebola. (There was no control group, which would be unethical after the successful study in Guinea.) The Ministry of Public Health says it still has 3220 doses of vaccine in Kinshasa and plans to send them to North Kivu if sequencing confirms, as expected, that the virus matches the one used to make the vaccine.

Earlier today [6 Aug 2018], Science Insider spoke with Salama, who is leaving for the DRC on [Thu 9 Aug 2018]. This is a condensed, edited version of the interview.
Q: What did you first think when you heard about this outbreak?
A: My 1st response was, "I hope it's not another one." We've just come out of last one, and we've been working around the clock since May [2018].

Q: This appears to have spread to more people and to more places than in the 1st few days of the confirmed Équateur outbreak. Why?
A: The probable and confirmed cases are in the range of 400 square kilometers [about 154 sq mi], which is not that huge, but it's an area with some big roads -- it's easy to travel from Mangina to Beni. And this is over the course of 3, 4 weeks. It's also a very mobile population: one million of the 8 million people in North Kivu are displaced, and there's lots of commercial activity.

Q: Assuming that this outbreak is separate from the one in Équateur, the DRC has only had 10 outbreaks since 1976 and now one occurs on the heels of another. What's going on?
A: I don't think we can read a trend into 2 data points. A few things are very interesting scientifically. If it turns out to be Ebola Zaire, it's the 1st time we've had Ebola Zaire in this part of the DRC. It's the 1st outbreak in the Kivus, and if you had to anticipate an outbreak in Kivu, most people would have thought it would be Ebolavirus Bundibugyo or Sudan, which both have been in Uganda. That's interesting and begs a series of scientific, epidemiologic, and zoonotic questions.
If it does turn out to be very a similar sequence to Équateur, we have to interpret that cautiously. It's unlikely that it was spread by humans, but it could mean fruit bats have moved the virus over from one side of the country to the other.
We can read a trend into what's happening more broadly beyond Ebola. We're starting to see a worrying occurrence with different outbreak patterns because of climate change, changing animal reserves, population growth and concentration, population displacement, and humans abutting on different animal territories. This trend toward outbreaks in urban areas is gravely concerning.

Q: What most worries you now?
A: Beni is very close to Butembo, a commercial center with a lot of trade that has a population of 800 000 to 1 million. And Beni is on the road to Goma, another major population center, where we've already had suspected cases. Superspreading in a village might mean 7 people in Mangina with an unsecured burial. In an urban area, it might mean one person going to a shopping center and affecting 1000. That's going to be a trend we're going to have to grapple with for years and decades to come.

Q: What are the security issues?
A: There are 100 insurgent groups in the area and 20 are highly active. There have been targeted attacks on peacekeepers, as recently as July [2018]. We'll have to travel with armed military escorts to do surveillance.

Q: The vaccination strategy calls for targeting people who have come in contact with confirmed cases as well as contacts of the contacts, to create a "ring" of protection. How does the volatility of the area affect those plans?
A: We're asking whether ring vaccination is the only possible implementation strategy.
If for security reasons we have areas that are blackouts and we can't do extensive contact tracing, we're asking [WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization] to consider whether they would recommend use of the vaccine still under geographic targeting protocols. So, if a village had 20 cases and 300 people, could we just vaccinate those 300 people? Especially if we have time limitations of how long we can be in a place because of security concerns. And if we go for geographic targeting instead of ring vaccination, we may need far more vaccine.

Q: And there are additional doses of vaccine in the United States with Merck, its manufacturer?
A: Yes, and there are up to 20 000 doses ready to be exported.

Q: A WHO expert panel in May [2018] supported the use of 4 experimental Ebola treatments during the Équateur outbreak, but none was tested. Are they being considered now?
A: We're very keen to ensure the drugs are used, and if possible, we'll look at research protocols. There's not a lot of data with any of the therapeutics, but we want to make sure people get access if someone is unfortunate enough to get Ebola.

Q: Are you at all frustrated that the regulatory process is taking so long to license the vaccine?
A: Do we want to accelerate the process of getting a licensed Ebola vaccine? The answer is absolutely, yes. There's also an interim option to use the vaccine without a research protocol under what's known as the Emergency Use Assessment Listing. We're pursuing that.

Q: How would that work?
A: It would be very important if ring vaccination became more complicated or if we had cases in surrounding countries that have trouble approving research protocols, like South Sudan. But one issue is liability and insurance. Under research protocols, we have clear insurance in the case of adverse events to indemnify the countries. With the Emergency Use Assessment Listing, those don't apply. We're working very hard to get an insurer.

Q: Who is paying for this response?
A: That's a very good question. WHO has made available USD 2 million from our contingency fund to kick-start responses. But we haven't yet finalized our appeal to donors. We do have a small amount of leftover funding from Équateur. We're negotiating with donors, including the Wellcome Trust, if we can repurpose that money.

Q: Given the proximity to Uganda and Rwanda, is there a discussion about whether to declare this a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which kicks in when diseases are likely to cross borders?
A: It's definitely something we're actively considering, but at this point, we don't have enough epidemiological data so it doesn't warrant calling an Emergency Committee meeting.

Update, 7 Aug 2018: Sequencing of the virus has now confirmed that it's the Ebola Zaire species, and that there is no link between the 2 outbreaks. Vaccination could start as early as 8 Aug 2018, Salama tweeted today.

[3] Ebola Zaire genetics in North Kivu
- Tue 7 Aug 2018. Genetic test confirms outbreak in east unrelated to Bikoro, DRC outbreak
[CIDRAP, Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/genetic-tests-confirm-separate-drc-ebola-outbreak-vaccination-begins
[byline: Lisa Schnirring]

A genetic analysis of the Ebola virus from a new outbreak of the disease in Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) North Kivu province confirms that it isn't related to a recent outbreak in Équateur province, and other lab testing has confirmed 3 more cases in the latest outbreak.

On Twitter today [7 Aug 2018], Peter Salama, WHO's deputy director-general of emergency response, said the genetic testing at the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa has confirmed that the Ebola Zaire virus found in North Kivu isn't closely linked to the Équateur outbreak strain, confirming the North Kivu outbreak is a new event.

He also said the confirmation means that responders can start using the VSV-EBOV vaccine, which targets the Ebola Zaire strain, as early as tomorrow [8 Aug 2018].

Oly Ilunga, the DRC's health minister, who also announced the sequencing results on Twitter today, said the country's ethics committee has cleared a plan for vaccination to begin tomorrow. In a separate statement, the health ministry said the 1st vaccination teams will arrive in Beni tomorrow to vaccinate primary health providers before shifting to contacts and contacts of contacts.

Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at the INRB on 3 of the initial patient samples from the North Kivu outbreak highly suggested that the Ebola Zaire strain was the cause of the outbreak, but the WHO had said genetic sequencing is needed to definitively confirm the species.

In briefing notes sent to journalists today, WHO said the cold chain refrigeration system to store the vaccine arrived in Beni on 5 Aug 2018 and will be operational sometime today. A team of vaccination experts from Guinea will be deployed to help with ring vaccination targeting health workers and contacts, and a revised research and vaccination protocol was expected yesterday [6 Aug 2018]. A clinical team with experimental drugs is expected to arrive in the area today.

In its daily outbreak update, the DRC's health ministry reported 3 more lab-confirmed cases, raising that number to 16. Overall, there are 43 cases, which includes 27 probable cases. Health officials are investigating an additional 46 suspected cases, up from 31 reported the day before. Another 2 deaths were reported in confirmed case-patients, one from Beni and one from Mabalako. Most of the confirmed and probable cases are from 5 health zones in North Kivu province, but 2 of the probable cases are from a health zone in neighboring Ituri province, according to the health ministry's report.

In other developments, the WHO said 2 treatment centers are being set up, one in Beni staffed by Alima and one in Mangina, the outbreak epicenter, covered by MSF France. Safe burials have been conducted in Beni, and systems are being set up to ensure that safe and dignified burials occur in affected health zones, with 2 sites already covered in Beni and Mangina.

To help minimize the spread to the DRC's neighbors, health officials have notified the governments of Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, and South Sudan about the outbreak and the need for heightened surveillance, especially in areas bordering North Kivu province. WHO added that response teams have identified 28 key entry points that need beefed up surveillance and capacity to detect and respond to potential new Ebola cases.

In its update, WHO warned that the cost of the response is likely to be significant, especially given a security situation that involves active armed conflict with rebel fighters and an area that is home to about 1 million displaced people. The group has already released USD 2 million from its emergency contingency fund. So far, there are 30 staff in or on their way to Beni, with teams also headed to Mangina, said WHO.

[This report is all good news, given a bad situation. The genetic analysis has confirmed that the Ebola strain is different from the Équateur outbreak strain, but it is Ebola Zaire indicating the vaccine will still be highly protective, and zMapp will be effective. The cold chain is in place, although a vaccine that does not require a cold chain would be a great improvement. The treatment centers are being set up, the need for increased surveillance is being encouraged in areas at risk, and there appears to be a coordinated response. The experience gained in the last 2 outbreaks has facilitated the rapid response to this 10th outbreak, which one might consider the most challenging one because of the issues around security. - Mod.LK]
