The Health Ministry has withdrawn the licences of all iodine supplement
producers after 17,000 school children were poisoned by the pills, reports
said yesterday.
Products already approved by local health departments were also covered by
the order, China Daily said.
"Violators of state laws and regulations concerned must be seriously
punished," said Health Minister Zhang Wenkang. Children in 11 provinces
fell ill after being given iodine supplements at school last month. In some
cases, uninspected tablets were sold to students for the personal profit of
local administrators, newspapers reported. Most cases occurred after the
ministry had issued a warning to schools on April 4 to restrict the
administering of such products. About 6,300 pupils in Lanzhou, Gansu
province, suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, dizziness and nose
bleeds. Some needed hospital treatment.
Profit appears to have played a role in the decision to issue the
supplements despite the directive. The pills were sold to Lanzhou students
for 77 fen (71 cents) each. The normal price of the tablets on the market
was 10 fen each. Similar cases were reported in Shandong, Anhui, Sichuan
and Henan provinces.

[It still is not clear what caused the reactions. Did the pills contain 7.7
times the normal dose of iodine -- in line with their increased cost -- or
was there a contaminant? - Mod.JW
