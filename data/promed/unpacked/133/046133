A farm in Germany's eastern state of Brandenburg has been hit by
an outbreak of swine fever, the state's agriculture ministry said on
Tuesday.
The ministry said the highly contagious disease, which is not
harmful to humans, had been detected at a farm in Jakobshagen
with 1450 pigs, and had probably been transmitted by wild pigs in
the area.
The farm has been under quarantine since last Friday and
preparations were being made to cull the herd.
There was no evidence that the disease had spread to any other
farms.

[Hog cholera or Classical swine fever is a contagious febrile
disease of pigs. It can cause devastating epidemics, particularly in
countries that are free of the disease and do not practice
vaccination, so their total pig population is susceptible.
The disease occurs in acute and chronic forms, and the virulence
varies from severe, with high mortality, to mild or even subclinical.
The severe acute form is characterized by fever, loss of appetite,
and depression. The incubation period is typically 2-6 days, with
death at 10-20 days after infection. Constipation is common,
followed by diarrhea. The principle lesion is a generalized
vasculitis, seen in live pigs as hemorrhages and cyanosis
[darkening, bluing of the skin, notably the extremities. There may
be generalized reddening. Vasculitis in the central nervous system
may produce incoordination or convulsions.
Pigs with the chronic form of the disease survive more than 30
days. After an initial acute febrile phase, they may show apparent
recovery but then relapse, with anorexia [loss of appetite,
depression, fever and progressive loss of condition.
Virologic tests are essential to confirm a diagnosis. Suitable
tissues are tonsil, certain lymph nodes (maxillary, submandibular,
or mesenteric), spleen, ileum and kidney. Confirmation with the
laboratory on which samples to take and the method of handling
samples is advised.
No treatment should be attempted, reporting the disease to
authorities is compulsory in many countries. Confirmed cases and
in-contact pig should be slaughtered and measures taken to protect
other pigs. This may involve herd slaughter combined with area
restriction on pig movements, or vaccination, depending on local
disease and control regulations.
Current vaccines are of the live attenuated type, either derivatives
of the lapinized [rabbit-adapted *C* strain, or strains adapted from
cell cultures. They are effective at controlling clinical disease but
allow the virus to continue circulating subclinically. Therefore
vaccination is inappropriate in countries or regions with an
eradication policy. - Mod.TG
