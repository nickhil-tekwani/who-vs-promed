According to Dr Ken Wirasandhi, the secretary of the Rabies Control
Team at the Sanglah Hospital [Bali], [the number of] dog bite cases
who have came to Sanglah Hospital in 2011 is lower than in the
previous months. Previously, in a day more than 40 people requested
VAR [anti-rabies vaccination], whereas in January [2011] VAR demands
are around 20-30 people.

Decreasing VAR demand is expected to continue. Meanwhile, based on
Bali Health Department's data, the stock of VAR is about 70 000 vials
in Bali [which will provide cover] up to April 2011. [The
sufficiency] of stocks of VAR [in] all regencies, can be one reason
for the decrease in number of dog bite cases at Sanglah Hospital.

However, rabies is still a threat. In the 1st 2 weeks of January
[2011], 4 people died [as a result of rabies virus infection]. The
most recent rabies fatality, a Nusa Penida resident, occurred on
Friday (7 Jan 2011). [This death] raises the total number of rabies
deaths in Bali to 118.

Within 2 days, 2 "suspect" rabies victims died in the Sanglah
Hospital [Bali]. They were both residents of Klungkung regency. One
of them came from Nusa Penida, a small island which has been
rabies-free. The victims, a 43 year old man and a 58 year old man,
were reportedly bitten by dogs 3 months ago and one month ago
[respectively]. Neither received prompt post-exposure vaccination.

[Merritt Clifton has forwarded the following relevant additional
information from Janince Girard, founder of the Bali Animal Welfare
Association. "We sterilized all the dogs on Nusa Penida in 2009. The
Government then proceeded to cull all the dogs there -- twice. We
could have easily caught and vaccinated the dogs, as we did
spay/neuter. We were not allowed to do so. They insisted culling
works."

Although the number of people seeking rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis may be declining, the death toll continues to rise and is
now given as 118 compared with the 107 reported in the Jakarta Post
of 3 Jan 2011 (see ProMED-mail Rabies, human - Indonesia: (Bali)
20110106.0066). It may be premature, therefore, to believe that human
rabies in Bali can be eliminated by the end of 2011 as previously
suggested.
