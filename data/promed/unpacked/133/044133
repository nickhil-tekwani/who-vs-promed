A 4-year-old quarter horse mare in Contra Costa County, California has tested positive for the neurological form of equine herpes virus-1 (EHV-1).

The California Department of Food and Agriculture said the animal was displaying severe neurologic signs. She was euthanized as a result. Initial investigations indicate no other horses were exposed to the potentially deadly virus as the mare was the sole horse on a pasture with cattle.

The department is continuing to monitor the situation.

[Equine herpesvirus is a very contagious disease and is often deadly to the horses that contract it. The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM. Thus, it can be devastating to the owners.
