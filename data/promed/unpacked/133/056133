Japanese encephalitis (JE), which claimed 13 lives since its outbreak in
Kinta [in Ipoh in October last year, affected mainly adults who have been
staying in the vicinity of pig farms for a period of time.
The outbreak in Negri Sembilan which recorded five deaths out of nine cases
and in Selangor which recorded one death during the same period, also
affected adults who have stayed in the vicinity of pig farms.
This reflected a change of scenario, based on previous data between 1989
[and 1993 victims of JE reported in the country were mostly children aged
under 15, a University of Malaya senior virologist, Prof Dr Lam Sai Kit,
said in his paper, "JE - A Global Perspective", at a one-day regional
conference on latest advances in the diagnosis and control of JE, here
[Ipoh, today.
He said based on the Ministry of Health's report, between 1989 and 1993,
about 52% of the reported cases comprised children aged between seven and
15, 31% comprised children aged under four, 9% comprised those between 15
and 24 and only 8% were adults, aged above 25.
Prof Lam said based on the ministry's report, there were 531 JE cases
between 1989 and 1998. The 33 deaths recorded reflected a fatality rate of
about 6.2%. Last year, he said, 91 cases were reported with 10 deaths,
reflecting a fatality rate of about 11%.
Prof Lam's views were shared by Dr Marina Abdul Hamid, a health officer
from the Kinta District Health Office in her paper, "An Overview of JE
Outbreak: The Kinta Experience".
She said based on the Kinta outbreak, all the 24 cases reported were adults
except for a 10-year-old boy who stayed in one of the affected farms, with
87.5% males and the majority of them engaged directly in porcine-related
activities.
Out of the 13 victims who died, six had been vaccinated during the campaign
period, and this raised several questions including that they had already
carried the virus or they had [been exposed to bites [by infected
mosquitoes before their body was allowed to build up an immune [response,
she said.
However, until today, out of the 24 cases of suspected JE, only nine have
been confirmed to carry the JE virus while others have viral encephalitis.
[The New Straits Times reported on 24 Feb 1999 that a 14-year-old boy from
Kuala Terengganu on the east coast was confirmed to have had JE. The State
Health Department director Dr Abdul Razak Kechik said, "There are no pig
farms in Terengganu but I suspect the virus could have been carried by wild
boar, cattle or horses." - Mod.CYC
