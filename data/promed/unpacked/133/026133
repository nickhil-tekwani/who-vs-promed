----------------------------------------------------------------------
Assuming that the signs and symptoms reported in this outbreak are all related to a single infectious disease, Gideon (http://www.GideonOnline.com) gives highest ranking to leptospirosis, followed by typhoid, visceral leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis. If causal, the findings of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly would discount malaria and yellow fever, respectively.
