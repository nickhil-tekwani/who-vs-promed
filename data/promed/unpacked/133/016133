From: Peter Roeder (AGAH) <Peter.Roeder@fao.org>

The communication [HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE - KENYA (12) does not indicate that
Rift Valley Fever is currently in Egypt contrary to the moderator's
comments attached to the posting. We were indicating that in the last two
decades or so RVF spread northwards and westwards in Africa, including into
Egypt, and the potential exists for spread into other regions.
