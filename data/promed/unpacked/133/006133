Veterinarians say now is the time of year pet owners need to be vigilant, especially after a rare illness killed a dog earlier this week. The disease is called Pythiosis - it's a fungal disease the animal experts want you to be aware of.

If it's not their toy or treat, and if it's not their food or water, veterinarians say you'll want to pay attention to what's going in your dog's mouth.

Their latest example of Pythiosis is Samson; when the Oklahoma Alliance for Animals (OAA) took him in last week they thought he was starving to death. "I have never seen a dog that way, that thin," said OAA president Jamee Suarez. But lab tests revealed Samson actually suffered from Pythiosis. "I thought, 'What is that,' you know? It sounds crazy," Suarez said.

Dr. Khris Keller helped treat Samson and said, "I've been at it for 36 years and he's the 3rd dog I've seen with Pythiosis."

He said dogs get Pythiosis by ingesting a mold that grows in swampy waters. The fungus causes their intestines to thicken so they can't keep food down.

"The vomiting and diarrhea for a long period - more than 24 or 48 hours needs to be checked out," he said. "The extreme weight loss in this case was the big key- and the dog was very happy, he wasn't depressed."

The disease is so rare, Keller said there's no reason not to take your dog to the lake this summer, but you'll want to mention it to your vet if your dog starts showing signs so they can run tests and catch it early, avoiding the death that Samson suffered. "It's a sad, sad thing for that dog. And there could be more that appear that way," Suarez said.

Veterinarians say humans can also get Pythiosis but that you can't catch it from your dog.

[According to this article pythiosis is rare, but in states bordering the Gulf of Mexico it is certainly not regarded as rare, but rather endemic. However, the disease has been diagnosed in many states both in the Northern US and the Southern US, as well as other countries.

Pythiosis is an infectious disease caused by a fungus-like organism, _Pythium insidiosum_ that naturally inhabits wetlands, ponds, and swamps. In dogs, the disease usually is manifested by gastroenteritis or dermatitis. Presumably dogs become infected by ingesting, or swimming in contaminated water. Pythiosis is endemic in states that border the Gulf of Mexico, but has been diagnosed in dogs from southern Indiana (with no history of travel outside the state). Dogs with gastrointestinal pythiosis often have a history of retrieving objects, such as sticks, from water and then chewing on them; young male retriever-type dogs are particularly at risk. Dogs with open skin wounds are probably predisposed to acquiring cutaneous pythiosis.

Gastrointestinal pythiosis is usually a fatal disease. Pathologically, the organism is highly invasive and angiotropic, so the infection can be complicated by disruption of vascular supply. The infection typically involves the full-thickness of the stomach or intestine and sometimes extends to adjacent organs.

Extensive fibrosis often results in stenosis of the affected segment of gut producing clinical signs referable to the site of infection. For example, pythiosis of the gastric pylorus often results in projectile vomiting, and pythiosis of the duodenum in obstruction.

Lesions of cutaneous pythiosis usually develop on the limbs, tail, or face. They are typically firm or spongy (depending on the degree of fibrosis) and ulcerated, often with a draining fistulous tract. Clinically, these lesions may resemble acral lick granulomas.

This is NOT a disease you want your pet to have. So place close attention to what your dog eats or drinks as well as the overall health of your pets.
