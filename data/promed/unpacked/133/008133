[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but will be available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 49 newly confirmed cases in China, 10 of which were imported and 39 were locally acquired, 36 in Beijing and 3 in Hebei province. No new deaths were reported. No new cases were reported in Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan. A total of 1827 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting the trend of reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 9 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 6 were imported. There were 2 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported each time. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327). More in-depth information on the ongoing outbreak in Beijing can be found in sections [1A], [1B], and [1C] of COVID-19 update (260): China (Beijing) South Africa, WHO, global 20200615.7469624.

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 37 cases and 0 new deaths, compared with 34 cases and no new deaths during the previous day (13 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 68 consecutive days. Today's (14 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 24 cases were locally transmitted, and 13 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (6), Gyeonggi (8), Incheon (8), and Chungnam (2). Imported cases were in Quarantine (7), Gyeongnam (3), Gyeonggi (2) and Seoul (1). Note that 12 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) has updated cluster information and tables and graphs as of yesterday's information (13 Jun 2020) in notice 374; notice 375 contains the updated tables and graphs for today's newly confirmed cases.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super-spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 236 989 cases, including 34 345 deaths, up by 346 cases and 44 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (13 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 346 cases and 78 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 244 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Piedmont (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4895_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4895_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (242) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (8 provinces reported no new cases), with another 3 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (244), followed by Piedmont (30), Emilia-Romagna (17), Lazio (14), and Tuscany (8).

Italy is now 41 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 25 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 187 427 total cases, 8837 deaths

For the 1st time in 2 months, daily deaths from COVID-19 in Iran passed the 100 mark on Sunday, [14 Jun 2020]. The spokesperson of the ministry of health said 107 people had died since Saturday [13 Jun 2020]. Sima Sadat-Lari, the newly appointed spokesperson announced from the local News Network that deaths have totaled 8837 since the epidemic was 1st announced on [19 Feb 2020] in the country. Iran was one of the 1st coronavirus hotspots after China and so far, it has the largest number of infections and deaths in the Middle East. In the last 2 months, the daily death toll was always under 100, but in recent 2 weeks infections increased again as the government opened the economy and reduced restrictions.

The number of people diagnosed with the virus increased by 2472 since Saturday [13 Jun 2020], reaching 187 427. More than 2700 people are listed in serious condition in hospitals, Sadat-Lari said. She also expressed regret for the increase in deaths and added that 7 provinces are in the red alert category for their high number of new cases.

[As of 14 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 187 427, including 8837 deaths, an increase of 2472 new cases and 107 deaths since 13 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. As stated previously, with the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran approximately 4-6 weeks following lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while there was still ongoing major active transmission. This is a tenacious virus with the overwhelming majority of the world still susceptible to it... With 7 provinces now involved, a key concern will be whether people begin travelling again within the country and may transport the virus from one zone to another.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 162 144, including 117 853 deaths, an increase from 2 142 224 cases and 117 527 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 206 606 as of 12:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 14 Jun 2020 including 17 415 confirmed deaths and an additional 4688 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and Illinois. For the 1st time, New York is not on the top 10 list.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, unchanged from yesterday (13 Jun 2020). A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
