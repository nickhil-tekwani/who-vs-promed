BRUSSELS: A new case of mad cow disease has been found in Belgium, bringing
the number of mad cow cases in the country to 27, local television reported
on Friday. Television network RTBF said the new case was found in Flanders
in Antwerp Province, yet it did not say whether the case had been found by
screening tests or routine checks conducted by livestock farmers.
Beginning in January 2001, the European Union (EU) has instructed all its
member states to conduct screening tests on cattle more than 30 months of
age before the meat can enter the food chain. The 15-nation bloc also
instructed member states to ban for 6 months the use of animal feed made of
cattle meat and bonemeal and to bar the meat adjacent to the cattle backbone.
All these measures are resorted to in order to stamp out the brain-wasting
disease, a variant form of which affects human beings. The latest mad cow
disease scares in France and Germany have caused European beef sales to
decline by as much as a third despite the measures the EU has taken to
restore consumer confidence.

On Friday, French officials said that a case of BSE had been discovered in
an animal born in 1997 -- after special measures on animal feed had been
put into effect in July 1996. The cow, born in August 1997, was destroyed
along with its herd.
Specialists must now determine why the cow, found in the Seine-Maritime
region, was infected with BSE. Feed containing animal parts can carry the
disease, but such feed is forbidden in France.

PARIS: Monkeys can contract mad cow disease if it is injected into their
bloodstream, underscoring that infected tissue risks transmitting the
brain-wasting illness to humans, researchers said on Friday.
French scientist Corinne Ida Lasmezas said that she and a team of French
and British scientists proved that the agent that causes mad cow disease,
or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), can be passed from one primate
to another intravenously. She warned, however, that the study had not
proven that vCJD can be passed to humans through the blood supply.
"Everything depends on the amount of the infectious agent in blood -- we
don't know if there is enough in human blood to infect another human," she
said.
The team's research, published last week in the U.S. journal Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, dealt with the behavior of prions -- the
distorted proteins blamed for causing BSE and its human equivalent, new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) -- in primates. "We wanted to
better understand the behavior of the BSE agent in primates to have an idea
of the risk that vCJD poses in humans," Lasmezas told Reuters in a
telephone interview.
"Effectively, this is the first time BSE has been passed between primates
via blood," she said. She said the study had also shown that the BSE prions
become more virulent to primates after they have replicated in primates.
They would lie dormant for less time when passed from one primate to
another than when they cross from cattle to primates.
In the study, Lasmezas and her team first infected macaque monkeys by
taking concentrated samples of the mad cow agent from brains of infected
humans and cattle and injecting them directly into the monkeys' brains.
They then took samples from the infected monkeys' brains and injected them
into the brains of healthy monkeys. They also took samples from the brains
of sick monkeys and injected them into the veins of other healthy monkeys.
The researchers found that all monkeys that were injected with the agent --
either into the bloodstream or into the brain directly -- became sick with
the fatal disease.
More importantly, however, the scientists found that the BSE agent lies
dormant for a shorter period of time once it adapts to primates. "This
means that once the agent has adapted to primates, it's more virulent for
another primate," she said.

Consumer Groups Warn of Mad Cow Enforcement Gaps
--------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: Consumer watchdog groups told members of a Senate subcommittee
that the US Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration,
and other federal agencies responsible for the safety of the nation's food
supply can't inspect the vast majority of products that enter the United
States from Europe. The result, they said, is that vigorous federal bans
designed to protect US livestock and US consumers from the deadly brain
wasting disease are weak.
"It's fine and well to have a ban, but it doesn't do much good if
compliance rates are low and inspection rates aren't what they should be,"
said Dr. Peter Lurie, deputy director of Public Citizen's Health Research
Group.
The disease, known formally as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
ravaged the European beef industry in the 1990s. More than 170 000 cases of
BSE have been reported in Western European cattle since 1986, and the
disease's human form, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has been
blamed for some 100 human deaths there. Several federal agencies responded
to the scare by banning imports of European meat and, in 1997, barring US
ranchers from using the animal-based cattle feed believed to be the source
of BSE's spread. Experts who testified before the committee credited the
bans with preventing any cases of BSE from occurring in the United States.
But Lurie told the committee FDA data shows that 23 percent of US cattle
renderers and 63 percent of FDA-licensed cattle feed mills have not been
inspected to ensure that they are complying with federal safeguards, and
"the FDA only inspects about 1 percent of all (animal) materials that enter
this country. There is very little inspection done on all this food that
comes back and forth across the border from all over the world," said
subcommittee ranking member Senator Byron Dorgan.
A recent report from the General Accounting Office suggested that as few as
30 percent of companies in the cattle industry were in compliance with
federal directives on BSE prevention.
Cattle ranchers and meat producers [have repeatedly stressed that no cases
of BSE have ever been seen in the United States and that efforts to keep it
out of the US cattle population and out of imported meat are working well.
"These efforts provide the best reasonable assurance that US cattle will
remain BSE-free and that US consumers will not be exposed to any related
health risks," said James H. Hodges, president of the American Meat Institute.
FDA officials maintained that their inspection schedule is rigorous and
that companies under their jurisdiction are complying with federal
regulations and import bans. The agency had inspected 834 feed producers,
renderers, dairy farms, and other cattle businesses and re-inspected 184
initially found to be operating outside of federal BSE rules, said Stephen
Sundlof, director of FDA's center for veterinary medicine. "Only one firm
continued to be out of compliance" as of this week, he said.
Lawmakers have introduced several bills designed to strengthen protections
against BSE. One bill, sponsored by Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, calls
for a formal federal task force dedicated to monitoring and preventing the
disease in the United States. Another takes the extra step of banning all
cow and sheep nerve tissue -- the tissue believed to carry the highest risk
for transmitting mad cow disease -- from all human and animal food. "While
the risks (of BSE) may be low, we cannot be complacent, said Senator Peter
Fitzgerald, the chair of the subcommittee.
