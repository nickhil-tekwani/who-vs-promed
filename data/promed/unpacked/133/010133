Korea has set up a governmental crisis center in an effort to contain
the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) that has spread through
the country, the government said yesterday [Wed 29 Dec 2010].

The highly contagious disease, 1st [confirmed] on 29 Nov 2010 at farms
about 270 km (168 miles) southeast of Seoul, has spread to other parts
of the country since.

In a joint statement, the Ministry of Public Administration and
Security and the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said the central anti-disaster headquarters will take charge
of quarantine, decontamination and vaccination efforts currently
underway and pool all available resources in an effort to end the
outbreaks.

"The government will use all available resources, including the
police, to help stem the disease that has continued to spread despite
nationwide quarantine efforts," the statement said.

In addition, the country's alert level will be raised to "red" -- the
highest in a 4-tiered response scheme -- to reflect the seriousness of
the situation.

The last time Seoul issued a red alert was when the country tried to
combat the human influenza A outbreaks in the 2nd half of 2009.

The farm ministry, meanwhile, said it has expanded areas that will be
given animal vaccines to control the spread of FMD. The 1st vaccines
were administered on Saturday [25 Dec 2010].

The emergency measures are needed since the disease is spreading much
faster than anticipated, officials said, admitting that they have not
been able to determine why, despite 1391 checkpoints in key areas and
the closure of all 85 livestock markets.

So far, more than 523 000 animals have been ordered to be culled from
a total of around 1.5 million cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and deer
raised in the country, with losses estimated to exceed 450 billion won
[USD 393 million].

The government has mobilized 172 348 quarantine personnel including
public servants, soldiers and the police for the decontamination and
culling process, the government said. Authorities plan to complete
limited vaccinations of animals ahead of schedule, it said.

[In archived post 20101228.4575, ProMED-mail requested clarification
on the seemingly large number (155 974) of "mobilized quarantine
personnel to man 1226 checkpoints across the country and to take part
in the decontamination and culling process." This issue has become
clearer thanks to item 2 above, according to which the engaged army
and police forces were included in the cited number. - Mod.AS]
