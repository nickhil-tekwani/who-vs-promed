dwarfing viroid from citrus in Punjab, Pakistan. Plant Dis 2009; 93(8):
840; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-93-8-0840C]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Pakistan is among the top 10 citrus-producing countries of the world and
the leader in Kinnow mandarin production with production concentrated in
the province of Punjab, which produces more than 96 per cent of the total
citrus crop.

To evaluate the presence and distribution of citrus viroids in this area,
34 samples were collected in September 2008 from citrus orchards in the
Sargodha, Bhalwal, and Faisalabad areas of Punjab, including 15 'Mosambi'
and 2 'Bloodred' sweet oranges (_Citrus sinensis_), 8 'Kinnow', and 4
'Feutrell Early' mandarins (_C. reticulata_), 3 'Jatti Khatti' rough lemon
(_C. jambhiri_), and 2 grapefruit (_C. paradisi_), which showed stunting,
bark scaling, and cracking symptoms on the rootstock which was either
citrange (_Poncirus trifoliata_ x _C. sinensis_) or sweet lime (_C.
limetta_). Infected budwood from these trees was grafted onto indicator
plants of Arizona 861-S-1 'Etrog citron' (_C. medica_) budded on rough
lemon rootstock, and after 3 months, the citron showed typical viroid
symptoms of mild epinasty and leaf roll with 23 of the 34 samples.

A one-step multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay was used to
detect simultaneously _Citrus exocortis viroid_ (CEVd), _Citrus bent leaf
viroid_ (CBLVd), _Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd), citrus dwarfing viroid [ICTV
approved name _Citrus viroid III_; CVd-III], and citrus bark cracking
viroid [ICTV approved name _Citrus viroid IV_; CVd-IV]. On the basis of
amplification of the appropriately sized DNA, CEVd, CBLVd, HSVd, and
CVd-III were detected in 12, 8, 31, and 17 samples, respectively, whereas
CVd-IV was not detected. 23 of 34 infected samples harbored more than one
viroid species and one had 4 viroids. Budwood from 11 trees did not induce
viroid symptoms on Etrog citron. 2 of these trees were infected with CBLVd
only and 9 with HSVd only.

The full sequences of CEVd, CBLVd, HSVd, and CVd-III were amplified by
RT-PCR and cloned. Sequences of three cDNA clones each of CEVd, CBLVd,
HSVd, and CVd-III were deposited in GenBank [database]. These nucleotide
sequences had greater than 97 per cent nucleotide identity to the most
similar genome sequences in GenBank. One of the HSVd sequences presented
the cachexia determinants.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of CBLVd and CVd-III in Pakistan.
These results indicate the need for proper indexing of mother trees and a
virus-free propagation scheme to create healthy budwood sources in Pakistan.

[2] _Hop stunt viroid_ - Jamaica

[ref: S Bennett, et al. First report of _Hop stunt viroid_ infecting citrus
orchards in Jamaica. BSPP New Disease Reports 2009 (Feb-Aug); 19]
----------------------------------------------------------
Citrus fruit is one of the major traditional agricultural products of
Jamaica. Fresh fruit is exported to the United Kingdom, United States,
Canada, and Barbados but the domestic market accounts for approximately 85
per cent of production. Constraints to fruit production are mainly related
to tree decline caused by infection with _Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV).
Exocortis has been described in Jamaica since the 1970s, but group II
viroids [see link below] including _Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd), the causal
agent of cachexia, have not been reported. Cachexia is a gumming and wood
pitting disorder of citrus with severe infections characterised by
stunting, chlorosis, and eventual death of the tree.

In 2003 and 2004, a survey of 6 major citrus producing regions of Jamaica
was conducted to evaluate the status of HSVd. A total of 24 samples of
citrus varieties, without symptoms of viroid infection, were collected and
indexed for viroids by inoculation of Etrog citron grafted on _Citrus
volkameriana_ and for HSVd using Parson's Special mandarin grafted on to
rough lemon. Within 3 months, typical viroid leaf symptoms were observed on
Etrog citron inoculated with samples from 4 regions, Clarendon, St
Catherine, St James, and St Mary (fig 1). Within 18 months, gumming at the
bud union, an indication of infection with HSVd, was observed on Parson's
Special mandarin inoculated with samples from the Clarendon region (fig 2).

For the latter samples, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) specific to HSVd amplified single fragments (ca 283 base pairs),
which were cloned, and sequenced. Analysis indicated high nucleotide
identities (between 95 and 100 per cent) with group II viroid species from
Cuba, Mexico, Uruguay, North America, Spain, Israel, Japan, and China.

This is the 1st confirmed report of HSVd infecting citrus in Jamaica. Apart
from stunting, conspicuous HSVd symptoms are not observed in the field
because of the prevalence of the tolerant sour orange rootstock. However,
this pathogen may be a threat to the industry later on, given the recent
initiation of replanting on CTV tolerant trifoliate rootstocks, most of
which are susceptible to citrus viroids. Further work on other viroids
infecting citrus is required, including their potential impact on the industry.

[A number of viroid species and strains infecting citrus have been
characterised which all belong to the family _Pospiviroidae_. They have
been organised into several groups according to their molecular properties,
host range, and symptom expression. Interactions between co-infecting
viroids in citrus are well known and may lead to very severe effects on the
host (synergism), but the mechanisms are unclear.

Viroids are widespread in citrus that has been propagated from symptomless
viroid-infected budwood. All citrus viroids induce specific symptoms on the
Etrog cultivar of citron (_Citrus medica_, widely used as a virus/viroid
indicator species), but only CEVd and HSVd cause specific symptoms
(exocortis and cachexia diseases, respectively) in other citrus hosts.
Other citrus viroids, particularly CBLVd and CVd-III, do not induce easily
recognisable effects in citrus varieties used commercially as scions or
rootstocks, but infection may cause reduction in tree size and yield.

Citrus viroids are transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. Due to
their possible strong synergistic effects, the use of viroid-free rootstock
and grafting material is vital in citrus cultivation.

_Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV) mentioned in item [2] causes one of the most
destructive diseases of the crop. Different strains of CTV may vary in
severity, and symptoms also depend on the citrus variety and the scion-
rootstock combination. For more information see links below.
