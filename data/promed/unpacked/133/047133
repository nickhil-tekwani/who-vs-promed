The UNC student discussed in the referenced posting [Rocky Mountain spotted
fever - USA (AL, NC): fatal 20030613.1460] (was transferred from the
Florida panhandle to our facility for her care. Her diagnosis was human
monocytic ehrlichiosis, not RMSF [Rocky mountain spotted fever]. Therefore,
the lack of rash in her case is not that unusual. Her titer from her
initial _E. chaffeensis_ serology met CDC criteria for diagnosis.
Furthermore, morulae were identified within the monocytes in both her bone
marrow and csf [cerebrospinal fluid]. Finally, it is interesting that she
initially received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole from a student health
clinic for presumed sinusitis; this drug has anecdotally been associated
with fulminant ehrlichiosis in adolescents in the pediatric infectious
diseases literature. An association with sulfa drugs and more severe cases
of other rickettsial diseases (RMSF, Mediterranean Spotted Fever) has been
reported. As an aside, it is difficult to tease out the role of delayed
diagnosis in these more fulminant cases.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Sizemore for the additional information regarding one of
the 2 cases previously posted of presumptive Rocky Mountain spotted
fever. From the information provided, it seems clear that the student had
ehrlichiosis. It has, indeed, been known for many years that RMSF is made
more severe with inadvertent use of sulfonamides (1). The effect appears
to be related to the drug's effect on para-amino benzoic acid
metabolism. The association may well exist for ehrlichiosis as well.
As stated by Walker and Dumler (2), there are no absolute clinical criteria
to distinguish Human monocytic ehrlichiosis from RMSF although patients
with HME are much less likely to have a rash (10-15 percent) and are more
likely to be leukopenic (2). We have no stated serologies for RMSF in this
case and different tick-borne diseases may coexist.
