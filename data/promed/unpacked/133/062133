[ProMED-mail is indebted to Professor T Jacob John for the following
clarification, which is necessitated by our reporting of 2 separate
outbreaks of undiagnosed fatal illness in Uttar Pradesh within the same
thread.]

A clarification
---------------
I wish to alert you to a clarification. 2 distinct outbreaks are mixed up
in the most recent ProMED-mail post: Undiagnosed fatal illness - India
(04): (UP) 20080828.2697.

Part [1] of this report concerns an encephalitis-like syndrome, (almost)
exclusively in children. Clinically it is a CNS disease, commonly called by
the "non-specific" term acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Some Japanese
encephalitis and other undiagnosed CNS diseases are involved.

My comment in part [2] of the report does not pertain to the AES outbreak,
but a different one (see: Undiagnosed fatal illness - India (03): (UP) RFI
20080826.2666), predominantly rural, not confined to children, clinically a
febrile illness "resembling malaria", and associated with flooding. The
very first report (see: Undiagnosed fatal illness - India (02): (UP) RFI
20080811.2478) of this outbreak emphasised involvement of children,
jaundice, link to flooding, but no mention of AES like nature. The only
commonalities between the 2 are that children are affected and death is
common. The news in 20080826.2666 does not say predominantly children but
such details are not given in it.

In summary, there are 2 major outbreaks, one in East UP [Uttar Pradesh],
resembling Japanese encephalitis (JE) and the other in South-East UP,
resembling leptospirosis with fever, jaundice and no particular brain
involvement. Children are often affected in leptospirosis outbreaks.

Both seem to have fairly high case fatality. The latter is eminently
treatable, only if diagnosis is suspected in the beginning. The CNS
disease, whether JE or another viral disease is not that effectively
treatable, but supportive care minimises mortality. The reason to propose
leptospirosis is that it fits the picture, infection is widespread in
India, outbreaks involving children and young adults occur after heavy
rains and flooding (waterlogging in one description), diagnosis (and
antimicrobial therapy) is often life-saving and specific lab tests are
available in a network of national labs. If government health officers read
ProMED-mail, they could immediately take action.

I hope my description of 2 outbreaks make sense. [ProMED-mail agrees]

[ProMED-mail regrets the confusion and is in complete agreement with
Professor T Jacob John's analysis. In fact the 1st 2 posts describing the
2nd outbreak in Uttar Pradesh in August contained a introductory statement
indicating that it was not known to be connected with an earlier outbreak
of undiagnosed fatal illness in Uttar Pradesh in April. In retrospect it
was inadvisable to combine the reports of the 2 outbreaks in the same thread.

The Hindustan Times report of 26 Aug 2008 was incorrectly included with
Professor T Jacob John's diagnosis of leptospirosis because it was assumed
incorrectly that that the press report did not refer to the outbreak of
encephalitis-like illness reported in Uttar Pradesh in April 2008.

To avoid further confusion any information about the 2 outbreaks will
continue to be included in a common thread until there is final resolution
of the underlying causation.
