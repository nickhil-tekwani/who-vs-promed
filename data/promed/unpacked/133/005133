Biosecurity New Zealand says it could be a week before it knows the extent
of a further outbreak of the varroa bee mite near Nelson.
Varroa has been found in 3 hives in 2 apiaries in the Sherry River Valley,
close to an infested area identified at Tapawera in June. A 3rd infected
apiary has been found at Brightwater -- 7km away.
Biosecurity New Zealand says all hives in the newly discovered areas will
now be tested to see how far the mite has spread. More than 25 000 hives
have been lost in the North Island since varroa was detected in Auckland in
2000.

[The varroa mite (_Varroa jacobsoni_) is an external parasite, visible to
the unaided eye, and was first discovered infesting Asian honey bees (_Apis
cerana_) in Java. Subsequently this dreaded parasitic infection spread to
European honey bees (_Apis mellifera_). It was discovered in Europe in
about 1970 and then in the USA in 1987. Mite eggs are laid in sealed brood
cells and the resultant nymphs feed on bee pupae destined to become worker
bees. Infestations are spread from colony to colony by fertilized female
mites attached to bees. Infestations can cause colony extinction within 3-4
years if no control measures are undertaken. Varroa mites transmit viruses
to honey bees, such as Black Queen-cell virus, Sacbrood virus, and Acute
bee-paralysis virus.
