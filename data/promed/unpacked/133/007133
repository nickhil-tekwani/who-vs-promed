RABIES, HUMAN, VACCINE ALLERGIES: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
*********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

I would like to present the readers the following problem that I am having
with a patient.
The State of Acre, South-western Amazon region of Brazil, has experienced a
significant rise in canine and human rabies cases in 1996, with a total of
9 know human rabies-deaths up to now. Although the incidence [of canine
rabies] has dropped significantly this year, we are still enduring this
problem of endemicity.
I have a patient, male, 36 years who is being treated [for] a chronic
hepatitis C infection with interferon, 3 million IU, 3x per week. One day
ago this patient has been attacked by a cat, suffering a deep biting wound
on his lower leg. Recently I have seen a serious problem of a urticariform
reaction in a patient in a similar situation; this patient was treated with
anti-rabies serum+vaccine while undergoing interferon treatment. Brazil's
Ministry of Health norms are to treat my patient with 10 doses of the
vaccine (Fuenzalida Palácios) and anti-rabies serum.
My questions are:
1) Has anyone information on the causal relation between the interferon -
vaccine + serum combined use and the reported allergic reaction, and if so:
2) What would be the best procedure for this patient?
