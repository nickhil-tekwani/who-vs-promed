[Baoding City is located approximately 150 kilometers [approx. 93 miles] southwest of Beijing in Hebei Province. The climatic conditions do not support transmission of leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis has been reported from Gansu Province, with an estimated annual incidence of 3.8 cases per 100 000 population (Zhang S et al. Incidence of Japanese encephalitis, visceral leishmaniasis and malaria before and after the Wenchuan earthquake, in China. Acta Trop. 2013;128:85-9). This could be the place where the patient was infected. - Mod.EP]
