"Nontoxic" forms of the _Pfiesteria piscicida_ microbe have been found in
two more rivers on Maryland's Eastern Shore. This confirms the assumptions
that the microbe exists beyond the waterways afflicted by toxic outbreaks
two summers ago.
JoAnn M. Burkholder, a North Carolina State University botanist credited
with first identifying the microbe, told scientists at a Wednesday meeting
in Baltimore, Maryland, recent tests confirmed the presence of pfiesteria
in two Eastern Shore waterways that have yet to see toxic, fish-killing
outbreaks. The rivers are the St. Martin River, which empties into coastal
bays near Ocean City, and the Big Annemessex River, which feeds the
Chesapeake Bay on the lower Eastern Shore.
The research provides partial confirmation of scientists' long-held
assumptions: Pfiesteria has been around for millions of years, resting in
the muck of bays and rivers scattered far and wide, in forms not harmful to
fish or people. What causes the microbe to turn vengeful is the subject of
continuing inquiry.
"We knew, and we've said all along, that _Pfiesteria_ exists at low levels
throughout estuarine systems and probably on the whole East Coast," added
Robert M. Summers, deputy director of technical and regulatory services at
the Maryland Department of the Environment. "If you look for it, you can
find it."
Burkholder took sediment samples from 29 locations on a dozen Eastern Shore
rivers, then incubated them in conditions designed to coax pfiesteria to
turn toxic -- warm water packed with fish. She left them there for several
weeks. Five of the cultures killed fish -- those from the two new rivers,
plus samples taken from the Pocomoke and the Chicamacomico, both of which
suffered outbreaks in the summer of 1997.
"These experiments are not meant to mimic nature," said Donald Boesch,
president of the University of Maryland's Center for Environmental Science.
"They're meant to maximize the conditions in which toxic pfiesteria might
develop. . . . It is an extreme experimental condition meant not to
determine whether this would happen in the real world, but whether there
are pfiesteria cysts there that could develop" into toxic microbes.
Burkholder for years has watched rivers in North Carolina that have yielded
sediments that kill fish when cultured in a lab, yet have not suffered
toxic outbreaks.
The most potent effect of the findings may be in the political arena, where
poultry interests are still chafing at legislation adopted last year in
Maryland in response to pfiesteria outbreaks. The new law limits how much
chicken litter farmers may spread on their fields as fertilizer. Scientists
believe manure is washing off fields and into waterways, feeding
pfiesteria.
The industry has pointed to last year's lack of outbreaks as proof of
legislative overkill. Butscientists point to Burkholder's latest findings
to underscore a point they have made consistently: It is likely that
_Pfiesteria_ has been here a long time and probably won't exit quickly. A
single summer of quiet offers little reassurance it won't return.
