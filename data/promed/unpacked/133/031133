Rabies transmission from organ transplants
------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed the
first reported cases of rabies transmission through solid organ
transplantation. Confirmation came from laboratory testing of autopsy
specimens after the deaths of 3 people who had received organ transplants
from the same donor.
Rabies is an acute, fatal disease that most often results from a bite of a
rabid mammal. Rarely, if ever, do non-bite exposures, including scratches,
contamination of an open wound, or direct mucus membrane contact with
infectious material (such as saliva or neuronal tissue) cause rabies.
Although rabies transmission has occurred previously through cornea
transplants, this is the first report of rabies transmission via solid
organ transplantation.
The organ donor, an Arkansas resident, had undergone routine donor
eligibility screening and testing. Rabies testing is not part of the
routine screening process. Lungs, kidneys, and liver were recovered and
later transplanted on 4 May 2004 into 4 recipients, one of whom (the lung
transplant patient) died during transplant surgery. No other organs or
tissues were recovered from the donor.
CDC is working with health officials from Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, and other public health partners to evaluate potential contacts
of the transplant recipients and the donor to determine who needs shots.
Those people include family members as well as healthcare workers who cared
for the organ recipients and donor at the following hospitals: Baylor
University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas; University of Alabama-Birmingham
Hospital, Birmingham, Alabama; Christus Saint Michael Healthcare Center,
Texarkana, Texas; Wadley Regional Medical Center, Texarkana, Texas; and
Good Shepherd Medical Center Longview, Texas. Individuals whose contact is
determined to have placed them at elevated risk of exposure to rabies virus
will be advised to receive post-exposure treatment as soon as possible. For

Investigation of rabies infections in organ donor and transplant
recipients: Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, 2004
----------------------------------------------------
On Wed 30 Jun 2004, CDC confirmed diagnoses of rabies in 3 recipients of
transplanted organs and in their common donor, who was found subsequently
to have serologic evidence of rabies infection. The transplant recipients
had encephalitis of unknown etiology after transplantation and subsequently
died. Specimens were sent to the CDC for diagnostic evaluation. This report
provides a brief summary of the ongoing investigation and information on
exposure risks and post-exposure measures.
Organ donor
-----------
The organ donor was an Arkansas man who visited 2 hospitals in Texas with
severe mental status changes and a low-grade fever. Neurologic imaging
indicated findings consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which
expanded rapidly in the 48 hours after admission, leading to cerebral
herniation and death. Donor eligibility screening and testing did not
reveal any contraindications to transplantation, and the patient's family
agreed to organ donation. Lungs, kidneys, and liver were recovered. No
other organs or tissues were recovered from the donor, and the donor did
not receive any blood products before death. The liver and kidneys were
transplanted into 3 recipients on 4 May 2004 at a transplant center in
Texas. The lungs were transplanted in an Alabama hospital into a patient
who died of intraoperative complications.
Liver recipient
---------------
The liver recipient was a man with end-stage liver disease. The patient did
well immediately after transplantation and was discharged home on
postoperative day 5. 21 days after transplant, the patient was readmitted
with tremors, lethargy, and anorexia; he was afebrile. The patient's
neurologic status deteriorated rapidly during the next 24 hours; he
required intubation and critical care support. A lumbar puncture indicated
a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (25 white blood cells/mm3) and a mildly
elevated protein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain indicated
increased signal in the cerebrospinal fluid. His neurologic status
continued to deteriorate. 6 days after admission, a repeat MRI indicated
diffuse encephalitis. The patient subsequently died.
Female kidney recipient
-----------------------
The first kidney recipient was a woman with end-stage renal disease caused
by hypertension and diabetes. She had no postoperative complications and
was discharged home on postoperative day 7. 25 days after transplant, she
was readmitted with right-side flank pain and underwent an appendectomy. 2
days after this procedure, she had diffuse twitching and was noted to be
increasingly lethargic. Neurologic imaging with computed tomography and MRI
indicated no abnormality. During the next 24 to 48 hours, the patient had
worsening mental status, seizures, hypotension, and respiratory failure
requiring intubation. Her mental status continued to deteriorate, and
cerebral imaging 2 weeks after admission indicated severe cerebral edema.
The patient subsequently died.
Male kidney recipient
---------------------
The second renal recipient was a man with end-stage renal disease caused by
focal, segmental glomerulosclerosis. His posttransplant course was
complicated briefly by occlusions of an arterial graft leading to
infarction of the lower pole of the transplanted kidney. The patient was
discharged home 12 days after transplantation. 27 days after
transplantation, he visited a hospital emergency department and was then
transferred to the transplant center with myoclonic jerks and altered
mental status; he was afebrile. An MRI of the brain performed on admission
revealed no abnormalities. His mental status deteriorated rapidly during
the next 24 hours. A lumbar puncture revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis
(16 white blood cells/mm3) and a mildly elevated protein. His mental status
continued to deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure requiring
intubation. A repeat MRI performed 10 days after admission indicated
diffuse edema. The patient subsequently died.
Laboratory investigation
------------------------
In all 3 patients, histopathologic examination of central nervous system
(CNS) tissues at the CDC revealed an encephalitis with viral inclusions
suggestive of Negri bodies; the diagnosis of rabies in all 3 recipients was
confirmed by immunohistochemical testing and by the detection of rabies
virus antigen in fixed brain tissue by direct fluorescent antibody tests.
Electron microscopy of CNS tissue of one of the renal transplant recipients
also identified characteristic rhabdovirus inclusions and viral particles.
Suckling mice inoculated intracranially and intraperitoneally with brain
tissue from one kidney recipient died 7 to 9 days after injection.
Thin-section electron microscopy of CNS tissue of the mice had visible
rhabdovirus particles, and immunohistochemical testing detected rabies
viral antigens. Antigenic typing performed upon brain tissue from one
recipient was compatible with a rabies virus variant associated with bats.
Rabies virus antibodies were demonstrated in blood from 2 of the 3
recipients and the donor. Detecting rabies antibodies in the donor suggests
that he was the likely source of rabies transmission to the organ
recipients. Testing of additional donor specimens is ongoing.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Rabies is an acute fatal encephalitis caused by neurotropic viruses in the
genus _Lyssavirus_, family _Rhabdoviridae_ (1). The majority of rabies
cases are caused by bites by rabid mammals (1,2). Non-bite exposures,
including scratches, contamination of an open wound, or direct mucous
membrane contact with infectious material (for example, saliva or neuronal
tissue from rabid animals), rarely cause rabies. After an incubation period
of several weeks to months, the virus passes via the peripheral nervous
system and replicates in the central nervous system. Rabies virus can then
be disseminated to salivary glands and other organs via neural innervation
(3). Rabies can be prevented by administration of rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis (PEP) (4), which is highly effective in preventing rabies when
administered before onset of clinical signs.
Although transmission of rabies has occurred previously among 8 recipients
of transplanted corneas in 5 countries (4), this report describes the first
documented cases of rabies virus transmission among solid organ transplant
recipients. Infection with rabies virus likely occurred via neuronal tissue
contained in the transplanted organs, as rabies virus is not spread
hematologically. In collaboration with the CDC, state and local health
departments in Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas have initiated
investigations to identify a potential source of exposure for the donor and
to identify contacts of patients among health-care providers or domestic
contacts who might need rabies PEP.
The risk for healthcare-associated transmission of rabies is extremely low;
transmission of rabies virus from infected patients to health-care
providers has not been documented (5). The use of Standard Precautions (6)
for contact with blood and body fluids (for example, gloves, gown, mask,
goggles, or face shield as indicated for the type of patient contact)
prevents exposure to the rabies virus. No laboratory-confirmed cases of
human-to-human transmission of rabies among household contacts have been
reported (4). No cases of rabies have been reported in association with
transmission by fomites or environmental surfaces.
Routes of possible exposure include percutaneous and mucocutaneous entry of
the rabies virus through a wound, non-intact skin, or mucous membrane
contact. Intact skin contact with infectious materials is not considered an
exposure to the rabies virus. People with exposure as defined above to
saliva, nerve tissue, or CSF from any of the 4 infected patients should
receive rabies PEP. Types of exposures in domestic settings for which
administration of PEP would be appropriate include bites, sexual activity,
exchanging kisses on the mouth or other direct mucous membrane contact with
saliva, and sharing eating or drinking utensils or cigarettes. In
health-care settings, additional opportunities that can lead to
contamination of mucous membranes or non-intact skin with oral secretions
include procedures such as intubation or suctioning of respiratory
secretions or injuries with sharp instruments (needlesticks or scalpel
cuts). Percutaneous injuries (as from needlesticks) are considered
exposures because of potential contact with nervous tissue. Contact with
patient fluids (such as blood, urine, or feces) does not pose a risk for
rabies exposure (4).
All potential organ donors in the United States are screened and tested to
identify whether the donor might present an infectious risk. Organ
procurement organizations are responsible for evaluating organ donor
suitability, consistent with minimum procurement standards (7). Donor
eligibility is determined through a series of questions posed to family and
contacts, physical examination, and blood testing for evidence of organ
dysfunction and selected bloodborne viral pathogens and syphilis.
Laboratory testing for rabies is not performed. In the case reported here,
the donor's death was attributed to noninfectious causes. The role of organ
donor deferral is to optimize successful transplantation in the recipient,
including minimizing risk of infectious disease transmission to the lowest
level reasonably achievable without unduly decreasing the availability of
this life-saving resource. The benefits from transplanted organs outweigh
the risk for transmission of infectious diseases from screened donors. CDC
is working with federal and organ procurement agencies to review donor
screening practices.
