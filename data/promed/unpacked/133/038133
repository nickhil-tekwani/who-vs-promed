At least 9 new cases of _E. coli_ infection [clearly identified as _E.
coli_ O157:H7 below connected to a south side Sizzler restaurant were
confirmed late Friday and Saturday, and local health officials predicted
the number will grow in coming days.
"The curve is tapering off," said Milwaukee Health Commissioner Seth Foldy
on Saturday afternoon. "But we do fully expect to see more cases."
The 9 new cases bring the number of people linked to the Sizzler restaurant
to 30, including 18 children.
The restaurant has been closed since Wednesday, though Foldy said his
department has begun discussions with the restaurant on conditions for its
reopening.
The outbreak is the largest of _E. coli_ infection ever in Milwaukee
County, though not the largest in state history. One person has died so
far, [a 3-year-old [child. Two children remain hospitalized at Children's
Hospital as of Saturday afternoon, neither one in intensive care, said
Kelly Henrickson, a hospital pediatrician and Associate Professor at the
Medical College of Wisconsin.
However, [a 4-year-old girl remained in critical but stable condition
Saturday at Schneider Children's Hospital in New York. She ate at the
Sizzler while visiting her grandparents in Milwaukee.
Henrickson agreed with Foldy's prediction that more cases will show up.
"There are going to be more cases next week," he said.
Both health officials, who spoke at a news conference Saturday at
Children's Hospital, stressed the importance of physicians not
administering antibiotics or other medication to people with symptoms of
possible _E. coli_ infection, especially diarrhea with cramps or bloody
diarrhea. "Medication does more harm than good" in _E. coli_ cases, Foldy
said.
All suspected _E. coli_ cases must be reported to health officials, he
emphasized, preferably through the SurvNet communicable disease network at
(414) 286-3624.
Foldy said researchers have narrowed the list of possible food - or foods -
that was the source of infection. "The questions we are asking of patients
strongly suggest certain foods," he said. But he declined to identify the
foods, saying it might interfere with the investigation by affecting
people's memory of what they ate at the restaurant.
There is no doubt that the Sizzler was the source of the infection in the
30 people, he said. "Genetic fingerprintings from 7 are virtually
identical, from the same source," Foldy said. "We believe it's basically
case closed. This restaurant was the source of infection."
And while health officials found some improper food-handling techniques at
the restaurant, "what we've seen is not outstanding compared with other
restaurants," he said.
_E. coli_ is a common [bacterium, found in the digestive system of all
humans. But some strains of it can cause severe illness. The kind
responsible for this outbreak - and for most _E. coli_ sickness in the
United States - is a strain known as _E. coli_ O157:H7.
Transmission comes through the mouth, usually by eating foods that contain
the bacteria. Foods that have been implicated range from ground beef to
lettuce and sprouts, and some transmission also comes through water,
researchers say.
Because of the dangers of secondary infection - people becoming infected
from a person already infected - health officials stress the importance of
thorough hand washing.
_E. coli_ O157:H7 is a "very hardy" bacterium, Foldy said, and therefore
"requires a whole new level of sanitary conditions," such as separate
chopping blocks for meat and for vegetables.
There are no cures for _E. coli_ infection or the more serious
complication, HUS, Henrickson said. "We provide supportive care," he said,
while the body does what it can to fight the infection.
City health officials still want to hear from people who ate at the Sizzler
and are experiencing symptoms. The phone number is (414) 286-3616.
