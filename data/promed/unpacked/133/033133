The readers of ProMED-mail cannot imagine the diatribes we received
regarding the posting on debt forgiveness. None criticized ProMED-mail but
all had a clearly emotional base and they did not seem appropriate for
posting. It is not ProMED-mail's mission to do any more than report but
every once in a while we slip up and post something that aggravates a fair
proportion of our subscribers or one very loud one. Either way, we have to
sit up late at night to clarify our intentions. Not tonight. I am going
to bed. String cut.
