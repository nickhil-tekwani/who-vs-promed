The Nipah virus that has claimed over 13 lives in Kerala in the last few days seems to have spread to the neighbouring Karnataka; 2 suspected cases of Nipah virus infection have been reported from Mangaluru and Kasargod in Karnataka.

The outbreak is likely to hit tourism industry in the State as well, as Bahrain has issued a travel advisory asking its citizens to avoid visiting the Southern States while the UAE [United Arab Emirates] to urging its citizens in India to exercise caution and abide by the instructions of the local authorities. The Piniyari Government too has asked travellers to avoid visiting 4 northern districts Kozhikode, Malappuram, Wayanad and Kannur, in Kerala, even though the Union Health Ministry has said that the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala is a localised occurrence and there is no threat of it spreading.

According to reports, one patient is a 20-year-old woman from Kasargod and the other patient is a 75-year-old man from Mangaluru in Karnataka. It is suspected that the woman probably could have been exposed to the virus when she had visited the Perambra hospital in Kozhikode district of Kerala where a nurse was undergoing treatment for Nipah virus infection. The woman had been in close contact with the nurse. The nurse succumbed to the infection on [Mon 21 May 2018]. However, the 75-year-old man has no history of travel.

Samples from both the patients have been sent to the Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), Manipal. The samples will be sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune if the results from MCVR turn positive for Nipah Virus.

Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Puducherry Governments have said that there is no need to panic in these States, but officials have been asked to be on alert in case of any suspected outbreak. Meanwhile, the central team has devised draft guidelines, case definitions, advisory for healthcare workers, information to the general public, advisories for sample collection and transportation and a brief on Nipah virus disease.

In an advisory issued by Kerala Health Secretary Rajeev Sadanandan, it was stated that travelling to any part of Kerala was safe. But if travellers wished to be extra cautious, they may avoid the 4 districts -- Kozhikode, Malappuram, Wayanad and Kannur, it said.

The UAE too has urged its citizens in India to exercise caution and abide by the instructions of Indian authorities following the outbreak of the Nipah virus in Kerala while Bahrain has issued a travel advisory. It has asked its nationals to avoid travelling to Kerala until an outbreak of the rare Nipah virus is under control, the Gulf state's consulate in Mumbai said on its Twitter account on [Wed 23 May 2018].

The virus can cause flu-like symptoms and brain damage, and the outbreak has already killed 10 people in southern India, with at least 9 more being treated, officials said.

There is no vaccine for the Nipah virus, carried by fruit bats and spread [among people] through contact with bodily fluids, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. Treatment for the virus, which has a mortality rate of about 70 percent, is supportive care.

With 10 deaths due to the deadly Nipah virus being reported so far from northern Kerala, the state government yesterday [Wed 23 May 2018] issued an advisory asking travellers to avoid visiting the 4 districts of Kozhikode, Malappuram, Waynad and Kannur. "Travelling to any part of Kerala is safe. However, if travellers wish to be extra cautious, they may avoid the 4 districts", Health Secretary Rajeev Sadanandan said.

The government has also called for an all-party meeting at Kozhikode on [Fri 25 May [2018] to discuss the issue. MPs, MLAs, other representatives of people and leaders of various political parties would attend the meeting, Health minister K K Shylaja said.

In Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, 10 people have lost their lives to Nipah so far and 19 are undergoing treatment in various hospitals, including one in Waynad. Of the 13 confirmed cases, 10 people have died.

Isolation wards have also been set up in Thalassery government hospital in Kannur, according to media reports.

In Kozhikode, from where 7 deaths have been reported, District Collector U V Jose has ordered temporary stoppage of all training programmes and summer camps in affected areas such as Changaroth, Koorachund, Kottur, Cheruvannur, Chekyad, Chakkittapara and Olavanna.

The anganwadis [a center that provides basic health care in Indian villages] in these regions too have been asked to close down to avoid the spread of the virus among children.

However, no decision has been taken yet concerning the reopening of schools after the summer vacation. The administration is hoping that the situation will be under control by the time schools reopen after a week. "The number of newly infected cases is very low now", Mr. Jose said in a statement.

In neighbouring Malappuram, where 3 persons have died due to the virus, orders have been issued in 4 panchayats [basic units of local administration] to stop Anganwadi classes for the time being.

A crisis management group has been constituted to coordinate the response of government agencies following the deaths in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts. The group comprises Additional Chief Secretaries of Health, Revenue, Labour, Home; Principal Secretary Forest, Director Animal Husbandry and state Epidemiologists, among others.

Keeping in mind the sacrifice of the 28-year-old nurse at Perambra Taluk hospital, who died after being infected by the virus while treating her patients, the Government today decided to give a job to her husband and financial assistance of rs 10 lakh [USD 1465] each for her 2 sons -- aged 5 and 2. The next of kin of 9 others who died of the virus would be given an assistance of Rs. 5 lakh [USD 738] each.

Meanwhile, DGP Loknath Behara warned that stern action would be taken against those who spread false information with regard to the virus in the social media. Creation of fake or false messages, spreading them to cause panic or public disorder are criminal acts and liable for investigation and prosecution. Directions have been issued to DGP (crimes) to register criminal cases against the creators of the messages and propagators, he said.

An expert team from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), including its director, Dr. Sujeet Kumar Singh and Head of Epidemiology, Dr. S K Jain, and a high-level team from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) are already in Kerala to take stock of the situation.

Surveillance has been increased in all districts.

The outbreak of the virus infection, which is a newly emerging zoonosis that causes severe disease in both animals and humans, is suspected to be from an unused well which was infested with bats.

The natural host of the virus is believed to be fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family, _Pteropus_ genus.

The Kerala Health minister also said there was no need to be afraid of bats and their habitats should not to destroyed.

[A previous ProMED-mail post reported that bats roosing in a well may have been the source of Nipah virus infections in Kozhikode district's Changaroth village (see Nipah virus - India (03): (KL) conf. 20180522.5812214). A 22 May 2018 report in the Times of India indicated that team from National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal arrived in Kozhikode on that day. Following the Nipah virus outbreak that claimed 3 lives in Kozhikode and reports that fruit bats could be its natural host, people are becoming wary of bat colonies in their neighbourhood. Hundreds of Indian fruit bats, also known as the Indian flying fox bats, roosting on huge trees [not in wells] are not an uncommon sight. The bats are said to spread the virus through their droppings, saliva on half-eaten fruits. There are possibilities of human to human transmission. The ground under the canopy of trees that bats colonise is always found littered with a thick layer of droppings (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/govt-plans-to-trace-infected-bats-to-contain-nipah/articleshow/64266381.cms. - Mod.TY]

[This report provides no evidence of detection of Nipah virus contamination of dates or bananas associated with human cases in this area. However, fruit contaminated by fruit bats can be a source of human infection, as has occurred in children in Bangladesh who ate fallen fruit that the giant fruit bats had partially eaten. Public education is important to prevent consumption of contaminated fruit. - Mod.TY]
