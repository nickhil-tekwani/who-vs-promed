I have made a recent visit to East Timor, leaving Dili on the 17th of March.
1. The local Northern Territory newspaper reported on Saturday March 18th
an interview with a local epidemiologist. 50 cases of dengue diagnosed in
Darwin since the beginning of the year. 49 of these cases were acquired in
East Timor. (The origin of the last case was not mentioned.)
2. The UN hospital in Dili has isolated all four serotypes of dengue
fever, serology confirmed in Brisbane. In order of prevalence 2, 1 and
single cases of 3 and 4.
They have treated cases of DHF in UNTAET personnel. There has been at
least one fatality (in a civilian policeman from Ghana).
3. The ICRC hospital is seeing dengue and DHF/DSS in the local population
as well. The ICRC takes patients from throughout East Timor.
4. Vector control is haphazard, and my impression was that it was possibly
dependent upon the willingness of the peacekeeping unit in control of a
sector to protect both themselves and the local population by fogging,
larvacides etc.

[ProMED-mail has received other informal notes regarding dengue in East
Timor. We would appreciate receiving definitive information to post for
our subscribers. The isolation of all four dengue viruses does not portend
well, given the attendant risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever. - Mod.CHC
