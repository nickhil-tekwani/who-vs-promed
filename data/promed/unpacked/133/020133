13 years [see comment] after being spotted in Corsica, the bluetongue virus [serotype 1] has been identified in 3 herds in the far south of the island, said an official statement from the Prefecture Corse on Fri 6 Sep 2013, after a leak of information a few hours earlier. In the fall of 2000, the epidemic had decimated entire herds of sheep on the island.

Identification one of the serotypes of bluetongue virus in several herds of sheep in the far south of the island concerned all breeders. In the eastern plain, Ghisonaccia, this Sat 7 Sep 2013, the Regional Chamber of Agriculture organized an emergency meeting.

The information was reported late Friday [6 Sep 2013] morning by the President of the Regional Chamber of Agriculture (CARC), Joseph Colombani. Contacted by the CARC, the Regional Directorate for Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Corsica (DRAAF) confirmed the presence of cases without wanting to comment formally.

Joseph Colombani said he was aware of a suspected case of bluetongue in a flock of sheep in the Alistro region, Haute-Corse. Other cases involve the herds of 4 farmers in the region of Bonifacio, in total more than 600 sheep.

The province acknowledges having been alerted "last week of the presence of some sheep with symptoms of bluetongue (BT) in 3 farms in the far south of Corse-du-Sud."

"Five other farms located in the same geographic area as the 1st 3 had been within a surveillance perimeter," said the prefecture in a statement.

This would be bluetongue virus serotype 1, said Joseph Colombani, president of the Regional Chamber of Agriculture of Corsica (CRAC).

A meeting is scheduled for Fri 13 Sep 2013 in Paris, the Ministry of Agriculture stated. The organization of a vaccination campaign for the fight against serotype 1 should be discussed.

On 14 Dec 2012, France was officially declared free of bluetongue. "If she were to lose this status, France could no longer export calves for fattening, as is the case in Italy; the stakes are clearly economic," said the President of the Regional Chamber of Agriculture; for that "the state is willing to sacrifice some Corsican sheep on the altar of the French economy."

Bluetongue appeared for the 1st time in 2000 in Corsica. The disease then spread to the entire metropolitan area, hitting dozens of livestock. By the end of 2008, there were an estimated 32 000 outbreaks reported throughout the metropolitan area.

Bluetongue is a non-contagious viral disease transmitted by midges in wild ruminants or livestock, mainly sheep but less often goats, cattle, and deer. Being a viral disease, there is still no effective treatment. Control is provided by the quarantine of affected farms, euthanasia of affected animals, vaccination, and control of the insect vector.

[The appearance of bluetongue in the sheep population of Corsica should not be a surprise in view of the reported presence of active bluetongue in neighbouring Sardinia. The short distance between the 2 islands allows effective spread by windborne culicoides.

Italy has not submitted immediate notifications on its outbreaks in Sardinia in 2012 (serotype 1) and 2013 (serotype likely to be 1 but not published; see 20130127.1517285). In its annual OIE report for 2012, Italy reported that the disease was present, "restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s) of the country."

France's official confirmation of the outbreak and of the serotype involved is anticipated.

Sardinian sheep are known to be genetically very susceptible to bluetongue. Are Corsican sheep as susceptible?
