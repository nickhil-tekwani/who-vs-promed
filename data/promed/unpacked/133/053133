13.01.2000
Diagnosis of Lassa fever confirmed
A 23-year old female student who had been transferred from a hospital
in Schwaedbisch-Hall to the renowned Mission Hospital in Wuerzburg
on Tuesday, 11 Jan 2000, due to continuing high fever has been
confirmed as suffering from Lassa fever. The young woman who is
studying in Duesseldorf had returned to Germany at the beginning of
the year from a seven-week African holiday in Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory
Coast) and Ghana.
Lassa fever is caused by a virus which is transmitted to humans from a
small rat widely occurring in African dwellings -- mostly through food
contaminated with rodent excrement. Human-to-human transmission is
possible under bad hygienic conditions through direct contact with
blood, saliva, vomitus or urine from diseased individuals, particularly
during nursing. Most infected individuals start being infectious only
when they reach the acute febrile phase. The disease, a so-called viral
hemorrhagic fever, can lead to a severe bleeding disorder with shock
and circulatory collapse. In hospitalised patients mortality is about 15 %.
Often the disease may run a mild or asymptomatic course. There is
currently no vaccine.
After other diseases had been excluded and the suspicion of Lassa fever
corroborated, the necessary measures were co-ordinated in close
collaboration between the Medical Director of the Mission Hospital in
Wuerzburg, Professor Dr. Fleischer, the responsible outbreak
administrator of the Health Ministries of Bavaria and
Baden-Wuerttemberg, the Robert Koch-Institut (http://www.rki.de)
and the Bernhard Nocht-Institut in Hamburg
(http://www.bni.uni-hamburg.de) where the necessary laboratory
investigations are done. The Federal Health Ministry, the European
Union and the WHO were informed through the notification channels in
place for these cases.
The patient is being treated in an isolated part of the Hospital. She is
in a serious state. Isolation ensures that there is no risk for other
patients nor for the general population. Family members and friends
who had been in immediate contact, and the medical personnel who
looked after the patient in Schwaebisch Hall, are being interviewed by
the health authorities regarding details of their contacts and informed
about possible symptoms. Contact persons are being asked to take their
temperature twice daily, to be vigilant re possible symptoms and to
contact the Hospital in Schwaebisch Hall in case of symptoms. As it is a
rare but severe infectious disease the health authorities are doing
everything to prevent infection of others.

Wed, 12 Jan 2000 19:19:17 +0100
Suspicion of Lassa fever confirmed (Update)
The 23-year old female German student who is currently being treated
for Lassa fever in the Mission Hospital in Wuerzburg arrived in
Germany, according to latest information, not on New Year's eve but on
7 Jan 2000, probably through Frankfurt Rhein-Main airport.
According to further information she spent the night of 6-7 Jan 2000 in
a still unknown hotel in Lisbon, Portugal [now doubtful -- see [3]
below - Mod.JW], and had already fallen ill with high fever in Cote
d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) on 2 January 2000. She had not taken malaria
prophylaxis. Two yellow fever vaccinations had apparently been done
in time before the trip.
It is still unclear whether the patient had returned from Abidjan (Ivory
Coast) or Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) to Europe. As she had
apparently fallen ill before her departure from Africa, a potential risk to
fellow travellers on the plane cannot be excluded with certainty. At
present the flights she used from Ouagadougou or Abidjan and from
Lisbon are being traced [these are reported below - Mod.JW].

Lassa fever import 7 January 2000
The 23-year old German student who was transferred from a hospital in
Schwaebisch Hall to the renowned Mission Hospital in Wuerzburg on
Monday, 10 January 2000, due to continuing high fever has been
confirmed with Lassa fever. The young woman who is studying in
Duesseldorf had returned to Germany from a seven-week holiday in
Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana on Friday, 7 January.
According to what is known so far she used the following flights back to
Frankfurt am Main:
06.01.2000 Abidjan/Cote d'Ivoire - Lisbon Air Portugal flight no.TP
3149
07.01.2000 Lisbon - Frankfurt/M. Air Portugal flight no. TP 5576.
An overnight stay in a hotel in Lisbon that was initially assumed now
seems very unlikely. Apparently she spent only a few hours in Lisbon in
or near the airport.
The Ministry for Social Affairs in Baden-Wuerttemberg issued the
following information on 12 January 2000 asking the media to
disseminate it nationally: "All passengers are urgently requested to
contact tomorrow (i.e. 13 Jan 2000) their local health departments.
Passengers with the following symptoms are asked to go to hospital
immediately: fever greater than 38.5 degrees C, headache, sore throat,
coughing and intestinal upset.
The following details are requested from passengers:
Name
Seat number
Contact address and telephone no.
The infection of the patient is due to the particular circumstances of
her travel (rural area, basic conditions). A particular risk for
travellers from Africa including West Africa, particularly Cote d'Ivoire
and Ghana, cannot be concluded from this case.
Taking into account the incubation period of Lassa fever of 6 to 21 days
(mostly 7 to 10 days) secondary cases are very unlikely to have onset of
disease before 13 Jan 2000.

[Although Lassa virus is a rodent-borne virus like the hantaviruses, it is
an arenavirus, a different group. Unlike the Andes hantavirus, Lassa
virus is not known to be transmitted through the air, only through
contact with body fluids. Unless an air passenger or crew member or
person in the airport came into contact with the blood, vomit, urine or
excrement of this unfortunate person, it is extremely unlikely that any
transmission occurred.
Remember the case of the sick Gabonese doctor who did not know he
had Ebola, & who travelled by commercial flight from Gabon to
Johannesburg, South Africa -- nobody on his flight contracted the
disease. Ebola is another hemorrhagic fever that is not transmitted
through the air. Ref: Ebola - South Africa (04) 961119121357. -
