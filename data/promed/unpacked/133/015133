In the past week, several beekeepers in the Bellinger valley [New South Wales/NSW] have noticed a serious disease in their beehives, American foulbrood. This has forced the destruction of the hives, much to the chagrin of these beekeepers.

It is never pleasant to have to destroy a bee colony; however, the NSW biosecurity act is very clear: American foulbrood is a notifiable disease under the act and any beekeeper who suspects the disease must notify the NSW Department of Primary Industries within 24 hours.

If the colony tests positive, the colony must be destroyed and the combs are burnt to stop its spread. Beehives must then be either destroyed in the same fire, or wrapped in plastic and prepared for irradiation to sterilise the hives.

American foulbrood is a highly infectious disease that if allowed to progress, will result in the death of the colony, at which point it is spread to other colonies in the area.

Bellingen Bee Sanctuary and Bellinger Valley Hives and Honey are looking to conduct a study to determine the amount of American foulbrood in the local feral bee population.

Residents are urged to contact Bellingen bee sanctuary with the location of any feral honeybee colonies via email <atootzman1@gmail.com> or Bellinger Valley Hives and Honey at <bellingervalleyhoney@gmail.com>.

They can also contact the Bellingen Bee sanctuary via phone at 0472723182

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium known for its ability to cause this severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Its spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.

It is noticeable as a distinctive, unpleasant odor.

Hive tools can easily spread the disease between colonies.

Oxytetracycline hydrochloride can be used to treat American foulbrood. While this will clear up the initial appearance of infection, the spores are likely in the bees' food. Although disease signs are no longer seen, AFB spores have contaminated the bees' stored food. At some later date, the bees will get back into the spores and signs will develop, again. This may result in increased antibiotic use and potentially eventually cause antibiotic resistance.

A 2nd antibiotic, tylosin, registered for use in bees (at least in the USA) as a therapeutic treatment, meaning disease is already present in the hive. Correct use of this antibiotic is extremely important as it could get into the honey.
