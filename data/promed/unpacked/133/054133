Clarification of Conclusions on Neuraminidase Inhibitor Resistance
------------------------------------------------------------------
I wish to amend a ProMED-mail post that has been circulated
[containing a press report of a keynote address I recently gave at
the Spanish National Virology Congress in Valencia.
My conclusions regarding neuraminidase inhibitor resistance were the
following:
1. That neuraminidase inhibitor resistance is currently seen at very
low level in clinical trials;
2. That resistant viruses appear to be compromised in their fitness;
3. That the clinical significance of neuraminidase inhibitor
resistance is uncertain; and
4. That resistance monitoring will be essential to understand the
impact of neuraminidase inhibitor resistance as drugs become more
widely used.
These remarks are not equivalent to saying that neuroaminidase
inhibitor resistance is increasing, as stated in the press report
posted in ProMED-mail. The data do not exist to support this
statement! I would be grateful if you could circulate my remarks to
clarify any false impressions gained from this media report.
