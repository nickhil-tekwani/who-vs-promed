Oman has launched some of the most powerful technological solutions deployed to date in the Middle East to track the movement and spread of COVID-19 and ensure patient compliance with isolation measures, in an effort to contain the disease in the country. Named Tarassud Plus, the system is a combination of a mobile application using artificial intelligence, with enhanced features that include up-to-date COVID-19 statistics, guidelines, and best practices to prevent the spread of infection.

The application also enables access to medical hotlines and support staff so that patients can discuss their symptoms and be directed to facilities where they can access care. Once patients are diagnosed, a medical tracking bracelet connected to the application ensures that they stay at home for the duration of their quarantine or isolation. "As nations around the world emerge from lockdowns, we must remain vigilant," said Dr Jaffar Hussain, acting WHO representative to Oman. "Only through widespread testing, contact tracing, and surveillance of the virus can we ensure that infection curves stay flat and lives are saved."

The application is available in Arabic, English, Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu, in an effort to cater to both citizens and residents in Oman. It has been downloaded tens of thousands of times. "Information is crucial if we are to effectively fight the coronavirus, and this kind of epidemiological data will help us better understand how it spreads, while limiting new infections," said Dr Adil Al Wahaibi, Director of Surveillance in Oman's Ministry of Health.

As of [16 Jun 2020], Oman has reported 25 269 cases of COVID-19 and 114 deaths. A total of 11 089 people have recovered. With an increasing number of cases reported, the artificial intelligence used in the app helps public health professionals risk-stratify suspected cases and attend to the most crucial ones.

The platform can be used to combat misinformation about the spread of the virus, and, if it is more widely distributed, can help limit future outbreaks through early detection of symptoms and effective contact tracing. Officials say it may be used in the future to guarantee that individuals who test positive for the coronavirus cannot access crowded places such as malls and mosques.

The capital Muscat has established a round-the-clock Center of Operation Management to sift through COVID-19 data and conduct epidemiological surveillance to track the spread of the virus effectively. "The wealth of information gleaned from effective surveillance, monitoring, and contact tracing will ensure that Oman is also ready for any future outbreaks to protect the wider population," said Dr Seif Al Abri, Director General of Communicable Disease and Disease Surveillance, in Oman's Ministry of Health.

https://www.omanobserver.om/moh-develops-app-that-alerts-about-covid-positive-people-around-you/


Download the Ministry of Health's Tarassud Plus mobile app even if one does not have COVID-19, advises an official. The app can alert the user if there is a presence of a person with coronavirus symptoms anywhere in the proximity. The benefits are many, said Dr Sulien al Khalili from the Ministry of Health while she explained the functions of the apps.

The main objective of this artificial intelligence system is to reduce the spread of the coronavirus with its geographical tracking feature. "By activating the system you will be able to assess your health status by analysing the symptoms if you have any and see if it is related to COVID-19. On the other hand, if one is infected and is meant to be in isolation then it can check on the individual's adherence to the instructions and provide information whether the person is available at home or moving about," explained Dr Sulien. If the application is downloaded it can alert individuals if there is a presence of a person with COVID-19 anywhere in the proximity.

"It is used for isolated people and their families but I recommend everyone to download the application because it can help in having your own database of information in addition to guidelines on health status in connection with symptoms," she explained.

In regard to the current situation with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases Dr Sulien said it is the norm of the epidemiology of the pandemic. "We are opening up so many activities and trying to go back to normal life. So the increase in the number of cases is expected. Of course, people have had the time to learn about the nature of the pandemic so what we ought to do now is to go back to our knowledge and logic. Yes, we are going back to normal life but that does not mean the virus has gone. It is very much around us. We have to take precautions and avoid risks," advised the expert.

She urged not to forget hand hygiene, which is the cornerstone of prevention and secondly, the use of masks especially if you are around people. According to her, the system has been helpful in keeping in contact with people and guiding them. There has been a good response from people who have begun to use the app.

"I think the main reason is that the individuals have the support when they really need it, and for us, it has made our lives easy because nowadays the geographical data such as where they are located and how many are infected as well as how many have been in contact are all now easier to comprehend. It is also convenient to communicate with the people," said Dr Sulien al Khalili.

The medical scout is available in 5 languages -- Arabic, English, Hindi, Bangladeshi, and Urdu. and can be downloaded at <t.ly/Gw8j>

[More and more countries are moving to apps that include tracking of current infections both to track if they are observing isolation or quarantine protocols, as well as to alert individuals if there have been active virus infected individuals near where they are. South Korea was one of the early users of such an app, Germany just launched an app on Wednesday, 17 Jun 2020. While there are individuals against the use of these apps for "privacy" reasons, they have had overall fairly widespread acceptance and use in countries where they have been implemented.

Screenshots of the app can be found at the source URL above. Searching for the meaning of Tarassud in Arabic, it means "observing steadily with attentive eyes, expecting, waiting, hoping. (in Urdu, Turkish, and Farsi it means waiting, hoping), and apt name for this app. (https://tinyurl.com/ybbn8lrr)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information on the natural history of asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains scarce./1-3 The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the cruise ship Diamond Princess led to 712 persons being infected with SARS-CoV-2 among the 3711 passengers and crew members, and 410 (58%) of these infected persons were asymptomatic at the time of testing (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at [the source URL above]). /4,/5 Here, we report the natural history of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in part of this cohort.

A total of 96 persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were asymptomatic at the time of testing, along with their 32 cabinmates who tested negative on the ship, were transferred from the Diamond Princess to a hospital in central Japan between [19 and 26 Feb 2020] for continued observation. Clinical signs and symptoms of COVID-19 subsequently developed in 11 of these 96 persons, a median of 4 days (interquartile range, 3 to 5; range, 3 to 7) after the 1st positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test, which meant that they had been presymptomatic rather than asymptomatic. The risk of being presymptomatic increased with increasing age (odds ratio for being presymptomatic with each 1-year increase in age, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.16). 8 of 32 cabinmates with a negative PCR test on the ship had a positive PCR test within 72 hours after arrival in the hospital but remained asymptomatic. In total, data on 90 persons with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as persons who were asymptomatic at the time of the positive PCR test and remained so until the resolution of infection (as determined by two consecutive negative PCR tests), were available for analysis (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

The group of persons with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection consisted of 58 passengers and 32 crew members, with median age of 59.5 years (interquartile range, 36 to 68; range, 9 to 77). A total of 24 of these persons (27%) had coexisting medical conditions, including hypertension (in 20%) and diabetes (9%). The 1st PCR test at the hospital was performed a mean of 6 days after the initial positive PCR test on the ship. The median number of days between the 1st positive PCR test (either on the ship or at the hospital) and the 1st of the 2 serial negative PCR tests was 9 days (interquartile range, 6 to 11; range, 3 to 21), and the cumulative percentages of persons with resolution of infection 8 and 15 days after the 1st positive PCR test were 48% and 90%, respectively. The risk of delayed resolution of infection increased with increasing age (mean delay in resolution for an increase in age from 36 to 68 years, 4.41 days; 95% CI, 2.28 to 6.53) (Figure 1 Crossing-point values in RT-PCR testing of asymptomatic persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection).

In this cohort, the majority of asymptomatically infected persons remained asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The time to the resolution of infection increased with increasing age.

[A fascinating description of the studies of the passengers and crew on the now infamous Diamond Princess that was quarantined for 14+ days off Yokohama after it was learned that a passenger who had left the ship in Hong Kong, had tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (see prior ProMED-mail posts during the period 4-20 Feb 2020).

Note that 410 asymptomatic infections were identified, with 79 (19.3%) converting to symptomatic infections during the follow up period and were reclassified as pre-symptomatic infections. In total 311 (75.9%) of the asymptomatic infected individuals remained asymptomatic after complete follow up (a number of the PCR negative individuals were repatriated and were found to be PCR positive upon return to their home countries). This study focused on the 96 asymptomatic infections and their PCR negative cabinmates. The fascinating finding was the infection clearance rate most associated with age of infected individual -- the older the individual the longer it took to have a PCR negative test indicative of resolved infection. That being said, viral cultures were not done which would have identified those with prolonged infections with viable transmissible viruses vs those with persistent viral debris leaving genetic material behind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Little is known about the natural history of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or its contribution to infection transmission.

Methods
We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine center for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.

Results
Between [10 Mar 2020] and [4 Apr 2020], 14 000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13 (43%) never had symptoms and 17 (57%) were symptomatic. 17 (57%) participants acquired their infection outside Viet Nam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8/13 (62%) vs. 17/17 (100%) P=0.02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20/27 (74%) available saliva; 7/11 (64%) in the asymptomatic and 13/16 (81%) in the symptomatic group (P=0.56). Analysis of the probability of RT-PCR positivity showed asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P less than 0.001 for difference over 1st 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the 1st week of follow up. 2 of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to 4 contacts.

Conclusions
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTS. NTS viral loads fall faster in asymptomatic individuals, but they appear able to transmit the virus to others.

[While the numbers in this study are small, the cited percentage of asymptomatic infections among contacts of SARS-CoV2 positive cases is an impressive 43%. The suggestion that 2 of the asymptomatic infected individuals may have transmitted the virus to as many as 4 individuals (an R0 of 2.0) is consistent with the speculation that the asymptomatic infected individuals are the secret weapon of this virus to behave in a stealth manner and make identifying chains of transmission difficult in the early stages of the outbreaks in locations around the world, including in the original outbreak in Wuhan, but also in Iran, Italy, Spain, the USA. In the early stages of the outbreak, only symptomatic individuals were tested, including symptomatic contacts, leaving a significant number of asymptomatic infected individuals to continue the chains of transmission under the radarscope. As the authors stress in their discussion, the testing and quarantining of all identified contacts is critical for ultimately interrupting the chains of transmission of this virus.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 63.4% of the global newly reported cases and 68.3% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 47.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA reported 31.6%, Chile 4.6%, Mexico 4.3%, and Peru 3.0%. The same 5 countries remained at the top, with Brazil switching place with the USA.

The European region reported 9.8% of the global newly reported cases and 9.3% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 43.1% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by the UK 7.2%, Turkey 7.0%, Ukraine 4.1%, Germany 3.8%, and Belarus 3.4%. Again, same countries, minor juggling of orders and percentages day by day (Germany and Belarus switched places).

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10.4% of the global newly reported cases and 10.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 26.1% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Saudi Arabia 20.8%, Iran 12.2%, Iraq 9.9%, Egypt 8.2%, Qatar 5.4%, and Oman 4.7%. Same countries, minor juggling of positions (Iraq and Egypt switched places).

The African region reported 4.6% of the global newly reported cases and 2.6% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 58.7% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 7.8%, Ghana 6.1%, Cote d'Ivoire and Ethiopia at 4.7% each, Central African Republic 2.4%, and Congo DR and Mauritania at 2.3% each. While South Africa and Nigeria are consistently numbers 1 and 2 in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day (Cameroon was number 2 yesterday, 20 Jun 2020, and today reported 0 newly confirmed cases).

The Western Pacific region reported 0.75% of the global newly reported cases and 0.46% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 68.7% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 15.9%, Japan 4.7%, South Korea 3.5%, and China and Australia 2.0% each. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Malaysia and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 11.1% of the global newly reported cases and 8.4% of global deaths. India reported 76.1% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 16.0%, Indonesia 6.1%, and Nepal 1.6%. Same countries, same order as in previous days.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 7000+ new cases a day (down from 8000+ per day). The Eastern Mediterranean has surpassed the European region, with Pakistan reporting around 4000+ cases a day and Saudi Arabia reporting around 4000+ cases a day. South East Asia has overtaken both the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions, with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day (over 15 000 cases today 21 Jun 2020). The Americas region is usually reporting around 70 000 cases a day (over 100 000 cases today 21 Jun 2020), with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day (over 50 000 cases today 21 Jun 2020) and the USA at 20 000-25 000+ a day (over 30 000 today 21 Jun 2020). In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 3000-4000+ range daily, and the Western Pacific region is maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 500+ cases per day (over 900 cases today 21 Jun 2020). (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 21 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which overtook the Eastern Mediterranean and European regions today [20 Jun 2020] in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 9 045 457, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The global case count has now surpassed the 9 million mark, having passed the 8 million mark on 15 Jun 2020, the 7 million mark on 7 Jun 2020, and the 6 million mark on 29 May 2020 -- the interval to confirm 1 million cases keeps shortening. The USA, with more than 2.35 million confirmed cases, now represents 26.1% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil, having crossed the 1 million mark (more than 1.08 million cases), represents 12.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. A global total of 470 698 deaths have been reported, an increase of 3980 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Italy, Chile, and Iran at number 10. China is number 21. In descending rank order, USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Russia, Pakistan, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Iran, all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, a change in the last 24 hours as China moved to slot 21. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
