On 18 Jul [2021], 2 yellow fever cases in individuals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) tested positive by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) at Centre Pasteur in Cameroon (CPC), according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report.

The 1st case is a 34-year-old man from the Abuzi health zone, North Ubangi province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, whose date of symptom onset was 20 Feb 2021 with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, and physical asthenia. Jaundice appeared on 25 Feb [2021].

The 2nd case is a 47-year-old female unvaccinated against yellow fever from Ango Health zone, Bas Uele province. She first exhibited symptoms on 7 May 2021.

In addition, confirmatory results are pending for 3 other presumptive positive cases from Equateur, Kinshasa, and North Ubangi provinces.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that spreads through the bites of infected mosquitoes.

Symptoms of yellow fever (fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches) develop 3-6 days after infection. About 15% of people infected with yellow fever virus will develop severe illness that can lead to liver disease, bleeding, shock, organ failure, yellowing skin (jaundice), and sometimes death.

There are no medications to treat or cure yellow fever. Yellow fever vaccine is the best protection against this disease.

[Yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). These 2 confirmed cases and the 3 presumptive positive cases are from various localities and doubtless are spillover from the sylvan (forest) or intermediate (savannah) transmission cycles, unlike the major urban cycle that originated in neighboring Angola and spread into the southern part of the DRC in 2016-2017. In that outbreak, DRC reported 2987 suspected cases, with 81 laboratory-confirmed cases and 16 deaths. The above report does not indicate if the areas where the current cases occurred have been included in the extensive YF vaccination campaign that was implemented earlier this year (2021). On 27 Apr 2021, the DRC launched a preventive yellow fever vaccination campaign targeting more than 16.3 million people, the 1st such drive against the disease in Africa in 2021. - Mod.TY
