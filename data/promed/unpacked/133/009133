Livestock anthrax in Argentina
------------------------------
An outbreak of bovine anthrax was noted on [28 Feb 2009] in a cattle
ranch in the Partido [municipality] of Benito Juarez in the province
of Buenos Aires. The herd consists of 150 Aberdeen Angus cattle, none
of which had been vaccinated. 3 head died suddenly and _Bacillus
anthracis_ was isolated from a metatarsal [bone marrow]. No estancia
[farm] hands were involved in handling the carcass.

The rainfall in the central region of the province has been the
lowest in the past 47 years. The lack of rain and high temperatures
appear to have reduced the number of anthrax outbreaks in the
[summer] of 2008-2009. The months of January-February [2009] were
climatically identical [hot & dry] and the cattle are thin and
generally in very poor condition.

[This is very similar to the dry year scenarios that we have recently
been seeing in the Dakotas and Texas, USA. Sporadic outbreaks occur but
they are essentially limited to one or a few animals with no spread.
One must remember that droughts are very stressful for livestock and
with their innate resistance way down, minimal infective doses of
spores can bring down the odd animal. It doesn't help if they haven't
been vaccinated. Our thanks to Ramon for this report. - Mod.MHJ]
