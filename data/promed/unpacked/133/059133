SALMONELLA, POULTRY VACCINATION - UK

It is reported by the BBC [18th June 1998] that "millions of chickens" are
going to be vaccinated this summer in the UK in an attempt to restore
public confidence in eggs. The vaccination of the first batch of 20 million
layers will cost BPS 4 million, but the farmers hope that the cost will be
recouped by an increased consumption of eggs. It is intended that the
programme will be completed by early 1999.
The UK egg industry is still feeling the effects of the egg problems of a
decade ago when the then Health Minister warned that eggs were unsafe to
eat as most were contaminated with salmonellae. The government reacted to
this scare by launching a drive to identify and slaughter infected birds.
The rise in human infections gradually increased nonetheless.
There is not 100% support in the industry for this new programme.

[The BBC was skimpy on details and more information has been requested from
my British colleagues. In the meanwhile Germany is successfully using a
vaccine based on a nonpathogenic, modified _S. typhimurium_ single deletion
mutant that has produced good results and is now mandated. Initiation was
followed by a reduction in poultry prevalence and then by human incidence.
The companies producing the vaccine are Empstoff Dessau, Lohmann Animal
Health, and Hoechst. Apparently there are plans to use this vaccine or a
similar in pigs. The USDA will not allow a single deletion mutant vaccine
in the USA and a double deletion mutant has been developed by Ray Curtis at
Washington University, St Louis, that is undergoing final approval trials
following which it will be marketed by Megan Animal Health. Obviously such
a vaccine programme is a two-edged sword -- "Great vaccine but why do you
need it?" -- plus there is a public concern with live vaccines, however
safe.
Interestingly, while _S. enteriditis_ is normally reservoired in poultry,
the European phage type 4 (pt4) has a human not poultry reservoir in
California. The pt4 moved to Mexico from Europe and apparently then came
north with migrant workers. A local overloaded sewage works plus heavy
rains resulted in overflow and downstream contamination and the salmonella
finding its way to the nearby poultry farms. Subsequently instituted sewage
surveillance noted its presence throughout much of California. - Mod.MHJ]
