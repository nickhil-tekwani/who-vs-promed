[Currently, there is no available vaccine against Nipah virus. That situation may change. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) on 24 May 2018 announced a collaboration with Profectus BioSciences, Inc. and Emergent BioSolutions Inc. under which Profectus and Emergent will receive up to USD 25 million to advance the development and manufacture of a vaccine against the Nipah virus, a bat-borne virus that can spread to both humans and livestock. Under the terms of the Framework Partnering Agreement for the collaboration among the three parties, Profectus will receive development funding from CEPI for advancing its Nipah virus vaccine and Emergent will provide technical and manufacturing support for the CEPI-funded program. Emergent, through a separate agreement with Profectus, has an exclusive option to license and to assume control of development activities for the Nipah virus vaccine from Profectus. The international nonprofit organization PATH will also be working with the consortium under a separate agreement with CEPI to work on clinical development (http://cepi.net/news/cepi-awards-25-million-contract-profectus-biosciences-and-emergent-biosolutions-develop-nipah). The development and testing of a new vaccine is likely to take many months and perhaps require more than the USD 25 million that has generously been given to start the vaccine's development. - Mod.TY]

There are 2 suspected cases of Nipah infection that have been isolated in Hyderabad's public hospitals. According to [Telangana] State health officials, the 2 individuals, men in their mid-20s, were isolated after they exhibited symptoms associated with Nipah virus [infection].

Dr Ramesh Reddy, Director of Medical Education, said one of the 2, an IT professional, recently visited Kerala and developed respiratory illness without encephalitis.

In the 2nd case, the patient isolated at NIMS [Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences ] hospital showed symptoms of encephalitis but had no history of travel to Kerala.

Dr Reddy said blood samples from both individuals were sent to National Institute of Virology [NIV], Pune, for testing. Isolation wards have been readied in public hospitals and the State was prepared if an outbreak occurred.

"We do not want to take any chances. Blood samples and throat swabs of both the patients have been sent to NIV-Pune for Nipah virus infection test. We also asked them to test for swine flu. We expect the result to come this evening or tomorrow," Mr Reddy told PTI [Press Trust of India] on [Fri 25 May 2018].

In Kerala, the Nipah virus has so far claimed 11 lives [now 12] and the state government has stepped up efforts to contain the outbreak. According to a Union Health Ministry advisory, the Nipah virus, which commonly affects animals such as bats, pigs, dogs, and horses, can spread to humans and cause serious illness among humans. Spread of the virus to humans may occur after close contact with other Nipah-infected people, infected bats, or infected pigs.

[If the 2nd case, who has no travel outside of the state, is confirmed as positive for Nipah virus infection, that would be an indication that the virus is more widely spread in India than previously documented and is present in Telangana state. There is no indication of the circumstances under which these 2 cases might have been exposed to the virus or its hosts. - Mod.TY
