• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. The number of 2022 cases stand at 48. There were 28 cases in 2021.
• The outbreak is affecting primarily the east of the country, and the risk of further expansion of the outbreak is compounded by a significant number of zero-dose children in the area.

Egypt
• 1 cVDPV2 positive environmental sample was reported in Giza. There are 16 positive samples reported in the country.
• An internal surveillance review is scheduled for this month [June 2022], as part of preparations for the expected Outbreak Response Assessment.

Ethiopia
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There were 10 cases reported in 2021.

Eritrea
• On 3 Jun 2022, the Global Polio Laboratory Ne2rk (GPLN), received notification of a cVDPV2 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case detected in Eritrea. The isolated virus is linked to a VDPV2 last detected in July 2020 in Sudan and belongs to the CHA-NDJ-1 emergence, originating in Nigeria. The case had onset of paralysis on [3 Sep 2021].
• The Government of Eritrea has declared this outbreak to be a national public health emergency, in line with temporary recommendations issued by the IHR Emergency Committee on polio.
• Local public health authorities are conducting a full field investigation, supported by the GPLN and the African Rapid Response Team, including to more clearly identify the extent of circulation since its last detection (including potentially in neighbouring countries), and to plan a response as needed, as per revised international polio outbreak response SOPs. Surveillance is being strengthened, including for active searches for any additional AFP cases in and around the immediate area of the detected case.
• Eritrea benefits from high levels of routine vaccination coverage, estimated at 95% (according to 2020 WHO-UNICEF Coverage Estimates), and a non-polio AFP surveillance rate of 1.44 in 2022 (declined from 6.86 in 2021).

Gambia
• No cVDPV2 positive environmental samples were reported this week. There were 9 positive samples in 2021.

Ghana
• 2 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples were reported in the Northern province. There are 4 positive samples reported in 2022.

• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There were 3 cVDPV2 cases in 2021.

Madagascar
• 4 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported; 1 in Sofia and 3 in Menabe bringing the number of 2022 cases to 5. There were 13 cases in 2021.

Malawi
• No case of WPV1 was reported this week. In February [2022], the country reported the 1st WPV1 case on the continent since 2016, with onset of paralysis in November 2021.
• Following the 1st of a series of multi-country outbreak responses implemented in March [2022], preparations are ongoing in both Malawi and neighbouring countries for the subsequent campaigns.
• In total, at least 4, multi-country campaigns will be implemented. Round 2 was successfully implemented last week across the country, with almost 3 million children reached, with independent monitoring indicating 94% coverage achieved.
• Lessons learned from the 1st round helped inform preparations for the 2nd campaign, including focusing on further strengthened coordination at all levels, microplanning, training and supervision, social mobilization and increased social mobilization and mass media engagement.
• At the same time, surveillance continues to be strengthened including at critical subnational levels.

Mauritania
• No cVDPV2 positive environmental sample was reported this week. There were 7 positive samples linked to the Jigawa outbreak in 2021.

Mozambique
• Following confirmation of WPV1 last month [May 2022], the Government of Malawi declared this outbreak to be a national public health emergency, alongside the cVDPV2 affecting the country.
• The Government goal is to respond to both outbreaks rapidly and with high quality with additional supplementary immunization activities (SIA) covering all country. Both outbreak responses will be considered regional responses and synchronization of activities is being planned.
• Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of Acute Flaccid Paralysis and poliovirus are being implemented in all 11 provinces with special attention to borders with Malawi and Zimbabwe.
• National and subnational authorities continue to be supported by partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, notably by experts of the African Rapid Response Team and the GPLN.
• Detection of this most recent case underscores the appropriateness of the large-scale, rapid, multi-country emergency outbreak response across south-east Africa, in line with revised international polio outbreak response SOPs. The overriding priority is to continue to implement the subregional emergency response, by continuing to conduct large-scale, rapid and high-quality response campaigns.
• Outbreak response plans are currently being reviewed, to ensure rapid and appropriate response to both strains.
• Vaccine logistics is being coordinated across all levels to ensure appropriate supply.
• The Emergency Operations Centre (MOH and GPEI partners) continues to coordinate response across all levels
• Based on outcomes of review of rounds 1 and 2, an SIA quality improvement plan before upcoming rounds is being developed and will be distributed to all levels
• An SIA preparedness plan is in place, to monitor preparedness levels ahead of the next rounds

Niger
• No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported this week. There are 2 cases in 2022 so far. There were 17 cases reported in 2021.

[Note that the 2 reported cases of WPV1 associated AFP refer to the 7th and 8th confirmed cases in Pakistan. Adding in the 2 imported cases into Africa (Malawi and Mozambique), the total number of WPV1 associated AFP cases with dates of onset in 2022 is now 10.

Last week there was only 1 country reporting cVDPV activity... this week there are 7 -- 3 with AFP cases and 4 with positive environmental samples. Disconcerting is the addition of a new country, Eritrea, with cVDPV2 circulation.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan: why the resurgence?
Date: Thu 9 Jun 2022

Why is polio on the rise in Pakistan?
-------------------------------------
Polio cases are on the rise in Pakistan although it's an illness eradicated almost everywhere else in the world. Part of the problem is widespread vaccine skepticism and outlandish conspiracy theories.

Pakistan's polio eradication campaign is in disarray, as a high number of cases emerge in the northwestern tribal district of North Waziristan. A total of 8 polio cases were recorded in the span of just 1 month, raising concerns that the disease could be on the rise again in the South Asian country of 220 million. The most recent case of child paralysis as a result of polio in Pakistan was reported in January 2021.

Experts say that vaccine skepticism is one of the biggest contributors to the spread of the illness, as people increasingly use fake vaccination markings.

"The outbreak in North Waziristan appears to be following the same pattern as that witnessed in 2014 and 2019, when there was a surge in cases in the same area. We are working tirelessly to ensure that we break this pattern," Federal Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel told DW [Deutsche Welle, German state broadcaster].

"Over 99% of the world is now polio-free. Our children also deserve a life free from this incurable disease," Patel added.

The disease, which mainly affects children under the age of 5, can infect the spinal cord, causing paralysis.

"Fake markings and refusals absolutely are 2 factors in the recent jump in the cases. The polio inoculation teams conspire with parents to miss the vaccination of the children," an official with the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program told DW, on the condition of anonymity.

[3] Americas region alert: PAHO

PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert Poliovirus outbreak risk 10 Jun 2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Considering the risk of importation of wild poliovirus and vaccine-derived poliovirus, or the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus in the Region of the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) shares with its Member States a series of considerations related to the prevention, surveillance, and preparation.

Situation summary
----------------
Following certification of the global eradication of wild poliovirus types 2 and 3, polio continues to be endemic for wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in 2 countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In Afghanistan, as of 7 June 2022, 1 case of WPV1 had been detected and 4 were detected in 2021. In Pakistan, 8 cases of WPV1 have been reported in 2022.

In addition, in February 2022, the isolation of a WPV1 was confirmed in a 3-year-old girl with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Malawi. The analysis shows that the virus is genetically linked to WPV1 that was detected in Pakistan in October 2019. This is the first case of WPV1 on the African continent in more than 5 years. In May 2022, 1 case of WPV1 was identified in stool samples collected from a child with AFP in Mozambique. Sequencing of the virus confirmed that it is linked to a strain from Pakistan, similar to a WPV1 case reported in Malawi in February [2022].

This detection of WPV1 outside the 2 endemic countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan, is of great concern and underscores the importance of prioritizing activities to detect and control polio.

Additionally, several countries in Africa and Asia have circulation of vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), variants of poliovirus that may arise in communities with low vaccination coverage. Recently, VDPV outbreaks have been detected in Israel and Ukraine (Figure 1) [all figures and tables available at source URL]. As long as poliovirus transmission is not interrupted worldwide, all countries remain at risk of polio importation.

Situation Summary in the Region of Americas
-------------------------------------------
In 1994 the Region of the Americas was certified as polio-free. This achievement was attained through the implementation of routine vaccination programs, the use of mass vaccination campaigns, and the implementation of surveillance of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children under 15 years of age.

Since the certification of polio elimination, countries in the Americas have continued vaccination efforts and epidemiological surveillance of AFP. However, between 2020 and 2021, the decline in vaccination coverage that already started before the COVID-19 pandemic was exacerbated. In 2020 there was a significant decrease in the detection of AFP per 100 000 children < 15 years compared to the detection in prior years. At the regional level, the average rate fell from 1.27 for the period 2016-2019, to 0.83 for 2020 and 2021. Also, comparing these same periods, there is a marked increase in the number of countries/territories that did not reach a rate greater than or equal to 1 (Table 1).

[Table 1. Rates of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) detected per 100 000 children]

Additionally, as shown in Figure 2, Polio3 coverage (either of the oral vaccine or the inactivated polio vaccine in children under 1 year of age) shows a downward trend or is below 95% in 33 of the 42 countries/territories for which data are shown. If this trend continues in vaccination coverage and epidemiological surveillance, there is a high risk of outbreaks occurring after the importation of a virus (wild or derived from the vaccine) or the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus, and that these are not detected in time.

[Figure 2. Immunization coverage of the 3rd dose of polio (% of vaccinated population) per year by country/territory. Region of the Americas, 2011 to 2021*.]

Guidance for national authorities
---------------------------------
Given these findings, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) reminds Member States that the most effective measure to reduce the risk of poliovirus outbreaks is to maintain good levels of immunity in the population through high and homogeneous vaccination coverage, and through sensitive epidemiological surveillance that allows the timely detection and investigation of all AFP cases.

In addition, the following considerations on vaccination, surveillance, risk mitigation and outbreak response plans are provided for national authorities:

Vaccination
------------
PAHO/WHO recommends all countries achieve and maintain high levels of polio vaccine coverage (>= 95%), both nationally and subnationally. Countries that have not introduced the 2nd dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV2) should do so as soon as possible.

Surveillance
------------
It is important that all countries/territories in the region strengthen surveillance of AFP cases to facilitate a timely response to the detection of an import or emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus:
• Detection and reporting of cases of AFP in children under 15 years of age: Train health personnel at all levels in the detection and notification of AFP. The number of AFP cases reported each year is used as an indicator of a country's ability to detect polio, even in countries where the disease no longer occurs. A country's surveillance system must be sensitive enough to detect at least 1 case of AFP for every 100 000 children under the age of 15, even in the absence of polio.
• Collection and transport of stool samples for analysis: At the onset of paralysis, polio can be difficult to differentiate from other forms of AFP such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis or traumatic neuritis. All children with AFP should be screened for wild poliovirus within 14 days of the onset of paralysis. For polio testing, fecal samples are tested for the presence of poliovirus. Samples must arrive at the laboratory within 72 hours of collection. Otherwise, they must be frozen (at -20 degrees Celsius [-4 deg F]) and then sent frozen.
• Laboratory confirmation: The sample is inoculated into cell cultures where the virus can infect and replicate. The isolated virus is then typified by molecular assays (RTPCR) to determine the serotype and whether it is a wild virus, or a vaccine virus. Then genetic sequencing tests confirm its genotype. The genetic sequence obtained is compared with a reference bank of known polioviruses, allowing inferences to be made about the geographical origin of the virus isolated from the sample.

Risk mitigation plan
--------------------
Countries/territories are recommended to develop a risk analysis and implement the necessary actions to mitigate the risk by achieving high vaccination coverage and maintaining a sensitive surveillance system.

Outbreak response plan: Countries/territories are urged to have an up-to-date outbreak response plan in place to be prepared to respond in a timely manner to the occurrence of an imported WPV1 or vaccine-derived poliovirus case or to the emergence of vaccine-derived poliovirus.
