Netherlands on the alert after new cases of sheep disease
-----------------------------------------------
Dutch agricultural authorities placed the entire country under a
special regime after the discovery of 2 new cases of bluetongue
disease, deadly to sheep.
The Netherlands have notably stepped up export restrictions for
cattle, sheep and goats.
The latest cases were 2 infected cows in the northern province of Friesland.
Bluetongue is a non-contagious, insect-transmitted, viral disease
fatal to sheep but which is not known to affect humans.

[According to a press release of the Dutch Ministry of agriculture,
the 2 cases were detected in bovines held on a collecting centre of
bovines for export, in the vicinity of Leeuwarden in Friesland,
northern Netherlands. The origin of these cows was not in the known
infected area in Zuid Limburg, but in the province Noord Brabant, so
far not known to be affected. This is the background to the decision
to declare the entire territory of the Netherlands as a restriction
area. For a map showing Netherlands' provinces, see

The French Ministry of Agriculture published on 5 Sep 2006 a press
release on the 4th case of bluetongue (in a bull calf) in France,
namely at Tailly, the Ardennes region, Lat: 49:26:06N, Lon: 5:04:53E.
