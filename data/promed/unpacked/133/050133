Central Kentucky has also been experiencing a higher number of cases of
_Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ (like that of Wyoming and
Colorado). In 2002 our clinic's (Hagyard-Davidson-Mcgee, Lexington, KY)
federally accredited laboratory had 26 confirmed cases. In 2001 we had NO
confirmed cases of "Pigeon Fever." As of today we are still seeing a few
cases (n=2).

[This disease was considered to occur rarely, and for some as yet
unexplained reason there appears to a dramatic increase in several places.
Although one cannot point to a direct relationship here, the only clear
change of recent has been the introduction and rapid spread of West Nile
Virus. Could WNV have decreased resistance in horses that ordinarily would
have had a subclinical case of Corynebacterium (Pigeon Fever)? - Mod.TG]
