Polio cripples 2 more kids; national count touches 47
----------------------
Be it parental refusal or fake finger-marking, there can be no justification for the rising number of polio cases in Pakistan at a time when the country should have been inching towards zero poliovirus transmission. Another 2 children -- one of them an 18-month-old male child from Quetta and the other a 10-month-old girl child from Bannu -- were afflicted with the crippling disease on Friday [26 Jul 2019], taking the country's national count to 47 so far this year [2019].

A point in time comparison with 2018 shows Pakistan as having reported 47 cases from 17 districts in 2019, versus only 3 cases from one district Dukki in 2018. If the 9 polio cases reported in the 2nd half of 2018 were to be added to this year's [2019] total, then the country is seen to have reported 56 new cases since the PTI government's coming into power. And the situation could not have been grimmer.

Announcing the latest case from Balochistan through an official statement, the National Emergency Operations Centre [NEOC] has termed investigations as revealing that the case was a consequence of "fake finger-marking" by the child's parents. Finger marking is the standard practice for polio eradication teams to ascertain whether children have been vaccinated during campaigns or not. In certain communities with severe misconceptions about polio vaccine, parents have been marking the fingernails of their children on their own in order to avoid vaccination during campaigns.

Fake finger-marking and parental refusal are not the key reasons for Pakistan's rising polio burden, as is currently being trumpeted. Data sheets recording weekly surveillance reports show that only 8 of the 45 cases that had been reported up until [25 Jul 2019] were refusals. As such, it is crucial for Pakistan's polio leadership to desist from blaming parents in every statement, and to instead truthfully analyze the factors impeding Pakistan's progress in the zero-polio case journey. A closer analysis of data underlines the need for serious brainstorming so that the problem is approached through a multipronged strategy encompassing community awareness through key influencers; enhancing routine immunization coverage, and improving safe water and sanitation, among other interventions that the polio leadership knows better.

The NEOC maintains that the child from Quetta, who is a resident of Chiltan Town, had not received any dose of polio vaccine during campaigns. His family is alleged to have resorted to fake finger-marking in order to lead teams to believe that he had been vaccinated. "After the child developed symptoms of paralysis in both limbs, his mother regretted not having gotten her child vaccinated," the statement mentions. The child did have 2 routine immunization doses as per parental recall, but the parents did not have a vaccination card for confirmation.

As for the latest case from Bannu, the child is a resident of Sedgai, UC Takhti Khel, Tehsil Wazir, and her vaccination history is under investigation.

Expressing his views, the Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio Eradication Babar Bin Atta urged communities to reject the anti-vaccine propaganda and to end practices such as fake finger-marking. He further stated that such misconceptions and practices are keeping Pakistan's children vulnerable to the virus and are ultimately detrimental to their long-term health and well-being.

Of the 47 polio cases reported from across Pakistan so far this year [2019], 36 are from Khyber Pakthunkwa and the Khyber Pakthunkwa Tribal Districts, 5 from Punjab, 3 each from Balochistan and Sindh.

[The 2 newly confirmed cases mentioned in the above media report have also been reported on the End Polio Pakistan website (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces) bringing the total number of cases confirmed since 1 Jan 2019 to 47. All 4 of the provinces in the country have reported cases (Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). If one adds this to the 11 cases confirmed in Afghanistan this year (2019), the global tally of confirmed AFP cases attributable to WPV1 during 2019 is now at 58.

A curiosity in the above media report is the statement "Data sheets recording weekly surveillance reports show that only 8 of the 45 cases that had been reported up until [25 Jul 2019] were refusals." In most media reports of newly confirmed cases, the media commentary has been that the parents had refused vaccinations for the children, a conflicting bit of information than is in this media report today. The question remains as to why the children were not vaccinated.

Unfortunately, cases continue to be reported, and from other media reports, vaccination coverage during the campaigns has been suboptimal.

------------------------------------------
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The latest wild poliovirus (WPV) case in Nigeria occurred in August 2016 and was reported in September 2016, in Borno State.

What is added by this report?
The number of children living in insurgent-held areas in Borno who have not had access to poliovirus vaccines was reduced by 87% during December 2016 - May 2017. Trained community members living in insurgent-held areas have reported suspected polio cases with no WPV identified on virologic testing, which suggests that WPV transmission might have been interrupted in Nigeria. However, outbreaks caused by type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) are spreading internationally.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Improved polio mass campaign quality is required to achieve interruption of all cVDPV2 transmission in Nigeria.

The number of wild poliovirus (WPV) cases in Nigeria decreased from 1122 in 2006 to 6 WPV type 1 (WPV1) in 2014 (1). During August 2014 - July 2016, no WPV cases were detected; during August - September 2016, 4 cases were reported in Borno State. An insurgency in northeastern Nigeria had resulted in 468 800 children aged less than 5 years deprived of health services in Borno by 2016. Military activities in mid-2016 freed isolated families to travel to camps, where the 4 WPV1 cases were detected. Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) campaigns were intensified during August 2016 - December 2017; since October 2016, no WPV has been detected (2). Vaccination activities in insurgent-held areas are conducted by security forces; however, 60 000 unvaccinated children remain in unreached settlements. Since 2018, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has emerged and spread from Nigeria to Niger and Cameroon; outbreak responses to date have not interrupted transmission. This report describes progress in Nigeria polio eradication activities during January 2018 - May 2019 and updates the previous report (2). Interruption of cVDPV2 transmission in Nigeria will need increased efforts to improve campaign quality and include insurgent-held areas. Progress in surveillance and immunization activities will continue to be reviewed, potentially allowing certification of interruption of WPV transmission in Africa in 2020.

Security Situation
A violent insurgency that arose in 2009 and was followed by insurgents seizing territory beginning in 2012 in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe states (and bordering areas of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger) led to the internal displacement of 1.8 million persons (3). By 2016, this conflict created a humanitarian crisis in which an estimated 468 800 children aged less than 5 years resided in insurgent-held areas in Borno with no health services, including vaccination and surveillance activities (2). Since December 2016, movement of populations within and out of Borno insurgent-held areas has continued with increasing numbers of persons now living in areas outside insurgents' control; however, many settlements remain inaccessible ([Figure - Inhabited settlements reached with bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine using standard house-to-house, Reaching Every Settlement, and Reaching Inaccessible Children approaches during August - December 2016 (A) and August 2016 - May 2019 (B), by number of cumulative vaccination visits reaching children aged less than 5 years -- Borno State, Nigeria, August 2016 - May 2019; available at source URL]).

Routine Childhood Immunization
National coverage levels for the 3rd dose of poliovirus vaccine (Pol3) delivered through routine immunization services by age 12 months have been less than 60% since 2002, with lower rates in northern states. A 2016 survey indicated that Pol3 coverage nationally was 33% and less than 25% in 7 of 13 northern states (4).

Poliovirus Surveillance
Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance. The quality of polio surveillance is assessed by nonpolio AFP (NPAFP) rates and stool collection adequacy. Targets for Nigeria are an NPAFP rate of 3 or more cases per 100 000 population aged less than 15 years per year and stool collection adequacy greater than or equal to 80% of AFP cases. In 2018, the national NPAFP rate was 9.6, and stool adequacy was 95%. As of [31 May 2019], the annualized national 2019 NPAFP rate was 8.0, and stool adequacy was 95%. In Borno, in 2018, the NPAFP rate was 24.5 with 85% stool adequacy; the annualized 2019 NPAFP rate is 19.6 and stool adequacy is 87%.

The destruction of health facilities after the insurgency disrupted health facility-based surveillance in Borno. Community informants help identify AFP cases in insurgent-held areas in Borno, particularly since February 2018. As of [31 May 2019], a total of 1018 community informants in Borno reported 220 verified AFP cases during 2018 - 2019. Stool specimens are obtained when patients with AFP and their families temporarily leave insurgent-held areas for evaluation in safe areas; in 2018, stool adequacy for these AFP cases was 61% and in 2019, 79% to date.

Environmental surveillance. To supplement AFP surveillance, sewage samples are tested for polioviruses (5). During January 2018 - May 2019, 25 (68%) of Nigeria's 37 states had at least 1 environmental surveillance site for a total of 113 functional sites; no WPV and 85 cVDPV2 isolates were detected through environmental surveillance.

cVDPV2 Outbreaks
Since 1988, widespread use of trivalent OPV (tOPV, containing Sabin serotypes 1, 2, and 3) reduced the number of polio cases greater than 99% globally. WPV type 2 was declared globally eradicated in 2015 (6,7). In low-immunization settings, transmission of attenuated Sabin poliovirus contained in OPV can result in genetic reversion to VDPVs that can cause paralysis. When community transmission occurs, VDPVs are categorized as circulating (cVDPVs) (8). During 2006 - 2015, greater than 94% of confirmed cVDPVs worldwide were cVDPV2 (8). To decrease the risk for cVDPV2, a globally synchronized switch from tOPV to bivalent OPV (bOPV, containing serotypes 1 and 3) occurred in April 2016 (8). Injectable inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV, containing serotypes 1, 2, and 3) was introduced into all OPV-using countries to provide individual protection from type 2 poliovirus paralysis (9). Both vaccines confer individual protection; however, IPV does not decrease fecal poliovirus shedding among children with infection, whereas OPV induces intestinal immunity and prevents shedding. Monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) vaccine is available for cVDPV2 outbreak response (10). Since January 2018 (as of [25 Jun 2019]), 2 independent cVDPV2 outbreaks have occurred ([Table 1 Number of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases, by acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases and environmental surveillance (ES) isolates in affected states -- Nigeria, January 2018 - May 2019, available at source URL] ).

Emergence in Jigawa State. 8 cVDPV2-positive sewage samples collected during [10 Jan 2018 - 17 Oct 2018], in Jigawa were genetically linked to 4 cVDPV2 cases with paralysis onset during [15 Apr 2018 - 13 Oct 2018]. This outbreak has spread to 11 other states, totaling 41 cVDPV2 cases and 71 sewage isolates. Genetically related poliovirus was also isolated from 11 AFP patients in Niger Republic, with onset [18 Jul 2018 - 3 Apr 2109], and from one sewage sample collected [4 Apr 2019], in Cameroon.

Emergence in Sokoto State. A VDPV2 isolate was identified in a sewage sample collected [30 Jan 2018], in Sokoto; subsequent samples from 3 sites in 2018 yielded genetically related cVDPV2s. Genetically related cVDPV2 was isolated from an AFP patient in Niger State, with onset [18 Mar 2019].

Vaccination Activities
In 2018, 2 national supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with bOPV, one subnational SIA with bOPV in 5 states, 2 subnational SIAs in 7 states using bOPV and fractional IPV, and 3 subnational SIAs in 2 states using bOPV and fractional IPV were conducted. One subnational SIA using bOPV has been conducted in 7 states to date in 2019. Two subnational SIAs were conducted in 2 states using bOPV and fractional IPV. Gombe was the only state with 3 subnational SIAs to date in 2019 ([Table 2 Number of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) by state, vaccine formulation, and quality assessment of response SIAs -- Nigeria, January 2018 - May 2019 available at source URL]).

Since December 2016, little change has occurred in the areas not accessible by standard house-to-house SIA teams in Borno. Two novel approaches for immunizing children in insurgent-held areas in Borno were implemented (2). Reaching Every Settlement utilizes security escorts to enable vaccinators to reach children in some settlements in insurgent-held areas, and Reaching Inaccessible Children enables vaccination of children by trained military personnel in settlements only accessible by these personnel (2). Satellite imagery is used to estimate population sizes in settlements and vaccination team movements are tracked using geographic information systems, providing data on geographic reach by these immunization approaches ([Figure]). Since January 2018, approximately 140 000 children in insurgent-held settlements were vaccinated during 13 Reaching Every Settlement rounds with bOPV, and approximately 85 000 children aged less than 5 years were vaccinated with mOPV2 in response to cVDPV2 outbreaks. During 5 Reaching Inaccessible Children rounds, 71 370 children were vaccinated with bOPV. As of May 2018, among approximately 104 330 children aged less than 5 years remaining in insurgent-held areas, 43 840 (42.0%) have received at least 1 bOPV dose. Most unreached children reside in settlements scattered over a wide geographic area. Overall, among children aged less than 5 years in insurgent-held settlements that have been reached, 79.8% and 26.2% have been offered greater than or equal to 3 doses of bOPV by Reaching Every Settlement or Reaching Inaccessible Children rounds, respectively.

During January 2018 - May 2019, Nigeria conducted multiple mOPV2 outbreak response SIAs in states affected by cVDPV2 and neighboring states (Table 2). The quality of outbreak response SIAs as assessed by post-campaign lot quality assurance sampling surveys has been variable; the national average for mOPV2 SIAs ranged from 64% to 90% of sampled local government areas reaching the target 90% threshold of estimated proportion of children vaccinated. A limited number of mOPV2 doses have been given in insurgent-held areas by Reaching Every Settlement during mid-2016 - mid-2019; therefore, approximately 104 330 children aged less than 5 years have had no exposure to type 2 OPV.

Discussion
During 2003-2014, Nigeria reported the majority of WPV cases in Africa and was the origin of most WPV importation outbreaks (1,6). Polio eradication activities were aggressively enhanced in 2012-2014. The last WPV type 3 isolated worldwide was in Nigeria in November 2012. The patient with the most recent WPV1 case in Nigeria had paralysis onset in August 2016 (2), even as previously silent areas in Borno have incrementally increased surveillance with community informants. Progress in decreasing the number of unvaccinated children in insurgent-held areas resulted from improved vaccination reach by novel approaches and net population migration from insurgent-held areas to accessible areas. Additional surveillance sensitivity assessments in Nigeria and other African countries are underway, potentially to allow certification of interruption of WPV transmission by the African Regional Certification Commission in 2020. However, active cVDPV2 transmission continuing into 2020 in Nigeria or 8 other countries on the continent with active cVDPV2 outbreaks might complicate the certification process.

Nigeria experienced multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks during 2005 - 2015 as well as ongoing transmission after cVDPV2 importation in 2013 because of vulnerability to emergence and spread of cVDPV2 from the predominant use of mOPV1, mOPV3 and bOPV during 2005 - 2014 SIAs, coupled with chronically low routine tOPV coverage (6). In addition, tOPV SIAs before the tOPV-to-bOPV switch were not sufficiently effective in all areas.

Children remaining in insurgent-held areas of Borno have remained inaccessible to mOPV2 administration by standard house-to-house SIAs for the cVDPV2 outbreak response; administration of mOPV2 in those areas will require Reaching Every Settlement and Reaching Inaccessible Children. Although mOPV2 is the tool to stop cVDPV2 outbreaks, it also carries the risk of seeding new emergences of cVDPV2 in areas with low-quality SIAs. Increased efforts for appropriate planning and supervision of subsequent SIAs will be important in ensuring optimal response quality necessary to interrupt cVDPV2 transmission and emergence.

An annual non-polio AFP detection rate of one case or more per 100 000 population aged under 15 years in countries in WHO regions certified as polio-free, or 2 or more in all other countries, reflects the sensitivity of AFP surveillance. Stool adequacy refers to the collection of adequate stool specimens (i.e., 2 stool specimens collected over 24 hours apart, within 14 days of paralysis onset, with arrival at the laboratory in good condition [cool and without leakage or desiccation]) from 80% or more of reported AFP patients and reflects the quality of case investigation. http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/surveillance-indicators/external icon.

SIAs are mass immunization campaigns conducted over several days to boost population immunity in areas with weak routine childhood immunization services and suboptimal coverage. The goal of SIAs is to reach every child aged under 5 years with OPV, regardless of their vaccination status. http://polioeradication.org/who-we-are/strategic-plan-2013-2018/supplementary-immunization/external icon.

[Reading between the lines, vaccination coverages are suboptimal in more than just the insurgency areas, not only from estimates but also as evidenced by the outbreaks of cVDPV2 outside of the insurgency areas.

In the past week or so, the media has been filled with reports that Nigeria is soon to be declared polio free, with the last confirmed case of WPV1 associated AFP having been reported in August 2016. But, and there is a BUT, the 4 cases of WPV1 confirmed in 2016 had a virus that was genetically related to a virus that was last confirmed in Borno in 2011, 5 years earlier. So given the continued existence of significant numbers of children living in the civil unrest zone that are not reached by routine vaccinations, how sure can one be that the WPV1 isn't still circulating in the zone? And will we go through a repeat performance of declaring WPV1 interruption of transmission only to learn 1-2 years later that the virus was circulating the entire time under the radarscope?

In 2004-2006, Nigeria was a major exporter of WPV to other countries in Africa. Now, it seems to be a significant exporter of cVDPV to Cameroon, to Ghana and to Niger, in addition to spreading to other states internally within Nigeria.
