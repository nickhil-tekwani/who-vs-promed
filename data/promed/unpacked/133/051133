Health officials are investigating an increase in reported cases of the liver disease hepatitis C among young people in Park County, with evidence suggesting that needle sharing among intravenous drug users might be to blame.

The probe came after 56 new reports of hepatitis C [virus] infections were logged in the county in 2012, a figure that exceeds the state average and is about double the number of the year before, The Powell Tribune reported last week.

Nearly 40 percent of the 2012 reports came from the Powell area and the remaining number from around Cody, said Ashley Grajczyk, viral hepatitis prevention coordinator for the Wyoming Department of Health. The spike in the disease, which is transmitted by blood, involved people [aged] from 20 to 34. It's possible some of the new reports involved people who have moved into Park County for substance-abuse treatment, but officials say they don't know how much that has contributed.

Grajczyk said the county's rate has been rising since 2008. Park County Public Health Nurse Manager Bill Crampton and Grajczyk spoke at a recent meeting of the Park County Health Coalition in Powell. They were looking for ideas on how to stop the spread of the disease and how to help those already infected. "We're talking about hepatitis C here, but in reality, it is at-risk kids, 15 to 30, who are doing all kinds of things that maybe we don't want to acknowledge or that we know about but don't know what to do about," Crampton said.

The Department of Health and Public Health spearheaded a campaign in May 2013 to raise awareness of the problem. It hung posters around the county warning people that if they're injecting drugs, they may be at risk for communicable diseases and hepatitis.

"Hepatitis C is for life. You can put it into remission. You can live with it. You can live a full and healthy life," Crampton said at the meeting. "But you may need treatment for some of these folks that will bear hepatitis C badly, and how do we assist them?"

In the initial stages, infected people are unlikely to display symptoms. But once the infection progresses over several years, a person may have elevated liver enzymes and feel joint pain, fatigue, and chronic abdominal pain. Liver damage or cancer can result from the disease. Some people can die from an infection, Grajczyk said.

Treatment of hepatitis C is expensive, and Grajczyk said many of the people infected lack adequate insurance.

[Park County is located in the state of Wyoming. The population was 28 205 at the 2010 census. The county contains the majority (more than 53 percent) of Yellowstone National Park's total land area. A map of the counties of Wyoming showing the location of Park county can be accessed at: http://www.ezilon.com/maps/united-states/wyoming-counties-and-road-maps.html.

No doubt, the location of Park County attracts foot-loose young people, including a higher proportion of intravenous drug-abusers than in the general population. There is no protective vaccine, but effective treatments are becoming available. The Park authorities are to be commended in trying to raise awareness of the situation among young people attracted to this part of Wyoming. The treatments are expensive and are virus genotype dependent.

Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. The delayed onset of the disease masks the seriousness of the potential outcome of hepatitis C virus infection.

The incubation period for hepatitis C is 2 weeks to 6 months. Following initial infection, approximately 80 percent of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes).

About 75-85 percent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection, and 60-70 percent of chronically infected people eventually develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 percent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C virus infection.

Diagnosis of chronic infection is made when hepatitis C virus RNA is identified by nucleic acid testing in a person with antibodies against hepatitis C virus. Specialized tests are often needed subsequently to evaluate patients for liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not always well tolerated, and some virus genotypes respond better to interferon than others. Treatment with newer, specific antivirals can be successful but are currently very expensive. - Mod.CP
