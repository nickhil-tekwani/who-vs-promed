In the 1980s I worked as a vet in the food hygiene and controls agency (at that time municipal) and one of the problems we had to help solve was contamination with spore-forming bacteria in cheese spread. What we found was that the automated cleaning process used in the tubing that transported the melted cheese at 85-90 deg C [185-195 deg F] did not clean out the joints properly (case of round gasket in square hole!), which left food for the clostridiae and others in a lower temperature part of the system, and spore spreading to the heated cheese and eventually to the final product.

Cheese spread is a very sturdy product, but sales plummeted when tubes of cheese in shops vented at the end in a slow explosion with the odors one associates with these bacteria. Routines were changed, manual cleaning of the joints on a regular basis, problem solved.
