Incessant rains have destroyed 60-70 percent of the tomato crop in
Himachal Pradesh pushing up prices in north Indian cities. Himachal
Pradesh is a major tomato-producing state of the region.

"The crop in Solan, Shimla, Mandi, Sirmaur, Bilaspur, and Kullu
[districts] was damaged due to excess rainfall," Agriculture Joint
Director RK Saroya said. "There is hardly any healthy crop to reach
the market."

A tomato farmer near Solan town said, "In August [2010] the crop
damage percentage was 30-40 percent. In September it rose up to 70
percent. The excessive rains also took a toll on other vegetable crops
including cabbage, capsicum, and beans."

The vegetable production this 2010 season is likely to be 550 000
tonnes against the expected target of 650 000 tonnes. An official of
the agriculture department said most of the remaining crop in the
state was hit by the fungus disease buckeye rot and bacteria-caused
leaf spot.

[Buckeye rot
------------
Phytophthora blight of tomato is also referred to as buckeye rot
because of the characteristic lesions on the fruit. It is mainly
caused by the fungus-like pathogen _Phytophthora nicotianae_
(previously _P. parasitica_), but other _Phytophthora_ species such as
_P. capsici_ may also be involved. The pathogens can affect a range of
other crops as well, including solanaceous and cucurbit vegetables.

Symptoms on tomato include brown spots on green and ripe fruit, often
at the blossom end and often appearing as concentric rings
('buckeyes'). Lesions may appear where the fruit has contact with wet
soil. Internal fruit tissue rots and young fruits may become
mummified. In high humidity, white fungal growth may appear and fruit
are likely to rot quickly from secondary organisms. Disease
development is favoured by warm temperatures and wet conditions.

The pathogens are soil borne and are also spread by water (rain,
irrigation) and with infected plant material. Disease management may
include phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, cultural measures
to reduce soil moisture and prevent tomato fruits from contact with
the soil, crop rotation, and fungicides. No tomato cultivars with
resistance to buckeye rot are available.

Bacterial blight
----------------
Bacterial (leaf) blight (also called leaf spot) of tomato is caused by
_Xanthomonas vesicatoria_ (previously _X. campestris_ pv.
_vesicatoria_). There are a number of strains in the species and some
can also affect capsicum. Solanaceous weeds may act as pathogen
reservoirs. The disease is considered the most destructive leaf
disease of tomato and capsicum. Symptoms include necrotic leaf spots,
premature leaf drop, and spots on fruit which make it unmarketable.
Disease progress and pathogen spread to neighbouring crops can be very
rapid in warm, humid weather.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including non-specific
insect activity), splashing rain, and infected plant and other
materials. They survive between crops mainly on seed, but also in
infected plant debris (such as stalks) and may be able to survive in
the soil to some extent, possibly in the rhizosphere of non-host
plants. Under favourable conditions, one infected seed in 10 000 may
lead to 100 percent infection of a field. Disease management is
difficult and includes use of clean planting material, crop rotation,
and preventative bactericidal sprays. Resistant tomato and capsicum
cultivars are available.

Some related _Xanthomonas_ species can infect other vegetable hosts
and may be responsible for the damage to cabbage and beans reported
above.
