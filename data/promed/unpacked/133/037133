As an allied health worker who deals with various diseases weekly, and
observes the impact of such on individuals, children, families, contacts,
medical personnel, etc., I suggest we poll the patients and ask them if
they believe the spread of disease which has cost them the lives and health
of people they know and love is a "good" thing. This may be a good abstract
thesis, but I'm trying to save or heal my patients, in accordance with my
oath, and I cannot subscribe to it from my point of view.

[I think David -- & some other readers who wrote in similar vein -- have
missed the point. The original post asked whether "spread ... might be a
"good thing" ... *if* it means that the countries who can afford to look
(for), identify and implement cost-effective solutions are given an
incentive to do so?" Meaning that developed countries are not going to
research exotic diseases unless & until they are infected by them - Mod.JW]

Should Ebola rear her ugly head along say, the Mississippi River here in the
USA, what are the odds that the drug manufacturers would come up with an
effective treatment or a vaccine?
Frankly, though, don't you believe that all treatment of disease goes
against nature and that survival of the fittest no longer applies? This may
be the real reason for the rampant transmission of deadly disease. The
"strong" are no longer the only survivors -- antibiotics and surgery make it
possible for those who would have died to live and reproduce more of their
kind with defective genes. The bacteria are fighting back though and
finding ways to resist the antibiotics that science has provided.
So with these perspectives, does science "owe" it to us to find new cures or
[are] some of the "cures" actually killing us? If science can find new
cures, we should be appreciative of the efforts made by the tireless
individuals trying to do so. They don't "owe" us anything. Appreciate what
there is and take it with a grain of salt.

Malaria doesn't seem to have followed that pattern so far. It's been
essentially eliminated from parts of the USA and Europe (and Northern parts
of Australia) where it was once endemic, but much of the developing world
still suffers and dies.
More to the point, even bednets seem to be less utilised in some malarious
areas than they once were, possibly because they are becoming even less
affordable there!

[I think that proves the rule -- no malaria in the North, therefore no
incentive to look for cures for the South. Of course, WHO has launched
'Roll Back Malaria', but financing that remains a problem - Mod.JW]

In the interest of folks in the 'developed world', we (governments, public,
pharmaceutical companies etc) should put in money/resources for research,
diagnosis and therapy into the "less developed world" where most of the
problem is -- before it blows out of proportions and comes back to "bite"
us! After all, isn't this precisely the
principle of Public Health that we teach (and ?practice in the developed
world) -- identify a problem, go to the root of the problem and stop it in
it's path before it spreads?
Hence, I would propose, instead of bringing these diseases back to us, we go
out and tackle them!

[Re: spread of disease to developed countries]
The intentional introduction (regardless of motive) would constitute nothing
less than bioterrorism.
There must be better ways to raise the consciousness of the developed world
to these problem. One way is to speak to non-heath people and explain the
depth of the issues in non clinical terms. Another is to publish non-jargon
articles in the popular (credible) press explaining the various problems
clearly.

From: "Bowers, Mark H. (SFMH)" <MBowers@chw.edu>

Recent data that show substantial reductions in the perinatal transmission
of HIV following 2 doses of nevirapine has provided even greater hope for
people in "third
world countries" than current testing of HIV vaccine candidates.
Both nevirapine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and the
current subunit HIV vaccine candidates were researched and developed in
Western Europe and the United States. Both are being tested (and apparently
discounted) in third world nations. The vast majority of currently approved
therapies for HIV disease remain well beyond the means of the southeast
Asian and African nations that are hardest hit by the epidemic, and beyond
the means of poor people in the first world. However, the case could still
be made that these 2 relatively inexpensive medications will save lives and
ease misery in the third world as well as in the first.

The real question is how do we free up the markets for capital and labor in
the third world so that these folks can protect themselves from illness and
philosophy.

Well, that certainly opens a can of worms!
To add to Mr. English's speculation: one has to wonder, as we approach 6
billion people worldwide, if this spread of disease is a "good thing" in
terms of population control. An unstoppable epidemic hasn't happened yet,
but isn't the emphasis on yet?

[Years ago, the noted tropical pediatrician Maurice King dared to publish an
article called, I think, "Let the children die." His thesis was that
childhood immunization was merely keeping children alive so that they could
die later of starvation because the land couldn´t feed them, plus their
countries didn´t have the money to educate them, so they´d be condemned to a
life of poverty, and their countries would just get poorer & poorer -
