[Since the beginning of October 2018, there have been 3 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH). Of the 3 cases, 2 were hospitalized and one was managed on home isolation. One case was a secondary household contact of a previously confirmed case, whereas the other 2 cases had a history of contact with camels. The cases came from 3 different regions: Riyadh, Najran, and Makkah (referred to as Taif region in the MoH report). It is hoped that October [2018] will continue to be a "quiet" month for MERS-CoV transmission. - Mod.MPP

Abstract
----------
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic pathogen capable of causing severe respiratory disease in humans. Although dromedary camels are considered a major reservoir host, the MERS-CoV infection dynamics in camels are not fully understood. Through surveillance in Pakistan, nasal (n  =  776) and serum (n  =  1050) samples were collected from camels between November 2015 and February 2018. Samples were collected from animal markets, free-roaming herds, and abattoirs. An in-house ELISA was developed to detect IgG against MERS-CoV. A total of 794 camels were found seropositive for MERS-CoV. Prevalence increased with age, and the highest seroprevalence was recorded in camels older than  10 years (81.37%) followed by those aged 3.1 to 10 years (78.65%) and  3 years or younger (58.19%). Higher prevalence was observed in females (78.13%) compared with males (70.70%). Of the camel nasal swabs, 22 were found to be positive by RT-qPCR, although with high Ct values. Moreover, 2409 human serum samples were also collected from 4 provinces of Pakistan during 2016 to 2017. Among the sampled population, 840 humans were camel herders. Although we found a high rate of MERS-CoV antibody-positive dromedaries (75.62%) in Pakistan, no neutralizing antibodies were detected in humans with and without contact to camels.

[Another foray into trying to unravel the mystery of "why the Middle East," when there are dromedary camels in North Africa and Pakistan. Studies have identified seropositivity in dromedaries in Nigeria, Kenya, and now Pakistan with minimal to no evidence of seropositivity in humans who had frequent contact with these camels. The mystery remains.... - Mod.MPP

Pakistan is one of 8 countries globally, and the only country outside Africa, that has a dromedary population exceeding one million animals. In a previous study, by the same study group, that was limited to Pakistan's Punjab region, up to 39.5% of 565 dromedary sera collected between 2012 and 2015 had neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV (Saqib et al. [4]). Seropositivity increased with age: More than half of animals older than 5 years were seropositive compared with less than one-third of animals under the age of 2 years. Because Punjab shares a border with the state of Rajasthan in India, where India's largest dromedary population is maintained, the authors suggested that a similar risk for human exposure is likely for this part of India. They concluded that the data obtained exclude the scenario of a widely susceptible animal reservoir population in which de novo introduction of MERS-CoV could start an epizootic that could lead to spillover epidemics among humans. The current (2018) paper, covering the entire country, underlines the said conclusion. However, in the current study, a high seroprevalence of MERS-CoV was found among young camels (58.19%), indicative of recent active circulation of MERS-CoV in the dromedary population of Pakistan. The active circulation of the virus is further confirmed by the detection of MERS-CoV in 22 nasal swab samples. Although the continuous circulation of MERS-CoV in the camel population of Pakistan is expected to pose a possible risk of transmission to camel herders and other people who have frequent contact with camels or their products, the revealed absence of such human cases is seen by the authors as posing "a germane question regarding the viral epidemiology in different geographic and ecological zones." Subscribers are referred to an early report on suspected MERS-CoV activity in Pakistani dromedaries, when Iran reported to the OIE in December 2014 about the detection of positive serology in camels illegally imported into Iran from Pakistan's Baluchistan (see 20141219.3039497). - Mod.AS
