[Given that rabies is endemic in many countries, especially in the African continent, this case should come as no surprise. The value of this case is that it is being notified [albeit a month late -- but better late than never. - Mod.JW].

According to the last 6-monthly report (July to December 2012) sent to the OIE from the Republic of the Congo, rabies had never been reported in the country. However, the Republic of the Congo is indicating in this same report that the disease is not notifiable in the country, and furthermore, the country does not indicate whether or not surveillance is being conducted, even though rabies is one of the important OIE notifiable diseases (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation; to see the information from Republic of the Congo, you need to choose the region and scroll to the country name and time period).

According to the WAHID database's list of the countries by sanitary situation section, rabies is present in all countries that border the Republic of the Congo (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist; to see the information, scroll to the name of the disease).

Data found in the OIE's WAHID database's disease incidence section shows that during 2012, Cameroon reported 4 outbreaks, Central African Republic 19, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo 13. The disease is also present in Angola and Gabon, but no quantitative information is available for these.
