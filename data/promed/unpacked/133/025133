[The following is the complete abstract of a recently published paper that
sheds some light on the potential for transmission of prion agents in blood
products - Mod.ES

Prion Protein Expression in Human Leukocyte Differentiation.
Blood 1998 Mar 1;91(5):1556-1561

The cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrPC) is a small glycoprotein
attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. This molecule is involved in the
pathogenesis of prion diseases in both humans and animals. We have
characterized the expression patterns of PrPC during human leukocyte
maturation by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies to PrPC, the glycan
moiety CD15, and the stem cell marker CD34.
We observe that prion protein is present on CD34(+) bone marrow (BM) stem
cells. Although lymphocytes and monocytes maintain PrPC expression
throughout their differentiation, PrPC is down regulated upon differentiation
along the granulocyte lineage. In vitro retinoic acid-induced
differentiation of the pre myeloid line HL-60 into granulocyte-like cells
mimics the suppression of PrPC in granulocyte differentiation, as both PrPC
mRNA and protein are down regulated.
These data suggest that selected BM cells and peripheral mononuclear cells
may support prion agent replication, because this process is dependent on
availability of PrPC. Additionally, retinoic acid-induced extinction of PrPC
expression in HL-60 cells provides a potential model to study PrP gene
regulation and protein function. Finally, these data suggest the existence
of cell-specific glycoforms of PrPC that may determine cellular
susceptibility to infection by the prion agent.
....
On the basis of our current report, BM cells, including CD34+ stem cells,
might be expected to harbor the prion agent, despite current guidelines
which do not recognize BM as high-risk tissue.28,29 In the periphery,
monocytes and lymphocytes, which express PrPC, would be expected to support
prion replication, whereas PrPC negative erythrocytes and granulocytes would
not.
This contention is supported by a limited number of transmission
experiments30,31 and by recent data from Blattler et al,32 who show that
prion agent infectivity detected in spleen by bioassay is dependent on the
expression of PrPC by spleen cells and does not accumulate by nonspecific
"carry-over" from the original inoculum.
An additional implication of our study is that PrPC must be differentially
glycosylated in the nervous system as opposed to the periphery. PrPSc, the
abnormal disease-associated isoform of PrPC, has been found to possess a
high proportion of N-linked glycan chains terminating in the glycosyl moiety
stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1), also known as CD15.33
This carbohydrate moiety has been found to participate in cell-cell adhesion
and tissue differentiation early in development, and probably plays an
important role in immunocyte adhesion in inflammatory processes.34,35
In the peripheral blood, granulocytes, which express no PrPC, display
prominent immunoreactivity for CD15. Lymphocytes, which display no surface
CD15, do express PrPC. Only peripheral monocytes possess surface
immunoreactivity for both PrPC and CD15, allowing the possibility that
monocyte PrPC may be modified with the SSEA-1 moiety.
Because glycosylation may participate in the brain-region-specific
replication of the scrapie agent,36 it is possible that certain PrPC on
different peripheral cells might be more likely to participate in scrapie
infection.
Of interest, some data indicate that the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage is
critical to the propagation of scrapie infectivity in the periphery. Scrapie
infection in severe combined immunodeficient mice is apparently dependent on
dendritic cells,37 which are tissue macrophages specialized for immune
presentation. Moreover, peripheral blood cells containing scrapie
infectivity are relatively radiation insensitive,38 which is consistent with
the end-mitotic nature of peripheral monocytes.
Finally, monocytes may be unique among peripheral blood cells for their
capability of processing PrPC to PrPSc.39 Because other peripheral blood
cells also express PrPC, the capability of monocytoid cells to support
scrapie agent replication may relate to a post translational modification,
such as SSEA-1 modification of the terminal PrPC glycans.
