[The delay in posting is due to trying to get clarification from Cuba,
which we have failed to get. - Mod.JW
[Translation by Mod.JW

The [Cuban Ministry of Health announced last Monday [3 May 1999, in an
information program transmitted to the population by TV, that 10 districts
of the city of Havana are presently under a state of emergency in the face
of the epidemic of dengue
hemorrhagic fever [sic.
According to this report, more than 600 epidemic foci have been detected by
sanitary inspectors, where the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, the transmitter of
the disease, exists. The district most affected is 10 of October, with
almost half the foci detected in the capital, followed by Playa, Central
Havana, Old Havana, Cerra & San Miguel del Padron.

[This appears to be a garbled report of the finding of 600 mosquito
breeding foci, not 600 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, in Havana. We
would be happy to receive further details - Mod.JW
