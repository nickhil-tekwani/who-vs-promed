The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and North American Produce Sales are warning the public not to consume the Daniella brand Mangoes described below because they may be contaminated with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup.

The affected Daniella brand Mangoes, product of Mexico, were sold as individual fruit with a sticker bearing PLU# 4959 and other information. These mangoes were sold at various retail stores between 12 Jul 2012 and 14 Aug 2012. Consumers are advised to contact the retailer to find out if you have the affected mangoes. If you have illness symptoms or any health concerns possibly associated with these mangoes, please contact your family doctor.

These mangoes may have been distributed in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon. There have been several confirmed illnesses associated with the consumption of these mangoes.

The importer, North American Produce Sales, Vancouver, BC is voluntarily recalling the affected mangoes from the marketplace. The CFIA is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.

[Unlike melons such as cantaloupes and watermelon which grow on the ground and can easily become contaminated, the mango grows on a tree so that contamination of the fruit likely occurred after harvesting. - Mod. LL
