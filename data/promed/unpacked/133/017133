The following information and acknowledgements supplement the press
release of our finding West Nile virus (WNV) in Cuba in 2004, which
formed the basis of the ProMED-mail post entitled "West Nile virus,
birds - Cuba: 2004 20050207.0419."
Our research that resulted in finding WNV antibodies in resident
Cuban birds in the spring of 2004 was the result of a joint study
with the Wadsworth Center at the NY State Department of Health, with
collaborators Laura Kramer and Alan Dupuis. Our research was
conducted on the military base located in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Our
findings were immediately reported to military officials, and a paper
is now in review at The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and
Hygiene. The paper reports the 1st evidence for circulating WNV in
Cuba and Puerto Rico.
