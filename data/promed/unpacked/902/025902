[2] CIDRAP Report of 11 Apr 2006

Human Avian Influenza Cases Reported in 3 Countries
-----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 11 Apr 2006, Egypt and Indonesia each reported a new human
case of avian influenza today [12 Apr 2006], while the World Health
Organization (WHO) confirmed a suspected case in Azerbaijan [see
preceding WHO report and ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human -
worldwide (44): Azerbaijan, China, Indonesia 20060412.1084"].
Elsewhere in the world, there was mixed news about the impact of the
virus on people.
In Afghanistan, no evidence of avian flu was found in birds in a
remote village where 3 children recently died, Reuters reported
yesterday [Mon 10 Apr 2006]. However, 20 other samples from 7
provinces have tested positive for an H5 avian flu, although the
neuraminidase has not yet been determined. The deaths of the
children, all from the same family in the central province of Ghor,
prompted fears of avian flu, Reuters said. Samples were not taken
from the children before their burial, the stories noted. The lack of
samples left investigators to rely on bird samples. Officials found
no evidence of disease among about 1000 chickens in the village,
Reuters said.
News from West Africa was more worrisome, if a Reuters report from
Nairobi yesterday [Mon 10 Apr 2006] is any indication. A WHO
official, Honore Meda, told Reuters at an avian flu seminar in
Nairobi that human cases of H5N1 may be occurring undetected in
Africans. "So far, there is no confirmed human case of avian flu
virus infection in West Africa, but this is not a reason to say there
is no human case," Meda said. "There is a risk and probability of
human cases occurring in West Africa, but there's no evidence to say
there is or there is not a human case." WHO in February 2006 tested
samples from 4 Nigerians, including a woman who died. The samples did
not yield a clear result, Reuters reported. Four West African
countries have experienced or are experiencing avian flu outbreaks in
poultry.
In India, 7 poultry farmers committed suicide because the H5N1 virus
destroyed their livelihood, according to an Agence France Presse
(AFP) report that cited information from a farmers' organization. The
H5N1 infections and subsequent culling that have swept India have
cost the industry USD 1.8 billion in 6 weeks, the National Egg
Coordination Committee said today [12 Apr 2006]. The 7 suicides are
not an unheard-of response to the stresses of farming in India. The
AFP story noted that nearly 9000 people in 4 Indian states are
thought to have killed themselves in connection with rising costs,
debt, and repeated crop failures in the past 5 years.
