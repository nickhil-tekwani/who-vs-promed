Guinea worm disease is usually caught by drinking water containing water fleas that carry the parasite larvae.

The worms mate and grow inside the body, and after 10-14 months the one-metre-long adult worm emerges, usually from the arms or legs, to shed its larvae back into water.

The parasite causes disability and trauma in some of the world's poorest communities in Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan.

Eradication programmes have cut human cases of Guinea worm from millions a year in the 1980s to just 27 in 2020.

Guinea worm would be only the 2nd human disease to be eradicated, after smallpox.

Just as eradication looked imminent, it has emerged that domestic dogs are also harbouring the parasite.

Targeted surveillance showed that in 2020, 93% of Guinea worms detected worldwide were in dogs in Chad, in central Africa.

Research by the University of Exeter, published today in Current Biology, has revealed a new pathway for transmission -- by dogs eating fish that carry the parasite larvae. This means dogs maintain the parasite's life-cycle and humans can still catch the disease.

[Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) is caused by the nematode (roundworm) _Dracunculus medinensis_. Its lifecycle is presented at https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/guineaworm/biology.html.

The citation for the 'article in press' addressed in the above media report is: Goodwin et al., Seasonal fishery facilitates a novel transmission pathway in an emerging animal reservoir of Guinea worm, Current Biology (2021), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.11.050 (subscription required).

Excerpts from its summary follow:

"We quantified and analyzed variation in Guinea worm emergence in dogs in Chad, across 3 climatic seasons, in multiple villages and districts. At the end of the hot-dry season and beginning of the wet season, when fishing by people is most intensive, Guinea worm emergence rates in dogs were highest, dogs ate most fish, and fish consumption was most closely associated with disease. Consumption of fish by dogs enables a non-classical transmission pathway for Guinea worm in Chad. Seasonal fisheries and the facilitation of dogs eating fish are likely contributing to disease persistence and to this key impediment to human disease eradication".

The zoonotic aspects of dranculiasis, involving mammals and fish, have been subject to several studies since 2012, when the emergence of infections in dogs was recorded, particularly in Chad, combined with an increased number of human cases.

A recent study, by a research team in the University of Georgia, presented the following results: "_D. medinensis_ infective larvae (L3) were recovered, under experimental conditions, from the muscle of 3 of 4 (75%) featherfin catfish (_Synodontis eupterus_), a species common in the Chari River Basin area in Chad, where high numbers of _D. medinensis_ infections are reported in domestic dogs living in fishing villages and is consumed by both people and dogs. Dogs in these villages often eat discarded small fish or fish viscera. This finding further supports the continuation of the screening of wild fish muscle tissues for Dracunculus larvae." (Box EK, Yabsley MJ, Garrett KB et al. (2021). Susceptibility of anurans, lizards, and fish to infection with Dracunculus species larvae and implications for their roles as paratenic hosts. Scientifc Reports (2021) 11:11802. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91122-5.)

According to the most recent "Guinea worm wrap-up (#283)" dated 3 Dec 2021, published by WHO Collaborating Center for Dracunculiasis Eradication, CDC, the following provisional data, covering the 10 first months of 2021, have been reported from Chad: a total of 769 dogs (81% contained), 61 cats (80% contained), and 7 humans (71% contained) with Guinea worm infections have been recorded between January and October 2021. This is a 48% decrease in infected animals and a 50% decrease in human cases compared to the same period of 2020. The report includes also updates from Mali and other countries (https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/guinea_worm/wrap-up/283.pdf).

A pandemic-delayed research study has just begun in Chad to evaluate the possible effect of the anthelmintic Flubendazole administered in a single higher dose to dogs, to prevent their infection with Guinea worm and becoming a source of water recontamination and continued cycle (copepods, fish). - Mod.AS]

[It is uncertain if consumption of raw fish could be a route of transmission as well to humans.- Mods.EP/MPP]
