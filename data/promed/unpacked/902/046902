[There have now been 8 consecutive days without reports of newly confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia, and only 1 newly confirmed case reported thus far in the month of October 2015. While it is too early to declare that transmission has been interrupted, this lull in newly confirmed case reports is a welcome respite from the active transmission that began in August 2015 and continued through the end of September 2015 when there were nosocomial outbreaks reported from Riyadh and Madinah.

Jordan reports additional MERS case, count now at 16
----------------------------------------------------
Jordanian health officials are reporting an additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in a 53-year-old individual, according to a Petra report (computer translated).

This is the 16th MERS case in the country since the virus appeared in the Middle East in 2012.

The patient reportedly had contact with a previously MERS-identified patient.

Jordanian health officials say that no returning Hajj pilgrims have tested positive for MERS to date.

Globally as of [1 Oct 2015] WHO has been notified of 1593 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 568 related deaths.

[As mentioned above, this is now the 16th case of MERS-CoV reported by Jordan in 2015. According to the media report, this individual had a history of contact with another case in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, suggesting that that the previously reported nosocomial outbreak in Amman is still ongoing with the tally now at 16 confirmed cases including 5 deaths.

[We are now in the post Hajj period when severe respiratory illnesses in returning hajjis are being tested to rule out MERS-CoV infections. ProMED has received several reports of influenza viruses being isolated in returning hajjis from Canada and Germany that are being posted in the influenza thread (see Influenza (49): Canada ex Saudi Arabia, Hajj returnees, susp., RFI, Alert 20151005.3693052. Two other reports are pending publication at this time).

In prior years, there were no cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in returning hajjis, while influenza virus was isolated. We await further information on the above listed suspected cases as well as more information on other respiratory viruses identified in returning hajjis. - Mod.MPP
