Eleven Ellenville area residents have [been] diagnosed with Legionnaires'
disease. Three of the five people who died in the recent pneumonia outbreak
had the disease, health officials confirmed yesterday. Although officials
would not release the names or condition of the other eight people with
Legionnaires', they said none are hospitalized. All are among more than 30
cases of pneumonia to hit the Ellenville area since mid-September. In
addition, 30 to 40 Ellenville Community Hospital workers were diagnosed
with flu-like symptoms that health investigators said was Pontiac Fever, a
weaker form of Legionnaires' disease, but caused by the same bacteria.
At a packed press conference in Kingston, officials zeroed in on Ellenville
Community Hospital as the probable source. Water samples from the
hospital's cooling tower tested positive for Legionella, the bacterium that
causes Legionnaire's disease. "This is likely to be the exposure," said Dr.
Joel Acklesberg, a doctor with the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention based in Albany. The hospital's hot water system, which
delivers water used for patients, tested negative. That has led
investigators to speculate exposure could have occurred as people were
coming in and out of the hospital, for anything from lab tests to visiting
hours.
The connection to the hospital was strengthened by interviews of
individuals with the illness. Seven of the eight people investigators were
able to interview visited Ellenville Hospital the week prior to their
exposure. Symptoms of Legionnaires' - high fever, headache, chills, [and]
sometimes diarrhea - show up two to 10 days after exposure. Legionnaires'
disease is rarely fatal for healthy people. In fact, many people can be
exposed and never show a single symptom. By the numbers, between 0.1 to 5
percent of those exposed will develop symptoms. But for people who have
medical problems or weakened immune systems, Legionnaires' can be fatal. Of
those who were sick, 90 percent had some underlying illness, officials
said, either diabetes or lung disease.
Officials refused to speculate whether there would be more deaths. Stan
Kondracki, an epidemiologist with the state Department of Health, explained
the link to the hospital's cooling tower. "Legionnaires' is a water
organism. It requires an aerosol - a spray or mist, [so] to speak - to
infect," Kondracki said. The disease is not passed person to person, and
cannot be transmitted through drinking contaminated water.
