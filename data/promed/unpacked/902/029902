'Ratti', India's Ricin-like seed, poisons 2 kids, 1 dead
--------------------------------------------------------
A child poisoned by a toxin called Abrin which is released by the seeds of a plant called _Abrus precatorius_, also known as Ratti or Gunchi in India, has been saved by the doctors at a hospital here.

The toxin Abrin is a poison which is like viper snake venom, causing illness by getting inside the cells of a person`s body and preventing the cells from making the protein they need. Without the protein, the cells die and eventually it affects the whole body and the person dies.

A 7-year-old boy, RK from Bhind in Madhya Pradesh was admitted in a critical condition in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on 31 Oct 2022. At the time of his admission, the child was showing symptoms of poisoning including bloody diarrhoea, swelling in the brain and shock, the hospital said in a statement.

A child poisoned by a toxin called Abrin which is released by the seeds of a plant called _Abrus _precatorius, also known as Ratti or Gunchi in India, has been saved by the doctors at a hospital in New Delhi. The toxin Abrin is a poison which is like viper snake venom causing illness by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the protein they need. Without the protein, the cells die and eventually, it affects the whole body and the person dies.

What Happens to You When You Come in Contact With A Ratti Plant?
----------------------------------------------------------------
A 7-year-old boy, RK from Bhind in Madhya Pradesh was admitted in critical condition to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on 31 Oct 2022. At the time of his admission, the child was showing symptoms of poisoning including bloody diarrhea, swelling in the brain, and shock, the hospital said in a statement.

Dr Dhiren Gupta, Senior Consultant, Department of Paediatric Emergency and Critical Care, said, "When we received the child, I was surprised to find the child was poisoned by a poison called Abrin which is released by the seeds of a plant called _Abrus precatorius_, also known as Ratti or Gunchi in India. This particular toxin or poison is as dangerous and fatal as snake venom and carries a high fatality rate if not treated on time."

Dangers of Coming in Contact With A Ratti Plant
-----------------------------------------------
"The child was unconscious, delirious (irritable), suffering from encephalopathy (swelling in the brain) and unstable vitals (high pulse rate with shock). The challenge before us was the child was brought to us 24 hours after ingestion and lost the golden hour with the unavailability of a definitive antidote," he said.

"In this kind of poisoning, the ideal treatment is a complete cleaning of the stomach within 2 hours of ingestion and charcoal therapy", Dr Gupta said. He added as there is no antidote for Abrin, the most important factor is avoiding Abrin exposure. If exposure cannot be avoided, then immediately Abrin should be taken out of the body as quickly as possible.

No Antidote for 'Abrin', Say Doctors
--------------------------------
"In the hospital, Abrin poisoning is treated by giving the victim supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poison. The type of supportive medical care depends on several factors such as the route by which the victim was poisoned (that is, whether the poisoning was by breathing in, swallowing, skin, or eye exposure). We did the same and the child was saved and discharged in stable condition 4 days after admission", added Dr Gupta.

[Please note, _Abrin_ and _Ricin_ are very close in their mode of action.

"Abrus precatorius (AP), the "rosary pea" or "jequirity pea', is commonly found in tropical countries. All parts of the plant are poisonous. The seeds are the most poisonous when crushed. Although this is commonly ingested as suicidal poison, its use as an herbal remedy is also well known.[1] AP is commonly known as "kunch" or "roti' in this part of the country [Bengal, India. "Kunch" is a Bengali word, but the plant has many names depending on the region and local language. See https://ntfp.org/2016/02/crabs-eye-rosary-pea/ -Mod.LXL]. The seeds vary in color, from red, black, orange, or white. The colorful and attractive appearance of the seeds poses greater risk of accidental ingestion and fatal outcome.

"The toxic principle present in the seeds is a toxalbumin known as Abrin. It consists of A and B chains and has structural and functional similarities with ricin, botulinum, cholera, and diphtheria toxin.[2] The A chain acts on the 60s ribosome to inhibit elongation factor (EF)-1 and EF-2, preventing protein synthesis and leading to cell death.[2] The fatal dose of abrin in human beings is 0.1-1 Î¼g/kg.[3] There is no specific antidote and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic.

"Local gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common form of toxicity. Some patients might develop renal failure. Neurological complications are extremely rare and mostly seen in adults. Reported in the literatures are headache, hallucinations, dilated pupils, tetany, seizures, coma, encephalitis, and dural venous sinus thrombosis.[4,5,6] Two cases had raised ICT and papilledema on presentation.[1]

"Abrin induces endothelial cell damage resulting in increased capillary permeability and consequent fluid leakage, the so-called vascular leak syndrome.[3,5]" (Extracted in part from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5890557/)
