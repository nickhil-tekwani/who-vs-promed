Over the past several days, 2 bighorn lambs, each about 3 months old, have died at PGA West [La Quinta, Riverside, California]. The 1st died Friday [6 May 2016] and the other Tuesday [10 May 2016] afternoon, according to the Bighorn Institute in Palm Desert.

A necropsy is being performed on each of the lambs to determine the cause of death, but preliminary results on the 1st lamb showed lots of mucus and congestion in the lungs, nasal cavity and ears, indicating upper respiratory problems, said Kevin Brennan, a wildlife biologist with Fish & Wildlife who recovered the remains of both lambs. "But until they come back with test results, we don't know for sure," he said. Results can take a few days, he said.

There have been signs of upper respiratory disease among the sheep, said Aimee Byard, a biologist and associate director with the Bighorn Institute. "Droopy ears, nasal discharge and nothing but skin and bones are all symptoms of respiratory disease," Byard said.

She and Brennan said the animals' access to the golf courses increases the chance for spreading infection. In the wild, the sheep are more spread out and less likely to infect each other with any disease. When they come down to the golf courses, they graze "nose-to-nose," making them more prone to disease. "So there are probably more (deaths) coming this month," Brennan said.

The Peninsular bighorn -- listed by the state as a "threatened" -- are commonly seen grazing on some of the golf courses in La Quinta, including SilverRock and PGA West.

In February 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife sent the city of La Quinta and Coachella Valley Conservation Commission a letter mandating a barrier to run along PGA West, Lake Cahuilla, The Quarry and Tradition Golf Club and the city-owned SilverRock Resort Golf Club. The Coachella Valley Conservation Commission -- comprised of representatives from the valley's 9 city councils and county supervisors and formed by the Coachella Valley Association of Governments -- was designated as the lead agency in finding a solution to the problem in La Quinta. The group has been conducting an environmental analysis of alternatives for keeping the sheep away from the golf courses and populated areas.

A draft environmental report should be completed this summer, Katie Barrows, director of Environmental Resources for CVAG, told the conservation board in April [2016]. "The federal agencies mandated fences at Traditions, SilverRock, PGA West and the Quarry. This impacts many residents," City Manager Frank Spevacek told The Desert Sun.

There are no preexisting mandates or agreements to build fences at the privately owned Traditions and PGA West, Spevaceck said. "In order to accommodate fences in these communities, private property must be secured for the fence right-of-way," he said. Doing that is considered a project under the California Environmental Quality Act, which is why the environmental report is being prepared.

Several years ago, the city of Rancho Mirage built a 5-mile-long, 8-foot-high fence bordering Highway 111 that is made of materials that blend in with the environment and officials say has worked well to keep the sheep from traveling to populated areas. Rancho Mirage also ran PVC piping up the hillsides to create an artificial spring as a water source for the bighorn.

Byard said when the SilverRock land was initially purchased by the city of La Quinta, it was one of the mitigating factors that if sheep came onto the golf course, the city would build a fence. "Why has the city not honored its commitment?" she asked.

Fencing SilverRock alone would not solve the problem because the sheep will just go around it to access the adjoining PGA West and Tradition properties, Spevacek said. "The agreement the city reached with the agencies is that other means would be used prior to erecting a fence," Spevacek said.

The 2014 letter from the federal and state agencies put the conservation commission and the city on notice that the other means were not working and a fence, 8 feet high and about 9.5 miles long, was needed. The cost is estimated at $3.5 million, of which $1 million may be paid by CVCC. The rest, the city would likely shoulder.

The 2 recent lamb deaths makes 9 bighorn that have died in La Quinta since August 2012, Byard said. A total of 4 have drowned in the concrete-lined Coachella canal; 1 died from eating oleander; 1 was struck by a car on Jefferson Street; and 1 died from disease, Byard said.

If people see the sheep, Brennan said, "under no circumstances should they attempt to capture or herd them."

[From the text, it could be inferred that pneumonia is not yet a major problem for the bighorn sheep population in La Quinta, but should the diagnosis be confirmed, there is reason for concern. Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena like this, usually require integrated and sustained research efforts. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices (including fencing).

Bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggests that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant. However, recent evidence indicates that in northwestern USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids.
