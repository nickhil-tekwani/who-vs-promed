Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update
------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
Between 18 and 20 Jun 2014, there were no new cases of Ebola virus disease [EVD], but 3 deaths were reported from Gueckedou (0 cases and 2 deaths) and Telimele (0 cases and 1 death). This brings the cumulative number of cases and deaths reported from Guinea to 390 (260 confirmed, 87 probable, and 43 suspected) and 270 deaths.

The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Conakry, 65 cases and 33 deaths; Gueckedou, 226 cases and 177 deaths; Macenta, 41 cases and 28 deaths; Dabola, 4 cases and 4 deaths; Kissidougou, 6 cases and 5 deaths; Dinguiraye, 1 case and 1 death; Telimele, 25 cases and 9 deaths; Boffa, 21 cases and 12 deaths; and Kouroussa, 1 case and 1 death. Currently, 19 patients are in EVD Treatment Centres in Conakry (9), Gueckedou (9), and Telimele (1).

The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 1147 and are distributed as follows: Conakry, 196; Gueckedou, 520; Macenta, 29; Telimele, 70; Dubreka, 118; Kouroussa 16; and Boffa, 198. So far 3098/4245 (73 percent) of contacts registered since the beginning of the outbreak have completed the mandatory 21-day observation period.

Sierra Leone
------------
Between 18 and 20 Jun 2014, there were no new cases in Sierra Leone, but 4 new deaths were reported from Kailahun (0 cases and 3 deaths) and Kenema (0 new cases and 1 death). This brings the cumulative number of cases and deaths reported from Sierra Leone to 158 (147 confirmed, 8 probable, and 3 suspected) and 34 deaths from confirmed cases.

The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Kailahun, 135 cases and 32 deaths; Kambia, 1 case and 0 deaths; Port Loko, 2 cases and 0 deaths; Kenema, 19 cases and 2 deaths; and Western, 1 case and 0 deaths. Currently, 52 patients are in EVD Treatment Centres in Kenema (12) and Kailahun (40).

The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 37 from Kailahun. Community health workers are being trained to do follow-up, and contact listing is continuing in Kenema, Kailahun, Kambia, and Port Loko.

Liberia
-------
Between 19 and 22 Jun 2014, a total of 10 new cases and 8 new deaths were reported from Lofa (8 cases and 6 deaths) and Montserrado (2 cases and 2 deaths). This brings the cumulative number of cases and deaths reported from Liberia to 51 (34 confirmed, 10 probable, and 7 suspected) and 34 deaths.

The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Lofa, 36 cases and 21 deaths; Montserrado, 11 cases and 11 deaths; Margibi, 2 cases and 2 deaths; and Nimba, 2 cases and 0 deaths. Currently, 15 patients are in the EVD Treatment Centre in Lofa.

The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 232 and are distributed as follows: Lofa, 112 and Montserrado, 120. So far, 159/391 (40 percent) of contacts registered since the beginning of the outbreak have completed the mandatory 21-day observation period.

The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance.

WHO response
------------
WHO and partners are providing the necessary technical support to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. This includes a high-level advocacy meeting with the governments of the 3 affected countries to enhance coordination, information management, and communication, among others. The WHO Regional Director, in consultation with the Director General, has established a temporary function of WHO sub-regional EVD outbreak response Coordinator to directly support the affected countries. The Coordinator is based in Conakry, Guinea. In addition, WHO is organizing a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub-region, technical experts and key stakeholders to be held from 2-3 Jul 2014 in Accra, Ghana. The objective is to ensure increased political commitment and enhanced cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region. WHO, GOARN [Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network], and other partners are also closely supporting the Ministries of Health in deploying additional experts in the various specialties (epidemiology, social mobilization, case management, data management, and logistics, among others) to support the EVD outbreak response efforts. The next cross-border technical meeting among the 3 countries was planned for 23 Jun 2014 in Kailahun, Sierra Leone.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

[2] Sierra Leone, revised figures

WHO reduces Ebola death toll in Sierra Leone
--------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization on Wednesday [25 Jun 2014] announced it was changing the way it reports fatalities from the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone at the request of the government. Previously, probable and suspected deaths from Ebola were included in the count, but from now on, only laboratory-confirmed cases will be reported, reducing the death toll in Sierra Leone from 58 to 34 as of Tuesday [24 Jun 2014].

The way the deaths are reported in Guinea and Liberia, the other 2 countries hit by the outbreak, will remain unchanged, said WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib. "They haven't asked to change their methodology; the only country that decided to change their methodology was Sierra Leone for now," said Chaib. Sierra Leone's press had criticized the government for reporting lower death rates than the WHO had initially been reporting.

The change in approach by WHO now brings their figures into line with those of the Sierra Leone government.

On Tuesday [24 Jun 2014], the European Commission announced it was committing an additional EUR 500 000 in funding to combat the outbreak, bringing its total contribution to EUR 1.9 million. Doctors Without Borders has described the outbreak as "out of control," and said with cases in more than 60 sites, its resources are stretched to the limit.

Medical facilities in these countries, some of the poorest in the world, are struggling to deal with the outbreak as well as educate populations unfamiliar with how to prevent the disease from spreading. The current outbreak, which began in Guinea either late last year [2013] or early this year [2014], had appeared to slow before picking up pace again in recent weeks, spreading to the capital of neighboring Liberia [Monrovia] for the 1st time.

[Revised WHO figures for Guinea show no change in the total (2 more confirmed, 1 less suspected) and 3 more deaths; for Sierra Leone, 22 more cases (44 more confirmed, 11 fewer probable and 11 fewer suspected) and 24 fewer deaths; for Liberia, 10 more cases (10 more confirmed, 1 more probable) and 9 fewer deaths.

WHO has to bow to the wishes of its member states, although the new International Health Regulations (IHR) are supposed to oblige countries to report outbreaks of disease that have international implications -- but do not specify the basis on which case numbers should be reported. Applying Sierra Leone's criteria to the other 2 countries, assuming all their deaths were confirmed, Guinea would be reporting more deaths than confirmed cases, and Liberia would have a case fatality rate (CFR) of 100 percent.

Spain's National Microbiology Centre confirms a man from Guinea Conakry isolated in the La Fe hospital in Valencia, eastern Spain, since Monday night (23 Jun 2014) with suspected EVD does not have the ebolavirus (http://www.thespainreport.com/9248/ebola-valencia). - Mod.JW
