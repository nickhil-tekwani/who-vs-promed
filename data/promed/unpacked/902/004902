In a follow-up on the diphtheria situation on the island of Hispaniola, the 2 countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic have now seen 23 total confirmed cases to date. The Dominican Republic with 12 confirmed cases including 9 deaths, and Haiti has seen 11 confirmed cases including 2 deaths.

Vaccination coverage for both countries is below where it needs to be: In Haiti, since 1980, DTP3 [3rd diphtheria- tetanus toxoid-pertussis] coverage has been less than 95%, with an average of 75% between 2010 and 2019 (range: 60%-79%), while DTP4 [4th diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis] coverage reached a maximum coverage of 46% in 2019.

In the Dominican Republic, since 1979, DTP3 coverage has been less than 95%, with an average of 87% between 2010 and 2019 (range: 83%-94%), while DTP4 reached a maximum coverage of 83% in 2019.

[The data in the news report above are for epidemiological weeks (EW) 1-15 (1 Jan-17 Apr 2021), and are from is derived from a PanAmerican Health Organization (PAHO) update, dated 23 Apr 2021 (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53825). The prior PAHO report stated: "In 2021, between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 7 (1 Jan-20 Feb 2021), 2 countries have reported confirmed cases of diphtheria: the Dominican Republic with 5 fatal cases and Haiti with 6 cases, including 1 death (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53380).

Both the Dominican Republic, with a population of about 3.3 million residents, located on the eastern 5/8ths of the island, and Haiti, with a population of about 11 million, share the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispaniola).

In 2020, a total of 5 countries had reported a total of 80 confirmed cases of diphtheria, including 21 deaths in the Region of the Americas: the Dominican Republic (3 cases, including 2 deaths), Haiti (66 cases, including 16 deaths), Brazil (2 cases), Peru (4 cases, including one death) and Venezuela (5 cases, including 2 deaths) (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53380).

However, the Dominican Republic reported 0 cases in 2018 and 2019 (PAHO update <bit.ly/2RpjTWb>), and only one confirmed case in 2017; whereas Haiti reported 73 confirmed cases in 2017, 105 in 2018, and 17 in 2019 (http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=43201).

PAHO attributed "various factors" contributing to the occurrence of diphtheria outbreaks in the Region of the Americas in 2020, including non-compliance with vaccination coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the postponement of vaccination campaigns (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53173).

Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable infection caused by toxin-producing strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (such as paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ can also harbor diphtheria toxin genes and cause zoonotic infection in humans.

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding. The organisms can survive in dust and clothing for up to 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Shedding from cutaneous lesions can cause respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts.

Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength doses combined with a full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lowercase d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap). In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children: one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm).

Respiratory diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics. Td vaccination is recommended for the patient's close contacts (that is, those who may have been exposed to respiratory secretions or who are close household contacts) if Td has not been administered within the last 5 years. These contacts should have nasal and pharyngeal specimens obtained for culture and should also be given antibiotic prophylaxis. - Mod.ML
