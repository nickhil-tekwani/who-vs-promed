Re: rabies transmission through organ donation
----------------------------------------------
***[Dr. Christian Drosten, Virology/Molecular Diagnostics, Bernhard
Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, submitted the 1st
report of the suspected transmission of rabies through organ
transplantation to ProMED-mail on Thu 17 Feb 2005. Dr. Drosten's
report and English language translation of the 2 press releases from
the Deutsche Stifung Organtransplantation [posted in Rabies, human,
organ transplantation - Germany (02) 20050218.0539] did not reach
this moderator until later. The diagnosis in these rabies cases was
primarily confirmed in Dr. Drosten's own laboratory, and his letter
contains some information that has not appeared in the earlier or
subsequent ProMED-mail reports. This information is reproduced below
with apologies to Christian Drosten for the mishandling of his
original report. - Mod.CP]
There are cases of organ transplantation-associated rabies infections
in Germany, which can be tracked back to a single multi-organ donor
who obviously did not present overt symptoms at the time when organs
were taken. Some, but not all, recipients are already in severe
clinical condition. Please note that the press releases from the
Deutsche Stifung Organtransplantation (DSQ) in German can be found at
<http://www.dso.de>
[and in English in ProMED-mail post "Rabies, human, organ
transplantation - Germany (02) 20050218.0539"]. Please note that the
German common name for rabies is "Tollwut."
Laboratory findings in formalin-fixed brain material of the index
patient (organ donor) included Negri bodies in light microscopy,
positive immuno-histochemical staining with a monoclonal primary
antibody, [and, in the case of] recipients, included positive RT-PCR
results in saliva, corneal swabs, neck skin biopsies, and, in
ultra-centrifuged serum, neutralizing antibodies in one patient; this
patient was probably vaccinated some time ago. He is not severely
ill. Not all organ recipients have been tested yet. These laboratory
diagnoses have been obtained collaboratively by the Bernhard Nocht
Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg and the Institute of
Hygiene and Environmental Health in Hamburg. An electron microscopy
image of brain material of the index patient can be viewed at

Cases of rabies in Germany following organ transplantation
-----------------------------------------------------------
On Wed 16 Feb 2005, the Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation
(German Foundation for Organ Transplantation)
<http://www.dso.de/>
announced possible rabies cases in 3 of 6 patients who received
organs from a donor who died in late December 2004 (1). These 3
patients, who received lung, kidney and kidney/pancreas transplants
following the donor's death, are in critical condition. The remaining
3 organ recipients (2 corneal, one liver) have not shown any signs of
rabies.
The organ donor suffered cardiac arrest in a hospital, where she was
resuscitated several times. Her circulatory system was stabilized,
but prolonged hypoxemia led to brain death. There were no clinical
indications that the donor patient was infected with rabies.
The Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg
<http://www.bni-hamburg.de/>
and the Konsiliarlabor for Rabies at the University Clinic in Essen's
Institute of Virology confirmed the diagnosis of rabies in the donor
and 2 of the recipients on 16 and 17 Feb 2005 (2). As a precaution,
all contacts of the infected donor and the infected patients in
Germany have received rabies immunoglobulin and started a course of
rabies vaccination. A warning was posted on the European Early
Warning and Response System on Fri 18 Feb 2005.
The risk of rabies infection in Germany is extremely low. The last 2
deaths due to rabies in Germany occurred in 1996 and 2004 (3,4). In
both cases, the infection was acquired abroad through an animal bite.
Transmission of the rabies virus to humans usually occurs through the
bite of an infected animal, but can also occur through direct contact
of mucous membranes or fresh breaks in the skin with infectious
material (e.g. saliva, neural tissue, cerebrospinal fluid).
Person-to-person transmission has been observed only in rare isolated
cases after transplantation. Rabies in transplant recipients was last
reported in 2004 in the United States (5, 6). Based on a risk analysis
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies/organ_update_070204.htm>,
174 contacts associated with these cases received post-exposure
prophylaxis with simultaneous passive immunization with rabies
immunoglobulin and active immunization with rabies vaccine.
As a result of this situation, in consultation with the
Konsiliarlabor for Rabies and the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute, the
Robert Koch-Institut has defined indications for immunization after
contact with a person suspected of or confirmed as having rabies.
These are available at <http://www.rki.de>.
