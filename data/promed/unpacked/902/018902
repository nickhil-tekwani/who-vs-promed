An outbreak of the acute hepatitis A infection has killed one person and affected 65 Massachusetts residents who are experiencing homelessness and/or substance use disorder, officials said. Hepatitis A is a viral infection that affects the liver and can cause severe illness.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued an alert about the outbreak on [Mon 24 Sep 2018], and is encouraging local health departments to work with clinical and community-based agencies that provide services to people experiencing homelessness and to those with substance use disorder, especially people injecting drugs. "There may be misconceptions about the different types of hepatitis," said state epidemiologist Dr Catherine Brown. "Hepatitis A infection can be prevented through vaccination and one dose of vaccine can provide substantial protection. It can also be prevented through proper hand washing, especially after using the toilet and before eating."

Of the 65 hepatitis A cases, 45 percent are located in Boston with an increasing number in other cities and towns, including the Southeast and metro Boston areas, the department of public health said in a statement.

The Metro Public Health Department is now confirming there have been 107 cases of hepatitis A reported in Nashville since December 2017.
The department is working with state officials and community organizations to reach at-risk groups.

Officials said those who have the greatest risk of being exposed are the following groups:
- People who use drugs (not just injection drug use).
- Men who have sexual contact with men.
- Individuals experiencing homelessness.

Health Department staff will be offering free hepatitis A vaccine to the at risk groups in the coming weeks at the following events and locations:
- 22 Sep 2018: St Thomas Medical Mission at Home, Municipal Auditorium, 8 am-2 pm.
- 27 Sep 2018: Room in the Inn, 705 Drexel St.
- 1 Oct 2018: Community Care Fellowship, 8:30 am-12:30 pm.
- 11 Oct 2018: Room in the Inn, 705 Drexel St.
- 20 Oct 2018: Operation Stand Down Event, Room in the Inn.
- 25 Oct 2018: Room in the Inn, 705 Drexel St.

Vaccination initiatives will continue in an effort to end the outbreak, including working with organizations that serve the homeless, reaching out to the LGBTQ community, working with the Davidson County Sheriff's Office [DCSO] to vaccinate DCSO inmates and efforts to reach those who use drugs.

Large hepatitis A outbreaks have occurred since early 2017 in several states, including ongoing outbreaks in California, Utah, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia, spreading from person to person primarily among people who are homeless and people who are drug users.
