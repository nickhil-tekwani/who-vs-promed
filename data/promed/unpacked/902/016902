In Gorakhpur 2 people succumbed to encephalitis at a hospital, taking
the toll due to the deadly brain fever in eastern Uttar Pradesh to
541 this year [2010]. Health officials said today [28 Dec 2010] that
as many as 6 fresh cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) have
been reported at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital in the
last 2 days. Additional director (Health) UK Srivastava said the dead
belonged to Kushinagar and Gorakhpur districts.

As many as 67 patients are presently undergoing treatment at various
government hospitals of Gorakhpur, Mahrajganj, Deoria, Kushinagar,
Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, and Siddharthanagar, he said.

This year [2010], a total of 3754 people suffering from encephalitis
have been admitted to various government hospitals, of whom 541 died.

Meanwhile, the Japanese encephalitis vaccination drive has been
successfully completed in 7 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh.

[This outbreak smolders on relentlessly. The etiologies of the
apparent majority these cases identified as acute encephalitis
syndrome are still not defined. Both JE virus and an unnamed
water-borne virus (enterovirus?) are reportedly involved. There is no
explanation offered in any reports thus far of why the non-JE
virus(es) have not been identified after several months. The campaign
with fresh JE virus vaccine has been initiated. One hopes that this
vaccination campaign will end cases of JE virus infection.
