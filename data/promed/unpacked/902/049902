Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in Canada
Additional information (follow-up report No. 1)
----------------------------------------
Information received on 3 Jun 2003 from Dr Brian Evans, Executive
Director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Ottawa:

End of previous report period: 20 May 2003 (see Disease
Information, 16 [21], 125, dated 23 May 2003).

End of this report period: 3 Jun 2003.

The case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was detected
as part of Canada's ongoing surveillance programme.

Geographical location of the BSE case: Wanham - 180 km
northwest of Edmonton, province of Alberta.

Comments concerning affected population: a Black Angus cow in a
herd of 192 head established in 2001.

The ongoing investigation into the cause of this case of BSE is
focusing on confirmation of the cow's birthplace and the history of
the feeding practices and sources of animal feed for this cow.
Herds where the animal has resided since its birth are being
investigated as well as other related sites.

As a consequence, the CFIA initially quarantined a total of 17
premises: 12 in the province of Alberta, 2 in the province of
Saskatchewan, and 3 in the province of British Columbia. These
included: the index herd, 10 premises related to trace-back
investigations, 3 trace-forward sites, and 3 other premises as a
result of feed investigations. The CFIA has confirmed that no cattle
have been exported from herds that had been quarantined dating
back to January 2003.

The index herd has been fully depopulated and all the remaining
animals have tested negative. Negative results from a rapid
diagnostic test were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
testing. The CFIA will remove the quarantine on the farm following its
cleaning and disinfection.

A total of 75 calves sold from the index herd and additional animals
which could not be identified precisely or could not be ruled out as
progeny of the index herd, on the 3 trace-forward sites, have been
destroyed and have also tested negative to both the rapid diagnostic
and the traditional tests. Since 2001, cattle are legally required to
be tagged when they leave their premises. This has facilitated the
tracing of these calves from the index herd through the Canadian
Cattle Identification Agency database.

Following on from negative test results for all samples on these 3
trace-forward sites, they have been released from quarantine, as
the remaining animals on these sites were neither related to the
BSE-positive cow nor to a common feed source. See
http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/heasan/disemala/bseesb/invest/20030604tfe.shtml


The information gathered to date has consistently identified one line
of inquiry in the trace-back investigation as having the highest
probability of the positive animal's movements:

In this line of inquiry, a herd in the province of Saskatchewan where
the infected cow is believed to have lived for 4 years has been fully
depopulated, and the animals (49) have tested negative to the rapid
test and IHC testing.

3 additional herds in this line of inquiry -- 2 in the province of
Alberta and 1 in the province of Saskatchewan -- have also been
depopulated and sampled. The animals in the second herd in
Saskatchewan have all tested negative to the rapid test.

The 3 premises that were quarantined as part of the animal feed
investigation have also been fully depopulated, as the inspectors
could not conclusively establish that ruminant animals on these
premises had not been inadvertently exposed to potentially
contaminated poultry feed. They include a small number of goats
that had consumed the same feed as the cattle.

On 2 Jun 2003, the CFIA placed one more farm under quarantine in
the province of Alberta in the trace-forward from the first line of
inquiry. Animals on this farm commingled in 1998-99 with, and were
exposed to the same feed sources as, animals from one of the
quarantined premises. The latter premises have been depopulated
and the animals have tested negative.

Any additional herd or animal that is found to be at risk as a result
of the investigation will also destroyed and the brains of all animals
destroyed will be tested.

No carcasses of quarantined animals will enter either the animal or
the human food chain.

To date, approximately 2000 animals have been subject to
quarantine notices and over 1160 cattle have been removed from
farms to be destroyed and sampled for BSE testing. A total of 15
farms remain under quarantine as of 3 Jun 2003. This number will
be reduced as and when additional negative test results become
available.

Daily updates are being provided on the CFIA's website, at
under the heading "Disease Investigation
in Western Canada". Interested individuals are also encouraged to
subscribe to the list server, which will automatically send out
e-mail notification of posted material.

A leading international expert looking into the way Canada has
handled its single identified case of mad cow disease (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) said on Monday that the disease
was likely to strike other animals in North America. "I'm estimating
there will be other cases in this part of the world," said Ulrich Kihm,
a member of the Paris-based Office International des Epizooties'
(OIE) expert committee on BSE.

Canada reported a single case of BSE in May 2003, prompting
more than 20 countries, including the United States, to ban imports
of Canadian beef. Those bans are costing Canada's cattle industry
up to C$27.5 million (US $20 million) a day.

"The risk is there that you will find a second or third case, or even
more, so the answer is clearly yes," he said in reply to a question
on whether more animals in Canada could be infected with BSE.

Canada has exported more than 9 million head of cattle to the United
States since 1996, the year the Canadian cow infected with BSE
was most likely born, Statistics Canada data show. The exchange of
live cattle between the 2 countries means there is a "high
probability" the brain-wasting disease, which has an incubation
period of 2 to 8 years, is in U.S. cattle, Kihm said.

"They have the exchange -- from what I have seen between cattle
and meat and bone meal -- going from north to south and south to
north, and I would say you are sitting in the same boat, you belong
to the same system," Kihm said.

Ron DeHaven, deputy administrator of veterinary services (VS) with
the U.S. Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS), disputed Kihm's statement. "I think it's
contrary to all of the information we have and the work that we've
done over a number of years to ensure that we have a good BSE
program in this country," DeHaven said. "By the internationally
recognized standards, we are free of the disease," he added.

DeHaven left open the possibility that USDA could begin considering
an easing of the beef import ban against Canada before the OIE
delivers itsfinal report in about 2 weeks. Ottawa is hoping to give
USDA an executive summary of that report on Tuesday, which might
have the data Washington needs to reconsider the near-total ban on
Canada's beef and cattle.

5 bulls born in 1996 on the farm in Saskatchewan where the
diseased Canadian cow was most likely born were exported to the
United States, but officials have said those bulls were unlikely to
have been infected with the brain-wasting disease. U.S. officials
have said those bulls have probably already been butchered.

Kihm said he had no doubt that Canadian beef was safe to be
exported and that Canada's system of monitoring for mad cow
disease is "fairly good," although it needs to be improved. "In terms
of what it is right now, I would say it's a fairly good system you have
in place," he said. "But you can, of course, improve it and you
have to improve it, there's no question," he added. Kihm said the
report into how Canada handled the mad cow probe would be ready
in 2 weeks.
