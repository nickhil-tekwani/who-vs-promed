[Since August 2020, Russia reported 39 outbreaks of HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza]. All were associated with the H5 hemagglutinin subtype, but only 2 of the 39 have been fully characterized as H5N8. These outbreaks occurred in both domestic poultry and wild birds and were located in Omsk, Kurgan, Tyumen, and Chelyabinsk oblasts. These oblasts border the North Kazakhstan region. See reports and updated maps at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=35477, https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=35280, and https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=35614.

For this HPAI event from Kazakhstan, the neuraminidase has not yet been typed. Determining the subtype and strain of this virus is very important. - Mod.CRD
