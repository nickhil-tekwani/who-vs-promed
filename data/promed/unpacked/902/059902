France confirmed a case of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) on Tuesday, the
first in continental Europe since the infection broke out in Britain last
month.
The French farm ministry said in a statement tests on cattle at a farm in
the Mayenne department of northwest France had been positive for the highly
infectious disease.
"The first case of FMD has just been confirmed in a herd of 114 cattle on
a farm in the Mayenne which is next to a farm which had imported British
sheep in February," the statement said.
It said the entire herd of cattle had been slaughtered and would be
incinerated later in the day.
It was the first confirmed case of the financially devastating disease
since 1981 in France, where farmers and beef producers are already reeling
from huge economic losses linked to a scare over mad cow disease in cattle.
FMD has spread like wildfire in Britain since it emerged there last month.
Until Tuesday there had been no confirmed cases in continental Europe, as
governments introduced draconian measures to keep the illness at bay.
In Italy, a senior veterinary official said about 390 sheep imported from
France had been quarantined after preliminary blood tests showed antibodies
for FMD. Further blood tests were being carried out to see whether or not
the viral infection itself was present.
The infected French cattle were discovered at a farm near the village of La
Baroche-Gondouin, which lies on the borders of the Loire and Normandy.
