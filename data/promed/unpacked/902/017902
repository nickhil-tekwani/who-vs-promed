Officials suspect botulism as villagers fall ill
------------------------
In Kwigillingok, 5 villagers from Southwest Alaska remain hospitalized in
Anchorage and Bethel after sharing a meal of whale blubber believed to have
been poisoned by botulism toxin.
State health officials are still investigating the illnesses, but they've
put together preliminary details of how 14 villagers were exposed to
botulism, a deadly illness impairing the nervous system.
When 2 people from Kwigillingok were searching for driftwood about 25 to 30
miles west of their home near the mouth of the Kuskokwim River, they found
a beached beluga whale that had died. They didn't believe it had decayed,
said Dr. Joe McLaughlin, medical epidemiologist leading the investigation.
They cut off blubber from the tail and brought it home.
Kwigillingok is a village of about 340 people. The Yup'ik residents
practice a subsistence lifestyle, and seal, birds, king salmon, and other
fish are staple foods, said Doris Sirilo, an Anchorage resident who was
raised in Kwigillingok. Whale is more rare, but when it's found, the tail
is considered a treat, she said. And it's not uncommon to share meals as gifts.
"People share their food a lot, especially when it's the first catch
of any season," Sirilo said.
Sunday afternoon 9 villagers ate together, sharing the raw blubber. Sunday
or Monday 5 others from the same village ate the blubber, McLaughlin said.
Within a day or two, some of the villagers developed nausea or vomiting,
difficulty swallowing, double vision, dry throat or mouth, or dilated
pupils, all possible symptoms of botulism, McLaughlin said.
They went to the village health clinic or flew to the hospital in Bethel to
be checked out. By Wednesday, the health care providers from the
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Regional Hospital in Bethel reported suspected
botulism to state health officials, said Dr. Beth Funk, medical epidemiologist.
As of Friday afternoon, 3 remained hospitalized in Bethel and 2 elders were
in Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage, McLaughlin said. The 2 flown
to Anchorage need mechanical ventilators to help them breathe, McLaughlin
said, but chances are good for recovery. At this point, no fatalities have
been reported. All are in stable condition.
Botulism becomes deadly when the toxin paralyzes the diaphragm and prevents
the person from breathing, Funk said. The last reported botulism death in
Alaska happened in 1991 when a Stebbins resident died after eating seal oil
stored in a sealed coffee can.
McLaughlin flew to the village to investigate the outbreak. Mike Rearden,
manager of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, flew with him to look
for the whale in hopes of marking it with a board telling people not to eat
it. They could not find it, however.
The Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corp. put out warning messages over the VHF
radios used by coastal villages, telling residents not eat the whale
blubber and to visit a health clinic if they had, said Dan Winkelman, the
corporation's general counsel.
McLaughlin said this botulism outbreak was unusual because it did not come
from deliberately fermented food, the common way hundreds of Alaska Natives
have been poisoned.
The bacteria causing botulism, _Clostridium botulinum_, is found naturally
in beach soil, ocean water, and sediment, even marine mammals and fish.
McLaughlin said it's possible the beached whale had beaten up against rocks
and trees, and the trauma introduced bacteria into the tissue.
In the Lower 48, most cases of foodborne botulism are linked to home-canned
food, Funk said. In Alaska, all of the botulism cases in the past 50 years
were connected with preparation or storage of traditional Native foods,
such as fermented or "stinky" seal or fish. During the winter of 2001, for
example, several people from Manokotak were poisoned after eating fermented
beaver tail and feet.
Traditionally, Alaska Natives fermented their food by placing it in pits.
But in more recent years, they started putting the food in airtight plastic
bags or containers that create an anaerobic, or oxygen-free, environment in
which the botulism-making bacteria can grow.
Between 1950 and 1997, 214 Alaskans contracted food-borne botulism and 19
of them died.
At this point, health officials say these are cases of suspected botulism.
There is no rapid test to detect the toxin, and epidemiologists must send
blood or stool samples and remaining whale blubber to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta for further testing.
"Right now, our state laboratory can't test for it, but we hope in the near
future they'll be able to do that," Funk said. McLaughlin said samples will
be sent out Monday. Lab results could take weeks to months, he said, but
are not needed to treat patients. "We take action immediately," he said.
If people have botulism-related symptoms, they can receive an antitoxin
preventing them from getting sicker. McLaughlin said 4 of the 14 people
exposed to the blubber received antitoxin this week.
