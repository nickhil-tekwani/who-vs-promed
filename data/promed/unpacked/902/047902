Date of confirmation of the event: 2 Mar 2018
Report date: 8 Mar 2018
Date submitted to OIE: 8 Mar 2018
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae)
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, Laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Wunthou, Lakes
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Dec 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 2000 / 8 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep/goats / - / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: There were a few cases of abortion in cattle herds observed after heavy flooding in November 2017, when swampy areas formed, and the number of mosquitoes increased. No mortalities in cattle have been reported. During the investigation, clinical signs consistent with Rift Valley fever were observed.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 0.40 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep/goats / ** / ** / - / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering, vectors

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; Vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; control of vectors; vector surveillance

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, South Africa (OIE Reference Laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 2 Mar 2018 / Positive
Sheep/goats / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 2 Mar 2018 / Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Wunthou is located in Yirol East County in Eastern Lakes state. Since January 2018, cases in both humans and livestock have been reported in this state. See map at http://iomsouthsudan.org/tracking/sites/default/publicfiles/documents/Lakes_YirolEast_Atlas.pdf.

"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute, febrile, mosquito-borne, zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus. It is usually present in epizootic form over large areas of a country following heavy rains and flooding and is characterised by high rates of abortion and neonatal mortality, primarily in sheep, goats, cattle and camels. The susceptibility of different species and breeds to RVF may vary considerably. Some animals may have inapparent infections, while others have severe clinical disease with mortality and abortion. Susceptible, older non-pregnant animals often do not show signs of disease.

RVFV is endemic in many African countries and may involve several countries in the region at the same time or progressively expand geographically over the course of a few years. In addition to Africa, large outbreaks have been observed in the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean Islands. These generally, but not exclusively, follow the periodic cycles of unusually heavy rainfall, which may occur at intervals of several years, or the flooding of wide areas, favouring the proliferation of mosquitoes.

Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes mosquitoes_ acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus, so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf. - Mod.CRD
