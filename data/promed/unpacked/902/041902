Ebola Situation Report - 5 Aug 2015
--------------------------------------

Summary
-------
There were 2 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 2 Aug 2015: 1 in Guinea and 1 in Sierra Leone. This is the lowest weekly total to have been reported since March 2014, and marks a 3rd consecutive decline in weekly case incidence. This decline is underpinned by continued refinements to all elements of the response. In particular, strengthened capacity for contact tracing and case investigation has increased confidence that the few remaining known chains of transmission are better understood and controlled than was the case several months ago. Maintaining these resources in the months ahead will be critical, as there remains a significant risk of further transmission and an increase in case incidence in the near and medium term. Almost 2000 contacts remain under observation across 5 prefectures in Guinea and 4 districts in Sierra Leone, and despite intensive efforts a small number of contacts in both countries have not been traced or have been lost to follow-up. In addition, recent high-risk transmission events in Guinea and Sierra Leone are very likely to result in further cases in the coming weeks.

Illustrating the continuing challenges, the single case reported from Guinea is a contact who was lost to follow-up, and who is likely to have generated a substantial number of further high-risk contacts. The case, a 28-year-old woman, is a registered contact associated with a known chain of transmission that has given rise to several generations of cases in the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry, over the past several weeks. After being lost to follow-up, the case travelled south from Conakry through Forecariah and into Kambia, Sierra Leone, where she reportedly visited a traditional healer before returning to Ratoma via Forecariah. Intensive efforts are underway to identify and trace all contacts in Guinea and Sierra Leone. 1080 contacts remain under followup in 5 western prefectures in Guinea, with the vast majority (over 90 percent) of contacts located in Conakry and Forecariah.

An interim analysis of the Ebola ring vaccination trial in Guinea suggests that the investigational rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine protects people exposed to EVD. The trial will continue in Guinea, with all rings around confirmed cases now receiving immediate vaccination. Previously, rings were randomly allocated to receive either immediate vaccination or vaccination 21 days after the confirmation of a case.

No new cases were reported from Liberia in the week to 2 Aug 2015. All contacts have now completed their 21-day follow-up period. The last case was discharged after testing negative for EVD for a 2nd time on 23 Jul 2015.

In Sierra Leone, the case reported this week is one of over 600 contacts generated by the single case reported in Tonkolili the previous week (the index case). The new case is a family member who provided care to the index case. Over 40 contacts are considered to be at high risk of infection because of the nature of their contact with the index case, and there is a high probability that further cases will arise. Investigations into the source of infection of the index case, who is thought to have acquired infection in Freetown before traveling to Tonkolili, are still ongoing. Across the country a total of 811 contacts remain under follow up, with the vast majority located in Tonkolili. All contacts associated with known chains of transmission in Kambia have now completed the 21-day follow-up period, although intensive efforts are underway to identify any contacts associated with the case reported from Ratoma, Guinea in the week ending 2 Aug 2015.

For the 1st time in 3 weeks, no health worker infections were reported from any of the affected countries. There have been a total of 880 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 512 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
----------------------------------------
There have been a total of 27 862 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 2 Aug 2015, with 11 281 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). One new confirmed case was reported in Guinea and one in Sierra Leone in the week to 2 Aug 2015.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 2 Aug 2015. Since the start of the outbreak a total of 880 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 512 reported deaths (table 5).

https://news.vice.com/article/the-race-to-zero-looking-for-the-last-ebola-patients-in-liberia
[For the 1st time in nearly 10 months, there was not a single person infected with the virus in any of the country's emergency treatment units.

The sentiment was clear: ...The fight against Ebola was not over for the country of 4.2 million people. Officials were still monitoring more than 100 individuals living in Liberia who had come in contact with an Ebola patient in the last 21 days, the incubation period for the virus. It would take a total of 42 days without a new confirmed case of hemorrhagic fever for the World Health Organization (WHO) to officially declare Liberia free of the virus.]

3 Aug 2015: Sierra Leone records 2 new cases of Ebola
https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/sierre-leone-records-two-cases-ebola-205601983.html
[Two new cases of Ebola have surfaced in Sierra Leone's Tonkolili district after a man died last week in the area where the deadly virus had not been seen for months, according to an official.

The 2 new cases are relatives of a man who contracted the virus in mid-July 2015, the National Ebola Response Centre's OB Sisay said on Sun (2 Aug 2015).

"We now know where the virus is, and we are tracking its movement by surrounding, containing and eradicating its last remaining chain of transmission," Sisay said. ... -more]

6 Aug 2015 Sierra Leone and Guinea: Only 2 Ebola cases reported in past week, but risks remain: WHO
http://www.todayonline.com/world/two-ebola-cases-reported-past-week-risks-remain-who
[Guinea and Sierra Leone each recorded a single case of Ebola in the past week, putting a year end goal of ending the deadly epidemic within reach, although risks remain, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tue (4 Aug 2015).

We have gone over the last 4 weeks from 30 cases (per week) to 25 to 7 and, in the last week, 2 cases. That progress is real," [WHO Assistant-Director] Aylward told a news briefing.

This new case in Sierra Leone appears to be in addition to the 2 cases reported in the item immediately above, in Tonkolili, where they have quarantined a whole village plus a whole hospital, that is, nearly 600 people quarantined. - Mod.LK]

[In January 2014, an internal study commissioned by Smart strongly recommended individual counseling for all Ebola burial staff; soon after, they began training frontline workers in psychological First Aid.

As the Ebola crisis enters its 2nd year, the stress of this difficult, sometimes dangerous work can take a physical and emotional toll," said Leslie Scott, national director of World Vision, the consortium's lead agency. A 24-year-old student was traumatised when he had to bury his friend on Christmas Day, just 3 weeks after he joined the Red Cross. The images terrorized him for months to come.

"Friends you used to work with, friends you used to play with, you carry them in a body bag, put them on a stretcher and dump them in a grave, never to be seen again. Now, I go with alcohol just to forget myself. I can't sleep, and I have no appetite. And at times, people say I look like a violent man, because I have no smile," he said...more]

[Sierra Leone is in a stronger place than it was 6 months ago to fight Ebola, but the new challenge is to get to 0 cases, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control [CDC] and Prevention said Mon [3 Aug 2015] during a visit, as new cases emerged in the city and in an area that had not seen the deadly virus for months.]

3 Aug 2015 USA (Virginia): Offices inside Woodbridge medical building quarantined during Ebola scare
http://potomaclocal.com/2015/08/03/woodbridge-medical-building-quarantined-during-ebola-scare/
[According to Lori Andrew-Spear, spokesperson for the Virginia Health Department, "On Fri 31 Jul 2015, an individual who was in West Africa within the past 21 days and is part of the Virginia Department of Health's arriving passenger monitoring program developed symptoms of illness. Out of an abundance of caution, the individual was transported to a Northern Virginia hospital for assessment.

Part of that assessment involved testing for a variety of potential causes of illness including Ebola. Testing for Ebola was negative....

The all-clear was eventually given to all inside the building. A tipster to Potomac Local described a scene of confusion while the office building remained under quarantine: "They initially told everyone that it was a possible contagious medical situation but would not provide any details, even when they were asked. The police officers on the scene told people to ask the fire department. Fireman said to ask the public health department but said they were not available for comment. In the end, hundreds of people were involuntarily detained for hours with no explanation."]

http://www.wired.com/2015/08/100-percent-effective-means-ebola-vaccine/
[...But that number ['100 per cent effective'] probably means less than you think it does. It's based on incomplete data, so it doesn't have the statistical clout it should. And it never will. Based on the vaccine's early success, the trial's runners decided that all participants in the study should get it immediately after exposure. That's a perfectly reasonable, humane reaction, but it also means that the researchers will never be able to collect better data on the vaccine's efficacy, which is what regulators look for when they're deciding to approve a drug. In other words, the vaccine's early success could make it harder for people to get it down the line. ...-more]

The current Ebola outbreak is the largest since the virus was discovered in central Africa in 1976. Thousands have already died as health workers battle to contain the epidemic and treat those exposed. Extensive public health measures seen as the key to ending the crisis, meanwhile researchers are fast-tracking trials of experimental drugs and vaccine candidates in the hope that they will help reduce the death toll and protect those on the front line of the outbreak. Nature reporter Erika Check Hayden traveled to Sierra Leone in December 2014 to report on the outbreak and efforts to bring it to an end.

[Abstract. A novel Ebola virus (EBOV) 1st identified in March 2014 has infected more than 25 000 people in West Africa, resulting in more than 10 000 deaths. Preliminary analyses of genome sequences of 81 EBOV collected from March to June 2014 from Guinea and Sierra Leone suggest that the 2014 EBOV originated from an independent transmission event from its natural reservoir followed by sustained human-to-human infections. It has been reported that the EBOV genome variation might have an effect on the efficacy of sequence-based virus detection and candidate therapeutics. However, only limited viral information has been available since 14 Jul 2014, when the outbreak entered a rapid growth phase. Here we describe 175 full-length EBOV genome sequences from 5 severely stricken districts in Sierra Leone from 28 Sep to 11 Nov 2014. We found that the 2014 EBOV has become more phylogenetically and genetically diverse from July to November 2014, characterized by the emergence of multiple novel lineages. The substitution rate for the 2014 EBOV was estimated to be 1.23 Ã-- 10e-3 substitutions per site per year (95 percent highest posterior density interval, '3 substitutions per site per year), approximating to that observed between previous EBOV outbreaks. The sharp increase in genetic diversity of the 2014 EBOV warrants extensive EBOV surveillance in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia to better understand the viral evolution and transmission dynamics of the ongoing outbreak. These data will facilitate the international efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics.]

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v524/n7563/full/nature14594.html
[Abstract. West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak so far recorded. Until now, there have been 27 013 reported cases and 11 134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic transmission from a bat to a 2-year-old boy in December 2013. From this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179 patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the 1st diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea, reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March 2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May (2014). The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.]

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v524/n7563/full/nature14612.html
[Abstract. An epidemic of Ebola virus disease of unprecedented scale has been ongoing for more than a year in West Africa. As of 29 April 2015, there have been 26 277 reported total cases (of which 14 895 have been laboratory confirmed) resulting in 10 899 deaths. The source of the outbreak was traced to the prefecture of Guckdou in the forested region of southeastern Guinea. The virus later spread to the capital, Conakry, and to the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali. In March 2014, when the 1st cases were detected in Conakry, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal, deployed a mobile laboratory in Donka hospital to provide diagnostic services to the greater Conakry urban area and other regions of Guinea. Through this process we sampled 85 Ebola viruses (EBOV) from patients infected from July to November 2014, and report their full genome sequences here. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the sustained transmission of three distinct viral lineages co-circulating in Guinea, including the urban setting of Conakry and its surroundings. One lineage is unique to Guinea and closely related to the earliest sampled viruses of the epidemic. A second lineage contains viruses probably reintroduced from neighbouring Sierra Leone on multiple occasions, while a third lineage later spread from Guinea to Mali. Each lineage is defined by multiple mutations, including non-synonymous changes in the virion protein 35 (VP35), glycoprotein (GP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins. The viral GP is characterized by a glycosylation site modification and mutations in the mucin-like domain that could modify the outer shape of the virion. These data illustrate the ongoing ability of EBOV to develop lineage-specific and potentially phenotypically important variation.]
