As of 15 May [2014], 9 laboratory confirmed cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] were recorded in the residents of the cities of Rostov-on-don, Salsk, Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, in the Dubovsky and Salsky rural districts.

[Cases were reported by] the regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare]. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is an arboviral vector-borne infectious disease [that occurs in] natural foci, characterized by different severity of clinical courses with hemorrhagic and without hemorrhagic syndromes. The incubation period is 1-14 days, on average 4-6 days. CCHF, in addition to the common intoxication and hemorrhagic syndrome, is characterized by a [bimodal] 2-wave fever, development of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The main reservoir and vector of the virus is the tick _Hyalomma marginatum_, which maintains the virus for life. In forest-steppe landscapes, the population of _H. marginatum_ is reduced, and the role of vector and, perhaps, the main reservoir of the CCHF virus is played by ticks of other species, in particular, _Dermacentor marginatus_. In connection with the seasonal activation of ticks, it is necessary to take personal precautions [to avoid tick bites].

[This is springtime in this endemic region and ticks have emerged and are questing for blood meals. It is not surprising that cases of CCHF virus infection are beginning to occur.

In the ProMED-mail post of 26 Aug 2013 (archive no 20130827.1906334), Mod.CP noted, "The Rostov region includes natural foci of CCHF virus infection. In 2012, 41 cases of CCHF were recorded in the region, and there were 48 cases in 2011, including 8 cases belonging to a nosocomial cluster. The maximum number of cases (81 patients) was recorded in 2008.

Rostov Oblast is a federal region of Russia, located in the Southern Federal District. Rostov Oblast has an area of 100 800 square km (38 900 sq mi) and a population of 4 277 976 (2010 census), making it the 6th most populous federal subject in Russia. Its administrative center is the city of Rostov-on-Don, which also became the administrative center of the Southern Federal District in 2002. - Mod.CP

The regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] recently reported 3 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever have been officially confirmed in the Stavropol region.

Infection occurred as a result of tick bites. The victims were admitted to the hospital and after laboratory tests CCHF [virus infections] were confirmed in 3 patients from Anzherskiy, Blagodarnenskiy, and Urkmen districts of Stavropol region. The press center of the regional Rospotrebnadzor also noted that as of 12 May 2014, 873 persons consulted medical establishments in connection with tick bites. This indicator is 28.2 per cent less than last year's [2013] indicated [numbers]. In April-May 2014 alone, 39 people were hospitalized with fever after tick bites.

Anti-tick treatments of livestock, fields and resort areas are being carried out in the Stavropol region.
