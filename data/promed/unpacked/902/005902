The China National Health Commission reported a human case of avian influenza A (H5N6) today [19 Aug 2019]. The case involved a 59 year old female from Beijing. She was hospitalised on [11 Aug 2019]. She is now in a critical condition.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multiorgan failure and even death.

People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.

People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

From 2014 to date [19 Aug 2019], 24 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N6) have been reported by the Chinese health authorities.

[The avian influenza viruses provide an excellent example of zoonotic infections that continue to emerge due to viral evolution. In this regard under the "One Health" concept, close cooperation between health and veterinary sectors on a regular basis is imperative for early diagnosis and coordinated response.

"It is essential that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories. Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, member states are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses."
