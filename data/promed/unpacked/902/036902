A flying fox carrying the deadly lyssavirus has been found at Tomago, the 3rd case detected in the Hunter [region, New South Wales] in the past 2 years. Wildlife in Need of Care volunteers rescued the animal from a wire fence last week [week of 6 Jan 2014] and took it to a local vet, who suspected it was carrying the disease.

An autopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Australian bat lyssavirus is deadly and affects the nervous system of bats. An estimated 1 per cent of bats and flying foxes are infected. Infection can spread to humans and other animals when bat saliva enters the body through breaks in the skin such as bites and scratches.

"Infection in people and horses is very rare but because of the serious consequences it is extremely important for people to avoid handling live or dead bats," a Department of Primary Industries spokesman said.

Five cases of Australian bat lyssavirus have been detected in NSW over the past 2 years. 3 of the cases were from the Hunter. Within a fortnight during November [2013], 10 people were treated in the Hunter New England health area for bat bites and scratches.

In the past 12 years, 3 Australians have died of Australian bat lyssavirus [infection].

"The virus has been found in 4 species of fruit bats and flying foxes and at least 3 species of insect-eating bats, so all Australian bats, both the larger flying foxes and the small insect-eating bats are considered to have the potential to transmit lyssavirus," public health physician David Durrheim said.

Wildlife in Need of Care volunteer Lorraine Yudaeff urged anyone who found a bat in apparent distress not to approach it. "They are an important part of our ecosystem and assist in the pollination of plants and are great insect-eaters," Ms Yudaeff said. "Because their habitat is now so restricted, they are especially prone to heat stress at this time of year. In high temperatures they tend to come down closer to the ground in attempts to cool off."

Flying foxes belong to the genus _Pteropus_, and they are the largest bats in the world. There are several species. The species found in the eastern coast of Australia is the grey-headed flying fox (_Pteropus poliocephalus_). Around dusk, grey-headed flying foxes leave the roost and travel up to 50 km (31 mi) a night to feed on pollen, nectar, and fruit. The species consumes fruit flowers and pollens of around 187 plant species.

Australian bat lyssavirus (ABL) was first identified in 1996, and has been found in several species of flying foxes and bats in Australia. A few human deaths have been reported due to this virus, generally associated with history of contact with flying foxes or other bats.
