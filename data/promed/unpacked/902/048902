From the SCFCAH [Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health] presentation by the EU delegation to Romania, we reproduce the following main addressed issues; the presentation includes also data collected after the mission's visit to Romania. For more details and maps, subscribers are referred to the original document at the source URL.

1. Scope of the mission, carried out 28-29 Jun 2016: preparedness against lumpy skin disease [LSD] in cattle in Romania
2. LSD outbreaks in Bulgaria and Serbia, respectively, 28 and 100 km [about 17 miles and 62 miles] from the borders with Romania.
3. Area at risk: South Romania counties bordering Bulgaria and Serbia: 500 000 cattle
4. Romania export: 68 000 cattle (to Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Jordan, and to lesser extent Balkan countries)
5. Cattle identification and movement registration are in place
6. Control and eradication measures:
- National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (NSVFSA)
- local level includes the County Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Directorates (CSVFSD) and government veterinary officers
7. Actions applied in area at risk (South Romania):
- emergency budget / contingency plan available
- risk analysis: cattle markets were banned
- awareness campaigns: official and field veterinarians and farmers
- desk-top simulation exercise
- training clinical signs
- increase diagnostic capacity: 5 more laboratories
8. Expected situation:
- LSD close to the border of Romania
- information available: position paper Bulgaria June 2016: LSD vaccination in Bulgaria to be completed by the end of 2016
- European Commission offered opportunity to carry out emergency vaccination as extension of Bulgaria
- Romanian hesitation because of trade restrictions and because of time-consuming national process to purchase the vaccines
9. Therefore highly likely that:
- LSDV originating from the Bulgarian or Serbian outbreaks would shortly spread to Romania
- LSD may not be prevented by vaccinating cattle only on Bulgaria and Serbian sides of the border.

Recommendations
---------------
1. Vaccination campaigns should be carried out in the southern part of the country at risk for introduction of the LSDV: borders with Bulgaria and Serbia
2. Second best option: enforce active and passive clinical and laboratory surveillance at the high risk counties and start large scale mass vaccination immediately after the 1st outbreak
3. Investigate trade effects due to vaccination more in detail as derogations can be applied especially for products for human consumption (milk, milk products, meat and meat products)
4. Process to purchase the vaccines should be started/finalised without delay
5. Database for animal identification and movement records should include data on vaccinations and laboratory test results
6. Enforced awareness campaigns: abattoir workers, animal traders, drivers cattle transport
7. Enforced active clinical and laboratory vigilance in the high risk border regions including a serological survey in the border region between Bulgaria and Serbia
8. Safe options for disposal of culled animals should be identified and agreed between ministries of Agriculture and Environment
9. Reinforced biosecurity measures should be commonly implemented at each farm at risk
10. Strengthen exchange information, harmonisation strategies and coordination control programmes across the region
11. Enhancement of the diagnostic capacity: More financial resources should be allocated for PCR materials and reagents

[As indicated in the mission's report, the European Commission offered Romania "an opportunity to carry out emergency vaccination as extension of Bulgaria"; Romania hesitated, "because of trade restrictions". The hesitation may be explained by the assumption that Romania's trading partners may or shall refuse imports of live, vaccinated animals or their derived products. The relevant recommendation of the mission (recommendation no. 3) says, "Investigate trade effects due to vaccination more in detail as derogations can be applied especially for products for human consumption (milk, milk products, meat and meat products)".

It is suggested to assess also the risk to trading partners by importing vaccinated live animals (from a country which is not infected by the field virus but practiced preventive vaccination). The pros and cons of such vaccination being applied prior to the introduction of such animals into an infected country deserves a thorough study. - Mod.AS
