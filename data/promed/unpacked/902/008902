Pests and rain hit Honduran banana crops
----------------------------------------
Black Sigatoka disease and adverse weather conditions led to a 5.3
percent year-on-year fall in Honduran banana production in April
[2011], website Latribuna.hn reported.

Statistics released by the Monthly Index of Economic Activity (IMAE)
showed banana production grew 24.6 percent during the same period in
2010.

[Black sigatoka (BS; also called black leaf streak) is caused by the
fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species of
_Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of
bananas and plantains. Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the
plant during and immediately after unfurling. Older leaves are not
readily infected.

BS causes destruction of leaf tissue, which affects the
photosynthetic capabilities, and therefore general vigour of the
plant. It can reduce yields by 50 percent or more. Fruit produced on
diseased plants can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment
causing further losses. It is spread by water, wind, and contaminated
materials (including suckers for planting). Disease management
includes phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, frequent
applications of fungicides, and cultural practices, but the high costs
of these measures make them essentially unavailable to smallholder
farmers.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS). YS is
regarded as less serious because it affects mainly older leaves with
less damage to photosynthetic tissue. Also, there are more crop
cultivars with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS.
