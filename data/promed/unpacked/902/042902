Up to 10 more people are believed to be suffering from new variant CJD, the
killer brain disorder thought to be caused by eating beef infected with BSE
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), known as "mad cow" disease. The victims
are all still alive and mostly young, including at least one child, a
13-year-old girl. New variant CJD has already claimed 48 lives in Britain,
but the appearance of new cases is particularly serious.
It is more than a decade since the government banned the use of parts of
cows thought to present the greatest risk. These new cases imply either a
long incubation period for the disease or infected meat is still entering
the food chain.
Dr Richard Knight, a clinical neurologist at the CJD surveillance unit in
Edinburgh, was cited as confirming the unit is dealing with a further 7-10
suspected cases, adding, "There is a long-term rise in the number of cases
but the overall numbers are still too small to tell us the eventual size of
the epidemic."
The Sunday Times established that meat banned because it could be infected
with BSE is still being sold for human consumption. After the BSE scandal
erupted, the government decided to slaughter all cattle over the age of 30
months. By the end of September last year, more than 2.5million cattle had
been killed.
Last week, Graham Bell, who worked at the Intervention Board, a government
body involved with the cull, was cited as claiming it has been open to
systematic fraud, adding, "It has not been monitored properly and not nearly
enough has been done to stop dishonest practices."
Bell has sent a file detailing his evidence to the French authorities.
British investigators have confirmed they are examining more than 50 cases
where farmers and cattle dealers have allegedly used bogus identity
documents to conceal cows' ages in order to sell them for human consumption.
Last week the agriculture ministry admitted 90 000 cattle have gone missing
from its surveillance scheme. About 1600 cows a year are still being
diagnosed with BSE. Trading standards officers at several county councils,
including Gloucestershire, Shropshire and Somerset, said last week that they
are involved in dozens of investigations.
Nigel Durnford, an animal health inspector in Gloucestershire, was quoted as
saying, "There is a hard core of people who are trying to get animals over
30 months into the human food chain." A ministry spokesman was cited as
saying there were stringent controls to prevent fraud, adding "The farming
community supports this system and the enforcement of the rules is taken
very seriously indeed."
On Friday at the close of the official inquiry into BSE, Lord Phillips, its
chairman, warned that the 48 deaths so far could be "just the tip of an
iceberg". Three more people, 1 in Ireland and 2 in France, have also died
from the disease. A 36-year-old French woman has the disease but is still
alive.
Previously, firm evidence of variant CJD could be obtained only through
postmortem examinations. New tests, devised by the CJD unit in Edinburgh,
now allow diagnoses to be made with some confidence while victims are alive.
The tests include tonsil biopsies and magnetic resonance imaging, which
shows victims to have undergone specific changes in a part of the brain
called the thalamus. Details of the tests are to be published shortly in a
medical journal.
