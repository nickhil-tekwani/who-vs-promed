Blue Earth County's 1st avian bird flu outbreak was announced Fri 29 May 2015 by the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, as the state's total number of affected farms topped 100.

The Blue Earth County turkey operation was among 4 included in Friday's announcement bringing the total number of farms hit by the flu virus to 102, now in 23 counties. Others new outbreaks included the 3rd in Brown County, the 6th in Renville County, and the 38th in Kandiyohi County, highest in the state. All were turkey operations, but only the flock size in the small Kandiyohi farm (7000) was announced.

That brings the total number of affected poultry to over 8.3 million birds.

But the U.S. Department of Agriculture also announced that [a control area/quarantine covering?] 14 backyard flock owners in Lac qui Parle County has been lifted. The Lac qui Parle control area had been in place since 27 Mar 2015 when Minnesota's 1st HPAI flu outbreak was reported. However, the 1 affected turkey farm in Lac qui Parle remains under quarantine.

The USDA also reported that appraisals have been approved for 99 of the affected premises. Birds on 87 of the affected farms have been euthanized, while just 27 have completed carcass removal. After these farms are cleared, cleaning and disinfecting begins. The barns must then sit empty for 21 days, according to the USDA.

[As one can gather from this article, having your premises diagnosed with avian influenza is no small deal. The euthanasia process, the cleanup process, and then the wait before any restocking -- and a still longer wait to start financial recovery, makes this a very long, tedious process.
