New case of hantavirus infection confirmed in Puerto Montt
----------------------------------------------------------
PUERTO MONTT - A new case of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome was confirmed
today in a 52-year-old woman in critical condition at the Internal Medicine
Service of the Puerto Montt Hospital. The woman was admitted to the
hospital on Fri 6 Apr 2001 after being infected in the rural commune of
Chaiten, where she resides. Upon confirmation of the disease, a team from
the rural health service was sent to investigate and instruct the family
and nearby neighbors in sanitary measures that should be adopted [to avoid
further cases.

[The preceding article titles were taken from the website of El Mercurio
along with the dates of publication of the articles. Having read through
most of the articles referred to here, it appears as though there has been
increased activity/identification of cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
in Regions 8 and 10 in Chile this year. Information from the most recent
Ministry of Public Health Epidemiology Website Hantavirus bulletin dated 16
April 2001 is included below. - Mod.MPP
[Today, Thu 19 Apr 2001, The Santiago Times reports that hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome cases have reached a record number this year, but the

Hantavirus: Epidemiologic Situation as of 16 Apr 2001
-----------------------------------------------------
Today 2 new cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome were confirmed. The
first case is a 10-year-old girl, resident of the commune of Loncoche,
Temuco, presently hospitalized in serious condition. The second is a male
living in Paillaco, 10th Region, hospitalized in serious condition in
Valdivia.
Overall situation for 2001: 38 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have
been confirmed this year; 8 in Jan, 12 in Feb, 15 in Mar, and 3 in Apr.
These 38 cases are distributed geographically as follows: Metropolitan
Region (3), 5th Region (1), 7th Region (5), 8th Region (11), 9th region
(5), 10th Region (11). To establish the precise geographic location of
infection, 2 cases are still under investigation; in one case the rural
area of Maule is suspected, and in the other the rural area of Osorno.
Of the 38 confirmed cases, 10 have died, representing a mortality rate of
26.3 percent, a figure lower than observed in previous years. The number of
cases occurring in the period Jan to Apr 2001 is higher than that observed
in the same period both in the year 2000 (13 cases) and in the year 1998
(26 cases).
The total number of patients [diagnosed with mild disease caused by
hantavirus [infection amounts to 17 since 1993, including 6 cases in 2001.
This figure [is probably an under-estimate, given the difficulties in
identifying [cases of mild clinical disease.
It should be emphasized that the disease [hantavirus pulmonary infection
is present in [Chile in an endemic form and until now, the cases have been
distributed from the 5th to the 11th Regions. Nevertheless, the reservoir
of the virus [the long-tailed rat is present from the 3rd to the 11th
Region, where cases [of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can [potentially
appear. For this reason, it is necessary that the population of these
regions adopt prevention measures in order to avoid contact with the rodents.
