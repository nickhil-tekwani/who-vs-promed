Another case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo virus, has been reported in Karachi [Sindh] as a patient at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JMPC) has been diagnosed with the disease.

Officials at the JPMC confirmed on [Sun 21 Oct 2018] that a resident of District Malir [Sindh] had tested positive for Congo virus and was being treated at the hospital.

"A resident of Jam Goth in Malir, was brought to the JPMC in critical condition," said JPMC Executive Director Dr Seemin Jamali. She added that the patient tested positive for CCHF and was being treated at an isolation ward in the hospital.

Dr Jamali explained that the patient had a history of dealing with animals as he was raising cattle at his residence in the Malir area. She added that most of the CCHF patients acquired the disease due to interaction with animals and cattle.

Another patient of CCHF, was also under treatment at the JPMC, Dr Jamali said, adding that his condition was stable. "So far in 2018, we have received 18 patients of CCHF of whom 6 died."

According to health experts, CCHF is a lethal disease with 40 per cent mortality rate. The disease is caused when a person comes in contact with an infected animal, which has parasitic ticks on its body that carry the virus.

Officials of the Sindh health department say so far 11 people have died due to CCHF in Karachi in 2018 while over 100 persons have tested positive for the disease.

[Persons working in close contact with animals are at risk for CCHF due to presence of ticks that can transmit the virus through bites or crushing during removal through skin cuts, etc. The animals do not show clinical disease during viraemia and the virus can be transferred in butchering, handling of meat and hides, etc.

The veterinary aspect of the problem requires establishment of animal screening with measures for tick control. Collaborative work by health and veterinary sectors with support of entomologists for setting up CCHF surveillance can help plan prevention and control programs.

The virus is now endemic in both rural and urban parts of the country, and the best safeguard on the human side is to inform the public regarding the risks and provide education on the use of appropriate practices and protection measures. - Mod.UBA
