India: Chandipura Virus Responsible for Deaths of 17 Children in Gujarat
------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 19 Jul 2004, Scientists of the National Institute of Virology
(NIV), Pune, have identified the mysterious virus responsible for a viral
fever, which has killed 17 children in over 8 talukas of Vadodara district
[see: Undiagnosed deaths, children - India (Gujarat): RFI 20040712.1870],
to be Chandipura virus.
As per communications to the state health authorities, the virus has been
identified to be similar to the virus which affected 165 children living in
rural areas in Andhra Pradesh in 2001-02. Confirmed to be a vector-borne
disease some time back, [phlebotamine] sandflies have been identified to be
the carriers of the virus. These flies are known to breed in dark places,
cracks on mud-walls of village huts, barks of trees, cattle and animal
sheds, poultry houses and other such places.

[Chandipura virus is a member of the genus _Vesiculovirus_ of the family
_Rhabdoviridae_. Chandipura virus was isolated first in 1967 from blood
samples from 2 patients during investigation of an outbreak of another
arbovirus disease in Nagpur. Subsequently a similar virus was isolated in
West Africa. More recently it has been associated circumstantially with
outbreaks of febrile illness in children in India (see references below).
Antibodies to Chandipura virus may be relatively common in endemic areas.
It is not clear whether Chandipura virus was isolated from patients in this
or previous suspected outbreaks, or whether the evidence was based entirely
on serology. Further information would be appreciated regarding the basis
for the diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
