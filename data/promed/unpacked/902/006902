Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update, 9 Jan 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Oman.

The case is a 59-year-old man who became sick with fever, cough, and shortness of breath on [20 Dec 2013] and was admitted to hospital in [Al Batinah North] Governorate on [24 Dec 2013]. On [28 Dec 2013] his condition deteriorated and he was transferred to an intensive care unit and was diagnosed with pneumonia. The patient died on [30 Dec 2013]. A laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV was made on [1 Jan 2014]. The patient had a history of daily exposure to camels and other farm animals and also participated in camel race events. In addition, the man was a heavy smoker.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 178 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 75 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers, and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[The WHO report above provides official confirmation of the recent media report on the MERS-CoV fatal case in Oman (see ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (01): Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, WHO 20140103.2150717 for the original media report.)

Noteworthy is the history of frequent exposure to camels and other farm animals, and a possible increased respiratory risk from a history of heavy smoking.

This case now raises the global tally of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections to 178 including 75 deaths.

Al Batinah North governorate (created in 2011) can be seen on the map of Oman at http://www.moh.gov.om/en/about_moh/images/map.gif.

For a map of Oman and the Middle East Region where all MERS-CoV infections can be traced to (to date, all cases treated outside the Middle East can be directly linked to contacts with MERS-CoV infected individuals who had travelled to the Middle East prior to onset of their illness) see http://healthmap.org/r/1FWS. - Mod.MPP]
