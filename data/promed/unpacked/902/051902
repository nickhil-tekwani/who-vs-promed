A 4 year old Egyptian boy has contracted the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird
flu virus, bringing to 70 the number of human avian flu cases in the most
populous Arab country, the state news agency MENA reported.

Egypt has been hit harder by the virus than any other country outside Asia
and has seen a surge of cases in recent weeks. Ten new human infections
have been reported since 1 Apr 2009, more than the country saw in all of
2008. The latest sufferer from the virus is from the Nile Delta province of
Sharkiya, MENA said.

The avian flu virus rarely infects people, but experts say they fear it
could mutate into a form that humans could easily pass to one another,
sparking a pandemic that could kill millions. Some 26 Egyptians have died
after contracting the virus. Most of those infected had come into contact
with infected domestic birds, in a country where 5 million households raise
poultry as a significant source of food and income.

MENA reported that the boy, believed to have contracted the virus from sick
household birds, had entered hospital suffering from a high fever and
showing flu symptoms. He was being treated with the anti-viral drug Tamiflu
[oseltamivir] and was in a stable condition, MENA added.

Last month [April 2009], Egypt ordered the culling of all the country's 300
000 to 400 000 pigs as a precaution against the new H1N1 influenza strain,
also known as swine flu, which has infected nearly 6000 people in more than
30 countries. The new virus has not been detected in Egypt so far.

Since 2003, the more deadly H5N1 bird flu virus has infected more than 400
people in 15 countries and killed more than 250. It has killed or forced
the culling of more than 300 million birds in 61 countries in Asia, the
Middle East, Africa and Europe.

[This 70th case further conforms to the age-specific rate pattern, which
distinguishes cases of avian A (H5N1) influenza as discussed in the
Eurosurveillance article by Dr JP Dudley reproduced in a recent ProMED-mail
post (Avian influenza, human (86): Egypt, age-specific rates 20090507.1708).
