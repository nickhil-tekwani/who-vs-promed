Your comments on ProMED-mail on anthrax outbreaks worldwide have always been a good source of information over the years. Thank you for that. And as you can see, in the end we followed your advice in 2011 to vaccinate in that outbreak.

Anthrax was quite frequent in Sweden in the 1st half of 1900, often due to imported bone meal. The Swedish Board of Agriculture banned all imports of bone meal in 1957 after a large outbreak, and after that the numbers fell to practically zero. Since then there were no cases until one single animal in 1981 in Uppsala region due to removing of an old "manure deposit".

In 2008 we had a winter outbreak (as you know from Susanna Sternberg Lewerin) due to harvested hay from a riverbank where dead pigs from the 1956-57 outbreak were dumped.

The outbreak in Orebro in 2011 was due to the accidental opening of an old grave when the owner was digging a trench. The grave was from an outbreak in 1943 and we have police records from that time since the burial was not properly done.

Since those outbreaks we are investigating every year a large number of suspect anthrax cases all over Sweden since the awareness among farmers and vets is high. This was the case this November [2013] as well -- the farmer called his vet and she suspected anthrax immediately when examining the dead cow, contacted us, and samples were promptly sent for laboratory confirmation.

After a visit to the farm in question this past Monday [4 Nov 2013] my colleagues could not verify any of the hypotheses we had. The spread by water was excluded since this is a drained wetland area, the farm is located up-stream and the drainage pipes are underground. A narrow canal divides the land from the wetland bird sanctuary area where the 2011 outbreak took place.

The vaccination area in 2011 was decided to encompass all land that could be flooded under the spring rise or bad weather since that outbreak was waterborne. In 2011 there were more than 20 deaths and some of the dead cows were found along the canal. Although the places where the dead animals had been lying were sanitized and (contaminated) earth removed it is regarded as an infected area. This includes the ditch although it was filled. So maybe a roe dear picked up the infection there and happened to die on the other side of the canal. Or maybe a bird of prey dropped an infected carcass/piece of carcass there?

I had a question on the possible role of wild boar in general, and I passed it on to Susanna Sternberg Lewerin and Dolores Gavier Widen and in summary our conclusion is -- based on a chapter where you are acknowledged -- since wild boar is rooting the soil it is possible that it can play a role in the epidemiology and it makes sense, but nothing is published on it as far as we know. Wild boar are less susceptible to infection.

The farmer has been asked to check the grounds more thoroughly for old carcasses. We haven't got any information back yet. So maybe we will never know?

The animals grazing on this land will be vaccinated for 5 years.

If you have any suggestions we would very much appreciate them.

[Professor Elvander rightly took exception to my suggestion that the farmer concerned may not have been conscientious in reporting any dead animals. Whatever I might think of some of the ranchers and officials I have to deal with elsewhere I was patently wrong in relation to hers for which I deeply apologise. My only excuse is lack of Scandinavian experience. Also, all too often the reports we see are very brief and lack any depth. And in the absence of information one tends to expect the worst, because that is too often what we see with this disease.

Something I have learnt the hard way: Within the 1st 40 minutes of starting an investigation on a farm or whatever, you will have seen the answer. The problem is it can sometimes take 1-2 years to recognise it. My fastest was 10 minutes in Bangladesh, but that's another story. My point is, the answer is on the farm, somewhere.

Scavengers defaecate spores -- well described -- but even if a crow had flown over from the 2011 farm, why did it take 2 years to reveal itself, during which time the faecal mass would have disintegrated and the remaining spores would be at a low density. Cows are curious creatures and any smelly bit from a carcass would have been quickly investigated with possible lethal consequences, not 2 years later.

Feral pigs and wild boar: yes, they scavenge and wander, and are fairly resistant. They could have rooted with their snouts across an old forgotten grave.

Out-of-sight dead deer that wandered across from the 2011 area to die this side: possible.

Latent infection dating from 2011: not impossible but a 2 year interval is much longer than we would expect. Plus there would have to have been some recent stressful event to reduce the infected cow's innate resistance. Summer heat is what we usually target, not autumn cold nights, which she would have sailed through in the previous autumns.

The way to find old forgotten cattle graves is to go out after it has rained and look for pools of standing water, minimally 1 m x 2 m (3 ft x 6 ft), this being the minimum area of grave needed to take a cow carcass. When the carcass decomposes the column of earth over it shifts downwards leaving a shallow sunken area, which can be invisible unless filled with rainwater. Then take soil samples from it, and process them using the Fasanella GABRI (ground anthrax bacillus refined isolation) technique.

Any insights from our members are welcome. - Mod.MHJ
