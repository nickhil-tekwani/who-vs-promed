Two more suspected deaths of children from Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Two more children are suspected to have died from hand, foot and mouth
disease in Singapore. The 2 were a 14-month old girl and her
two-and-a-half-year old brother, who died on Sat 30 Sep 2000. The
Environment Ministry said they were admitted to KK's Women's and Children's
Hospital on Thu 28 Sep 2000 with fever, rash and vomiting. The children's
other 5-year old brother, who [was also admitted to KK Hospital, is in a
stable condition. [He also is suspected to be suffering from hand, foot and
mouth disease.
The Ministry said post mortem investigations were underway. But as a
precautionary measure against the spread of the disease, the Ministry said
all kindergartens, child-care centres and children enrichment centres would
be closed for between one week and 10 days beginning from Mon 3 Oct 2000.
Earlier this month, a 2-year old child was suspected to have died from the
disease, resulting in a 10-day closure of his play-school, the Cutie Kids
Playhouse in Sengkang.
