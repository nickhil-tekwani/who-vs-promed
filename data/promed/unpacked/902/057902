The Hopkins County Health Department (Kentucky) is advising you to wash your hands and to fully cook your meat after a salmonellosis outbreak. Officials confirm the outbreak after one person died on Wed 18 Sep 2013. Health officials say there have been 7 confirmed cases. Of 6, 4 people were hospitalized. One has died.

The Health Department says it started the investigation on Tue 17 Sep 2013. It says it could take a few weeks. Officials are unsure whether the outbreak is caused by contaminated food or is animal related. Investigators will be attempting to link the cases together with food diaries and interviewing the affected persons.

Denise Beach with the Hopkins County Health Department says symptoms are fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. "People want to be really good about hand washing. They need to make sure that food is cooked to proper temperatures, especially meat and eggs. They need to make sure all the cutting boards, countertops, utensils are cleaned," Beach said.

She says if you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor immediately.
