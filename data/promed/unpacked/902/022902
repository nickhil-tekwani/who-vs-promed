BTV serotype 16 is widely distributed in the mediterranean basin. Today, in
Italy, seroconversion is present in Calabria and Sicily. Serotype 16 was
detected in Sardinia during the fall of 2003.

[Professor Fadda is gratefully acknowledged for his repeated, authoritative
information. We should all be reminded that the ProMED-mail systems works
best -- in fact depends on -- a 2-way flow of information. This is a
excellent example of how the control of infectious diseases is leveraged by
our mutual global, electronic connection. Additionally, further resources
and information, for those interested, are presented below by ProMED-mail
expert moderator AS. - Mod PC]
[5 BTV serotypes have been identified since 1998 in southern Europe: BTV 1,
2, 4, 9, and 16. A map showing their geographical distribution in the
Mediterranean basin, produced by the Instituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G. Caporale", Teramo, Italy (IZS), can be seen at:
<http://www.izs.it/bluetongue/mappab1.gif>.
According to the map, BTV 16 has so far been identified in Europe in Greece
and Italy. The 1st incursion of BTV 16 to (southeastern) Europe was
reported from Greece in 1999. No seroconversions (of any BTV serotype) in
sentinel bovines were recorded in Greece during 2002 or probably also
during 2003; see abstract A10, Nomikou et al, 3rd International Bluetongue
Symposium, Taormina, October 2003 (page 23):
<http://www.bluetonguesymposium.it/abstract_book.pdf>.
Antibodies against BTV 16 were reportedly identified for the 1st time in
Italy on 31 Jul 2003 in Puglia in sentinel animals (see 20030923.2399).
The most recent official BT-related reports from European countries have
come from Italy, France, and Spain. Italy reported to the OIE (19 Sep 2003)
about the identification of BTV 4 in Sardinia. France reported (14 Nov
2003) BTV 4 in Corsica. Spain reported (16 ­ 18 Dec 2003) BTV 4 in Menorca
island.
Early reporting on the dynamics of BTV serotypes is helpful to the
international animal-health community. ­ Mod AS]
