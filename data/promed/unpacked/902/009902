Anthrax in a pig has been reported in the Voronezh region. The
diagnosis was confirmed in the Voronezh regional veterinary
laboratory. The pig carcass has been burnt, and anti-epizootic
measures have been applied. The causes of this case are under
investigation. The last anthrax case in the Voronezh region was
registered in 1964.

This farm has been placed under quarantine. There are 600 head of
livestock on the affected pig-breeding farm. All livestock at the
affected farm has been vaccinated; livestock in the neighbouring zone
has been vaccinated as well. During the inspection specialists
collected samples of soil, forage, litter, etc.

Farm workers have also been examined. At present all workers are
healthy. No new anthrax cases have been noted at the farm.

[Anthrax has been registered among animals recently in the Voronezh
region. For example, in 2005 veterinarians found anthrax virus in the
pork brought for sale on the Liski city market. No infection was found
in 5 persons who handled this meat. In 2006 in the Podgorensky area
anthrax was diagnosed in a slaughtered pig. - Corr.BA]

[We have seen such outbreaks before in Veronezh; see below. With 600
head it is a commercial pig farm, and in such cases they are using
commercial pig feed. If the feed company is not careful where
they get their bone meal from, there will be outbreaks especially if
the feed is in any way abrasive. Soft pig feed will go straight
through even if it contains anthrax spores. To vaccinate livestock on
surrounding farms is very wise as other farms will have received
contaminated pig and dairy feeds. - Mod MHJ]

involved pigs (not cattle), and was misnumbered as (02).
