Rabbit hem. dis. virus, possible arthropod vectors 971002094323]
In response to a request for further information regarding possible
Australian arthropod vectors that may be transmitting RHD virus (called
rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) virus in Australia), I can provide the
following information.
Our current view is that insects are the main means of natural spread of
RCDV. The 300 km or so spread from Wardang Island to Yunta and the
Flinders Ranges in South Australia over a period of a few weeks and then
the rapid spread to other regions of Australia over the succeeding months
was a reasonable indication that insects were important and, although some
later spreading may have been deliberate, the magnitude of the event
suggested that spread by people in four-wheel-drives was a minor component.
Scavenging by mammals and birds may also play a part by opening carcasses
and exposing large amounts of virus in blood and organs to flies. There
appears to be very little virus shed by infected rabbits prior to death and
most virus is found in the liver and blood. Some virus is found in urine
in animals found dead and this could also be a source (Gelmetti _et al_.
1992, J. Appl. Rabbit Res. 15: 1435-1471). Also after animals die there is
frequently blood stained fluid coming from the nasal cavity, which is
presumably a post mortem change and probably contains a great deal of
virus. This could serve as a source of virus for flies feeding on an
unopened carcass. Contact spread may play a role in spreading virus in
warrens. As the virus can retain infectivity after traversing the
alimentary tract of dogs (del Carmen Simon _et al_. 1994, Rec Med Vet, 170:
841-845) it may also be able to retain infectivity through avian predators
and scavengers, allowing a wider dispersal of virus, although this has not
been investigated.
A number of insect species have been shown to transmit the disease in the
laboratory and, with other species, have sometimes been found in the field
to be contaminated with virus. In the laboratory, a species of mosquito
commonly found in association with rabbits and a major vector of myxoma
virus (_Culex annulirostris_), the European rabbit flea (_Spilopsyllus
cuniculi_), the Spanish rabbit flea (_Xenopsylla cunicularis_) and the
Australian bush fly (_Musca vetustissima_) have been shown to be capable of
transmitting the virus.
In the case of the mosquito, 100 female _C. annulirostris_ were allowed a
brief interrupted feed from the ear or shaven flank of a RCD virus-infected
rabbit 16 and 20 hours post infection (p.i.). Mosquitoes were transferred
to two susceptible rabbits and allowed to continue feeding. Both acceptor
rabbits died of RCD 42 and 52 hours p.i. Virus (strictly speaking, viral
genomes) was also found in mosquitoes by PCR. Regarding the fleas, 100
Spanish or 100 European rabbit fleas were allow to feed on an infected
rabbit from 16 hours p.i. until death. For each species of flea, fleas
were transferred to two
susceptible rabbits and both died of RCD within 4 days. Again, virus could
be found in the fleas by PCR. There is no evidence that the virus
replicates in these insect species and it is proposed that transmission is
mechanical. There is no information on how long virus will persist on or
in these insects. In these experiments the insects were transferred from
infecteds to susceptibles within a few hours (Lenghaus _et al._, 1994, in
"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease: issues in assessment and control", Munro and
Williams eds. Bureau of Resource Sciences, Canberra. 104-129).
With bush flies, the experimental design was somewhat different because of
the biology of the species. The bush fly breeds mainly in cattle and horse
dung in outback Australia and each summer and autumn migrate from their
breeding grounds to cover most areas of Australia. They feed on secretions
from eyes and mouth of man and animals to obtain moisture and the protein
required for egg laying. They will also obtain moisture and protein from
carcasses. They are not biting insects like fleas or mosquitoes although,
like a number of other flies, they do have prestomal "teeth" surrounding
the prestomal cavity and they can utilise these to scrape surfaces,
sometimes resulting in the sensation of a "bite". In laboratory
experiments, different groups of approximately 20 food and water-deprived
bush flies were allowed access to infected rabbits at different times after
inoculation and later to unopened and opened carcasses. After various
times, flies were transferred to susceptible rabbits. Although there were
complications with the experiment in that at early times flies were allowed
[to remain in contact] too long with infected rabbits which made them less
interested in feeding on the susceptible rabbits, the experiments clearly
showed that transmission could occur from rabbit carcasses both intact and
opened but not from the living infected rabbits (CSIRO Divisions of Animal
Health and Wildlife and Ecology, 1997, Field evaluation of RCD under
quarantine. Project CS.236 report. Meat Research Corporation, Sydney).
Direct evidence of insect transmission in the field has not been possible
but evidence from PCRs done on insects trapped in the field have shown that
a number of insect species become contaminated with virus (CSIRO Divisions
of Animal Health and Wildlife and Ecology, 1997, Field evaluation of RCD
under quarantine. Project CS.236 report. Meat Research Corporation,
Sydney). In one case it was shown that the virus was viable. Species that
have been shown to be contaminated with virus in the field are:
_Musca vetustissima_ bush fly
_Calliphora stygia_ large brown blowfly
_Calliphora novica_ and _C.augur_ lesser brown blowflies
_Chrysomyia rufifacies_ secondary green blowfly
_Chrysomyia varipes_ small green blowfly
(positive by inoculation into rabbits)
_Aedes postspinaculosis_ mosquito
_Aedes notoscriptus_ mosquito
It is becoming clear that the virus contaminates a wide range of insect
species in the field and there is no doubt that the list will grow. Again,
there is no evidence that there is an intrinsic cycle in any of these insects.
Although all these insects have been found to be contaminated this does not
mean that they are important or even involved in transmission.
Experimental transmission in the laboratory shows the potential for the two
fleas, the mosquito _C. annulirostris_, and the bush fly to be important in
the field. The blowflies pose a different problem. It is not surprising
that they become contaminated in the field but can they transmit? One
possibility is that they leave their faeces or regurgitated gut contents on
vegetation which could be consumed by rabbits (B. Cooke, pers comm.). The
virus is infectious by the oral route. With bush flies it is perhaps
easier to see a mechanism of transmission directly from carcasses to the
eye of a rabbit.
The work is continuing on the role of insects in transmission of RCD virus.
It will always be difficult to determine precisely which insects are
involved in any particular transmission event. However, by piecing
together information from virology, entomology and climatology we should be
able to develop a fairly accurate picture.

[We are greatly indebted to Dr. Robinson for going to great lengths to
provide this information and for clearing the air. There has been so much
inaccurate information and even anti-governmental nonsense that it is like
a breath of fresh air to have someone provide such an authoritative,
professional report. Niall Byrne had been sending us information but he is
now manning the Australian Animal Health Laboratory Rabbit Calicivirus
Homepage and has been busy. This report by Dr. Robinson is a clear effort
by the Australian Government to provide data, although there will
inevitably be some who will find it otherwise. ProMED-mail readers need
not be concerned that they will be burdened with postings from these
people. We assume that some of the results of studies of RHDV in Australia
are not in the public domain or are simply incomplete; we cannot or will
not report these. We also assume that in the near future CSIRO
(Commonwealth Scientific Research and Industrial Organization, if memory
serves) will provide a summary of results regarding these fascinating
experiments to rid Australia of an insufferable pest. I expect such
reviews would be sent to scientific journals and not to ProMED-
mail, which is as it should be. -- Mod CHC]
