Fear and anguish prevails at Kalala village [Barnala district, Punjab state] as the majority of the inhabitants have tested positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The village has a population of 2358 living in 428 houses. The health department has taken 41 samples, 28 of which have been found positive.

In December 2012, in a medical camp, 370 people out of 870 were found to be hepatitis C positive. Going by that ratio, the actual number of infected people might be in the range of 800 to 1000. HCV has taken the lives of 25 people of the village. The village has no clinical laboratory or government dispensary. Health facilities are virtually non-existent in the village. Most of the newly elected panchayat [village council] members are victims of the dreaded disease.

Recently a blood donation camp was organised in the village by Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana; 90 units were donated by villagers. Of these, 28 units were found to be HCV positive. A 24 year old villager said he had lost his grandfather, father, and uncle to HCV. Now he, his sister, and cousin are infected. The treatment cost is over INR 200 000 (about USD 3400), so few can afford treatment.

HCV was identified in 1989. The World Health Organization (WHO) compares HCV to a "viral time bomb". HCV is responsible for 50-76 per cent of all liver cancer cases worldwide. In 2010, 98 hepatitis C cases were reported from Kalala, Chananwal, Chinniwal, and Sehjra villages. Recently, 13 cases have been reported from Kube village. These villages are in close proximity. The villagers still say unhygienic water is responsible for the epidemic. Health authorities have not made villagers aware not to use contaminated and unsterilised needles, the main source of HCV.

Civil surgeon Dr Renu passed the buck on to unregistered RMPs [rural medical practioners?], holding them responsible for re-using syringes, making people vulnerable to infections. However, she failed to answer why her department had not taken action against such RMPs so far. Such outbreaks are required to be notified to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project immediately by the health department. The civil surgeon said she was not aware of the previous outbreaks since she joined only 4 months ago. "We are instructing the civil surgeon to take effective steps and refer patients to Government Medical College, Patiala, and the PGI [Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research] in Chandigarh. The civil surgeon is also being asked to take action against unregistered RMPs," said deputy commissioner Indu Malhotra.

[The extent of hepatitis C virus infection in Kalala village is exceptional. According to WHO (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html), hepatitis C is found worldwide, with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. Hepatitis C is not a waterborne infection as believed by the Kalala villagers. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needlestick injuries in health care settings; injection drug use; or by being born to a hepatitis C infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water, or by casual contact with an infected person.

About 75-85 per cent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection and 60-70 per cent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 per cent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C.

Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not widely available globally, it is not always well tolerated, some virus genotypes respond better to interferon than others, and many people who take interferon do not finish their treatment. This means that while hepatitis C is generally considered to be a curable disease, for many people this is not a reality.

Scientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies (involving combined use of interferon and ribavirin). However, these drugs are too expensive for widespread use.
