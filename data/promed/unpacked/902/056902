Hong Kong: contact tracing and diagnostic testing at Caritas Medical Center
-------------------------------------------------
The staff of the Hong Kong Center for Health Protection (CHP) of the
Department of Health has performed contact tracing on over 300 health care
workers, their home contacts, visitors, and patients discharged from the
pediatrics wards of the Caritas Medical Center (CMC).
Among those contacts who reported fever and respiratory symptoms, 2 were
health care workers who have now recovered, and 4 were discharged patients
from the pediatrics ward. The latter are admitted to isolation wards of
Princess Margaret Hospital in stable condition. Laboratory tests for 3 of
the discharged patients showed adenovirus in 2 and parainfluenza type 3 in
one. Adenovirus and parainfluenza virus are common viruses in the
community. The CHP along with the Hospital Authority are now closely
monitoring the situation and the implementation of infection control
measures in CMC.
As of Saturday noon [20 Nov 2004], a total of 34 children -- 20 boys and 14
girls, aged between 4 and 17 -- have been involved in an outbreak of
respiratory illness at the Developmental Disabilities Unit of Caritas
Medical Center. No new cases have been reported in CMC in the past 24
hours. Laboratory tests performed at the University of Hong Kong have
earlier produced positive results for parainfluenza virus (type 4)
infection in some clinical specimens. Tests on more samples are under way.

[The identification of the agent responsible for the outbreak of
respiratory disease at the Caritas Medical Center remains uncertain. Human
parainfluenza virus 3 (identified in a single contact) is now ranked by the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as a member of the
genus _Respirovirus_, whereas human parainfluenza virus 4 (identified in a
minority of specimens at the Caritas Medical Center) has been designated a
species of the genus _Rubualvirus_, the type species of which is mumps
virus. The viruses identified in the screening of contacts, adenovirus and
human parainfluenza virus 3, are viruses that are ubiquitous in the general
population and not necessarily related to the outbreak at the Caritas
Medical Center. Human parainfluenza virus 3 is 2nd only to respiratory
syncytial virus as a cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and
young children. Reinfection can occur throughout life, the elderly and the
immunocompromised being at greater risk of serious complications. Infection
with human parainfluenza virus 3 is usually seasonal in temperate climates,
with outbreaks occurring predominantly in autumn. Human parainfluenza virus
3 spreads efficiently, and, by age 5, almost all children will show
serological evidence of past infection. Hence, firm diagnosis of human
parainfluenza virus 3 infection depends on isolation of infectious virus.
Because reinfection can occur throughout life, despite the presence of
neutralizing antibodies, nosocomial infection is common in both children
and adults. More detailed information on the outcome of current diagnostic
testing is awaited. - Mod.CP]
