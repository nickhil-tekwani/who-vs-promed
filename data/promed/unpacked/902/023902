More Than 400 Fall Ill On Hawaii Cruise Ship
---------------------------------------------------------
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) said about a 6th of the 2500 passengers
on board its Pride Of Hawaii cruise ship became sick this week [5-9
Nov 2007]. The passengers fell ill with the stomach flu after leaving
Honolulu Harbor Monday [5 Nov 2007].NCL said it is telling its
passengers booked on its next cruise about the outbreak so they have
the option of not sailing if they are not comfortable. Operators of
buses and cabs who handle passengers of the cruise line were notified
about the problem on Friday [2 Nov 2007].

NCL sent out a memo saying, "To prevent an occurrence of the Norwalk
virus infection [_Norwalk virus_ is the type species of the genus
_Norovirus_ , family _Caliciviridae_. Norwalk viru and its relatives
are a heterogeneous group of viruses responsible for sudden onset
gastroenteritis in humans and similar disease in livestock. -
Mod.CP], NCL would recommend that all motor coaches and tour
equipment utilized by Pride of Hawaii and Pride of Aloha passengers
be sanitized prior to and after each excursion." On Friday afternoon
[9 Nov 2007], NCL said the outbreak has been confined to just the one
ship [i.e., the Pride of Hawaii]. It said the "Pride of Aloha" and
"Pride of America" are not affected.

NCL is not required to notify the state Department of Health when
there is an outbreak. Because of federal jurisdiction its
notification extends to the Food and Drug Administration and Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.

State health officials said they were contacted Friday [9 Nov 2007]
to run lab tests for the company. The tests would confirm if it is
the Norwalk virus or some other type of illness.

NCL said it is cleaning and disinfecting all its buses on all islands
and is asking all its tour operators to do the same. Passengers
onboard the Pride of Hawaii were not allowed to disembark in Maui on
Wednesday [7 Nov 2007]. The company said it was not because of the
outbreak; it was due to an oil spill clean up in Kahului. The ship
apparently spent the day at sea and then diverted to Kona. It arrived
in Maui on Friday [9 Nov 2007] and is expected to continue on to Kauai.

Passengers who became ill with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were
asked along with their cabinmates to remain quarantined in their
rooms for 24 hours. NCL said it is giving those passengers a USD
200.00 on-ship credit.

[Outbreaks of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis have been
frequent, particularly during winter months in the Northern
hemisphere and have been designated accordingly "winter-vomiting
disease." Outbreaks occur frequently in closed communities such as
schools, health care centres, hotels and prisons on land and in naval
ships and cruise liners on the seas. Because of the antigenic and
genetic heterogeneity of noroviruses, recovery from a recent bout of
norovirus-associated gastroenteritis may not confer protection
against a subsequent infection.

ProMed-mail will not routinely post reports of outbreaks on cruise
ships because of their frequent occurrence, but will post a few to
serve as a reminder of perils on the seas. However, the companies
operating cruise ships have a good record in containing outbreaks and
decontaminating their ships between cruises. - Mod.CP]
