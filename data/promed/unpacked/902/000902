98/208 Tomato geminiviruses in Brazil
Tomato golden mosaic geminivirus was reported in Brazil more than 20 years
ago, but until recently tomato-infecting geminiviruses had no economic
significance. Since 1994, a sharp increase of geminivirus-like symptoms has
been observed in several areas in Brazil. This occurred simultaneously with
the appearance of the B biotype of _Bemisia tabaci_ (EPPO A2 quarantine
pest).
Geminiviruses have been isolated from symptomatic tomato plants in the
Federal District, two different areas of Minas Gerais and in Pernambuco.
These plants showed a variety of symptoms (e.g. yellow mosaic, severe leaf
distortion, downward leaf curling and epinasty). Whitefly populations were
high in all sampled fields. In some fields, and particularly in Pernambuco,
incidence of symptoms was close to 100% and no tomato of commercial value
could be harvested. By using molecular techniques (PCR and comparison of
amplified fragment sequences), it was felt that at least six different
geminiviruses were present. These viruses are most closely related to
tomato golden mosaic, bean golden mosaic and tomato yellow vein streak
geminiviruses. However, homologies were less than 80 % for the fragments
compared. Further studies are needed on the biological and molecular
characterization of these geminiviruses
