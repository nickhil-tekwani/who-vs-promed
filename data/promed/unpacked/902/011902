South Australians (SA) are being reminded to be aware of symptoms of meningococcal disease after an influx of cases were reported to SA Health in recent weeks. So far this year [2014], 20 cases of meningococcal infections have been reported with 8 of those occurring since September.

Chief Public Health Officer Dr Stephen Christley said while the disease was usually rare, numbers increased when more respiratory infections were around. "As we have experienced increased numbers of cases in the past few weeks we're asking the general public to be aware of the symptoms of meningococcal disease and seek medical advice is necessary," he said. "Symptoms of meningococcal infection may include fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and sore muscles, followed in some cases by a rash of red and purple spots. Babies or young children with meningococcal infection may also be fretful, refuse feeds or be difficult to wake."

Dr Christley said meningococcal bacteria were carried in the nose and throat of about 10 per cent of the population, but the bacteria were usually harmless. "The bacteria are spread from person to person through close contact, but only a very small number of people develop meningococcal disease," he said. "With all cases of meningococcal infection, SA Health will identify people who may have been in contact with the patient to provide them with information." A Meningococcal Australia spokesperson recommended people keep vaccinations up-to-date and act quickly if they suspected someone had contracted the disease.

"Meningococcal disease, while rare, is a disease that can lead to death in less than 24 hours," the spokesperson said.

"Around 5 to 10 percent of those who contract meningococcal disease will not survive and 20 percent of survivors are left with permanent disabilities that range from learning difficulties, sight or hearing problems, loss of fingers, toes and limbs, and scarring from skin grafts."

[Maps of Australia can be seen at http://www.ga.gov.au/image_cache/GA4073.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2799732,286. South Australia is a state in the southern central part of Australia, with a population of 1 650 600 in 2012. A majority of the state's population (77.1 percent) resides within Greater Adelaide's metropolitan area (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia).

With 20 cases of meningococcal disease so far this year (2014) in South Australia, the incidence rate is 1.21 per 100 000. However, the news report above fails to tell us the incidence rates in prior years for comparison and we are not told the serogroups involved. We are also not told if any outbreaks of meningococcal disease contributed to the total number of cases in South Australia. (In the US, only about 2 percent of cases of meningococcal disease occurs as part of an outbreak.) Outbreaks can occur in communities, schools, colleges, prisons, and other populations and are usually caused by the same or closely related strains. More information concerning the epidemiological findings concerning the cases of meningococcal disease in South Australia would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

For Australia as a whole, the incidence of meningococcal disease declined from about 700 cases in 2001 to 208 laboratory-confirmed cases in 2012 (incidence rate 0.88 per 100 000), the lowest annual total incidence since surveillance data was collated (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf). The conjugate meningococcal C vaccine was introduced into the National Immunisation Program in 2003. Since 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34 percent of cases in 2003 to 5.7 percent in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60 percent in 2003 to 83 percent in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf).

According to the annual reports of the Australian Meningococcal Surveillance Programme, the number of cases of meningococcal disease in South Australia fluctuated each year, from 13 to 24, of which the percent due to serogroup B ranged from 64 in 2001 to 96 in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-annlrpt-menganrep.htm).

For comparison, in the US, prior to 2000, an estimated 1400 to 2800 cases of meningococcal disease occurred each year, with an incidence rate of 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000 population. Since 2000, the incidence of meningococcal disease has decreased (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/mening.pdf). There are now fewer than 1000 cases reported each year (http://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/surveillance/index.html). - Mod.ML]
