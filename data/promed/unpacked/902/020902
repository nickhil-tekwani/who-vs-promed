Franklin Vergara, Minister of Health, confirmed the death of a child
aged 9 months due to Venezuelan equine encephalitis in Darien. This
disease occurs in both humans and horses and is manifested by a fever,
which causes neurological complications. It is transmitted by
mosquitoes.

It was learned that 2 other children remain in intensive care at
Children's Hospital. Vergara explained that although this is usually
not a deadly virus, in cases where the patient has some degree of
malnutrition, the disease may cause death.

[2 cases in horses occurred in Darien on 6 May 2010, but were only
reported officially on 6 June 2010 -- see ProMED archive below. The
mosquito-borne virus of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE --
technically Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis) is endemic in Central
America and the northern part of South America and poses a risk to
travelers to the infected area. The reservoirs are wild rodents and
opossums. There are vaccines for horses, but no vaccine for either
disease has been approved for humans except for laboratory workers and
the military.

There is a good up-dated review of VEE disease on Medscape:
