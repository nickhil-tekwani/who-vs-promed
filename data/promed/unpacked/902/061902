The State Health Secretariat of Piaui (SESAPI) confirmed this Friday [8 Feb 2019] the occurrence of another human case of neurological disease in the state caused by West Nile virus. (WNV). The case is a young man resident of the rural zone of Picos, who suffered from acute flaccid muscle paralysis in 2017. The patient was admitted to the University Hospital of the UFPI in Piaui, where the standard protocol for the diagnosis of neuroinvasive diseases issued by SESAPI was applied; he received treatment and recovered completely. The tests were conducted at the time, but the Ministry of Health released the results only in early 2019, indicating the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the virus in the patient's blood.

The 1st and, until then, only case of West Nile fever in Piaui had occurred in August 2014, corresponding to a cowboy from the city of Aroeiras do Itaim, Piaui. In fact, it was the 1st case of the disease in the country. At the time, tests on birds and equines of the region indicated that these animals also had contact with the virus. To date, examinations of 32 other suspected human cases in the state have resulted as "undetermined." In April 2018, WNV was detected in the brain of sick and dead horses with neurological symptoms in the state of Espirito Santo, but without confirmation of human cases in that state.

West Nile fever can be transmitted to humans through the bite of mosquitoes infected with the virus acquired from infected (wild) migrating birds. There is no transmission through interhuman contact or through contact with horses. Most infected individuals have no symptoms, and cases of neurological impairment are exceptional. Preventive measures are similar to those against dengue, Zika, and chikungunya [viruses]. Since 2014, the state of Piaui has intensively monitored cases of neurological disease and tests all suspected cases reported for the disease, both in the public and private hospital network.

[West Nile virus (WNV) was 1st reported in South America in equine animals in Colombia in 2004 and in 2006 in horses in Argentina, 5 and 7 years, respectively, after it was introduced into the Americas in New York in 1999. As mentioned above, the 1st reported case of neurological WN in Piaui state was in 2014. The virus has been detected in other parts of Brazil. Interestingly, WN virus antibodies have been shown to be present in horses from 4 ranches of southern Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul state (see archives below). In a more extensive follow-up study, WNV-seropositive equines were detected in 10 ranches.

A comparative analysis of the genome of the WNV circulating in Piaui state, or other localities in Brazil, to compare with North American or Caribbean isolates would be very interesting and epidemiologically valuable. Health authorities in the state are to be congratulated for their surveillance and tests of human patients with neurological disease.

The health officials of SESAPI are thanked for sending in this report to ProMED-mail. - Mod.TY
