Scientists report the 1st cases of foot disease for endangered huemul deer in Chilean Patagonia in a study led by the Wildlife Conservation Society and the University of California, Davis' One Health Institute, with partnering institutions in Chile and the United States.

In the study, published [17 Apr 2019] in the journal PLOS ONE [see reference below], researchers found foot lesions in 24 huemul deer in Chile's Bernardo O'Higgins National Park between 2005 and 2010. The park remains one of the few strongholds for the species, which lives in the rugged mountainous terrain of southern Argentina and Chile.

The foot disease causes severe pain, swelling, partial or complete loss of the hoof, and in many cases, death. Affected animals become unable to move and forage, leaving them susceptible to starvation and predation.

Researchers identified parapoxvirus as the likely cause of the disease. About 40 percent of the 24 affected deer died, suggesting the virus could pose a considerable conservation threat to the already vulnerable species.

"We knew that deer were getting sick and dying from this disease for many years, but we didn't know what was causing it," said corresponding author Marcela Uhart, a wildlife veterinarian with the UC Davis One Health Institute and director of the Latin America Program within UC Davis' Karen C Drayer Wildlife Health Center. "We're really excited that we found a potential cause for this disease. Now we need to learn from it so we can be better prepared to help this species."

Iconic species
--------------
Culturally iconic, the huemul deer appears alongside the condor on Chile's coat of arms and symbolizes biodiversity in the region.

While only about 2500 remain in the wild today, huemul deer were once widespread in Patagonian forests. Then, in the 19th century, habitat loss, poaching, and livestock disease began contributing to their decline. Today, the huemul deer is the most endangered deer in South America.

"Considering the critical situation of huemul deer, this finding is a significant 1st step toward identifying and implementing solutions," said lead author Alejandro Vila, the Scientific Director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Chile. "We will continue to work closely with all relevant stakeholders for the recovery of this flagship species."

Cattle considerations
---------------------
The lab analysis provided some indication that this disease may have originated with livestock, as well, but more research is needed to confirm. Parapoxvirus DNA present in the sample was highly associated with bovine viruses.

Three-quarters of the deer affected by the foot disease were found in the Huemules Valley, where cattle were introduced in 1991 before being removed in 2004. The remaining quarter of affected deer were found in the more isolated Bernardo and Katraska Valleys, which were always free of cattle and had no cases of the foot disease until 6 sick deer were found between 2008 and 2010.

Better monitoring could help
----------------------------
The study said a better system for monitoring the population, collecting high-quality samples, and ensuring their delivery for lab analysis could help researchers, land managers, and wildlife veterinarians more quickly identify problems huemul deer face and find ways to help them.

"It's very rare to link an endangered species with the cause of a disease," Uhart said. "Disease is one reason this species is not doing well. A collaborative framework that involves the different stakeholders can help us put the right pieces in place to diagnose and help the species."

Such a framework requires collaboration among academic institutions, non-governmental organizations and government agencies, the authors emphasize.

"We are very pleased with the outcome of this collaborative investigation," said Alejandra Silva, Regional Director of the National Forestry Service (CONAF) for Magallanes and Antarctica. "Given how complex it is to work in remote and isolated locations and the costs involved in pursuing sophisticated diagnostics, we recognize the value of partnering with academia and the non-governmental sector to solve problems threatening our wild species."

Additional coauthors for the study include Cristobal Briceno of University of Chile; Denise McAloose and Tracie Seimon from Wildlife Conservation Society in New York; Anibal Armien from University of Minnesota; Nicholas Be from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Elizabeth Mauldin and James Thissen from University of Pennsylvania; Manuel Quezada from University of Concepcion in Chile; and Ana Hinojosa, Jose Paredes, Ivan Avendano, and Alejandra Silva from CONAF [National Forest Corporation] in Chile.

The study received financial support from CONAF, Michel Durand, Weeden Foundation, Agnes Gundt, Wuppertal Zoo and the Wildlife Conservation Society.

[Borrowing from that work: "The huemul deer (_Hippocamelus bisulcus_) is a medium-sized neotropical cervid that is endemic to shrubby habitats and forests in southern Argentina and Chile. Huemul were the most widespread species in Patagonian forests until the 19th century, but since that time their range and populations have markedly declined. Contributing factors include habitat loss, poaching, competition with introduced ungulates and susceptibility to livestock diseases."

The genus _Parapoxvirus_ (family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae) comprises several members: orf virus (OV), bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV), pseudocowpox virus (PCPV), and parapox of red deer in New Zealand virus (PVNZ). The viral DNA found in this study was closely aligned with 2 species in the parapoxvirus genus, BPSV, and PCPV, which are mainly found in cattle. The interagency collaborative efforts that have been implemented to achieve this important new information are very valuable for the conservation of this cervid. It is important that they are continued and reinforced, enhancing, and expanding the monitoring activities, and carrying out new studies that shed light on the determinants and consequences of this virus-deer interaction. Additional efforts should include surveys and active surveillance in livestock inhabiting the region. - Mod.PMB
