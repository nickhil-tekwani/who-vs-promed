Two more kindergarten-age children have been diagnosed with yersiniosis in
Krasnoyarsk and the total number of cases is now 141. 22 children and 2
adults are still in hospital.

The 1st cohort of children from a summer camp was hospitalized on 20 Jun
2008. The next mass outbreak of yersiniosis among children from another
summer camp was registered on 23 Jun 2008 and in another outbreak that
began on 27 Jun 2008, 11 children from a kindergarten were hospitalized.

[In a week, the number of reported cases increased 10 per cent, since by 8
Jul 2008 there were 128 people and now there are 141 cases. - Mod.NR

The clinical features in these cases are not stated. Infection with
_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis with reservoirs in many
animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer, and various birds.

Most individuals affected are children or young adults. The commonest
presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis, with fever, and
right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be confused with acute
appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which has been
described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a reactive
arthritis or erythema nodosum.

Although many associations had been previously made, one of the strongest
studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and food was
published in 2004 from Finland (1). The editorial commentary (2) with the
paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of infections
associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection with this
bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from lymph node or
stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but cross-reactions are found
between yersiniae and other enteric organisms, including some salmonellas.
