Re: [I believe the great apes are capable of catching & killing small
antelope, so this could be the missing link in the infection chain.
Can anyone confirm? - Mod.JW
Yes, chimpanzees are known to cooperatively hunt and kill small
antelope. The individual chimpanzee in custody of the carcass then
shares out the flesh among the members of the community to which it
belongs. Other individuals beg for tidbits of flesh.
As to gorillas, I cannot recall any report of mammalian flesh
consumption by any of the populations of gorillas. However, gorillas
and chimpanzees are sympatric. Are there any studies of Ebola virus
viability in mosquitos, ticks, fleas, etc.? That is one way that I can
think of the virus being spread among the sympatric great apes --
blood feeding across species by arthropods. Otherwise, perhaps during
consumption of vegetation there is also a consumption of insects that
feed on the same vegetation as do the great apes -- or simply reside
on the vegetation. Maybe this is a link -- chimpanzees, gorillas, and
duikers are all eating or brushing by the same vegetation (chimpanzees
and gorillas are primarily -- like duikers -- terrestrial quadrupeds).
