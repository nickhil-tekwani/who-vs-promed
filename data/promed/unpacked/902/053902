Three workers at a plastics production facility in a suburb of Baltimore,
Maryland have contracted legionellosis, and one has died. According to
Diane Dwyer, chief epidemiologist for the Maryland Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene, the Department is investigating the air conditioning and
all water systems at the plant but the source of _Legionella_ organisms has
not yet been identified. In the meantime, the building in which the
victims worked has been closed.
In the wake of the investigation authorities have learned of nine cases of
respiratory illness among plant workers including six cases of pneumonia.
At the present time it is unclear whether any of these additional cases are
related to the outbreak of legionellosis.
