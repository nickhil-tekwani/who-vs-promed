The Health Department [at Limbang in the northern region of Sarawak
yesterday issued a statement advising people staying along the Limbang River
banks or those depending on river water for their daily consumption to take
precautionary measures against the possible outbreak of water-borne diseases
including cholera.
Divisional Health Officer Dr Kamarudin bin Lajem said Limbang River had been
contaminated with cholera vibrio. The water samples taken at the jetty of
Medamit bazaar on 8 Mar 1999 were found to be contaminated with the bacteria
which caused diarrhoea, he added.
According to Dr Kamarudin, water samples were collected at various spots in
the area after 15 cases of diarrhoea were detected at Lubok Pasu, SRK Nanga
Medait, Rumah Hassan early this month. He disclosed that two medical teams
consisting of 10 personnel from the department had been despatched to the
infected area.

South Africa is still largely cholera free, although Mpumalanga health
authorities on Tuesday reported a small outbreak of the water-borne disease
in Secunda after a 16-year-old child was hospitalised with severe
dehydration. The child and his family have been quarantined and an epidemic
disease task team has been deployed in the area to test all ground water
sources.

Cholera - Mozambique

Mozambican health authorities announced on Wednesday that a further 45
people died of cholera and 2900 others were diagnosed as suffering from the
disease over the past week as the country struggles to combat the epidemic,
African Eye News Service reported.
The latest fatalities bring to 1711 the number of Mozambicans who died from
the disease since September 1998. The disease claimed 113 people in February
alone. National health deputy director Avertino Barreto said on Wednesday
while 36470 people were diagnosed with cholera over the past six months, the
latest figures indicated the epidemic had stabilised. Barreto said the
government was confident its rural water purification drive would soon start
bringing the number of new infections down. He conceded that new floods in
the country's isolated central provinces might hamper the purification
drive. The floods were also threatening clean water supplies to major urban
centres such as Maputo, Beira and Quelimane. A growing number of diarrhoea
cases initially suspected to be cholera had since been diagnosed as malaria
or dysentery.
"Our only concern now is that provincial authorities in the central
provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado continue to prosecute villagers for
attacking our rural health workers," he said. Mozambican health workers
have repeatedly been stoned and assaulted while chlorinating village water
sources. Villagers accuse the health workers of contaminating and not
purifying the water.

Cholera Africa - Somalia (01)

A total of 157 deaths attributed to cholera were reported from 4679 cases in
central and southern Somalia between 1 Nov 1998 and 25 Feb 1999, the UN
country team (UNCT) reported on Wednesday. The deaths mostly affected
people in the southern regions of Benadir, Bay, Gedo, Lower Juba and Lower
Shabelle, said a UNCT
statement quoting the UN World Health Organisation (WHO).
A cholera epidemic sweeping the drought-stricken Bay region of southern
Somalia has killed nearly 200 people this week, local officials said on
Friday.
Thousands of people in the region have left their homes in recent months to
escape insecurity or to look for water after rains failed late last year,
and are living in makeshift camps with poor sanitation. The worst hit
village was Habal Bar, about 80 km (50 miles) southwest of the regional
capital Baidoa, where 120 people, including 80 children, have died of
cholera in the last four days. A further 68 people, mainly children, have
died in seven other villages around Baidoa in the last few days, officials
said. Religious leaders have advised people not to gather in groups to eat
or talk in an effort to stem the spread of the epidemic, which they said
could get out of hand without help from foreign aid agencies. Frequent and
unpredictable bouts of inter-clan fighting have caused problems for aid
workers trying to work in the Bay region, while Baidoa itself is completely
out of bounds for security reasons.
In the neighboring Gedo region, which has been relatively stable in recent
months, an outbreak of cholera among displaced people camped on the banks of
the Juba River has been brought under control. The United Nations
children's agency UNICEF said it installed chlorinated water tanks in the
camps, and had this week closed its cholera clinic in the town of Bardera
after treating over 1000 patients, of whom 60 died.
