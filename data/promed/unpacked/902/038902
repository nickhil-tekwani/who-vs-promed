An outbreak of avian botulism has led to the death of more than 50 birds at Birkenhead Park.

The RSPCA [Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to -- non-human -- animals] have spent the last 2 days travelling around Merseyside, Cheshire, and Greater Manchester [North West England] collecting both dead and dying birds that have contracted the disease as well as those yet to show clinical signs.

Among the wildfowl to fall victim to the illness at Birkenhead Park are 7 several-month-old cygnets and their parents.

RSPCA Inspector Anthony Joynes described it as a "terrible" and "sad" time and referred to the current operation as a "mercy mission".

He said: "It is not just Birkenhead Park but we've had over 50 birds die there.

"We've been going all over Cheshire and Greater Manchester collecting dead birds -- the wildlife centre in Nantwich is completely overrun with birds with it. It has not been a nice job, it's been like a mercy mission. We are trying to save them but they go downhill really fast. As well as collecting dead birds we've having to end the suffering of others. It's terrible, it's really sad. It will run its course and the animals will recover but it's just really sad," said Inspector Joynes.

"People take white bread to feed the birds which they shouldn't be doing anyway but they throw the bread in and the bag, there are beer can holders everywhere. Maybe this will serve as a push for everyone who visits this beautiful park to take more care of it. It isn't just up to the rangers and the RSPCA, everyone needs to take responsibility for the park and everyone who visits should leave it as it is."

Wirral Council has placed signs around the park's lakes warning people of the outbreak. The authority says it is working closely with the RSPCA and is urging people not to feed the remaining birds as that could exacerbate the problem.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.
