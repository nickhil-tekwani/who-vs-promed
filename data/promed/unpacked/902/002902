Fruit trees in orchards have been damaged by disease and insects in South Pyongan Province. Damage has also been done in North Hwanghae Province. The damage grew serious because of the lack of "disinfectant and insecticide," along with the adverse weather conditions. Authorities told farmers to make their own insecticide using plant-based natural oils, but they're not really effective. [This] has led [the government] to mobilize local people to take measures to prevent further damage.

Other areas of the country facing continued monsoon rains -- including North Pyongan Province, South Hwanghae Province and Gangwon Province -- may have already suffered from disease and pest damage to their crops. Some have even raised concerns that intense rains in the country's breadbasket -- the 2 Hwanghae provinces -- could lead to "disruptions" in food production.

[It is impossible to speculate which particular fruit and/or other crops are affected, but it is highly likely that multiple pathogens are involved. Any insect pests, in addition to their direct crop damage, may also contribute to pathogen spread. Undiagnosed diseases have also been reported recently from vegetable crops in the country (ProMED-mail post 20200727.7614763).

Reliable, preferably molecular diagnosis, is vital to identify potential pathogens and to be able to design effective management strategies for each crop/pathogen situation. This includes recommendations on which agrochemicals, if any, may be expected to show some benefit.
