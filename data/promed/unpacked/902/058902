[In a recent posting - BSE, regulations for risk management - European Union
980327084729 - we assumed that our members would know what a "specified risk
materials (SRMs)" would be. On reconsideration this was a presumption and so
I asked Ralph Blanchfield for a definitive answer. As usual, he kindly
provided the needed information. - Mod.MHJ

>>There is no urgency on this but could you get one of your people to come
up with a list of SRMs so that the ProMED members will have some idea of
what is involved? Thanks!<<
>From the context, I assume that you are referring to SRMs as defined in the
EU Commission's original decision that has been the subject of all the
subsequent shenanigans by some EU Members States!
The original Commission Decision 97/534/EC of 30 July 1997 stated
"specified risk material' shall be defined as follows:
(a) the skull, including the brain and eyes, tonsils and spinal cord of:
-- bovine animals aged over 12 months,
-- ovine and caprine animals which are aged over 12 months or have a
permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum;
(b) the spleens of ovine and caprine animals."
In addition
"The use of the vertebral column of bovine, ovine and caprine animals for
the production of mechanically recovered meat shall be prohibited."
