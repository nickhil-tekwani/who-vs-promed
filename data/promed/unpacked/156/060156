Puzzled scientists are battling to identify why millions of Pacific
oysters are dying in New Zealand waters. Up to half of the juvenile
Pacific oyster stocks in the North Island are thought to have died,
and up to 10 percent of the adults, according to Oyster Industry
Association chairman Callum McCallum.

Aquaculture New Zealand said up to 80 percent of juvenile oysters on
some farms have died.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has called on animal health
experts for a scientific opinion on widespread die-offs of Pacific
oysters (_Crassostrea gigas_).

Acting on a request from the European Commission, EFSA has
specifically asked whether the juvenile stocks may have been killed
off by a combination of a herpes-like virus -- ostreid herpesvirus-1
(OsHV-1) -- and environmental factors.

In the UK, the movement of oysters from parts of the Kent coast has
been banned after the herpes decimated juvenile Pacific oyster stocks.
The OsHV-1 virus has wiped out stocks in France in recent years and
the UK has declared a containment area on the Thames and north Kent
coasts.

A spokeswoman for the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and
Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) said OsHV-1 is an emerging disease that
has been associated with high levels of mortality in Pacific oysters
in France, Jersey, and some bays in the Republic of Ireland.

In 2008 France's main marine research institute, French Research
Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (Ifremer), set up a crisis team
which found 40-100 percent of oysters aged 12 to 18 months were dying
from the oyster herpes.

Scientists found that an increase or a sudden change in the water
temperature was an important risk factor, but the introduction of
non-certified possibly-infected spat, movements, and mixing of
populations and age groups, among other husbandry practices, were key
risk factors.

European authorities want increased biosecurity measures in their
oyster aquaculture sector and tests on the health status of oyster
spat before it is collected for farming.

McCallum said restrictions had been placed on the movement of oysters
into the few North Island bays where farms were not affected or to the
South Island.

Until this year [2010], around 3.5 million dozen Pacific oysters --
around 2800 tonnes -- were harvested annually in New Zealand's NZD 30
million (EUR 17.1 million/USD 22.6 million) industry, with the
majority exported, mainly to Australia and Asia, but about half of the
oysters due to be exported next year [2011] are now dead. Stocks for
next year [2011] are going to be reduced considerably, McCallum said.

Aquatic disease specialists had taken approximately 250 samples for
analysis, and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry response manager
Richard Norman said speculating on the cause of the deaths would be
premature.

[Indeed it does seem to be an emerging disease, as even OIE is
treating it as an emerging disease.

Clinical signs of the disease may include high levels of mortality
particularly affecting juvenile stages of Pacific oysters. These signs
usually appear when water temperatures exceed 16 deg C (60.8 deg F).

Currently there is no cure once this disease has infected an area.
However, there is a PCR test for early detection and potentially for
confirmation.
