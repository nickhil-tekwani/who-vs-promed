RABIES, HUMAN & ANIMAL - SOUTH AFRICA: ALERT

A rabies epidemic has hit several of KwaZulu-Natal's most popular
holiday spots. Three people, including 2 young children, have died
of rabies in the past month on the north coast. Some areas are
reporting at least 25 cases of animal rabies a month.
The province's far south coastal resorts and areas around game
parks on the north coast have been particularly hard hit by the
lethal disease, transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected
animal.
Dr Sashi Ramraj, a senior state veterinarian in the province,
warned that many local doctors were unable to diagnose the
symptoms of the disease. Ramraj is one of several government
officials who will be running crash courses in the disease for
doctors and health workers during the next few weeks.
"We need to educate people about this disease. If it is spotted
soon enough the patient can be saved; if not the results are
horrific. We need to tell the public if they do not inoculate their
animals and fail to familiarise themselves with the disease they
could die the worst death imaginable," said Ramraj.
The epidemic came to light with the death of a woman admitted to
Empangeni's Ngwalazane Hospital for hypertension. No one
realised the woman was suffering from rabies, which needs to be
treated within 48 hours of an animal bite for the victim to stand any
chance of survival.
Once victims begin to show the symptoms of rabies they cannot be
helped and inevitably die a death so excruciating that doctors, in
order to allow patients to die a dignified death, have no option but to
sedate them to the point they are comatose.
While the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals)
and government veterinarians inoculate animals against the
disease, they are not managing to get to all the animals at risk. In
KwaZulu-Natal most rabies cases are spread by dogs, and
surprisingly the dogs most likely to spread the disease come from
urban areas.
Ramraj said the owners of these rabid dogs were "being criminally
negligent. They have the money to afford a private vet, but they just
cannot be bothered. It is surprising, but the rural poor are good
about their dogs, while the wealthy just cannot be bothered. The
rabies problem we have is not due to under-funding or a lack of
resources, it is due to people simply being too idle to care."
The provincial Department of Agriculture's George Bishop said to
stop the spread of the disease the department needed to inoculate
70 percent of animals. "In many areas we do not even manage to
get to that figure. Generally, rabies figures have been going down
over the years, but in some areas the situation is pretty poor."
Bishop said it was very difficult to give exact figures for rabies,
particularly in rural areas bordering the Transkei where many
people died of the disease without the cause of their death being
reported.
For many the only source of affordable inoculations for their dogs
is the SPCA, which used to provide free medicines at their clinics.
Now the cash-strapped society cannot do that any more.
Gail Parsonage, manager of the Durban and Coast SPCA, said:
"Medicines are at a real premium. These days we have to ask the
public to pay, not the full price, but what they can afford. We are
always desperately short of money, but we still manage to go out
into the field and vaccinate animals. Even so, we are still seeing too
many cases."
Said Dr Andrew Jameson of British Airways Travel Clinics: "The
situation with rabies is so bad in parts of Africa -- and KwaZulu-
Natal -- that we advise travellers to seek immediate medical
attention if they are even licked by an animal. The message we put
out is if you are as much as licked by a possibly rabid animal it is
the end of your holiday. You need to seek proper medical
assistance immediately. Rabies is the most certain killer on this
Earth. I have no idea how you compare these things, but everyone
agrees on it. Rabies is the most painful and most horrific way there
is to die."
