_Salmonella_ outbreaks linked to backyard poultry
-------------------------------------------------

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 1135
Hospitalizations: 273
Deaths: 2
States: 48, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico
Investigation status: Closed

CDC and public health officials in several states investigated multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella [enterica_] infections with serotypes of Enteritidis, Hadar, Indiana, Infantis, Mbandaka, and Muenchen. Epidemiologic and laboratory data showed that contact with backyard poultry made people sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
A total of 1135 people infected with one of the outbreak strains were reported from 48 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (see map https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/map.html). The true number of sick people in these outbreaks was likely much higher than the number reported, and these outbreaks may not have been limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 15 Dec 2020 to 10 Oct 2021 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/epi.html). Age information was available for 1132 people. Their ages ranged from less than 1 to 97 years, with a median age of 37 years. Many were young children: 268 (24%) were under 5 years and 140 (12%) were under 1 year. Of 1107 people with sex information available, 646 (58%) were female. Of 829 people with information available, 273 (33%) were hospitalized. Two deaths were reported: 1 from Indiana and 1 from Virginia. State and local public health officials interviewed people about the animals they came into contact with the week before they got sick. Of the 677 people interviewed, 449 (66%) reported contact with backyard poultry before getting sick.

Traceback data
--------------
Of 293 people who reported contact with backyard poultry and provided more information, 212 (72%) reported that they bought backyard poultry this year [2020-2021]. Purchase locations included feedstores, auctions, and directly from hatcheries. Traceback of these purchases did not identify a single, common source of backyard poultry. A total of 264 separate purchases from more than 150 purchase locations of 70 different companies were reported. At least 17 hatcheries supplied backyard poultry to these purchase locations.

Laboratory data
---------------
Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples were closely related genetically. This means that people in these outbreaks likely got sick from the same type of animal.

Public health officials from several states found 2 of the outbreak strains (Hadar and Enteritidis) from sick people's backyard poultry and the backyard poultry environment.

- On 15 Apr 2021, public health officials in Ohio found the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Hadar from a sick person's ducklings.
- On 7 May 2021, local public health officials in California found the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Hadar from a sick person's duck environment (the ground, duck droppings, and duck's sleeping area).
- On 1 Jun 2021, public health officials in Arizona found the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Hadar from a sick person's chickens and the chicken environment (chickens' roost and water source).
- On 15 Jun 2021, public health officials in Maryland found the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis from a sick person's chickens.

WGS was also used to identify any predicted antibacterial resistance for bacteria from 1101 sick people's samples, 4 animal samples, and 7 environmental samples. Of the 1112 samples, 394 (35%) were predicted to be resistant to one or more of the following antimicrobials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (0.5%), ampicillin (0.9%), chloramphenicol (0.3%), cefoxitin (0.5%), ceftriaxone (0.5%), ciprofloxacin (0.1%), gentamicin (1.8%), kanamycin (0.4%), streptomycin (33.8%), sulfamethoxazole (2.2%), tetracycline (32.6%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (0.2%). Testing of 11 sick people's samples using standard antibacterial susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) confirmed these results (streptomycin and kanamycin were not tested by this method).

Most people with salmonellosis recover without antimicrobials. However, if antibacterials were needed, some illnesses in these outbreaks may have been difficult to treat with some commonly recommended antimicrobials and may have required a different therapeutic choice.

Public health action
--------------------
CDC always advises everyone to take steps to stay healthy around backyard poultry. CDC routinely works with hatcheries and stores that sell poultry to educate new poultry owners and control the spread of _Salmonella_ at hatcheries.

[Having a flock of backyard fowl can serve a number of purposes, including home-raised meat, fresh eggs, and companionship, but care must be taken to avoid the zoonosis salmonellosis.

The following recommendations are from the CDC: What Backyard Flock Owners Should Do (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/index.html):

"Wash your hands
- Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after touching backyard poultry, their eggs, or anything in the area where they live and roam.
- Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Consider having hand sanitizer at your coop.

"Be safe around backyard flocks
- Don't kiss or snuggle backyard poultry, and don't eat or drink around them. This can spread _Salmonella_ germs to your mouth and make you sick.
- Keep your backyard flock and supplies you use to care for them (like feed containers and shoes you wear in the coop) outside of the house. You should also clean the supplies outside the house.

"Supervise kids around flocks
- Always supervise children around backyard poultry and make sure they wash their hands properly afterward.
- Don't let children younger than 5 years touch chicks, ducklings, or other backyard poultry. Young children are more likely to get sick from germs like _Salmonella_.

"Handle eggs safely
- Collect eggs often. Eggs that sit in the nest can become dirty or break.
- Throw away cracked eggs. Germs on the shell can more easily enter the egg through a cracked shell.
- Rub off dirt on eggs with fine sandpaper, a brush, or a cloth. Don't wash them because colder water can pull germs into the egg.
- Refrigerate eggs to keep them fresh and slow the growth of germs.
- Cook eggs until both the yolk and white are firm, and cook egg dishes to an internal temperature of 160 deg F (71 deg C) to kill all germs." - Mod.LL
