Virulent Newcastle disease (vND), formerly known as exotic Newcastle disease, is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting the respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems of birds and poultry. The disease is so virulent that many birds and poultry die without showing any clinical signs.

vND is not a food-safety concern. No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected with mild symptoms.

vND has not been found in commercial poultry in the USA since 2003.

Since [Fri 18 May 2018], the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed 52 cases of vND in backyard birds in California: 49 in San Bernardino County, 2 in Riverside County, and 1 in Los Angeles County. [For details go to the USDA website. - Mod.MHJ]

[USDA has been updating their records, inserting missed outbreaks, so this series report is more accurate. Unfortunately, the momentum is not decreasing. - Mod.MHJ
