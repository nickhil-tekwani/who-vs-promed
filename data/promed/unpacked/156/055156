************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
[This was originally posted in Spanish on ProMED-PORT but we held it for
further confirmation. The confirmation arrived from Dr. Delia Enria of the
Argentina National Institute of Infectious Diseases, see [2] below. - Mod.CHC]

Buenos Aires media have reported cases of suspected hantavirus infection in
Loncohue [Lonco-Pue], [southern Argentina]. A married couple have been
affected, the man having already died and the wife being in serious
condition. Their two children have not been infected.

On December 24, a woman from Lonco-Pue (Neuquen Province) was confirmed as
having had HPS. Her husband had died from a similar disease a week before,
without seeking medical care. Confirmation of the disease was not possible
for him. The rest of the family is under control, and without problems. So,
the information is right. Southern Argentina (Rio Negro, Chubut, and
Neuquen provinces) has had only four confirmed cases during 1997 (including
the one we mention here), and the whole situation has been quiet since the
last outbreak, in 1996.

[It is clear than hantavirus infections and human diseases have been with
us for a long time and that such occurrences as this can be attributed to
better surveillance and improved diagnostic methods. - Mod.CHC]
