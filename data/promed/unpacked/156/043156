At least 5 children under one year died in the last hours and 41 more are affected by severe respiratory infections in an area of high poverty in Chiapas, southeastern Mexico, officials said. The state government said in a statement that the deaths were reported in the Emiliano Zapata community, Yajalon municipality, and that health authorities took steps to care for children affected by this disease.

The authorities stated that these respiratory infections, caused by the intense cold and heavy rains, present with high fever and cough and the bacteria are spread in winter in areas of high deprivation.

To handle the emergency the Governor of Chiapas, Manuel Velasco, sent the director of the Provincial Health Secretariat.

In addition, 3 health teams were sent to the community to care for the patients and implement preventive measures, among those to vaccinate in order to avoid a possible epidemic.

Also, the state government gave full support to the affected families and the people of the community "to prevent the proliferation of the disease."

[Acute respiratory infections are common causes of morbidity and mortality in young children throughout the world, especially in developing countries (http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/ari/en/index2.html). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most frequent lower respiratory tract pathogen in infants and young children worldwide (http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/ari/en/index2.html, http://www.virologyj.com/content/9/1/78#B43, http://www.cdc.gov/rsv/). RSV is a common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia in children under 1 year of age in the United States and is a frequent cause of hospitalization of infants and young children [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14615709). In the US, RSV infections generally occur during fall, winter, and early spring. In tropical countries, the occurrence of RSV infections has been noted to occur in the rainy and cold season, which has been attributed to overcrowding as a result of populations staying more to their homes (http://www.virologyj.com/content/9/1/78#B43).

RSV bronchopulmonary infections in hospitalized children can be associated with super-infection in the lower airways (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20700753), with bacteria, commonly due to _Haemophilus influenzae_ and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20700753) or other respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus (ProMED-mail post Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (136): Argentina, pediatric mortality archive no. 20091227.4359).

Human parainfluenza viruses type 3 (HPIV-3) is second only to RSV as a cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/224708-overview). Other respiratory viruses include the influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 2, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus.

The recent worldwide outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to a particular coronavirus (SARS- CoV), which resulted in 8096 cases and 774 deaths between November 2002 and July 2003, and a novel influenza virus (pandemic H1N1/09 virus) emphasize the risk posed by novel respiratory viral infections in humans.

More information on this current outbreak in Chiapas, Mexico would be greatly appreciated.

Chiapas, officially Free and Sovereign State of Chiapas, is one of the 31 states that, with the Federal District, comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas). Chiapas has a humid, tropical climate, with a population of almost 5 million. It is home to one of the largest indigenous populations in the country with 12 federally recognized ethnicities.
