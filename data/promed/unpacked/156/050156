New Test for FMD
----------------
A cheap new test can distinguish cattle infected with or vaccinated against
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), according to an article in the science
journal Nature Science.

The new test is believed to open the door to allow future outbreaks to be
controlled and ended by immunisation rather than by culling.

Of the 6 million-plus farm animals slaughtered in 2001 (as Britain
struggled to contain the spread of FMD), one in 8 were cows; vaccination was ruled out because the blood of dosed animals was indistinguishable from that
of infected ones. Their immune responses are similar, and symptoms can take
days to develop. During this delay a healthy-looking animal can spread the
FMD virus, so export is forbidden.

The fast, low-tech lab test reliably sorts the two groups, say Armin
Saalmuller and colleagues at the Institute for Immunology of the Federal
Research Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals in Tubingen, Germany. Should
another outbreak occur, the assay could identify infected animals, says
Saalmuller, making vaccination an option.

"It could easily be made into a strip test -- like a dipstick," says FMD
expert David Paton of the Institute for Animal Health in Pirbright,
UK. Animals could then be checked quickly in the field.

Called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, the test correctly
recognised blood samples from 50 infected and 1000 vaccinated cows. It also
distinguished different strains of the FMD virus, which is prone to
mutation, Nature Science says.

But FMD epidemiologist Mark Woolhouse of the University of Edinburgh in
Scotland has warned that the test is not specific or sensitive
enough. "It's possible that you'd be using this test on millions of
animals," he says. "Even if it's 99.9 per cent effective, that means you
could misdiagnose a lot of them," he told Nature Science.

The test spots the antibodies that infected cattle produce against the FMD
virus that is replicating in their cells. Animals vaccinated with
inactivated virus do not produce these antibodies.

Similar kits exist, but Saalmuller's version is quicker to use and costs
one-fifth the price of its rivals. It uses synthetic reagents, while
others use biological components.

"You don't need a high-security lab to do the analysis," says Saalmuller.

[There are a number of diagnostic tests that can be used to differentiate
between infection and vaccination, most of which rely on the detection of
antibodies for non-structural (NS) proteins. There are currently no
internationally recognised standards for antibody to FMD virus NS proteins,
though they are described in detail in OIE's Manual of Standards for
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines (see Chapter 2.1.1 "Foot and Mouth Disease",
in : Serological tests - c) Nonstructural protein antibody tests:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00022.htm>.

These tests may occasionally give false positives, mainly in older animals
with a history of regular repeated vaccinations (see Steve Angus'
commentary in 20010430.0839). This is the background to the following
remark in the Manual: "A negative result for antibody to NS proteins cannot
be taken as definitive proof that an individual animal has not been exposed
to FMD virus. This must be taken into account if NS protein antibody tests
are used for assessment of risks for animals involved in international trade".

The test described by the Tubingen group might be a significant step
forward. However, an issue not yet solved is the identification of
"carrier" animals, which can be produced by vaccination and consecutive
infection. These animals without FMDV symptoms are a continuous threat for
nonvaccinated animal populations. A sensitive method for detection of these
animals is highly important for FMDV diagnosis; the author say that
detailed analyses of carrier animals and their antibody repertoire will be
the subjects of further studies.

The full abstract of the paper [Hohlich BJ, Wiesmuller KH, Schlapp T, Haas
B, Pfaff E & Saalmuller A. Identification of foot-and-mouth disease
virus-specific linear B-cell epitopes to differentiate between infected and
vaccinated cattle - J. Virol. 2003 Aug; 77(16): 8633-9], follows (and can
be obtained via a PubMED search):

"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease of
cloven-hoofed animals. For several years, vaccination of animals, which had
proven to be successful for the eradication of the disease, has been
forbidden in the United States and the European Community because of the
difficulty of differentiating between vaccinated and infected animals. In
this study, detailed investigations of the bovine humoral immune response
against FMD virus (FMDV) were performed with the aim of identifying viral
epitopes recognized specifically by sera derived from FMDV-infected
animals. The use of overlapping 15-mer synthetic peptides, covering the
whole open reading frame of FMDV strain O(1)K in a peptide enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, allowed the identification of 12 FMDV strain
O(1)K-specific linear B-cell epitopes. Six of these linear B-cell epitopes,
located in the nonstructural proteins, were used in further assays to
compare the reactivities of sera from vaccinated and infected cattle.
Antibodies recognizing these peptides could be detected only in sera
derived from infected cattle. In further experiments, the reactivity of the
six peptides with sera from animals infected with different strains of FMDV
was tested, and strain-independent infection-specific epitopes were
identified. Thus, these results clearly demonstrate the ability of a simple
peptide-based assay to discriminate between infected and conventionally
FMD-vaccinated animals." - Mod. AS].
