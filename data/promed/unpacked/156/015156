_Coccidioides immitis_ ex Costa Rica
------------------------------------
Women aged 35 and 36 years were admitted to hospital with dry coughs and
high temperatures after returning from a tour in Costa Rica on 7 December.
Chest radiographs showed scattered pulmonary lesions compatible with
mycosis. The first case developed symptoms on 9 December and the second on
13 December. Laboratory results of bronchial lavage revealed
coccidiomycosis. Confirmation by a second laboratory is pending, but the
clinical symptoms, laboratory, and radiological findings all support the
diagnosis, so treatment with itroconazole has been started. Two other
patients traveling in the same group are reportedly being treated for
mycoplasma infection in Heidelberg. In our patients mycoplasma infection
could not be confirmed. The travel group included other people about whom
we have no information so far.

[ProMED-mail is a moderated newsgroup established to serve as an early
warning system for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. We
occasionally do report on diseases that would not classify as "emerging or
re-emerging infectious diseases" for special reasons, often for a public
health/public service rationale. There was significant discussion
surrounding the posting of the original case reports of coccidioidomycosis
in returning European travellers who had attended an event in California
where coccidioidomycosis is endemic and hence would not be classified as an
emerging infectious disease. The justifications for posting at that time
included the geographic distribution of attendees/participants in the event
(helping disseminate the information to our international readership as a
public service alert), in addition to a reminder of the geographic
implications of an earlier posting this year in which it was noted that
this was an epidemic year for coccidioidomycosis in California.
The cases reported above may very well be diagnoses made as a result of the
increased awareness for coccidioidomycosis at this time in Europe following
the reports of the earlier cases ("seek and ye shall find"). It is curious
that there were additional cases of pulmonary disease among the same group
that are being treated for mycoplasma pneumonia -- is this a case of
"mistaken identity" or just coincidental infections? Of interest, while
coccidioidomycosis is felt to be potentially endemic in 15 countries,
including Costa Rica, according to Gideon (http://www.cyinfo.com/) no cases
were reported in 1992; 0 in 1993; 1 in 1994; 0 in 1995; 0 in 1996; 0 in
1997; 0 in 1998; 0 in 1999; 0 in 2000. The two cases reported above may
well serve as confirmation that coccidioidomycosis is endemic in Costa Rica.
Our readers should be reminded that coccidioidomycosis is not routinely "on
topic" for ProMED-mail and that these postings are being done as a public
service to alert our readership of the impact of the global village we now
live in as well as giving me a chance to cite my favorite adage related to
disease surveillance -- "seek and ye shall find". With our increased ease
in communications and more widespread travel, we should not be surprised by
identification of "new endemic" areas for "old diseases". Mod. MPP
