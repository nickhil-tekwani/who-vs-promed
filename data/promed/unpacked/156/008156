It is thought [a 7-year-old boy] may have ingested floodwater containing rats' urine. If the theory is confirmed, it will make him the 1st person to die as a result of the flooding causing chaos across the UK. The boy was found at his home in the Chertsey area of Surrey, which became flooded when the River Thames burst its banks.

He was taken to hospital with his father and mother but lost his fight for life yesterday [8 Deb 2014]. Speculation that he died from Weil's disease [a severe form of leptospirosis], which is transmitted from animals to humans through water, rose after the authorities failed to deny it was the cause.

[The boy's] father was in a serious condition in hospital last night [8 Feb 2014], according to Surrey police. 15 others, including police officers, were also admitted as a precaution. Residents spoke of the "sense of shock" in the community at the boy's death.

Chris Norman, Surrey county councillor for the Chertsey area, said: "It is a huge blow, especially with the floods as rampant as they are in the area.

Carbon monoxide poisoning has also been put forward as another possible cause of the death. The gas may have been emitted by floodwater pumps used in the family home, police said.

Last week, [the boy's] mother posted a photo of rising flood waters on Twitter. She wrote: "So I've been told to expect the Thames floods to rise another 6 inches [15.2 cm] over next 24 hours. This is outside my front door!"

[Chertsey is a town in the Runnymede borough of Surrey, England on the River Thames 29 km (18 mi) southwest of London (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chertsey).

Recently, flooding in the Thames River valley has reached record levels and floodwaters continue to rise as a result of heavy rainfall (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26111598). Temperature in London has been in the mid-30s to mid-40's deg. F (approx. 2-8 deg. C) (http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/UKXX0085).

Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Leptospirosis occurs worldwide, including the UK. However, it is most common in tropical and subtropical regions. _Leptospira_, the spirochetal bacteria that cause leptospirosis, are found in fresh water, damp soil, vegetation, and mud. _Leptospira_ survive best in fresh warm water. These bacteria cannot survive in salt water or freezing temperatures.

Chronically infected animals, which usually do not become ill, carry _Leptospira_ in their kidneys and excrete _Leptospira_ in their urine. The commonest sources of infection in the UK are said to be rats and cattle (http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Leptospirosis/GeneralInformation/lepto005GeneralInformation/).
Humans become infected by contact with infected animal urine or water contaminated by infected animal urine.

Leptospirosis is uncommon in the UK; there are usually only 50-60 cases per year in England and Wales (http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1317139445731). In 2012, 72 cases of human leptospirosis were identified in England and Wales, of which 50 were acquired locally, usually during the summer and autumn months, and mostly related to occupation, water-sport recreational activity, gardening, or farm animal exposure (http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1317139445731).

Because the cases of suspected leptospirosis in the UK reported in the news release above are occurring in cold winter months, the diagnosis of leptospirosis seems unlikely. ProMED-mail would appreciate follow-up data from knowledgeable sources when results of diagnostic tests become available. - Mod.ML
