Liberia: yellow fever - update
------------------------------
The Ministry of Health, Liberia has reported one additional confirmed
case of yellow fever. The case, a 30-year-old man, is from the same
community as the index case, Zuotuo, Tappita District. Nimba County.
The total number of confirmed cases is 2 including one death.

The case, was laboratory confirmed at the national laboratory in
Monrovia and at the Pasteur Institute, Dakar, Senegal, a regional
reference laboratory and WHO Collaborating Centre for yellow fever.
The Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical assistance of WHO, has
started to vaccinate Tappita District and plans to extend the
reactive mass vaccination campaign to neighbouring districts.


The MoH has submitted a 2nd request for yellow fever vaccines from
the global emergency stockpile, managed by the International
Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control
(YF-ICG). The new request targets 177 112 people. In total the 1st
and 2nd request target a population of 294 613 people.

[Since this 2nd case is from the same village as the index case
reported in ProMED-mail archive no. 20080405.1246, one wonders if
this reflects human-mosquito-human transmission, with the risk of an
urban outbreak, or is another isolated, rural case. In either case,
speedy immunization of people in this area is critical.
