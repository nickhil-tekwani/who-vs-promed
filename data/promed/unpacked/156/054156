Botulism outbreak hits poultry farm
-----------------------------------
A botulism outbreak has struck a poultry farm in western Finland.
Authorities report that a large number of birds have already died from the
illness. The remaining infected birds are to be culled.

The Finnish Food Safety Authority (Evira) said the birds were infected with
the _Clostridium botulinum_ bacterium, which causes botulism. The poultry
exhibited typical symptoms associated with the disease.

Evira officials would not disclose the exact location of the farm. Botulism
is rarely found in animals in Finland.

[Botulism is an intoxication caused by ingesting _Clostridium botulinum_
exotoxin or by absorbing toxin produced in the alimentary tract
(toxico-infection). The causative toxin in poultry is mainly of type C.

The intoxication in poultry is clinically characterised by flaccid
paralysis of the legs, wings, neck, and eyelids. Paralytic signs progress
cranially from the legs to include the wings, neck, and eyelids.
"Limberneck", the common name for botulism in birds, describes neck
paralysis. Death is due to cardiac and respiratory arrest.

Botulism was reported in ruminants fed poultry manure contaminated with _C.
botulinum_ type C spores. The zoonotic potential of type C botulism is
minimal, even negligible. Only 4 poorly documented type C botulism
intoxications have been reported in people, but cases have occurred in
nonhuman primates.

Botulism is not an OIE-listed disease, but may be included in annual
reports voluntarily. The identification of the causative toxin in the
outbreak in Finland would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
