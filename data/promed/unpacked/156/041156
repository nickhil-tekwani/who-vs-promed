As many as 1600 suspected chikungunya cases have been found in
Sullia, Puttur, and parts of Bantwal. It has again played havoc in
these taluks [A taluk is an administrative division in some Indian
states, and consists of a headquarters city with authority over
villages and municipalities within its jurisdiction. - Mod.TY] The
health department has taken all the possible measures to contain the disease.

Speaking to Deccan Herald, district health officer (DHO) Dr Jagannath
said teams from Fr Muller Medical College, KMC, KSHEMA, KVG Medical
College, A J Hospital have been sent to the affected regions; 5
mobile teams are already working in the affected areas.

He said the health department has taken intensive health awareness
education programmes in all the affected areas, gram panchayats.
[Gram panchayats are local government units at the village level. -
Mod.TY]. Apart from this, fogging is being undertaken daily in the
affected areas.

Drug distribution centres have been opened in all the PHCs [primary
health centres], anganwadi centres, so that the medicines are
available free of cost to the infected, he added. [Anganwadi centers
are governmental child- and mother-care health centres in India. - Mod.TY]

The department has decided to take help from the doctors of Sullia
Ayurvedic College, Ayush, and Fr Muller Homeopathic College as
ayurvedic and homeopathic treatment proved to be effective in
treatment of chikungunya.

In Kasargod, as many as 43 are infected with chikungunya [virus].
Patthanady panchayat limits has the highest number with 30 cases. As
many as 610 people are suffering from fever with chikungunya symptoms
in the district. As many as 28 have been admitted at the hospital.

The district administration has taken stringent measures to contain
the outbreak of chikungunya and dengue in the district. In 2007, 75
persons suffered from chikungunya symptoms. However, 31 were infected
with chikungunya [virus] in the Kasargod district.
