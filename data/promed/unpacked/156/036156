Fujian province cites first H7N9 case as total reaches 119
----------------------------------------------------------
Fujian province today [26 Apr 2013] reported its 1st H7N9 influenza case -- the 9th area of eastern China to be affected by the virus -- as other provinces reported 6 more infections, raising the outbreak total to 119. In a pattern seen throughout the outbreak so far, most of the newly reported cases are in men, and many of the patients are older. The new case from Fujian is in a 65-year-old man who is being treated in a hospital, according to an update today from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection. So far none of the man's 24 close contacts have shown symptoms. A resident of Nanchang, the provincial capital, the man is a retiree who hadn't traveled recently and had no contact with poultry, though he lives near a poultry market, according to a report yesterday from the Xinhua, news agency. Fujian is about 485 miles south of Shanghai and borders both Jiangxi province, which reported its first case yesterday, and Zhejiang province, which has reported 45 cases so far, the most of any province.

About 400 laboratories across China have test kits for detecting the virus, so all provinces probably have the capacity to identify cases. Global influenza experts expect cases to continue to rise until the full scope of the virus's source is known. Chinese researchers have linked human illnesses to H7N9 viruses found in market poultry, but questions still remain about other types of exposure and whether other birds or animals harbor the virus.

Other cases reported today include 3 from Jiangsu province. A 49-year-old man is in stable condition, a 36-year-old man is in serious condition, and a 60-year-old man is in critical condition, according to the CHP.

Jiangsu health officials also reported a death from the virus, in a 32-year-old woman whose case was reported earlier this month, according to translated health bureau reports posted on the FluTrackers infectious disease message board. Her death lifts the number of H7N9 fatalities to 23.

China's agriculture ministry said today that tests on samples from poultry farms have found no positive H7N9 samples, Xinhua reported. The ministry said 68 060 samples have been collected so far from poultry markets, habitats, farms, and slaughterhouses across China, but only 46 have tested positive; 44 were from 14 live poultry markets in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Henan provinces, plus the city of Shanghai. The 2 other positive samples were from Jiangsu and included one from a wild pigeon and another from a household farm of carrier pigeons.

In other developments, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) said yesterday that as of Apr 24 it would update the number of human H7N9 infections every week, which appears to signal an end to daily reports of new cases. Most provincial health departments still appear to be announcing cases as they are confirmed by lab testing.

[The decision of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to release weekly updates of cases numbers, rather than daily reports as at present, will help to eliminate confusion and provide a clearer understanding of the course of the outbreak - Mod.CP]

[The positive pigeon farm now turns out to have been for carrier pigeons, not pigeons for consumption. This is a worrying development, because pigeon races are held up to 1000 (one thousand) miles from the home loft. Perhaps a carrier pigeon fancier can tell us if racing pigeons stop on the way home to feed or interact with other pigeons. Beijing has already banned pigeon racing there as a preventive measure, see ProMED archive 20130414.1645731. - Mod.JW]

7 more human cases of avian influenza A (H7N9) verified by NHFPC
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) verified with the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) today (Fri 26 Apr 2013) 3 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Jiangsu, 2 in Jiangxi, one in Fujian and one in Zhejiang.

The 3 cases in Jiangsu involve men aged 49, 36 and 60 who are receiving treatment in hospital and their respective condition is stable, serious and critical [respectively].

The 2 cases in Jiangxi involve a 69-year-old man and a 76-year-old woman who are receiving treatment in hospital. Their condition is critical. Their 24 close contacts are asymptomatic so far.

The case in Fujian involves a 65-year-old man who is receiving treatment in hospital. His 37 close contacts are asymptomatic so far.

The case in Zhejiang involves a 38-year-old man who is receiving treatment in hospital. His condition is serious.

As of 9pm today [26 Apr 2013], a total of 118 cases have been laboratory confirmed with avian influenza A (H7N9) on the Mainland, which included Zhejiang (45 cases), Shanghai (33 cases), Jiangsu (27 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4cases), Jiangxi (2 cases), Beijing (one case), Shandong (one case) and Fujian (one case).

A spokesman for the DH stressed that the CHP is closely monitoring the situation and will continue to maintain close liaison with the Mainland health authorities for more case information as well as to keep a close eye on the latest advice from the World Health Organization. The spokesman also reminded travellers, especially those returning from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Beijing, Shandong, Jiangxi and Fujian, with fever or respiratory symptoms to wear facial masks immediately, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should also pay special attention to those who might have had contact with birds, poultry or their droppings in the affected areas.

"No human case of avian influenza A (H7N9) has been identified so far in Hong Kong," the spokesman reiterated. "We would like to reassure the public that the Government will be as transparent as possible in the dissemination of information on human cases
of avian influenza A (H7N9). Whenever there is a suspected case, the CHP will release information to the public as soon as possible," the spokesman added. The spokesman urged travellers not to visit wet markets with live poultry in the affected areas and avoid direct contact with poultry, birds or their droppings. If contacts have been made, they should thoroughly wash hands with soap and water.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and are reminded to take heed of the following preventive advice against avian influenza:

* Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
* Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating, after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with tissue and put it into covered dustbins;
* Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
* Wear a mask when respiratory symptoms develop or you need to take care of fever patients.

The public may visit the Avian Influenza page of the CHP <www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html> for further information.

Hunan in the south is coloured blue, inland from Fujian & Jiangxi, which are also infected. Is the epidemic spreading south, or did it originate south of Shanghai and has been carried north by migrating birds or the poultry trade?

[4] Israel MOH guidelines
Date: Sat 27 Apr 2013
From Haaretz Daily, Fri 26 Apr 2013 [in Hebrew, transl Mod.AS, summarised, edited] http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/health/.premium-1.2004491


In view of the spread of A/H7N9 in China, the Director of the Epidemiology Department at Israel's Ministry of Health (MOH), Dr. Emilia Anis, has issued guidelines to the physicians in the Ministry's districts and sub-districts, regarding the detection of suspected cases. "The Ministry of Health monitors the data published in the world and maintains ongoing contact with the relevant parties," says Anis.

It was decided that the preparedness plan will be in line with the measures prepared by the Ministry in relation to the previous avian influenza threat, H5N1, in 2003. This virus strain caused several outbreaks in poultry in Israel during the last decade, but no human cases have been documented in Israel. This is in contrast to neighbouring Egypt, where 168 human cases have been reported, of which 60 died.

According to MOH's definitions, any patient presenting acute, severe respiratory disease signs who had been in China during the 10 days before the onset of symptoms will be regarded as a suspect case of the new virus and be hospitalized under isolation in a biosafety facility (under negative atmpspheric pressure). The Ministry further prescribes medical monitoring of contact persons and family members of such patients , during 10 days following hospitalization.

No limitations on travel to China have been imposed. In line with WHO policy, there is no requirement for medical checks upon those returning from China. However, those travelling to China are advised to maintain strict hygienic measures during their stay (described in some detail), consume well-cooked food and refrain from visiting animal markets, farms and having close contact with animals.

Those returning from China should seek immediate medical advice if they have acute respiratory signs during 10 days after return.
