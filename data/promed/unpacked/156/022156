Dozens of cases of Legionnaires' disease have been reported across the metro Detroit area [Michigan]. Investigations are being conducted to determine common sources of exposure.

Meanwhile, the Oakland County Health division is strongly advising that residents take all necessary steps to prevent the disease, which is a respiratory infection caused by bacteria called _Legionella_.

State health officials are investigating an uptick in cases of Legionnaires' disease in metro Detroit.

A total of 35 cases were reported in June [2013], said Angela Minicuci, public information officer for the Michigan Department of Community Health. They were in Wayne and Macomb counties and the city of Detroit. "Around this time of year, this is when we would see a typical seasonal increase," Minicuci said. "The numbers are just a little bit higher than what we're typically used to seeing in June."

Of the 15 cases of Legionnaires' disease reported so far this year [2013] in Wayne County outside of Detroit, 13 were in June, said Mary Mazur, spokeswoman for the Wayne County Department of Public Health. "The investigation is ongoing," she said. "As of this time, we have not found a common thread."

[We are told that the authorities are unsure if the number of cases of Legionnaires' disease in the Detroit metropolitan area is unusual or if there is any epidemiological link among the cases, which are still under investigation. However, the diagnosis of even a single case of Legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is, therefore, a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative bacillus of the genus _Legionella_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis and Pontiac fever is a less severe, non-pneumonic form. Pontiac fever develops from hours to 2 days after initial infection, with fever, malaise and muscle aches, whereas Legionnaires' disease has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days after exposure. Legionnaires' disease, and presumably Pontiac fever, is acquired by inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_.

More than 70 percent of cases of Legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (1). _L. longbeachae_ is found in soil and potting mix (2), and Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil. Unlike _L. longbeachae_, _L. pneumophila_ is found in water sources, such as natural aquatic bodies, including rivers, lakes, and thermally polluted waters.

Water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in water storage tanks of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in groceries, fountains, cooling towers, and car washes. If a cooling tower is the implicated source, the effect of wind speed and direction on _Legionella_-contaminated plumes from the cooling tower may influence the distribution of cases.

Legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons. However, healthy individuals can also be at risk of contracting this disease.

The Detroit metropolitan area, referred to as metro Detroit, is a major metropolitan area located in Southeast Michigan. The urbanized area covers parts of the counties of Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne. Detroit, with a population of 701 475 in 2012 and the seat of government for Wayne County, is the most populous city in the state of Michigan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit). Wayne County has a population of 1.8 million, excluding that of Detroit. Macomb County borders Wayne County to the northeast and Oakland County to the northwest.
