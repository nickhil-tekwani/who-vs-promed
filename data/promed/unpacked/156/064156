In the 980626010416 posting cited above I very stupidly commented that the
German "hunting" party was making its way to Vladivostok ... this would
have been very difficult, slow, and pointless as two polite gentlemen
gently pointed out to me. Of course I meant Murmansk. Serves me right for
teasing my geography challenged colleagues.
