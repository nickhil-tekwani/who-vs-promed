[Ref: KS Ling & D Sfetcu: First report of natural infection of
greenhouse tomatoes by _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ in the United
States. Plant Dis. 2010; 94, 1376; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-07-10-0516.]

In April 2009, a large number of tomato plants (_Solanum lycopersicum_
L.) grown in a commercial greenhouse facility near Los Angles, CA
exhibited general plant stunting (short internodes) and foliar
symptoms that included distortion, chlorosis, and scattered necrotic
spotting. Over time, the leaves began to exhibit a purple color and
curling. Diseased plants were often frail with spindly shoots. The
disease resulted in a significant yield loss due to reduced fruit size.

The disease was initially localized in certain areas in a greenhouse
despite using a number of cultural management efforts including
vigorous scouting, roguing of diseased plants and strict hygiene and
cleaning practices. The disease was also observed in neighboring
greenhouses by the spring of 2010.

A standard panel of tests for common tomato viruses and viroids was
conducted. Full viroid genomic sequences were obtained through RT-PCR
specific for _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd). Sequences obtained
from direct sequencing of amplicons or cloned PCR products from one
isolate were identical and consisted of a full viroid genome of 358
nt, which was named PSTVd-CA1. This isolate had a high sequence
identity (98 percent) to other PSTVd isolates [in gene data banks].

The disease was reproducible upon mechanical transmission to tomato
"Moneymaker" [variety] plants, which expressed symptoms that were
similar to those on the source plants. "Moneymaker" plants are
commonly used as indicators for pospiviroids, including PSTVd.
Recovery of PSTVd from the inoculated plants was confirmed by RT-PCR
and sequencing.

The exact source of the PSTVd inoculum in the current disease outbreak
is unknown, but it could have been introduced from infected potato or
ornamental plants or through infected tomato seeds. The disease
epidemic might have been enhanced by frequent hands-on activities in
greenhouse tomato production and the environmental conditions (high
temperature and intense lighting) in the greenhouse that favor symptom
expression.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus
_Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including
potato, tomato and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic")
disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to
65 percent in potato and up to 50 percent in tomato. Many solanaceous
ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd.

Symptoms in tomatoes include stunting of plants, leaf chlorosis, leaf
distortion, and shortening of internodes. In potato, shoots are
spindly, plants are stunted, and tubers are small and deformed. All
varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, with no
natural resistance to PSTVd available in either host. However, mild
strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 percent, depending on
the host cultivar. Spread occurs also via infected plants or
vegetative plant parts, pollen, mechanical means (such as human
activities as mentioned above) and plant-to-plant contact. Only in the
presence of _Potato leafroll virus_, PSTVd can also be transmitted by
an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_). PSTVd is exceptionally stable and
can survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Disease
management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other
possible sources of inoculum, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free
planting material.

As stated above, the glasshouse conditions may have favoured symptom
expression. This may, in fact, have been an advantage for the grower,
since it resulted in the discovery of an infection which otherwise may
have led to reduced yields even without visible symptoms. While PSTVd
is known to occur in glasshouse tomatoes, it would be important to
identify the source of the outbreak described above and examine the
certification schemes applied to local tomato seeds and/or transplants
to prevent future outbreaks.
