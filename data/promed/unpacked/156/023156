Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 6 Jun 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 11 Jun 2018
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 25 Jan 2017
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] virus
Serotype: H7N7
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to: a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (H7N7-1): Arthies, Arthies, Val-D'Oise
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Jun 2018
Outbreak status: resolved 5 Jul 2018
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 10 000 / - / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Samples taken in a farm with mallard ducks, in the framework of the planned surveillance. The national reference laboratory confirmed the presence of low pathogenic H7N7 virus on [8 Jun 2018] in ducklings born this year [2018]. The animals were put under containment and a new series of assays showed the absence of viral excretion on [5 Jul 2018].

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds/ ** / 0 / ** / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: A breeding farm with mallard ducks was tested, in the framework of the national surveillance of avian influenza. The batch of ducklings was confirmed positive to low pathogenic H7N7 virus. The animals did not show any symptoms. They were put under containment and new assays performed 3 weeks later showed the absence of viral excretion. Once the batch is dispatched, the breeding facilities will be subjected to cleaning and disinfection, then to fallowing, as per the legislation.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance with containment and/or protection zone; screening; traceability; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Labocea; Ploufragan (National laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 5 Jul 2018 / Negative
National Reference Laboratory; Ploufragan (National laboratory) / Birds / nucleotide sequencing / 11 Jun 2018 / Positive
National Reference Laboratory; Ploufragan (National laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 11 Jun 2018 / Positive

["Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

To prevent cases of LPAI; poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected; farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection; the area must be clear of organic material." https://tinyurl.com/y7rfdhx8
