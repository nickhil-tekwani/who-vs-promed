The National Agriculture & Livestock Diagnostic Laboratory (LANAGRO)
will test 2205 serological samples from 10 cattle herds.
Samples were obtained from a population of 8647 cattle in 10 herds
located in the municipalities of Maringa, Loanda, Amapora, Grandes
Rios & Bela Vista do Paraiso, all of them in the state of Parana.
Samples will be examined using NSP tests and under the supervision of
PANAFTOSA [Panamerican Foot and Mouth Disease Center]. Sampling was
targeted to cattle with FMD-like signs, cattle aged between 6 and 24
months, and animals from the Londrina market, and was carried out
from 2-7 Jan 2006.
Tests will detect the non-structural proteins of the FMD virus. The
results should be available next week, and will be followed by the
Panamerican Foot & Mouth Disease Centre in Brazil.

A decision by the Federal Justice [ministry] interrupted preparations
for the culling of 1800 cattle from a herd suspected of [containing
FMD-infected animals], as required by the World Organisation for
Animal Heath (OIE).
The judge gave the Ministry of Agriculture 5 days to present the test
results justifying the culling.
In October 2005, when FMD was confirmed in Mato Grosso do Sul state,
209 animals left the Bonanza ranch there for the Cachoeira ranch in
Parana state.
The Cachoeira ranch's lawyer is the same one who succeeded in Federal
court in blocking the slaughter of 1050 head on the Bonanza
ranch. That injunction was filed on 15 Dec 2005 and the Ministry [of
Agriculture] has still not succeeded in overturning it.

[It appears that legal maneuvering is likely to block all efforts to
cull in Mato Grosso do Sul or Parana states until too late for that
measure to be effective. If there is a quarantine order in effect,
it clearly cannot stop movement of cattle over state lines from
suspected infected herds. - Mod.JW]
