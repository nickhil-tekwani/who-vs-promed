ANTHRAX - GHANA
===============
I've worked 2 hours at home and have come up only with the AFP headline:
28/04/97 - 12h29 - 144 words: 30 die in Ghana after eating anthrax-infected beef
but can't get the report.
[Does anyone have access to this report? Do any of our subscribers have
further details? - Mod.JW]
