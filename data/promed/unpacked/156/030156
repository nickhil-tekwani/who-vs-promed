Influenza - update 114
-----------------------
Situation update:
----------------------
As of 20 Aug 2010, the situation in New Zealand and India remains
largely unchanged since the last update. Influenza H1N1 (2009) virus
transmission remains locally intense in parts of India and New Zealand.

In New Zealand, during the 1st week of August 2010, the national
consultation rate for ILI [influenza-like illness] increased sharply.
Influenza H1N1 (2009) virus transmission appears to be locally
intense in parts of the country that were less affected during last
winter's pandemic wave; however, to date, the overall national rate
of ILI consultations and the numbers of severe and fatal cases of
H1N1 (2009) [virus infection] remain below levels observed during the
2009 winter pandemic wave. The majority of influenza viruses detected
during the current winter epidemic have been H1N1 (2009).

In India, community transmission of H1N1 (2009) remained active and
moderately intense in several states, most notably in the states of
Maharashtra but also in several other western and southern states
(Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu). Between
mid-June 2010 and the 2nd week of August 2010, the state of
Maharashtra reported consecutive weekly increases in the number of
new cases, including numbers of new fatal cases; the epidemic does
not appear to have peaked in Maharashtra, but the rate of increase in
the numbers of new cases appears to have slowed. The epidemic appears
to have stabilized or begun to decline in several other affected
states. Seasonal influenza B viruses are also known to be currently
circulating in India, although at lower levels than H1N1 (2009) viruses.

Except in South Africa and New Zealand, overall influenza activity
and rates of respiratory diseases remained low in other countries of
the temperate southern hemisphere (Australia, Chile, and Argentina).
In South Africa, active circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 and
type B viruses was observed during June through mid-August 2010. In
Argentina, there are unconfirmed media reports of localized influenza
outbreaks in at least one part of the country.

(Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the
Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries
in tropical regions are defined as those between these 2 latitudes).

Map Of Influenza Activity And Virus Subtypes (Week 31: 1-7 Aug 2010)

Map of influenza activity and virus subtypes [jpg 840kb] (see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/don2010_08_20.jpg>).

Description: Displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to
Flunet (<http://www.who.int/FluNet>), WHO regional offices or on
Ministry of health websites in the last 2 weeks. The percent of
specimens tested positive for influenza includes all specimens tested
positive for seasonal or pandemic influenza. The pie charts show the
distribution of virus subtypes among all specimens that were tested
positive for influenza. The available country data were joined in
larger geographical areas with similar influenza transmission
patterns to be able to give an overview
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/transmission_zones/en>).

Qualitative indicators (Week 29, 2009 to Week 31, 2010: 13 Jul 2009-7 Aug 2010)
The maps below display information on the qualitative indicators
reported. Information is available for approximately 60 countries
each week. Implementation of this monitoring system is ongoing, and
completeness of reporting is expected to increase over time.
