Outbreak of pneumococcal pneumonia among shipyard workers in Marseille, France, January to February 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
----------
We report the 3rd outbreak of pneumococcal pneumonia within one year among workers in European shipyards. During January and February 2020, 37 cases of pneumonia were identified in a shipyard in Marseille, southeastern France. Outbreak control measures were implemented, including a mass vaccination campaign with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine targeting all shipyard workers. Given the high mobility of shipyard workers, coordinated responses between European public health institutes are necessary to avoid further outbreaks.

Introduction
-----------
On 27 Jan 2020, the University Hospital Institute-Mediterranee Infection (IHU) reported to the regional health agency (ARS) 6 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia that had occurred within the 10 previous days among contractors at the shipyard of Marseille, southeastern France.

Here we describe the preliminary results of the ongoing investigations, the control measures implemented, and discuss further measures that should be undertaken at a larger scale.

Outbreak description
-------------------
Until 6 Feb 2020, we recorded 18 probable and 19 confirmed cases. All cases except for one were male with a median age of 39 years (range: 22-66 years). All cases were identified among workers, except for 4 crew members. The onset of disease ranged between 9 Jan and 6 Feb 2020 (Figure). Medical history was collected for 17 cases of pneumonia: half of them were smokers, 4 had a chronic respiratory disease, 2 had a heart disease and one was diabetic. As at 12 Mar 2020, no new cases have been identified after 6 Feb 2020; 35 cases have recovered and probably left Marseille, and 2 cases were still hospitalised.

Among the 37 cases of pneumonia, 18 were hospitalised, including 5 in an intensive care unit. 17 cases were co-infected with a virus, including 6 cases with influenza virus.

Nine cases of pneumococcal pneumonia were confirmed by positive urinary pneumococcal antigen, 4 by isolation from blood or endobronchial samples and 6 by both detection methods. All 10 _S. pneumoniae_ isolates were sent to the NRL for Pneumococcus for serotyping. Serotyping was performed with the use of latex particles sensitised with pool, group, type and factor antisera provided by the Statens Serum Institut (Copenhagen, Denmark). The following serotypes were identified from blood cultures of 8 patients, serotype 3 (n = 1), 4 (n = 4), 8 (n = 2) and 9N (n = 1), and an additional serotype 4 from the endobronchial sample of another patient. Whole genome sequencing of isolates and analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs are ongoing.

Discussion
--------
Regarding community-acquired pneumonia in adults, outbreaks of pneumococcal disease have been described in close and crowded environments (prisons, care facilities, shelters) [5]. Several risk factors related to these outbreaks have been identified, including smoking, people 65 years and older, poor nutritional status, immunosuppression, several comorbidities and respiratory viral infections [6]. IPD is a well-known complication of influenza [7].

Pneumococcal outbreaks had not been reported in shipyards before 2015 [5]. In 2015, 9 cases of serious pneumococcal disease were identified in Northern Ireland [8]. Three IPD cases were reported at a shipyard in Singapore in 2017 [9]. In 2019, one outbreak occurred in Norway and a 2nd in Finland with 20 and 37 cases, respectively [10,11]. Notably, in the latter, 3 different _S. pneumoniae_ serotypes were isolated from blood cultures of 25 cases. Over the course of a year, Europe has recorded 3 outbreaks in different shipyards, raising concerns over the risk of pneumococcal disease in people working in crowded and polluted environments. Welders are recognised to be at greater risk to develop IPD owing to their exposure to metal fumes. Vaccination with PPV23 is recommended in the United Kingdom for this population [12-14]. France does not have specific guidelines for this occupational group.

The cases identified in the shipyard of Marseille presented several risk factors for pneumococcal disease including exposures to respiratory irritants, smoking and viral coinfections. Workers lived and worked in crowded environments. Several occupations that facilitated exposure to respiratory irritants were identified among the pneumonia cases: technicians (n = 7), interior outfitters and installers (n = 6), fire-guards (n = 2), managers (n = 2), painter, a welder and a carpenter. Seven of them reported direct exposure to dust, solvent or metal fumes. As in the 2019 outbreak in Finland [11], several different serotypes were present. Serotype distribution differs across countries depending on vaccination policies, among other factors. For example, serotype 4 has not been prevalent in France since the implementation of child vaccination with PCV13 [15]. The question remains whether the onset of pneumococcal pneumonia in these outbreaks may be attributable to a propagated outbreak with spread from person to person and/or a shift from commensal to pathogen under favourable conditions (workplace exposure, viral infections).

Outbreak control measures were difficult to implement as workers came from different countries with different vaccination strategies, spoke different languages and were employed by several contactors. In addition, the goal of vaccinating 4300 workers and crew members was difficult to achieve as the vaccination campaign had to be completed within 5 days because of the departure date of the ship and of the workers.

[The journal article above reports the 3rd outbreak of pneumococcal pneumonia within one year among workers in European shipyards. This outbreak occurred in Marseille between 9 Jan and 6 Feb 2020 and involved 37 cases among multinational temporary shipyard workers who were housed in crowded quarters and exposed to fumes, dust and solvents at the work site. The microbial diagnosis was confirmed in 19 cases by positive urinary pneumococcal antigen (9 cases) and positive blood culture and/or endobronchial sample (10 cases). Four different serotypes were identified. Whole genome sequencing of isolates is ongoing. 17 cases were co-infected with a virus, including 6 cases with influenza virus. Certain respiratory viral infections, especially influenza, can be complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia due to _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ or _Staphylococcus aureus_, and less commonly _Haemophilus influenzae_ or _Streptococcus pyogenes_.

Measures to control this shipyard outbreak included a mass pneumococcal vaccination program with pneumococcal polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine (PPV23) that was given to 1460 of 4300 shipyard workers and crew members. The 23-valent vaccine was used to protect against a larger number of pneumococcus serotypes because the serotypes of the outbreak strains were unknown at the time.

_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is a Gram-positive bacterium with more than 90 known serotypes, based on the antigenic specificity of the organism's capsular polysaccharide. Pneumococci are spread person-to-person when nasopharyngeal carriers of the organism sneeze or cough, releasing airborne droplets among close contacts in crowded settings. Pneumococci can cause an asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier state, otitis media, sinusitis, non-bacteremic pneumonia, and invasive pneumococcal disease, such as bacteremic pneumonia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, peritonitis, and meningitis. At high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease are children younger than 2 years of age, persons who have certain underlying conditions such as HIV infection, and those 65 years of age and older. Although all serotypes may cause serious disease, a relatively small number of serotypes cause the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease.

Outbreaks of pneumococcal disease have been reported in nursing homes (http://www.immunize.org/reports/report053.asp), shelters for the homeless (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7420632?dopt=Abstract), military camps (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/441.abstract?ijkey=480be94b029ef0ef87beb11be36bfeb82d99300e&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha), and childcare centers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717096/). A large clonal outbreak due to serotype 5 with a particular genotype (ST289) occurred in western Canada in the years 2005-2009 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/5/11-0235_article). Several outbreaks of pneumococcal pneumonia have been reported in shipyards since 2015. See prior ProMED-mail posts archive nos. 20150529.3393444, 20150522. 3375546, and 20150519.3372317. Shipyard welders and exposure to metal fumes are recognized risk factors.

Marseille is a port city on the Mediterranean, in the region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur of France, with a population of 870 018 in 2016 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille).
