The 1st outbreak of Australian Grapevine Yellows (AGY) in the Clare Valley, South Australia, was recorded in January 2017. Two samples of _Vitis vinifera_ cv. Cabernet Sauvignon from an 18 year old vineyard tested positive.

About 20 per cent of the vines showed yellowing symptoms with stunted growth and shrivelled bunches. The vines have been showing decline for the last few years but now for the first time the phytoplasma pathogen in the area has been detected by PCR. The winery has decided to destroy the vineyard.

The last recorded AGY outbreak in South Australia was in 2014 in the Riverland, 226 km to the east. AGY has been previously reported in other Australian states. For example, a previous outbreak in NSW in 2004 was confirmed both by symptoms and molecular analysis.

We have also recently reported the closely related disease strawberry lethal yellows (SLY) in South Australia [ProMED-mail post 20161006.4542180].

[The name 'grapevine yellows' is used for a number of diseases caused by different phytoplasmas that affect grapevines worldwide. Australian grapevine yellows (AGY) has so far only been reported in Australia and is caused by a strain of _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma australiense (CPA; stolbur group, 16SrXII). The AGY pathogen is closely related to, or identical with, phytoplasmas associated with strawberry lethal yellows (SLY), strawberry green petal disease, yellow leaf disease of New Zealand flax (_Phormium tenax_) and papaya dieback. It is thought that CPA may have originated in New Zealand and then spread to Australia and possibly other countries in the region.

Symptoms of AGY vary with host cultivar and may include chlorosis along leaf veins, backward rolling of affected leaves, shoot tip dieback, black pustules on green bark, premature flower drop, shrivelled berries and stunting of plants. Yield losses in sensitive grapevine varieties can be severe.

CPA may be spread by leafhopper vectors (Cicadellidae), depending on the host, and with infected plant material, such as grapevine cuttings and rootstocks. Symptom development is often slow and, depending on the host and environmental conditions, asymptomatic infections may also occur. Thus, freedom of symptoms cannot be taken as proof of freedom from CPA. Disease management may include vector control, removal of potential reservoir hosts and removal of symptomatic plants, but certification of planting material by molecular methods is essential for pathogen exclusion.

As mentioned above, the related SLY has also recently been detected in South Australia (ProMED-mail post 20161006.4542180). While both AGY and SLY were identified by CPA-specific PCR analysis, this did not include complete genome sequencing. It therefore remains to be investigated whether both pathogens are identical and may have spread between the two hosts, or if they are different CPA strains that vary in host range.

Stolbur phytoplasmas, alone or in coinfections, have been reported to affect a range of dicotyledoneous crops (including tomato, potato, capsicum, aubergine, grapevine, sugar beet), as well as a few monocot hosts such as maize and sugarcane (ProMED-mail posts 20070607.1844 and 20080303.0869).
