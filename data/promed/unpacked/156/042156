School meals hospitalize 130
-----------------------------
Over 130 elementary school students were hospitalized after outbreaks of
suspected food poisoning in 4 separate schools this week, local reports
said on Wed, 31 Mar 2004.
The local al-Ahram newspaper reported that 47 students fell ill on Tue, 30
Mar in the Gharbiya governorate north of Cairo. The same newspaper reported
similar incidents earlier in the week. The other incidents took place in 2
neighborhoods in Greater Cairo and in Minya south of Cairo.
Police and health ministry officials are investigating the incidents.
However, the outbreaks are believed to have been caused by biscuits
provided in school canteens.
"For the 4th time this week, public school students were poisoned from
eating biscuits high in iron distributed as school meals," the 31 Mar 2004
issue of al-Ahram said. Most of the students were released from hospital
the same day, the report said.
In Jan 2004, there were reports of a similar wave of suspected food
poisoning among students who consumed biscuits distributed in school lunches.

[The symptoms manifested in this outbreak and the time between the
suspected ingestion and the onset of illness are not stated in the
posting. Iron toxicity initially presents as nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain within 1-2 hours after the ingestion of doses of 10 to 20
mg/kg of the equivalent of elemental iron. If the toxicity is profound,
subsequent systemic effects include hypotension and shock as well as
hepatoxicity. Specific management can include limiting iron absorption by
using activated charcoal and/or by administering compounds (phosphates or
bicarbonates) that complex with iron in the gut to produce insoluble salts.
Desferroxiamine can be administered systemically to complex with iron in
appropriate circumstances.
