A deadly virus is said to have claimed the lives of more than 180 of
British Queen's swans.

According to David Barber, the Royal Swan Marker, fewer cygnets will
be born on River Thames this year [2011] because duck virus enteritis
is killing birds, many of them breeding pairs, the British media
reported.

He expects to confirm the decline in births during next month's Swan
Upping, the annual census that dates back to the 12th century, which
takes place between Sunbury in Surrey and Abingdon in Oxfordshire.

A harsh winter and attacks by youths have also had an impact, Baber
said. "Shootings are up in the past year. These cause horrific
injuries and slow deaths," he said.

[Duck virus enteritis (DVE) or duck plague, a disease included in
OIE's list of notifiable animal diseases, is an acute contagious
infection of ducks, geese, and swans (order Anseriformes) caused by a
herpesvirus. Diagnosis is based on a combination of assessing the
clinical signs, gross pathology, and histopathology supported by
identification of the virus by either isolation or polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The disease is not zoonotic.

UK's annual reports to the OIE indicated the absence of DVE in 2005;
no information on this disease is available in later reports.
Laboratory confirmation or otherwise is requested.

Information on the due ceremonies related to the traditional Royal
Swan Upping, 18-22 Jul 2011, is accessible at
http://www.windsor.gov.uk/site/whats-on/royal-swan-upping-2011-p456491.
Sunbury and Abingdon can be located via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/0YqI.

Additional information on DVE, including diagnostic methods and
vaccines (production and testing) is available at
