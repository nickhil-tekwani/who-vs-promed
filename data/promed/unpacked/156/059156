[ProMED-mail has reported on the rising incidence of syphilis in various locations throughout the USA and other countries. (See prior ProMED-mail posts listed below). The news report above gives no detailed information about the outbreak in Pima County, Arizona, specifically whether this outbreak is occurring among men who have sex with men (MSM), whether there is an associated high incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, or whether there is an association with use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners or smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. These factors have been common in syphilis outbreaks elsewhere, and knowing whether they feature in this Pima County outbreak is important so that disease control programs can effectively target efforts to limit continued transmission.

A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV infected gay men seek out other HIV positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, but of course, this situation allows transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases (Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

Pima County is located in the south central region of the US state of Arizona. The county's population of 980 263 in 2010 is mostly concentrated in the city of Tucson (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona). - Mod.ML
