KUSHTIA, May 24: Viral fever and jaundice have broken out in an epidemic
form in different parts of the district.
At least 2,000 people have been attacked with viral fever in 14 days.
According to physicians, symptoms of the fever are high temperature,
muscular pain and headache. Poor and the distressed people are the worst
suffers as they are deprived of proper medicare due to financial problems.
Local health complexes lack sufficient supply of medicines for treatment of
the affected people. Patients are given only prescriptions
instead of necessary medicines. They can not afford to buy medicines as the
prices are high in the market, local people said.
On the other hand, jaundice is spreading in the area due to ignorance of
the people. The patients are often seen going to quacks for treatment.
Physicians said, "complete rest and drink of sufficient water are the only
treatment for the disease."

[This is an excellent example of how ProMED-mail subscribers can contribute
by alerting the world to outbreaks which have not yet reached the attention
of the major news wires. Many thanks, Michael.
There are 2 epidemics reported here. The high fever could be due to
influenza, or to dengue or another mosquito-borne virus. Although viral
hepatitis is a likely cause of the jaundice, it could also be leptospirosis,
which is caused by a bacterium. Lab diagnosis is sorely needed. Perhaps our
Bangladeshi friends on "mignet" can give us more details? - Mod.JW]
