Re Echinococcosis, foxes - France (02) 20071225.4132
-------------------------------------------------------
Just another clarification to the following sentence:
"- "meat" is not an appropriate word as larvae are found, most of the
time, in the liver, lungs, spleen, and very infrequently in muscles."
Actually, according to EU regulation (n. 853/2004), 'Meat' means
edible parts of the animals, ........., including blood.
Although, from a mere biochemical point of view, meat is what muscles
become after hanging, the term "meat" is used to indicate all edible
parts of the animals, including certain viscera, such as liver, lungs
and spleen.
