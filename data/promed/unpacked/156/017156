Olive killer bacteria found on Corsica
--------------------------------------
Officials on Corsica took emergency measures after the discovery of a bacterium that could ravage fruit and olive oil production. _Xylella fastidiosa_ has already killed thousands of olive trees in the Italian region of Puglia and is considered a threat to olive production around the Mediterranean. The 1st-ever infection by _Xylella fastidiosa_ on the island was found on an ornamental tree in southern Corsica.

The spread of the bacteria could do serious harm to the local economy. Officials sprung into action, ripping up the plant and those around it and disinfesting the area. They are worried that the infected plant was apparently planted in 2010.

That raises 2 worrying questions -- was it already infected, in which case has the bacteria spread elsewhere, or, even more worrying, was it infected by another plant that has not been identified.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem in infected plants, causing wilting, necrosis and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crops causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; phony disease of peach; leaf scald of plum; variegated chlorosis of citrus; lucerne dwarf; as well as leaf scorch of elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander and other woody ornamentals. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported and these may serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. Several subspecies have been proposed and more research is needed to determine host range and risks to crops of the spectrum of Xf strains.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors including several species of sharpshooters (including _Carneocephala_, _Draeculacephala_, _Graphocephala_, and _Homalodisca_ species). It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seed-borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control.

The pathogen has been reported mainly from the Americas, but was recently confirmed for the 1st time in Asia, on grapevine in Taiwan (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). It seems likely that the outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, and 20140424.2425497) represents the 1st report of the pathogen in Europe. While a source of the European incursion is currently still unproven, suggestions that it was due to contaminated imports of plant material appear likely. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern, especially outside of the Americas.

The pathogen has been added to the quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). The EU has strengthened its measures to prevent its spread and the list of regulated plants has been expanded to 160 species and 27 genera. Xf was reported for the 1st time from France earlier this year (2015) on ornamental coffee plants in Paris (ProMED-mail post 20150422.3313661). In Corsica, the possibility of Xf being present was already considered in 2014 and an alert was raised (ProMED-mail post 20140820.2708739).

The Xf pathotype affecting oleander, almond, and coffee also affects olives and appears to be the one currently spreading in Europe. Although the host species and/or Xf strain involved the incursion in Corsica is not mentioned above, the risk that this is the olive-infecting strain must be considered and the strict measures taken by authorities are justified.
