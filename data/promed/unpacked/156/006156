During the last 3 days [20-23 Aug 2013], 35 people became ill from tularemia in the Khanty-Mansiysk [Khanty-Mansiy] town of Ugra. Among the ill were 4 children.

Today [23 Aug 2013], the District Office of Epidemiology had a press conference providing the following information: "Cases presented with a marked rise in temperature to 39-40 C [102-104 F], headache, chills, weakness, muscle pain and swollen lymph nodes. Most had evidence of an inflamed insect bite of a mosquito or midge. Patients have been hospitalized in the infectious disease ward of the district hospital and have a moderate degree of severity," said the press service.

It was stressed that the main source of tularemia is infected rodents. Infection of humans occurs through the bite of a mosquito or a gnat but can also be from contaminated food or airborne dust containing the organism that then contaminates water and/or food, or from direct contact with diseased rodents.

Tularemia is a zoonosis. The causative agent of the disease is a bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_. The known carriers include: hares, rabbits, water rats, and voles. In nature, epizootic outbreaks occur periodically. The infection is transmitted to humans through direct contact with animals or through contaminated food and water, sometimes by aspiration.

[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter. Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation, with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. The type of disease in this case is not stated. - Mod.LL
