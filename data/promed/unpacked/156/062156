The Agriculture and Food Ministry announced that 143 cows have tested
positive for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in southeastern Bulgaria,
close to the border with Turkey.

The animals live on a farm outside any community, in a forest. The
infection most probably spread from wild animals. The farm is located
close to the village of Kirovo [Burgas province], southeastern
municipality of Sredets, the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency said.

The animals in the village are out of danger for now, because they
have not been in contact with any of the above-mentioned cows. No
quarantine will be imposed in the region. All 143 cows will be killed
and their owner will be paid compensations, the agency added.

A new outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been discovered in
Bulgaria's Burgas district, a day before the European Commission was
expected to lift the measures, imposed on the area because of the
previous FMD cases.

A total of 143 animals will be killed after the virus was discovered
in the tissue of cows during a routine check at a private farm near
the village of Kirovo, close to the border with Turkey. The blood
samples for FMD turned out negative, which means that the
contamination is a week old, according to experts from the Food Safety
Agency.

[If the farm is isolated, surrounded by forest, and the disease is a
week old, it is very persuasive that it might be as a result of nearby
wildlife being infected. If that is so, and it is very speculative, it
will probably delay full restocking. Logically it would begin with a
limited number of sentinel animals. Wild game and farmed game of
species susceptible to FMD in Bulgaria, are addressed in Commission
Decision 2011/44/EU, available at
<http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:019:0020:0033:EN:PDF>.
