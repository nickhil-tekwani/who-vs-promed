Almost 200 people, mostly children 2 to 17 years, have suffered foodborne illness in an outbreak of salmonellosis in a college of San Bartolome de Tirajana (Gran Canaria), which has been forced to hospitalize 18 pupils in different centers.

This outbreak of salmonellosis, the largest ever recorded in the archipelago, occurred at the South Sands School after one of the food handlers of this center of private education contaminated a pasta salad that was served as lunch with _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis. This was reported today, 5 May 2014, by the director general of Public Health of the Government of the Canary islands, Jose Diaz Flores. The analysis of his department did not attribute the outbreak of salmonellosis to the dish made with sauce and egg but to the deficient hygienic-sanitary practices of the food handler.

Flores said that there are 199 persons ill due to this bacterium, 191 of them children, and 8 were workers at the school, of which 18 have been admitted with a fever, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, although they have improved and are expected to be discharged.

Public Health does not believe that the outbreak will continue to increase because the incubation period of this disease is between 24-72 hours, and the 1st cases were detected Wednesday afternoon [30 Apr 2014]. From 30 Apr through 1 May 2014, there had been a continuous flow of ill people affected, mainly children, in the health centers of the south and from the island's capital.

[Serotype Enteritidis is often associated with undercooked eggs or egg products. The posting seems to imply that the food is not at fault but rather the sanitary practices of the food handler. Given the serotype, it is likely that the reservoir was uncooked eggs or sauce made from raw eggs, and the food handler was implicated for inadequate cooking or poor kitchen hygiene techniques rather than the food handler being infected and, by poor hand washing, contaminating the eggs and/or sauce.

Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. However, most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and are contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell is formed. - Mod.LL
