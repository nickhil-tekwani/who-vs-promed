Health authorities confirmed Tuesday [31 Dec 2013] that a Chinese tourist in Taiwan has been infected with the H7N9 strain of [avian influenza], marking the 2nd imported H7N9 infection this year [2013]. The infected, an 86-year-old man from Jiangsu Province, is still in Taiwan receiving treatment, though most of his 25-person tour group has already returned to China, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 2 of his daughters have stayed with him but have thus far shown no symptoms associated with the virus.

The man entered Taiwan [17 Dec 2013] and began showing symptoms 2 days later, starting with a loss of appetite. On [23 Dec 2013], he reported tightness of the chest before being rushed to an emergency room the next day, where he was put on a ventilator to treat pneumonia. An infectious diseases experts familiar with the case said he was not surprised by the 2nd case of H7N9 coming from China following the 1st back in April [2013]. Even so, this patient's symptoms were slightly different from previously reported infections, indicating that doctors still face some difficulty in diagnosing the virus, he added. The man's infection could mean that H7N9 has become prevalent across all of southern China even though, puzzlingly, major duck and chicken farms in the region have been found disease-free.

"Beware of the virus if you see any ducks in the Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) area," he cautioned.

[The analysis of this 2nd case of avian A/H7N9) influenza virus infection is consistent with an interpretation that the infection occurred in China prior to travel of the patient to Taiwan. No other persons are known to have become infected. However according to this report some difficulty was encountered in confirming the diagnosis. Another puzzling feature is that the largest duck and chicken farms in the Jiangsu province of China have been found disease-free. - Mod.CP
