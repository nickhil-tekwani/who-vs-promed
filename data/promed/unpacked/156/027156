[Dr Calisher's comments below are in response to the previous post
(20070621.2007) that reports an increase in populations of deer mice
(_Peromyscus maniculatus_), hosts of Sin Nombre hantavirus, in New Mexico,
United States. - Mod.TY]
Although the statements by Dr Terry Yates and Mr DiMenna regarding the
current situation regarding deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_)
populations, Sin Nombre virus, and the probability of the occurrence of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in New Mexico are no doubt correct for New
Mexico, those statements should be recognized as being pertinent to that
state, not necessarily to the entire south western US. Weather conditions
in the western US can be quite focal, and results of either very wet or
very dry conditions can be correspondingly focal.
Since 1994, we have been trapping rodents (emphasizing deer mice) and
testing them for antibody to Sin Nombre virus, the hantavirus recognized as
the principal etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the US
and Canada. Recently, we trapped at 2 locations where, in the past, we had
captured as many as 100 deer mice in 3 days, but we captured only 7 and 2
deer mice in 2 days each at those sites. We would have expected not only
many more deer mice but at least a few infected deer mice; none was found
to be infected.
Because both of these sites are so close to the border between New Mexico
and Colorado, I called Terry Yates' laboratory and was surprised to hear
that they had a quite different set of results.
Were I to try to predict this season's [2007] overall number of cases of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Colorado, it would not be a high number. I
am too experienced to make such predictions however, so, for now, let us
just say "we will have to see". The State of Colorado is large, and we have
trapped only at relatively few places. Nonetheless, our results and Terry's
may be useful in demonstrating the wide variation in not only rodent
population densities but virus prevalence from place to place. Our winter
(2006-2007) in Colorado was a wet but a very cold one (we have found that
increased rodent populations occur after warm and wet winters), which may
account for at least some of the difference. For further information
regarding the basis for these statements, see:
Calisher CH, Mills JN, Sweeney W, Root JJ, Reeder SA, Jentes ES, et al.
Population dynamics of a diverse rodent assemblage in mixed grass-shrub
habitat, southeastern Colorado, 1995-2000. J Wildl Dis 2005; 41: 12-28.
Calisher CH, Root JJ, Mills JN, Rowe JE, Reeder SA, Jentes ES, et al.
Epizootiology of Sin Nombre and El Moro Canyon hantaviruses, southeastern
Colorado, 1995-2000. J Wildl Dis 2005; 41: 1-11.
These ecologic differences provide evidence for the need for continuing
studies. If we are to understand epidemiologic parameters and events
leading to human disease caused by hantaviruses, a great deal more of the
epidemiologic mosaic must be taken into consideration and accounted for.
Simply keeping track of numerators, a relatively passive approach, as so
many public health organizations do, is not useful and is no longer acceptable.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Calisher for reminding us that weather effects on
ecosystems, including wild hosts of pathogens, can be dramatically
different from one place to another. These changes can occur even within a
given state in the USA, so generalizations in the absence of good field
data should be made with considerable caution, particularly for small
mammal hosts with limited mobility. The point made about the need for long
term field studies in order to understand dynamics of host populations and
their endemic viruses is well taken. - Mod.TY]
