Abstract
--------
Objectives: To compare risk factors for COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and White patients.
Design: Retrospective cohort study
Setting: 5 hospitals within a single academic health system
Participants: 3086 adult patients with self-reported race/ethnicity information presenting to the emergency department and hospitalized with COVID-19 up to 13 Apr 2020.
Main outcome measures: In-hospital mortality
Results: While older age (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.07) and baseline hypoxia (OR 2.71, CI 2.17-3.36) were associated with increased mortality overall and across all races/ethnicities, non-Hispanic Black (median age 67, interquartile range [IQR] 58-76) and Hispanic (median age 63, IQR 50-74) patients were younger and had different comorbidity profiles compared to non-Hispanic White patients (median age 73, IQR 62-84).
Conclusions: This analysis of a multi-ethnic cohort highlights the need for inclusion and consideration of diverse populations in ongoing COVID-19 trials targeting inflammatory cytokines.

Discussion
----------
Racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and outcomes have become apparent in both the USA and elsewhere. The causes of these disparities are complex and multifactorial and must be considered in the context of the social determinants of health.

Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was highest in non-Hispanic White patients, but multivariable analysis showed that race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor of mortality in this cohort. It remains unclear whether race and ethnicity are independent risk factors for COVID-19 mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. Large national-level studies in the UK and Brazil have reported race as an independent predictor of mortality, whereas smaller studies in the USA have not (1,13,14 [see source URL for references]), possibly due to statistical power or population differences.

Changes in clinical management and outcomes of COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic may also complicate comparisons of results from different time periods (17). In this New York City patient population, race/ethnicity was not an independent predictor for mortality.

Despite recapitulating several known risk factors, such as age, male sex, and hypoxia, we found only suggestive but non-significant interactions between Black race, diabetes and obesity, both of which tended to increase the mortality risk of Black patients to a greater degree than White patients. Notably, when analyzing inflammatory markers for their association with mortality, we found a significant interaction between the non-Hispanic Black population and the inflammatory cytokine IL-1B.

In conclusion, our analysis of a diverse cohort drawn from the New York metropolitan area highlights both similarities and important differences across racial/ethnic groups in risk factors for death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The findings identified across populations call for conscious inclusion in future cohort studies and clinical trials to ensure the efficacy of potential diagnostics and treatments across diverse individuals.

[2] Netherlands: reimpose face masks
Date: Tue 2 Nov 2021 18:05 EDT
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-weigh-vaccine-boosters-new-restrictions-covid-19-cases-surge-2021-11-02/


The Dutch government on Tuesday [2 Nov 2021] decided to reimpose measures, including the wearing of face masks, aimed at slowing the latest spike in COVID-19 infections, prime minister Mark Rutte said. The use of a "corona pass", showing proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or recent negative coronavirus test, would be broadened as of 6 Nov 2021 to public places including museums, gyms and outdoor terraces, Rutte said.

Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have been rising for a month after most social distancing measures were scrapped in late September [2021] and reached their highest level since July in the past week. This has forced many hospitals to cut back on regular care again, to make room for urgent COVID-19 cases.

In a televised news conference, Rutte called on all Dutch, vaccinated and unvaccinated, to stick to basic hygiene rules and to stay at home if they had symptoms of a possible infection. "Our own behaviour is crucial, a very large part of our coronavirus policy depends on it," the prime minister said. Face masks will be reintroduced in stores and other public places, while people are advised to work at home for at least half of the time. The government next week could decide to broaden the use of the corona pass to the workplace, Rutte said.

Dutch health authorities on Tuesday [2 Nov 2021] recommended COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for older adults. Around 84% of the Dutch adult population has been vaccinated.

As of Tuesday [2 Nov 2021], new infections were up nearly 40% week-on-week to more than 300 infections per 100 000 people, approaching peaks previously seen in July 2021 and in December and October 2020. The strain on hospitals is an immediate concern, as the country's National Institute for Health said on Tuesday admissions were up 31% in the past week, with unvaccinated patients accounting for most hospitalisations.

Among people testing positive in the past month, about 52% said they were unvaccinated, while 45% said they were fully vaccinated, according to RIVM data. Earlier on Tuesday [2 Nov 2021], the country's Health Council recommended that fully vaccinated adults aged 60 and older should begin receiving a booster shot. Rutte's government routinely adopts the council's recommendations.

[Other countries are locking down again to combat rising case numbers. "Russia is set to reimpose strict COVID-19 lockdown measures as the country records its highest daily cases since the pandemic began. In Moscow, businesses are being forced to shut and residents told to stay home for at least 10 days" (https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/russia-goes-into-covid-lockdown-as-new-cases-surge-124806725696).

"Latvia plans to impose a 4-week lock down to slow the spread of coronavirus after a surge in cases threatened to overwhelm hospitals, Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said, according to the Leta newswire" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-18/latvia-plans-to-reimpose-lockdown-after-covid-spike-leta-says), from Claudinne Miller, Tulane Outbreak News (<cmiller15@tulane.edu>).

[3] Pfizer vaccine: children
Date: Tue 2 Nov 2021

Children ages 5-11 should be vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) said on Tuesday [2 Nov 2021]. ACIP voted 14-0 to recommend vaccinating this population with a 2-dose regimen of 10 Î¼g apiece, 21 days apart, citing the favorable benefit-risk association, the idea of restoring normalcy to children, and especially the extensive data presented by Food and Drug Administration and CDC staff.

Several hours later, CDC director Rochelle Walensky signed these recommendations. Earlier in the day, she once again addressed the panel. "Today is a monumental day in the course of this pandemic and one that many of us will be very eager to see," she said, adding that since the 1st vaccines were authorized for ages 16 and up, the question has been when protection might be expanded to younger children.

This is a "recommendation likely to have tremendous impact," Walensky said. She said she was eager to see how committee members "interpret what we know and acknowledge areas of uncertainty." Walensky also said that 745 children have died of COVID during the pandemic, including 94 children ages 5-11, and over 2300 children in this population have been diagnosed with multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).

Many committee members spoke as parents and grandparents and explained how they have vaccinated their children and grandchildren. Consumer representative Veronica McNally got a bit choked up when talking about how she would vaccinate her child after this recommendation, and would do so to prevent "the 95th death" in a child.

In an unusual move, several liaison representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP), and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) read statements in support of vaccination for this age-group prior to the ACIP vote.

Even normally skeptical ACIP members were on the side of the vaccine. Sarah Long, MD, of Drexel University in Philadelphia, who previously expressed hesitation about risk of vaccine-associated myocarditis in other age groups, said she was "very supportive" of this recommendation, given the large amount of data presented by the FDA and manufacturer, as well as because of the lower dose. "We have one more vaccine that saves the lives of children and we should be very confident to employ it to the maximum to do what it was meant to do without significant concerns of serious adverse events," she said.

All eyes were on one rare side effect, vaccine-associated myocarditis. CDC staff presented data on vaccine-associated myocarditis showing that it occurs less frequently in younger children, and no cases of myocarditis were observed within the clinical trial.

Matthew Oster of CDC noted the incidence of vaccine-associated myocarditis would be about one in every 10 000-20 000 individuals for this age-group. McNally asked Oster point-blank if given the information today, in his medical opinion, do the benefits outweigh the risks of vaccination. "In my opinion, yes," Oster said.

While ACIP members were united in their support for the vaccine, Matthew Daley of Kaiser Permanente Colorado in Aurora, acknowledged those who are against this recommendation. "I feel like collectively we're stronger when we hear from dissenting voices," he said. "Of course, you only want what's best for your child. It's understandable that you have questions given" the disinformation campaign against the vaccine, Daley said.

Several ACIP members stressed the importance of talking to pediatricians about the vaccine, and pediatricians recommending the vaccine to their patients. We will "end this pandemic with science leading the charge", Walensky said.

[Also see STAT article by Helen Branswell (https://tinyurl.com/3ac5s2wv): "Polling estimates vary, with between 34% and 57% of parents surveyed saying they plan to have their children in this age-group immunized, CDC's Sara Oliver, an epidemiologist, told ACIP members during a presentation Tuesday."

See also this report from National Public Radio (https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/11/02/1051301705/cdc-advisors-recommend-pfizers-covid-vaccine-for-children-ages-5-through-11): "The CDC's latest data show that 172 children ages 5-11 have died from COVID-19 and more than 8300 have been hospitalized.

"'We also know that beyond the clinical impact of COVID on children, there have been detrimental social and mental health impacts that we are just beginning to fully understand,' Walensky said in giving her charge to the panel."

"The most recent CDC data from September 2021 show that 38% of children in the 5-11 age-group have antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19, indicating that they've been infected. Dr Jefferson Jones, a medical officer with the CDC, said that young children are at least as likely to be infected as adults. More than 1.9 million cases have been reported in 5 to 11 year olds.

"Overall, there have been more than 8300 children ages 5-11 hospitalized with COVID-19. More than 2300 children in this age-group have gotten a related illness called MIS-C, a severe condition that affects multiple organs and can be fatal. The 5-11 age group had the highest number of cases of MIS-C among children."

Even with the case for vaccination of 5 to 11 year old children being very strong, with the extent of vaccine hesitancy that exists in the USA, it will be interesting to see how many parents get their children vaccinated, unless it is mandated by the schools. - Mod.LK]
