Health authorities in Uganda have confirmed the death of 3 more Ebola patients in the country, days after declaring an outbreak of a strain of the disease in a central district.

In a statement released on Friday [23 Sep 2022], the health ministry said the total deaths attributable to the outbreak -- confirmed and suspected -- stood at 11. It also said the total number of confirmed cases now stood at 11 after 4 more infections were confirmed in the past 24 hours. Nineteen others suspected of contracting Ebola were receiving treatment at a hospital, the ministry added.

The NGO Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has set up an Ebola treatment center in Uganda's Mubende district in the central region of the country in the interest of responding to the newly declared outbreak in support of the Ugandan Ministry of Health.

The organization is also considering opening a 2nd center in Madudu, a town 25 kilometers (15.5 mi) further north where the 1st person to die from the Ebola outbreak was from and where several suspected cases have been reported, MSF said in a statement.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, 58 possible cases have been reported, and 11 deaths have been counted, according to data from the Ugandan Ministry of Health, which is why it has asked MSF for help to gather health, logistical and epidemiological teams to intervene as soon as possible.

In this regard, MSF has detailed that, "immediately after" the declaration of the Ebola outbreak in Uganda -- which followed the detection of an infected person in the center of the country -- the Ugandan health authorities requested support in their efforts to fight the spread of the disease.

"From MSF, we are assembling a team composed of medical, epidemiology and logistics staff with experience in hemorrhagic fever case management. The plan is for the team to be ready to start work early next week," the organization said in a statement.

The NGO has also expressed the willingness of the country's Ministry of Health to intervene wherever needs are identified, while pointing out that the priority is to improve patient care within the existing structure.

The last Ebola outbreak in the country occurred in 2019, when MSF also intervened to support Ugandan health authorities in the management of people who had been in contact with confirmed cases.
