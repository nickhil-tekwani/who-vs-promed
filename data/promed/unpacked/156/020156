Another bird flu infected farm detected by antibodies
-----------------------------------------------
Japan has detected another bird flu case, in a poultry farm with 300 000
chickens, by serological tests that indicate an H5 past infection.
The Ogawa farm GP Center of Aikeien Co. Ltd is in Nakanobu district,
Ogawamchi town, Higashi Ibaraki county, Ibaraki Prefecture.
The positive tests were found in 5 closed-system poultry compartments on
the farm. This farm is 5 km southeast of the Minori farm, where antibodies
against H5 had been detected on 22 Aug 2005. 14 poultry farms had been
previously put under movement restrictions. Following the current finding,
restrictions have been applied within a 5 km area around the Ogawa farm.

[The same information has been briefly mentioned by Kyodo News.
According to Japan's recent update to the OIE, sent on 23 Aug 2005, 3 newly
detected foci in Saitama and Ibaraki prefectures have been caused by low
pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus subtype H5N2. The affected
populations showed little or no clinical signs of the disease.
The update report describes also the adopted control and surveillance
measures; see <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_56.HTM#Sec4>.
It may be assumed that the additional focus, reported above, belongs to the
same cluster. - Mod.AS]
