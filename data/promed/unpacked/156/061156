The Ebola outbreak that erupted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's North Kivu Province in October -- the 2nd in 2021 -- was today [16 Dec 2021] declared over, the national health authorities announced after no new cases were reported at the end of a 42-day countdown, or 2 incubation periods after the last confirmed case was discharged.

In total, 11 cases (8 confirmed, 3 probable), including 6 deaths were reported in the outbreak that was declared on 8 Oct 2021 after a new case was confirmed in the Beni health zone in the country's North Kivu Province. This was the country's 13th outbreak and occurred in the same area as the 2018 outbreak which lasted 2 years.

More than 1800 people were vaccinated in a campaign that kicked off just 5 days after the 1st case was detected. The outbreak marks the 1st time the recently-licensed ERVEBO vaccine against Ebola was used in the country. ERVEBO is the same as the compassionate-use vaccine, but as a licensed vaccine, its rollout is less cumbersome operationally.

"Stronger disease surveillance, community engagement, targeted vaccination, and prompt response are making for more effective Ebola containment in the region," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. "During this outbreak, the Democratic Republic of Congo was able to limit widespread infections and save lives. Crucial lessons are being learned and applied with every outbreak experience."

Swift response comprising key outbreak control measures such as contact tracing, testing, disease surveillance, as well as community collaboration efforts helped contain the outbreak within Beni, where the initial case was detected. In support of the country, WHO deployed experts, supplies, and contributed funds to help contain the outbreak.

However, unpredictable and sometimes volatile security in parts of Beni hampered response in some localities, with health workers and other frontline responders unable to access insecure areas to monitor high-risk contacts or administer vaccines.

The prevention of sexual abuse and exploitation was a core pillar of the response. An expert was deployed to train WHO personnel and partners on preventing inappropriate and abusive behaviour. Every person involved in field work received training and each partner agency signed a code of conduct. Trainers engaged directly with community members where health authorities were working to raise awareness about sexual exploitation and abuse and how to report it safely. Radio spots and pamphlets in local languages also helped spread the message.

With the outbreak now declared over, the health authorities are maintaining surveillance and are ready to respond quickly to any flare-ups. It is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak. Results from genome sequencing conducted by the country's National Institute of Biomedical Research found that the first Ebola case detected in the just-ended outbreak likely represented a new flare-up of the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak due to persistence of the virus in the community.

The country has set up an Ebola Survivor Programme which currently has more than 1100 people from previous outbreaks in North Kivu Province. The 2 survivors from the now-ended outbreak have been enrolled in the survivor programme. For the next 18 months, they will receive monthly check-ups, which include medical evaluations, psychological and nutritional support.

[No new confirmed cases have been reported since 30 Oct 2021. This is a milestone in response to an Ebola outbreak, using the now licensed ERVEBO vaccine, which greatly facilitated rollout. In addition, lessons from earlier outbreaks were applied making a more effective response. The healthcare workers and all the support personnel are to be congratulated.

In this outbreak, the WHO also responded to the report in September [2021] of a sexual assault scandal that engulfed it and other aid agencies.

"More than 80 aid workers, a quarter of whom were employed by the WHO, were involved in sexual abuse and exploitation during the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak." (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/28/panel-finds-80-alleged-abuse-cases-tied-to-who).

It is notable that during the latest outbreak that just ended, "the prevention of sexual abuse and exploitation was a core pillar of the response." - Mod.LK
