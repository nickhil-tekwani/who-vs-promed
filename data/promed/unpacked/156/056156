From: "Barry Schoub" <schoub@niv.ac.za>

Unfortunately inaccurate media reports have caused some confusion in this
case. The patient, a 27-year old male, had received a human cadaveric dura
mater graft, Lyodura (R), processed by B. Braun Melsungen AG, some 10 years
ago. This particular brand of dura graft has been associated with a number
of cases of iatrogenic Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease in various countries (MMWR
1987; 36(21) 324-325. MMWR 1989;38(3) 37-38,43) including a collection of 43
cases from 1979 - 1996 in Japan (MMWR 1997; 46(45); 1066-1069).
The clinical picture in this patient, whose condition is now grave, is
characterised by severe myoclonic siezures and the EEG picture shows the
pattern typical of classical CJD of triphasic periodic waves. The 14-3-3
protein test on the patient's CSF (tested at the National CJD Surveillance
Unit, Edinburgh) was strongly positive.
There is therefore nothing to suggest that the patient has nvCJD or that he
had any exposure to bovine BSE. The evidence to hand suggests that this is a
case of iatrogenic CJD probably acquired from a cadaveric dura graft 10
years previously. A definitive diagnosis would need to await the
neuropathological report at necropsy.
Finally, it should be pointed out that production of Lyodura was
discontinued in 1996.

[Many thanks to Dr Schoub for this authoritative clarification. Some
journalists just can't seem to understand the distinction between classical
CJD & nvCJD, confusing their readers. - Mod.JW]
