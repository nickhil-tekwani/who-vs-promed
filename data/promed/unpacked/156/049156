Minister for Agriculture and Food Production Moses Jn. Baptiste said the country is facing a national crisis, as the black sigatoka disease continues to ravage the banana sector, a significant foreign exchange earner. The government has asked for help from a team of experts from the University of the West Indies to assist in fighting the disease.

The minister said the country's response requires support from the highest level and from all St Lucians to avoid total disaster. "A proactive and multifaceted approach is being taken to prevent widespread destruction of the sector, including a review of a short-term plan of action." Fungicides would also be provided to banana producers to spray plantations, he stated.

"In addition, the ministry has prepared a proposal for an action plan and suggests that a task force may be necessary to deal with the problem. It will also encompass all banana and plantain farmers and a sustained education component."

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species and hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of bananas, with yield losses of 50 percent or more. It is present in the Americas, China, South East Asia, and parts of Africa. Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant; older leaves are not readily infected.

BS seriously affects photosynthetic ability, and fruit can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment causing further losses. It is spread by water, wind, and contaminated materials including suckers for planting. Disease management includes frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, and cultural practices, but the high costs of these measures make them essentially unavailable to smallholder farmers.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS) with similar symptoms. YS causes less damage because symptoms appear mainly on older leaves. There are more crop cultivars with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS.

BS (and also YS) has been causing serious crop losses in the Caribbean region. St Lucia attempted to prevent introduction of BS by quarantine measures (see ProMED-mail post 20071010.3322), but nevertheless, BS was reported to have appeared in the country by 2010 (see ProMED-mail post 20100204.0381).
