Japanese macaques: Many died of a hemorrhagic disease - mysterious
infectious disease
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I came across with the below news in Yahoo Japan news early this morning
<http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20100709-00000057-jij-soci>, but I
have not been able to find any English translation. So here is my
translation:

Japanese macaques: Many died of a hemorrhagic disease - mysterious
infectious disease - Aichi, Kyoto Primate Research Institute

On 9 Jul 2010 it was revealed that many Japanese macaques at the
Kyoto Primate Research Institute (Inuyama City, Aichi) have died of a
hemorrhagic disease of an unknown causal agent. During the period
March 2008-April 2010, 38 macaques died and between July 2001 and
July 2002, 6 died [of the disease]. It has not been confirmed if the
infection spread to other primates or to humans.

The vice director Hirohisa Hirai stated "We believe that it is a
mysterious disease, but it is different from Ebola hemorrhagic
disease that also infects humans. It is highly probable that the
infectious disease is unique to the Japanese macaques."

According to the Institute, the symptoms of the macaques that died of
the infection included hemorrhages from the organs and the nasal
mucosa and dark-brown mud-like stool. In most cases the number of
blood platelets was reduced to almost zero; the numbers of red blood
cells and white blood cells were significantly reduced; and the
monkeys were severely anemic. The cause is under investigation.

The infection was limited to 3 areas that include indoor cages within
the Primate Research Institute and outside enclosures. It is
suspected that an unknown disease agent that uniquely infects the
Japanese macaques is the causal factor of the infectious disease.
Although most infected macaques have died, some have survived and are
still living.

The Primate Research Institute is currently analyzing the blood of
the animals and investigating the cause(s) of the infection by
collaborating with other organizations to prevent further spread of
the disease.

ProMED-mail posting (archived 20100709.2307), similarly translated --
but abridged -- from a Japanese media source. Since Prof Goodwin's
translation added some details of interest, this version seems to
deserve posting as well.

Further results of the investigation are expected with great
interest. - Mod.AS]
