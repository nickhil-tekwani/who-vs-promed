Foot and Mouth disease outbreaks detected in the Western region of Venezuela
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barquisimeto, Barinas, Merida, Portuguesa, and Apure are the states
in which foot and mouth disease outbreaks have been reported, as a
consequence of sanitary measures currently implemented by the
Government.
Mr. Genaro Mendez, President of the Venezuelan National Livestock
Farmers Federation, stated that some outbreaks have already been
detected in many Western Venezuelan states, 2 of them in Portuguesa,
one in Barinas, one in Apure and 2 in Merida; and, according to
livestock farmers, this is happening because of indiscriminate beef
importation without adequate sanitary controls (i.e. recommended
immunizations and product quality control measures), since it has
been discovered that many beef products do not comply with the
requirements of Venezuelan Sanitary Authorities.
