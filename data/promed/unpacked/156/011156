Four deaths in Guatemala linked to contaminated shellfish
---------------------------------------------------------
More than 30 people have fallen sick and 4 have died in Guatemala after eating shellfish.

The National Commission for the Surveillance and Control of Red Tide in Guatemala has extended an alert because of the presence of saxitoxins above the limits on the coasts of Tiquisate, Escuintla, Retalhuleu and San Marcos.

Public health officials said since the end of April [2022], 34 people had been affected and 3 children and 1 adult had died.

Authorities urged the public not to eat bivalve mollusks such as mussels, clams and oysters.

A warning was issued earlier this month [May 2022] after monitoring and analysis detected high concentrations of saxitoxins above the limits.

Saxitoxin is a toxin responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Harmful algal blooms are often called red tides.

Saxitoxin affects the nervous system, with symptoms usually occurring within 30 minutes. Severity depends on the amount of toxin consumed. Initial reactions are tingling of the lips and tongue, which spreads to the face, neck, fingertips, and toes, followed by a headache, dizziness, and nausea. Muscular paralysis and respiratory difficulty may occur within 5 to 12 hours.

Officials said people with any of the symptoms mentioned above should go immediately to the nearest health center to receive treatment. Patients were told not to self-medicate as all services are free.

Affected shellfish will taste and appear no different than safe shellfish, and cooking does not destroy the toxin.

[Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting shellfish from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days.

Shellfish that cause this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases, death may occur in 2 to 25 hours.

Contamination with saxitoxin is a serious situation. Hopefully, individuals will heed the warning. Do not eat the marine life at this time, and don't go swimming in these waters. Painful eye conditions, sinus conditions, and other systemic issues may occur. The illness can be quite serious.

"Saxitoxins are also known as paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs). Most human saxitoxin toxicoses have been associated with the ingestion of marine shellfish, which accumulate saxitoxins produced by marine dinoflagellates. However, saxitoxins are also found in freshwaters, produced by cyanobacteria in the genera _Anabaena_, _Aphanizomenon_, _Planktothrix_, _Cylindrospermopsis_, _Lyngbya_, and _Scytonema_." (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/shellfish-toxin)

"Saxitoxins are best known for their effects on people after ingestion of contaminated marine shellfish. The syndrome is termed paralytic shellfish poisoning. The name of the toxin was based on the genus of the Alaskan butter clam, _Saxidomus_, from which the prototype member of the group was first isolated after a large number of people who had eaten the clams experienced the toxic syndrome. After ocean waters become free of the toxigenic dinoflagellates, mussels rapidly eliminate the toxins, but other organisms do so at widely varying rates.

"Saxitoxin is now known to be one of many structurally and toxicologically similar toxins, including neosaxitoxin, and other derivatives, many of which are termed gonyautoxins. Marine dinoflagellates in the genera _Alexandrium_ (formerly _Gonyaulax_), _Gymnodinium_, and _Pyrodinium_ are producers of these toxins. Saxitoxins and related compounds accumulate in a range of planktivorous invertebrates, including mollusks (bivalves and gastropods), crustaceans, and echinoderms, and fishes that ingest the toxigenic dinoflagellates. Predatory fish, birds, marine mammals, and humans can be poisoned through the food web when they ingest contaminated shellfish or finfish. Saxitoxins are monitored in shellfish and other seafood species, and closures of fisheries are commonly implemented to prevent harvest of contaminated organisms." (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/neosaxitoxin)

"The clinical presentation of saxitoxin-poisoning varies depending on the level of exposure. The lag time between exposure and the appearance of clinical signs is highly variable, and can range from minutes to as long as 72 hours (Montebruno, 1993). At relatively low exposure levels, moderate paresthesias, often described as a tingling sensation, are experienced around the mouth and extremities. Larger exposures lead to a spreading numbness of the mouth, throat, and extremities. High exposure levels may cause acute muscle paralysis and respiratory failure."
