Six Coachella Valley [California] mosquito samples tested positive for the St. Louis encephalitis virus [SLEV], which was common across the region until the West Nile virus become commonplace more than a decade ago.

The samples came from traps southeast of Mecca in 4 areas: Buchanan Street and Avenue 76, Buchanan and Avenue 68, Johnson Street and Avenue 70 and Grant Street and Avenue 71, according to the Coachella Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District.

The virus hasn't been discovered in California since 2003 and officials are now investigating how it returned.

"We don't really know why the virus has reappeared, but we do know its detection this year has been a trend in other parts of the country as well," Jeremy Wittie, district scientific operations manager, said in a statement.

It was 1st detected in 1933 during a "large urban outbreak" in St. Louis [Missouri], according to the district. It spread throughout the western hemisphere and it was the only neuroinvasive mosquito-borne flavivirus in North America until the West Nile virus appeared in 1999.

[It is of interest that SLEV has been detected in Southern California again after an apparent absence of more than a decade. ProMED-mail has not posted a report of SLEV in California since 2003 (see archive no. 20031011.2555), when it was infecting sentinel chickens. Finding it now, 12 years later in mosquitoes (unspecified species), raises an interesting question -- was it reintroduced into the area, or was it there all along, but at prevalences so low that it was not detected?

SLEV is transmitted from wild birds to humans in California by _Culex tarsalis_ mosquitoes, and causes sporadic outbreaks and scattered individual cases in areas where it is endemic.

Mecca, California, is in a desert area in Riverside County. The town is located at less than 150 feet below sea level on the edge of the Salton Sea, formerly the Salton Sink.
