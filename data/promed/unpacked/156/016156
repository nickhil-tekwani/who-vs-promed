The number of leptospirosis deaths in the country now sits at 4 after
the Ministry of Health confirmed the North's 1st death. Ministry of
Health spokesman Iliesa Tora yesterday [24 Feb 2009] said [the] 4th
death occurred 2 weeks ago. The patient had been admitted at the
Labasa Hospital for 3 weeks, he said. "For the north, one
leptospirosis patient has died which brings to 4 the total number of
deaths from leptospirosis with 3 from the west and one in the North,"
he said.

Mr Tora said 14 leptospirosis cases were reported nationwide; 8 in
the West, 2 in the North, and 4 in the Central Division.

[More than 90 percent of patients with leptospirosis have a mild,
self-limited illness, with fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, cough, pharyngitis, skin rash, and muscle pain especially
in calves and lumbar region, which is rarely fatal. About 10 percent
develop a more severe illness with myocardial, pulmonary, renal or
hepatic involvement that may be fatal in 5-40 percent. In recent
studies of patients admitted to hospitals, about 20 percent die
(<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/513767>;
<http://www.psmid.org.ph/vol31/vol31num4topic1.pdf>).

The fact that there are 4 deaths due to leptospirosis in Fiji
suggests that there are likely more than the 14 reported cases, who
likely have mild illness.
