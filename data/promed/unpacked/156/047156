An outbreak of nodular dermatitis [aka Lumpy skin disease] has been recorded among cattle in the Atyrau region. The number of diseased animals exceeded 2000, of which 50 head of cattle died. The authorities intend to pay their owners a 100 percent payment, Today.kz noted from the press service of the akimat [directorate, mayorat] of the region.

According to the deputy akim [Mayor] of Atyrau region Salimzhan Nakpaeva, signs of the disease in cattle began to appear on 30 Jun [2016] in Kurmangazy district of Atyrau region - starting with temperature elevation and the appearance of sores on the skin of some animals. Local veterinarians had not been able to establish the cause of the disease in cattle. Experts, called from the central national laboratory, collected samples from the affected cattle and established diagnosis. It was found that the animals suffer from nodular dermatitis.

"This virus has come to us from the Russian Federation, where earlier outbreaks were reported in Chechnya, Dagestan and Stavropol", explained Salimzhan Nakpaev. "This cattle disease is characteristic of the African continent and its carriers are flying insects. As of today, 2043 cattle have been affected by the disease, of which 51 died. There are 343 animal specialists to treat with antibiotics and perform the necessary procedures in order to save the rest of the population. Fortunately, we now know the cause of the disease and methods of combating it. Funds have been allocated from the regional budget, to purchase the vaccine and medications. I note from the people that the disease continues."

The head of Atyrau region, [Mayor] Nurlan Nogayev, instructed not to hesitate and to declare quarantine upon cattle in the affected area. He met with residents of Kurmangazy district and said that the government plans to pay 100 per cent compensation for the owners of fallen cattle.

"But you do not need to treat the disease in a slipshod manner in view of the compensation", said the Mayor to residents. "We must not allow the spread of the disease; this is also your responsibility - it is not the problem of a single person, family or area. Fallen cattle should be destroyed and diseased animals isolated, leading to compensation, paid at market value".

Nodular dermatitis of cattle is an infectious disease caused by a virus and is characterized by short-term fever, lesions of the skin, lymphatic system and mucous membranes, and the formation of nodules in the subcutaneous tissue and necrosis.

[According to the above information and earlier media-derived reports (eg http://www.kyrgyzkorm.kg/news/zagadochnaya-bolezn-porazhaet-skot-v-kazaxstane.html), LSD started its circulation in the Atyrau region, and probably also in West Kazakhstan, during June 2016 - at least 5 weeks prior to the 1st notification of the disease by the Veterinary Services to the OIE (20160722.4363497), The OIE notification reported LSD diagnosis in the Mangystau region, located southern to the above 2 regions. The 3 apparently infected regions can be seen in the administrative map available at http://tinyurl.com/j4cyqe7.

The vaccine mentioned in the above report is probably the same one applied in the LSD-infected regions of the Russian Federation, namely a heterologous live attenuated vaccine (attenuated sheep pox virus strain "ARRIAH").

Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, and the 9th largest in the world. The belated diagnosis of LSD there is surprising; following the acquiring of independence in Dec 1991, Kazakhstan obtained support from the West, particularly USA, in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories for research and diagnosis of infectious diseases in man and animals. One of the recent research projects addressed capripox vaccines (see ref below).

Early report on the factual distribution of LSD within Kazakhstan is anticipated. Neighbouring countries may take steps to prevent its introduction; those countries include China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.
