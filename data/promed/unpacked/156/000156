Farmers have mixed emotions about how the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is dealing with a cattle disease outbreak. It comes as an 8th South Island farm's tested positive for _Mycoplasma bovis_; a small cell-wall deficient bacterium, which causes arthritis and pneumonia.

Dairy farmer John Gregan attended an MPI meeting in Waimate last night [Mon 20 Nov 2017], and said there was a fair amount of concern among farmers. "The farmers said it's difficult to monitor but they're doing their best and feel it wasn't unexpected on the properties that it had spread to."

Around 300 people attended the meeting in Waimate, for the disease that doesn't affect meat or milk produced by the infected cows. "We have to trust MPI at the end of the day. They've got professionals doing the work and hopefully they do the right thing, but it's a bit like playing rugby from the sideline."

Mr Gregan said 1700 cows have already been culled -- with 5000 expected to be gone by Christmas. Cattle infected with a bacterial disease will be culled with extreme care.

[This is a lot of culling for this disease. This article does not mention if there is any compensation for the producers' loss of animals or income.

This particular disease can spread from animal to animal through close contact. It can also be spread between farms when a new animal incubating the disease but showing no clinical signs arrives on a premises. Potentially, spread of the disease may occur through the use of contaminated equipment.

This is a cattle disease and does not affect sheep or goats.

This disease can cause:
- untreatable mastitis in dairy and beef cows;
- severe pneumonia in up to 30 per cent of infected calves, starting as a hacking cough;
- ear infections in calves, the first sign typically being one droopy ear, progressing to ear discharges and in some cases a head tilt;
- abortion;
- swollen joints and lameness (severe arthritis/synovitis) in all ages of cattle
(< https://www.dairynz.co.nz/animal/cow-health/mycoplasma-bovis/>).

It is hard to watch your animals being culled, and equally hard to watch the disease spread. - Mod.TG
