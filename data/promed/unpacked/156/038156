quarantined. According to the authorities, 13 000 birds are kept
between the 3 farms. Results of laboratory tests are expected

As requested in an earlier posting, here is the confirmation of avian
influenza in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany. It is a low pathogenic
variety and that is good news. OIE routinely reports H5 and H7 as
information on these strains helps to complete the epidemiologic
picture as these strains have been known to develop and become highly
pathogenic. - Mod. PC]

[The final serology of the reported case and laboratory confirmations

or otherwise of the 3 new cases are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
