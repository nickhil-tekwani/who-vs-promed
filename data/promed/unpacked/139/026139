At least 40 (21 percent) of the 191 horses died or were euthanatized. The
numbers of equine deaths associated with WNV infection by State are:

Of the 191 horses, 188 were positive on a WNV IgM-capture enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) and a WNV plaque reduction neutralization
test (PRNT) performed on serum at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. One of the other 3 horses had brain
tissue that tested positive at the NVSL on WNV reverse transcriptase-nested
polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR), had serum that was positive on WNV
PRNT, and had WNV isolated from brain tissue. An additional horse was
positive on WNV RT-nPCR on a virus isolate submitted to the NVSL for
confirmatory testing. The third horse had brain tissue that was WNV RT-nPCR
positive and had WNV isolated from brain tissue. Of the 188 serologically
positive horses, 9 horses from which brain tissues were submitted also
tested positive on WNV RT-nPCR performed on those tissues. WNV was isolated
at the NVSL from one of those 9 brain tissues as of 15 October.
