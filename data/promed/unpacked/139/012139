The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has warned people of the spread of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in the Maldives, local media has reported. The HPA reported that the number of confirmed HFMD cases had increased in some regions since January 2013.

[Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in adults. Symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (herpangina), and a skin rash. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by several viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is spread from person to person by direct contact with the infectious viruses that cause this disease. These viruses are found in the nose and throat secretions (such as saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus), fluid in blisters, and stool of infected persons. The viruses may be spread when infected persons touch objects and surfaces that are then touched by others. There is no specific treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease. Visitors to the Maldives with small children should pay particular attention to personal hygiene.

Maldives, officially the Republic of the Maldives, and also referred to as the Maldive Islands, is an island nation in the Indian Ocean consisting of a double chain of 26 atolls orientated north-south that lie between Minicoy Island (the southernmost part of Lakshadweep, India) and the Chagos Archipelago.
