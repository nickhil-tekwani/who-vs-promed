Rise in number of vesicular stomatitis cases in US
--------------------------------------------------
Official figures show a surge in the number of cases of vesicular stomatitis in the United States.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral infection that can affect horses, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids. It also has the ability to infect people, causing flu-like symptoms, but such cases are rare.

The latest update from the US Department of Agriculture, dated [12 Aug 2015], shows that 57 new premises were identified in the previous week. A majority of the cases are identified in horses.

They were in Colorado's Conejos and Weld counties, New Mexico's Rio Arriba County, South Dakota's Custer and Lawrence counties, Utah's Grand County, and Wyoming's Platte County.

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service report says 215 premises have been identified that were either positive for the disease, or had suspected cases, since the 2015 outbreak began on 29 Apr.

Cases have been confirmed or suspected in 7 US states so far -- Arizona (35 premises in 2 counties), Colorado (118 premises in 11 counties), New Mexico (29 premises in 11 counties), South Dakota (12 premises in 4 counties), Texas (3 premises in 3 counties), Utah (5 premises in 3 counties), and Wyoming (13 premises in 3 counties).

Currently, there are 107 premises remaining under quarantine across 5 states (Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming).

Colorado is worst affected at present, with quarantines in place in Archuleta, Chaffee, Conejos, Delta, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Montezuma, Montrose, and Weld counties. In all, there are 70 premises under quarantine.

New Mexico has a total of 12 affected premises across Rio Arriba, San Juan, Santa Fe, Taos and Union counties.

South Dakota has 11 quarantined premises across Custer, Lawrence, Meade and Pennington counties.

Utah has 3 affected premises, Grand and San Juan counties.

Wyoming has 11 affected premises across Goshen and Platte counties.

The disease can cause distress to livestock. Clinical signs include vesicles, erosions and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats and above the hooves of susceptible livestock. Vesicles are usually only seen early in the course of the disease.

Its transmission is not completely understood, but biting insects are known to be a key vector, and mechanical transmission and livestock movements are also believed to play a part.

The signs are similar to those of foot-and-mouth disease. In cattle, animal health agencies must establish that the symptoms are not a result of foot-and-mouth disease, which has not been seen in the US since 1929.

Equine epidemiologist Angela Pelzel-McCluskey told Horsetalk in January [2015] that the 2014 outbreak fit the pattern of a bad season every 8 to 10 years, with the last outbreak on a similar scale being in 2004-2006. This particular outbreak began in 2004, continued into the following year, and the virus managed to over-winter into 2006.

Before that, there were hundreds of cases reported in 1995 and 1997. There were reports, too, of large numbers of cases in 1985-86.

She believes these major outbreaks occur when climatic and ecological factors combine in a way that favors the insect vectors, although the formula is not necessarily simple.

"We don't really know which factors are most important or impactful," she said.

[The factors that result in an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis are not well understood at all. Factors such as rainfall, or dryness, insects, and winds have all been examined without a defined outcome.

This particular article provides a nice summary of the many cases this year (2015). - Mod.TG
