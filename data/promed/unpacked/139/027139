Virus outbreak in holiday sites
-------------------------------
Investigations are being carried out in north Cornwall [England]
after an outbreak of a diarrhoea and vomiting bug [suspected
norovirus infection]. About 200 people have had symptoms at holiday
sites between Newquay and Padstow since the end of July [2009], the
Health Protection Agency (HPA) said. The outbreak is suspected to
have been caused by norovirus, the HPA said. The local NHS [National
Health Service], Cornwall Council, and the Environment Agency are
working to identify the source of the outbreak, the agency added.

Holiday accommodation outlets have been asked by the incident team to
maintain a strict cleaning regime, especially for shared facilities,
it said.

The HPA said: "It's not uncommon to see bugs like norovirus spread
quickly through holiday settings like campsites and hostels, causing
widespread diarrhoea and vomiting. We're working hard to see if we
can find any source for the illness, which seems to be a bug which is
passed from person to person."

[This outbreak is unusual in that is affecting several holiday sites
more-or-less simultaneously. Norovirus infection can spread rapidly
from person to person, but also can be food-borne. Delivery of
contaminated produce from a single source or by infected delivery
personnel could explain this outbreak. Further information on the
progress of the investigation is awaited.
