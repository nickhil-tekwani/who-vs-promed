Is turning a blind eye to measles vaccination responsible for
occurrence of post-measles encephalitis (PME), an infectious and
life-threatening disease affecting young children in the region? It
would seem so if latest cases are taken into consideration. Though
authorities concerned blame people, they are unable to answer how
skipping vaccine is possible when it is a part of the routine
immunisation programme.

While Japanese encephalitis (JE) is already known to create havoc in
some parts of east UP [Uttar Pradesh], particularly in the belts of
Gorakhpur, Maharajganj and Deoria districts, the occurrence of PME in
a number of children in the region, with some still undergoing medical
treatment in city hospitals, has caused concern.

"The preliminary reports indicate PME conditions in a number of
children from the region, out of which 4 children have even reached
coma stage," said the Secretary of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP)
UP, Alok Bhardwaj. "Two of them have been discharged, but the others
are still kept under medical supervision. However, the concerning part
of the exercise is the fact that the region has never reported such a
large number of such cases," pointed out the senior paediatrician.

It may be mentioned here that out of 4 critical cases of PME, one
each has been reported from Varanasi, Chandauli, Ballia and the Buxar
district of neighbouring Bihar state. Similarly, a number of PME cases
have been also reported from Bhadohi, Mirzapur, Jaunpur and Ghazipur
districts in the region.

"We are conducting investigation in these cases, and initial reports
suggest a possibility of failure of sticking to the routine
immunisation programme, which includes measles immunisation at the age
of 9 months. Such type of outbreak has been reported already in some
areas of southern states, and there are hints of laxity in measles
immunisation in these cases," said Bhardwaj. Saying immunisation was
mandatory to eliminate chances of measles infection for the lifetime
in children, he also emphasised that an outbreak of measles infection
could not be ruled out if it [immunisation] was avoided on a large
scale.

It is also worth mentioning that the World Health Organisation
expanded programme on immunisation recommends immunisation at 9 months
of age. This age can be lowered to 6 months if there is a measles
outbreak in the community.

"Vaccination for measles is part of the government immunisation
programme, and people must come forward to complete the course of
immunisation," said chief medical officer RS Verma on Wednesday [2 Mar
2011]. Saying the vaccines were available at all government health
centres, the CMO emphasised that vaccination against measles provided
protection against natural measles along with other complications
associated with the infectious disease in children. Similarly, Alok
Bhardwaj added measles vaccine should be combined with other live
attenuated vaccines, such as mumps and rubella vaccines (MMR vaccine),
as such combinations were highly effective.

[Measles vaccine coverage (a mononvaalent vaccine at 9 months of age)
in India has been good, but measles incidence remains high in parts of
India. Measles even in previously healthy children can be a serious
illness requiring hospitalization. As many as one in 20 children with
measles develops pneumonia, and about one child in every 1000 who get
measles will develop encephalitis, which may leave a child deaf or
even mentally retarded. In developing countries, where malnutrition
and vitamin A deficiency are common, mortality from measles virus
infection can be considerable. Sub-acute sclerosing pan-encephalitis
(SSPE), a fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system,
can be a very rare consequence of measles infection early in life.

The above account of encephalitis in the state of Uttar Pradesh
attributes many cases of encephalitis to measles virus infection as a
consequence of deficiencies in measles vaccine coverage. However a
recent publication by F.k. Beig et al. in the International Journal of
Infectious Disease (25 Jan 2010) describes an investigation of the
etiology of viral encephalitis (VE) in the children of western Uttar
Pradesh. Both cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples were collected
from pediatric patients suffering from encephalitis hospitalized at
Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh from July 2004 to November
2006. Viral isolation was done on RD cells, HEp-2 cells, and Vero
cells from the cerebrospinal fluid samples of children with suspected
VE. A microneutralization test was performed for enterovirus 71. An
enzyme immunoassay for IgM antibodies was performed for measles virus,
mumps virus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and
Japanese encephalitis virus. 87 patients were enrolled in the study.
The most common etiology of VE was enterovirus 71 (42.1 percent),
followed by measles (21.1 percent), varicella zoster virus (15.8
percent), herpes simplex virus (10.5 percent), and mumps (10.5
percent). Japanese encephalitis virus was not found in any case.
Enterovirus 71 infection caused significant morbidity in children;
mortality occurred in 50 percent. A preponderance of cases occurred in
December. In their study, generalized convulsions along with altered
sensorium were the significant findings in patients with VE. The
authors concluded that enterovirus 71, the major etiology of VE in the
study, was associated with significant mortality and morbidity.

It is likely, therefore, that improved measles vaccine coverage may
reduce the incidence of VE in Uttar Pradesh but will not eliminate
it.
