An outbreak of horse herpes has shut down racing temporarily at Vernon Downs in central New York.

Jason Bluhm, racing director for Vernon Downs, says that about 5 horses tested positive for equine herpesvirus and one had to be euthanized. They were all from the same trainer and housed in the same barn.

Racing was cancelled Saturday night [4 May 2013] and all horse barns are under quarantine for 14 to 21 days.

Equine herpes is a term used for several highly contagious respiratory tract diseases in horses that are caused by 2 closely related herpesviruses. Signs are similar to a cold, but with a long-lasting high fever. In the horse that was euthanized, the virus caused neurological damage making it difficult for the horse to walk.

[The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
