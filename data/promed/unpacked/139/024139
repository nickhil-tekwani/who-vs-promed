Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), probably of the H5N1 subtype, has broken out in farmed broilers in the region of Bagmati.

The veterinary authority sent Follow Up Report No. 2 dated 24 Dec 2012 to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE]. The report describes one new outbreak of HPAI at a commercial farm with 42-day-old broiler chickens reared in a closed farm premises in the region of Bagmati in central Nepal, starting on 13 Dec 2012. Of the 3000-bird flock, all but 150 broilers died, and those were subsequently destroyed.

According to the report, the birds showed swollen heads with respiratory distress and started to die. High morbidity and mortality were recorded in the affected farm. All remaining birds, poultry products, and poultry production materials were destroyed and disposed of as per the standard operating procedure. Cleaning and disinfection activities are being continued. Intensive surveillance activities are ongoing throughout the country. The neuraminidase type is not yet known.
