Rubella Outbreak in an Unvaccinated Religious Community in The Netherlands
Spreads to Canada
---------------------------------------------------
There are indications that the rubella outbreak that started in September
2004 among members of a religious community in the Netherlands, first
reported in Eurosurveillance on 3 Mar 2005 (1), has spread to Canada. This
outbreak is specifically affecting some unvaccinated groups within the
Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland (Reformed Community in the Netherlands,
a Christian community).
Up to Tue 17 May 2005, 214 laboratory confirmed cases of rubella have been
reported in southwest Ontario. 5 of these cases have been in pregnant
women. The Canadian Christian community where the cases occurred has
historical and social links with the affected groups within the
Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, and individuals frequently travel
between the 2 communities. A definitive source for the Canadian patient
with the earliest date of onset reported (mid-February 2005) has not yet
been identified. An isolate has been obtained from the outbreak in Canada
and is currently being genotyped. Attempts are being made to isolate
rubella virus in the Netherlands so as to genetically link the respective
outbreaks. The World Health Organization has recently published a
standardised rubella virus genotyping protocol (2).
In the Netherlands, up to 17 May 2005, 309 laboratory confirmed cases have
been reported (from 1 Sep 2004); 23 of these are known to be in pregnant
women (9 in their 1st trimester). The geographical spread of the outbreak
in the Netherlands is documented on the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid
en Milieu website: <http://www.rivm.nl/vtv/object_class/atl_infparasit.html>.
The epidemiological curve, shown as a figure entitled: " Reports of
laboratory confirmed cases of rubella by week of onset, the Netherlands
(cases reported between 1 September 2004 - 17 May 2005. Source: Osiris.")
in the original document shows 3 separate peaks, each larger than the last.
It is uncertain whether these peaks reflect the true incidence or are the
result of a registration artefact.
In both the Netherlands and Canada, the outbreak occurred in a community
with low measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage and strong
social adherence. The proportion of cases in a vaccinated individual is low
(0.3 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively), indicating that the
effectiveness of the rubella component of the MMR vaccine is very high.
Rubella infection acquired during early pregnancy can lead to miscarriage
or severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This
syndrome occurs in up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who are
infected in the 1st trimester (3). It is important to differentiate primary
rubella infection from re-infection because the risk of CRS for
re-infection during the first trimester of pregnancy is less than 5 to 10
percent (2). Rubella IgG avidity serology has been shown to be a very
useful laboratory test for differentiating primary rubella infections from
re-infections/past infections in pregnant women where critical patient
management/counselling decisions are required (4). Rubella IgG avidity
serology is being used for the investigation of rubella exposure or
suspected rubella in pregnant women in the Canadian outbreak.
Rubella and CRS are preventable by immunisation, and both the Netherlands
and Canada have a routine 2-dose MMR vaccination schedule. During the
outbreak, health authorities in Canada and the Netherlands have offered MMR
free of charge to unvaccinated individuals (in the Netherlands this has
only been offered to those under the age of 18). Public health laws in
Ontario allow authorities to exclude unvaccinated children from attending
school when there is an outbreak of a vaccine preventable disease. Local
public health officials in Ontario have issued indefinite exclusion orders
for students who are not immunised or cannot offer proof of immunity. Such
a law does not exist in the Netherlands. In addition, the provincial
Ministry of Health for Ontario (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term
Care) has given advice on isolation of cases, quarantining of contacts and
travel restrictions. This also differs from the Netherlands, where the
emphasis of public health advice is on advising pregnant women to avoid
contact with rubella patients.
The effectiveness of both Canadian and Dutch public health advice in
preventing spread of rubella and in preventing pregnant women from becoming
infected is probably limited. This is firstly because members of the
affected communities often decline vaccination, since it contradicts their
religious beliefs. Comprehensive information on the uptake of MMR during
this outbreak is not yet available in Canada or the Netherlands. Secondly,
rubella is most infectious prior to the onset of rash (usual range one week
prior to 4 days post rash onset). Finally, only a minority of cases are
diagnosed, since rubella virus infection can be asymptomatic in up to 50
percent of cases and, if symptomatic, usually has a mild course.
Further spread of the outbreak and risk of CRS depends on herd immunity
(resulting from vaccination and natural infection) and level of contact
with the affected community. In the Netherlands, historical seroprevalence
and vaccine uptake data suggest that the level of protection in the general
population is high (5). Even in municipalities where a high proportion of
the population declines vaccination, seroprevalence studies suggest
that >97 percent of women of childbearing age are immune (probably through
circulation of rubella virus in the past) (5). In addition to the groups
within the Gereformeerde Gemeente in Nederland, Dutch groups with a
relatively low seroprevalence may include some groups of immigrants and
those supporting the anti-vaccination movement (including followers of
homeopathy and anthroposophical teachings).
In Canada, populations with relatively low seroprevalence may include
immigrants as well as other groups who resist immunisation for religious
and philosophical reasons.
Although Reformed Christian communities exist outside the Netherlands and
Canada, to our knowledge vaccine preventable diseases have only spread
internationally from the Netherlands Gereformeerde Gemeente in the
Nederlands to Canada (6,7,8). Canada's temperate climate, which has
synchronous seasons to those of the Netherlands, may be one explanation for
this. However, onward spread from Canada has been documented in the past:
the poliomyelitis outbreak in the Netherlands in 1978 spread to Canada and
subsequently into the United States (9).
Public health efforts in the Netherlands and Canada are now focusing on
raising awareness amongst the affected community and health professionals,
documenting (molecular) epidemiological links, and improving surveillance
of CRS.

[The following extract from a recent MMWR report on Elimination of Rubella
and Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the United States, 1969--2004, puts the
situation in Canada in perspective.
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5411a5.htm>)
"The changing epidemiology of rubella in the United States during the
preceding 10 years reflected efforts to control the disease elsewhere in
the Western Hemisphere. The burden of rubella was increasingly recognized
in countries as their vaccination programs succeeded in controlling
measles, whose symptoms can resemble rubella. In 1997, a Technical Advisory
Group for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommended
strategies for rubella control and CRS prevention. In 2003, with the
success of accelerated rubella control, PAHO member countries voted to
establish a goal to eliminate rubella and CRS from the Western Hemisphere
by 2010. As of 2004, a total of 43 of 44 countries and territories in the
region had included rubella vaccine in their routine immunization programs.
For countries reporting rubella cases to PAHO, the number of reported
rubella cases dropped from 135 947 in 1998 to fewer than 1000 cases in 2003.
With elimination of endemic chains of rubella transmission in the United
States, future patterns of rubella will most likely reflect global disease
epidemiology. Since 1998, most non-U.S.-born cases of rubella reported in
the United States have occurred among persons born in countries where
rubella vaccination has not been or was only recently implemented.
According to a survey of the member countries in the World Health
Organization, the number of countries that have incorporated
rubella-containing vaccine into their routine national immunization
programs increased from 65 (33 percent) in 1996 to 110 (57 percent) in
2003. However, rubella continues to be endemic in many parts of the world.
The United States should continue its vigilance against rubella and CRS by
1) maintaining high vaccination rates among children; 2) ensuring
vaccination among women of childbearing age, especially women born outside
the United States; 3) continuing surveillance of both rubella and CRS; and
4) responding rapidly to any outbreak."
