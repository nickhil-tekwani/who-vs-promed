Outbreak of Cyclosporiasis Associated with Snow Peas
--------------------------------------------------
During June-July 2004, public health officials in Pennsylvania were
notified of cases of the parasitic disease cyclosporiasis (1,2) among
persons associated with a residential facility (e.g., residents,
staff, and volunteers). CDC confirmed the diagnosis of _Cyclospora
cayetanensis_ infection (1) by examining stool specimens from
multiple patients. By early July, local public health officials had
been notified of approximately 50 potential cases of cyclosporiasis
associated with the facility; onsets of illness were from early June
through early July. This report describes the findings of the
epidemiologic and traceback investigations, which determined the
cases were linked to consumption of raw Guatemalan snow peas at 5
special events, for which food was prepared by the facility staff,
from late May through late June (Table).
This is the 1st documented outbreak of cyclosporiasis linked to snow
peas. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC are working with
Guatemalan officials to determine the sources of the snow peas and
possible modes of contamination.
A case of cyclosporiasis was defined as onset of illness 1-14 days
after consumption of food or beverages served at one or more of the 5
special events. Persons with laboratory-confirmed cases had infection
confirmed by CDC by examining stool specimens for Cyclospora (1), and
at least one gastrointestinal (GI) symptom (i.e., diarrhea [loose or
watery stool], nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, loss of appetite,
or unintentional weight loss) or constitutional symptom (i.e., fever,
chills, muscle aches, joint aches, generalized body aches, headache,
or fatigue). Persons with probable (clinically defined) cases of
infection either had 1) 3 or more loose or watery stools during a
24-hour period and at least one other symptom or 2) 5 or more
symptoms, including at least 3 GI symptoms.
Of the 349 persons associated with the facility who were in the
population potentially at risk for infection, 315 (90 percent)
persons were interviewed to ascertain exposure (e.g., event
attendance) and illness status; 215 (68 percent) of the 315
interviewed had attended at least one event. Of the 215 persons, 96
(45 percent) had illness that was consistent with one of the case
definitions; 40 cases were laboratory confirmed, and 56 were
probable. All of the cases were associated with special events (i.e.,
none were attributable to other meals at the facility, which were
prepared by the same staff and in the same kitchen), and each of the
5 events was associated with laboratory-confirmed cases. Therefore,
the investigation focused on identifying an item served at all 5
events, but not at other meals.
Only pasta salad met these criteria. In addition, pasta salad was the
only food item statistically significantly associated with illness in
retrospective cohort studies, which were conducted among persons who
attended the 2 most recent events (events D and E) (Table); data for
77 attendees were included in analyses. The summary relative risk for
these 2 events (i.e., for the association between pasta salad and
illness) was 32 (95 percent confidence interval: 5--219; p<0.001).
Specifically, 90 percent (38 of 42) of the persons who ate the salad
had cases of cyclosporiasis, compared with 3 percent (one of 35) of
the persons who did not eat the salad. The median incubation periods
for illness associated with events D and E were 8 days (range: 1-13
days) and 7 days (range: 1-10 days), respectively.
The pasta salad included multiple types of raw produce, none of which
were implicated in investigations of previous outbreaks of
cyclosporiasis (1). Of the produce used in the salad (Table), only
snow peas met all of the following criteria: 1) were included in all
3 batches of the salad served at the 5 events, 2) were from the same
"lot" (i.e., from one container, purchased on 1 day, and from one
supplier), and 3) were not served at other meals except the 5 events.
Event A on May 31 (Table) was the 1st occasion in 2004 at which pasta
salad or snow peas were served by the facility.
All of the snow peas used by the facility came from the same 4.5-kg
container, which was purchased on May 21 and refrigerated thereafter.
On June 22, after the last (3rd) batch of salad was prepared (Table),
the residual snow peas were discarded; none were available for
testing for Cyclospora oocysts or DNA when the investigation was
initiated. In an investigation conducted by FDA, the snow peas were
traced to an exporter in Guatemala.
The snow peas were handled only on days when batches of salad were
prepared (Table). For each batch, a handful of peas (approximately 1
kg) was removed from the container, washed in municipal water, and
added to the salad. None of the food handlers who prepared or served
the salad had symptoms consistent with cyclosporiasis before the
onset of the outbreak or on the days the 1st 2 batches were prepared
or served (Table). One person who helped prepare the 3rd batch had a
probable case of cyclosporiasis after eating salad from the first 2
batches.

MMWR Editorial Note:
The findings of this investigation indicate that raw Guatemalan snow
peas were linked to this outbreak of cyclosporiasis in Pennsylvania.
No evidence of ongoing transmission has been obtained, despite
heightened surveillance for cases of cyclosporiasis. This is the 1st
investigation in which snow peas have been implicated as the vehicle
of an outbreak of cyclosporiasis. Several other types of fresh
produce (e.g., raspberries, basil, and mesclun lettuce), from various
countries, have previously been implicated as vehicles of U.S.
cyclosporiasis outbreaks (1). FDA and CDC are working with Guatemalan
officials to determine the sources of the snow peas (e.g., farms or
cooperatives) and possible modes of contamination. The modes of
contamination of implicated vehicles have not been definitively
determined for any previous foodborne outbreak of cyclosporiasis (1);
better understanding of the biology and epidemiology of the parasite
is needed. For imported vehicles of infection, international
collaboration is critical to the success of investigations and to the
identification of appropriate prevention and control measures.
Produce should be thoroughly washed before it is eaten. This practice
might decrease but not eliminate the risk for transmission of
Cyclospora (1,3).
Health-care providers should consider the diagnosis of Cyclospora
infection in persons with prolonged or remitting-relapsing diarrheal
illness and specifically request testing of stool specimens for this
parasite (1); such testing is not routinely conducted by most
laboratories. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) has been shown
in a placebo-controlled trial to be effective treatment for
Cyclospora infection (4). Adults should receive TMP 160 mg plus SMX
800 mg (one double-strength tablet) orally, twice a day for 7 days.
Some patients might benefit from longer courses of therapy.
Alternative treatments for persons allergic to sulfa drugs have not
yet been identified (1).
Newly identified clusters of cases of cyclosporiasis should be
investigated to identify the vehicles of infection and their sources
and modes of contamination. Although cases of cyclosporiasis are not
yet reportable in all U.S. states and territories, such cases are
nationally notifiable. Clinicians and laboratorians who identify
cases of cyclosporiasis, especially ones unrelated to foreign travel,
are encouraged to inform the appropriate local public health
officials, who are encouraged to contact CDC's Division of Parasitic
Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases. To report cases
and potential outbreaks, contact CDC, telephone 770-488-7319; for
questions about laboratory diagnosis of infection, 770-488-4474; for
clinical questions, 770-488-7775. Additional information about
