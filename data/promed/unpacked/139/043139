An _Escherichia coli_ outbreak linked to a Merritt Street restaurant has
hospitalized 4 young Niagara residents, including a 2 year old. Public
health officials closed Yaman, located at 491 Merritt St, at noon on Tue 5
Jun 2007 and are asking anyone who has eaten there since 17 May 2007 to
call the health department at 905-688-3762. So far, 4 young patients,
ranging in age from 2 to 16 years, are infected with _E. coli_ O157.
"We have a fairly serious level of concern here, especially for children,"
said Dr Doug Sider, the Niagara Region's associate medical officer of
health. Infected children under the age of 5 are especially susceptible to
complications leading to kidney failure, Sider said. One of the patients
has been sent home, but 3 remain hospitalized.
Sider wouldn't comment on the severity of their conditions, but added "you
always have to be worried. Unfortunately, it's a nasty infection." Other
family members will be monitored for symptoms, and Sider said he expects
the department will test dozens of other customers.
_E. coli_ 0157 is infamous as the bacterial strain that killed 7 people and
sickened hundreds of others in 2000 during an outbreak in Walkerton.
Sider said the public health department received its 1st report of illness
on the weekend, and the latest on Mon 4 Jun 2007. All 4 victims, from 3
families spread across the region, ate at the restaurant during a short
timeframe, Sider said. It's too early to know the source of the outbreak,
he added, but investigators will test food samples, review food handling
practices and talk to staff in the next few days.
An answer may be weeks away, but Sider said he's grateful the evidence
pointed so quickly to a single establishment. "To be able to do that so
quickly is uncommon," he said.
