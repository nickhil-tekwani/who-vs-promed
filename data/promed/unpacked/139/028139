Bovine ephemeral fever, also known as 3-day sickness, has been confirmed in a cattle herd in Kyogle Shire, and there have been reports of clinical signs of the disease in Tweed and Byron Shires. "It is expected the disease will move south as the season progresses," said a spokesperson for North Coast Local Land Services (NCLLS).

Three-day sickness is an insect-transmitted virus of cattle causing a high fever and pain in the muscles and joints. On the North Coast, it is usually seen in cattle between 6 months and 2 years of age; however, if they are from outside the region, adult cattle can also experience the disease.

"Affected cattle are often by themselves, off their feed, seek shade and water, shiver, drool and are lame. Signs usually last only a few days, and most cattle recover uneventfully. Some cattle -- especially bulls and heavier conditioned cattle -- may go down and take several days to get back on their feet. Heavier cattle are at an increased risk of secondary complications as a result of being down. Pregnant cows may abort, and bulls may become infertile for up to 3 months."

The virus appears on the North Coast in summer as the population of the biting insects transmitting it increases. The occurrence of the disease is likely to increase following the recent rainfall in the region, providing favourable conditions for the insect populations to increase rapidly.

"Producers are encouraged to seek veterinary advice, and medication is highly effective in bringing down the fever and reducing the muscle and joint pain. Recovery tends to be quicker with less weight loss. There are several other diseases resembling 3-day sickness requiring alternative treatment, so veterinary diagnosis is essential," said the spokesperson.

"A paddock with plenty of shade, water and feed and free of steep gullies is ideal for cattle to recover in. Any affected cattle should be provided with shade, water and feed and turned or lifted 2 times daily to help prevent secondary complications.

"Recently recovered cattle should not be sent to the abattoirs for several weeks to give the body a chance to heal and avoid the possibility of downgrades from any residual muscle damage. Where treatments have been given, any withholding periods must be observed.

"A vaccine is available, and its use is strongly recommended for bulls and any cattle introduced from areas which do not normally experience the virus. In those areas where the virus is already active the vaccine is unlikely to provide protection, though in more southern areas there may still be time for the vaccine to provide protection before the virus arrives."

[This article provides some good insights into the disease. This disease is not a zoonotic disease.

The following is excerpted from Fenner's Veterinary Virology, 5th edition (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/bovine-ephemeral-fever):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Although the clinical and epidemiological presentations of bovine ephemeral fever are highly characteristic, laboratory confirmation is required. A diagnostic increase in antibody titer, or preferably seroconversion, can be detected by enzyme immunoassay, including blocking ELISA, by neutralization assays, which are virus specific, or by immunofluorescence or agar gel precipitin tests, which are cross-reactive with related rhabdoviruses. Although virus isolation was the traditional 'gold standard,' real-time RT-PCR assays are now routinely employed to achieve rapid (i.e., 'same day') confirmation of bovine ephemeral fever.

Immunity, prevention, and control
---------------------------------
"Infection results in solid, long-lasting immunity. Because outbreaks tend to involve a high proportion of animals in a herd, repeat clinical episodes usually involve young animals born since previous outbreaks. Prevention by vector control is impractical in the areas of the world where this disease is prevalent. Vaccination has been used in endemic countries, including Australia, Bahrain, China, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Namibia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Turkey. Both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines are used, although repeated immunization is often required. Problems with conventional vaccines stem from their lack of potency -- inactivated vaccines require more antigenic mass than it has been possible to achieve economically, and live-attenuated vaccines suffer from a loss in immunogenicity linked to the attenuation process (see Chapter 4: Antiviral Immunity and Virus Vaccines). Immunization with the bovine ephemeral fever virus G protein alone can confer protective immunity in cattle, as can recombinant vectors that express this protein." - Mod.TG
