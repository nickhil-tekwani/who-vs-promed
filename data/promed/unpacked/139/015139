The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed
yesterday [11 Jul 2007] that turkeys from a
Virginia farm carried antibodies indicating
possible past exposure to a mild form of H5N1
avian influenza virus. Virginia's agriculture
department had announced 9 Jul 2007 that samples
collected during routine preslaughter testing
initially showed the birds had antibodies to an H5 virus.
In a press release 11 Jul 2007, John Clifford,
the USDA's chief veterinary officer, said tests
at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories
(NVSL) in Ames, IA, indicated that the antibodies
correspond to an H5N1 subtype.
"There have been no signs of illness or death in
the birds, indicating that this is not the highly
pathogenic H5N1 virus that has spread through
birds in Asia, Europe, and Africa," Clifford
stated. The NVSL will run further tests to better
identify the virus the birds may have been exposed to, Clifford said.
So far, tests suggest that the antibodies
detected correspond to the low-pathogenic North
American strain of H5N1, which usually causes
only minor illness or no noticeable signs in birds, the USDA said.
Several thousand poultry samples collected from
other poultry operations near the affected
Shenandoah Valley turkey farm have all tested
negative for avian influenza, which further
suggests that the antibodies found in the turkeys
involve a common avian flu virus that poses no threat to humans, Clifford said.
When the USDA expanded its avian flu testing
program for wild birds beyond Alaska in 2006,
several birds, such as a green-winged teal in
Delaware and mallard ducks in Illinois and
Michigan, tested positive or were presumed
positive for the mild North American H5N1 strain.
In a fact sheet on the low-pathogenic H5N1, the
USDA said the strain was detected in apparently
healthy wild birds as long ago as 1975. In 2002,
antibodies to the same strain were found in
samples from Michigan turkeys, but the virus could not be isolated.
After Virginia officials announced the antibody
findings, Richard Wilkes, the state veterinarian,
banned all bird sales and exhibitions until 30
Jul 2007 and restricted the application of
poultry litter on fields in 17 counties,
according to a 9 Jul 2007 press release.

[Although this is a low pathogenic strain, the
regulatory authorities will be closely watching.
It is possible for such a strain to mutate to
highly pathogenic, it does not seem likely, as
there are no sick birds indicating the stain is
changing according to other pressures. ï¿½ Mod.TG]
