Mosquito control measures in Hawaii
This is in response to the moderator's request (22 June 1998) for
information on mosquito control activities in Hawaii regarding dengue fever
control.
The Vector Control Branch attempts to maintain a mosquito-free zone around
seaports and airports through a program of perimeter insecticide treatment
to prevent the entry of alien disease transmitting mosquitoes.
In recent years, the only reported dengue fever cases have been imported.
For dengue fever prevention, when a person is reported as being suspected
of having dengue fever and is still ill (might transmit the virus to local
mosquitoes), all possible sites frequented by the victim are surveyed for
mosquito breeding sites and adults of both _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes
aegypti_ (found only in pockets on the islands of Hawaii, Molokai and
Lanai). A minimum radius of 200 yards (normal flight range) from the focal
point is thoroughly inspected. All mosquitoes of these two species found
in this "zone" are eliminated by adulticiding and/or larviciding.

[I am not clear as to who exactly sent this message, David Sasaki or George
Kitaguchi (Vector Control Branch, Hawaii Department of Health). Apologies
if I have misattributed it.
In any event, thanks to the sender for this information. Maintaining
Hawaii as a dengue-free zone is not only important medically but is
important for the tourism industry there, and therefore is important
politically. Obviously, Hawaiian authorities are doing their best to see
that Hawaii remains free of dengue. - Mod.CHC
