Molecular epidemiology of hepatitis C virus among injecting drug users in Hungary
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Treso B, Takacs M, Dencs A, Dudas M, Par A, Rusvai E]

The aim of this study was to determine the geographical distribution of hepatitis C virus genotypes/subtypes among people who inject drugs (PWID) recruited at 22 needle exchange sites and drug outpatient services in all 7 Planning and Statistical Regions of Hungary. Of 198 such PWID, 147 (74.2 per cent), 45 (22.7 per cent), and 6 (3.0 per cent) carried genotype 1, 3, or 4, respectively, and 31 (72.1 per cent) of the 43 genotype 1 sequences were of subtype 1a. Genotype 3 was significantly more prevalent in provincial towns than in the capital, Budapest. Injecting for a longer period and an older age both correlated with a higher prevalence of genotype 3, suggesting possible future changes in genotype distribution. The distributions of hepatitis C virus genotypes/subtypes differed significantly between the tested PWID and the general population. The identification of genotype 3 reflected its worldwide occurrence among PWID. Our results underline the importance of genotyping before treatment, especially among people who have ever injected drugs in Hungary.

Introduction
------------
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) may rarely cause symptomatic acute hepatitis. The infection becomes persistent in about 85 per cent of these cases, and its persistence may be responsible for liver cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV has been suggested to have 6 genotypes, which differ from each other by 31-33 per cent at the nucleotide level and are further classified into several subtypes. These genotypes have different susceptibility to treatment. Each genotype and subtype exhibits a certain geographical distribution, for example, genotypes 1, 2, and 3 occur virtually worldwide. On the American continent subtype 1a is the most prevalent, in Europe it is subtype 1b. Genotype 4 is mainly present in North and Central Africa and in the Middle East. Genotype 3 originates from Asia, but subtype 3a is widely distributed among people who inject drugs (PWID) around the world. In Hungary, subtype 1b has been reported in 85 per cent, subtype 1a in 4.5 per cent, and genotype 3 in 0.5 per cent of chronic HCV carriers among the general population, with mixed infections in the remainder. A similar genotype distribution, but without mixed infections, has been observed in southern Hungary.

Since the screening of blood products for HCV was introduced in Europe in the 1990s, HCV transmission has become closely associated with the sharing of injection equipment among PWID. In Hungary, 126 acute HCV cases were reported to the National Center for Epidemiology (NCE) from 2006 to 2010. In 72 cases, the epidemiological investigations revealed potential risk factors, and injection drug use was reported in 20 of these patients. The seroprevalence of HCV among PWID is high (22.6 per cent in 2008) relative to similar age groups in the general population (less than 1 per cent).

No data are available on HCV genotypes in Hungarian PWID. The aims of the present study were therefore to determine the genotype and subtype distributions in this group, to predict possible changes in such distributions, and to examine the phylogenetic relatedness of the HCV sequences.

Discussion
----------
The genotype and subtype distributions of HCV were found to differ between PWID and the general population. The abundance of genotype 3 and subtype 1a among PWID was in accordance with data on PWID in industrialised nations worldwide. Since genotype 3 and subtype 1a are rare in the general Hungarian population, we assume that Hungary is involved in the worldwide epidemic of these genotypes among PWID, and that genotype 3 and subtype 1a may possibly have entered the Hungarian population of PWID from abroad. Genotype 3 proved to be significantly more frequent among PWID who entered the study in the provincial towns than in Budapest. This observation suggests that PWID communities with different genotype frequencies exist in Hungary.

Of the 4 HCV genotype 4-infected PWID outside Budapest, 3 were residents of the same town, Veszprem (ca. 64 000 inhabitants). Only 4 PWID in Veszprem were found to be positive for HCV: 3 of them carried genotype 4 and one genotype 3. Although few viruses were genotyped, our data suggested a possible epidemic of HCV genotype 4 among PWID in Veszprem. In contrast, all 5 HCV RNA-positive individuals detected in the general population of Veszprem carried genotype 1. HCV genotype 4 is often associated with drug injection use in Europe.

A shorter duration of drug injection use was found to correlate with a higher prevalence of genotype 1 and a lower prevalence of genotype 3. The prevalence of genotype 1 was significantly higher in the youngest age group (younger than 25 years old). Younger PWID are most likely to present with a more recently acquired infection. These data suggest that the prevalence of HCV genotypes may drift towards genotype 1 in the future among Hungarian PWID. In contrast, the genotype recently emerging among PWID in the Czech Republic is genotype 3. No other publication was found about changes in genotype distributions in other neighbouring countries.

The correlation between the HCV genotype and the type of drug injected was not confirmed after adjusting the data to the duration of injection drug use and geographical distribution. Consequently, the correlation between opiate use and infection with genotype 3 was probably due to an association of opiate use with the users' older age and the duration of drug use.

The prevalence of different genotypes observed in the general population in Hungary was similar to our results. Importantly, none of the individuals in our study was infected with more than one genotype or subtype, either in the general population or among the PWID, whereas others have identify mixed infections. This difference might be due to the use of different versions of the LIPA kit for subtyping.

Phylogenetic analysis of the NS5B nucleotide sequences of the genotype 3 viruses confirmed previous findings that genotype 3 HCVs from PWID in different geographical areas do not form well-defined clades. However, some clear sub-clusters with strong bootstrap values were apparent in the Hungarian sequences, suggesting that the individuals in the sub-clusters were infected by each other, probably through unsafe practices of drug injection. We did not sequence the whole genomes, thus recombinant viruses may not have been recognised if they were present, and may have been misclassified.

The determination of HCV genotypes in PWID is of more than epidemiological significance. More than 95 per cent of the HCV carriers in the Hungarian general population are infected with HCV genotype 1. The current National Treatment Protocol specifies that genotyping is not compulsory before treatment and is strongly recommended only for foreign nationals living in Hungary. Our findings lead us to propose that the Treatment Protocol should be modified to include Hungarian PWID in addition to foreigners. Since genotype 3 is relatively susceptible to treatment and is common among PWID, it is possible that the shorter treatment time (24 versus 48 weeks) and the higher cure rate (greater than 75 per cent versus about 45 per cent) can help convince people who have ever injected drugs to accept and complete a course of treatment, and would also reduce costs. We assume that genotyping and subtyping will remain or become a more important tool for individualised therapy in the future in view of upcoming treatments with direct acting agents.

[Determination of the genotypes of hepatitis C virus is more than an academic exercise because the genotypes and subtypes respond differently to the increasing number of antivirals now becoming available and to treatment protocols. Each genotype and subtype exhibits a certain geographical distribution; genotypes 1, 2, and 3 occur virtually worldwide. On the American continent subtype 1a is the most prevalent, in Europe it is subtype 1b. Genotype 4 is mainly present in North and Central Africa and in the Middle East. Genotype 3 originates from Asia, but subtype 3a is widely distributed among people who inject drugs around the world. In Hungary, subtype 1b has been reported in 85 per cent, subtype 1a in 4.5 per cent, and genotype 3 in 0.5 per cent of chronic HCV carriers among the general population, with mixed infections in the remainder.

From their analysis the authors have established that genotype 3 is prevalent in injecting drug users in Hungary (in contrast to genotype 1 in the general population) and suggest that that since genotype 3 is relatively more susceptible to treatment it is possible that a shorter treatment time (24 versus 48 weeks) and the higher cure rate (greater than 75 per cent versus about 45 per cent) can help convince injecting drug users to accept and complete a course of treatment, that would also reduce costs. - Mod.CP
