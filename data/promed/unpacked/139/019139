Today, 26 Jul 2022, a collegial meeting addressing "the results of the socio-economic development of the 1st half of 2022 for the Osh region and the tasks for the 2nd half of the year" is being held at the authorized representative office of the president in Osh region.

As informed by Deputy Presidential Envoy Uristem Manapov, 95% of vaccinations and 91% of diagnostics have been completed according to the half-year plan.

"Blood samples were obtained from 1377 horses, 54 558 cattle, 2817 sheep and goats, and 95 dogs for brucellosis, which is dangerous for animals and humans. As a result, 235 head of cattle were diagnosed with brucellosis and slaughtered based on veterinary sanitary rules. The cattle were allowed to be slaughtered and then disposed of.

"The number of people with brucellosis is 46, which is 12 more than last year," he said.

[In Kyrgyzstan, the prevalence of brucellosis in humans and animals is higher than in other Central Asian countries. Persistent traditional agricultural practice and lifestyles, as well as consumption of fresh dairy products, contribute to this high prevalence. Currently, despite its endemicity, brucellosis remains underdiagnosed and underreported. Also, the transmission between livestock and humans has not yet been studied in detail in Kyrgyzstan.

According to a 2013 study, _Brucella melitensis_ is endemic in Naryn (a province neighboring Osh on its north-east), and sheep are apparently the main source of infection for cattle (Ref 1). _Brucella_ isolates from animals from other regions of Kyrgyzstan are rare. Identification and genotyping of _Brucella_ isolates are not routinely established. Therefore, the genetic epidemiology of circulating strains cannot be assessed in detail throughout the country. However, it may be assumed that _B. melitensis_ is the main pathogen, countrywise.

The above and additional information is available in a recent review (Ref 2).

Introduction of mass vaccination in small ruminants, applying mainly the live-attenuated REV1 vaccine (eye-drop administration), has evidently contributed to improvement of the brucellosis situation in Kyrgyzstan, 2010 - 2019, reducing the number of infections in animals as well as humans. The current reported increased infection rate is concerning and may reflect decreased control activities since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Brucellosis remains a serious public health and veterinary problem in Kyrgyzstan. The media report from Osh lacks information on the results of the samples obtained from sheep and goats. Such information will be helpful, as well as information on the identity of strains obtained from humans, countrywise. - Mod.AS
