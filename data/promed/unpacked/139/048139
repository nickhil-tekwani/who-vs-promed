FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - SOUTH AFRICA: NOT

I would like to comment on the ProMED-mail posting of Fri, 24 Jan 2003,
with the heading "Zimbabwe foot and mouth hits neighbors in Johannesburg"
[Foot & mouth disease - Zimbabwe: vaccination 20030125.0228].
Both this heading and the following article are very misleading as South
Africa is presently foot and mouth disease (FMD) free. South Africa
regained its officially recognised OIE FMD-free zone status on 31 May 2002,
and there have been no FMD outbreaks since our last reported outbreak in
the FMD controlled area of Bushbuckridge in Limpopo Province in 2001. It is
true that the FMD situation in Zimbabwe is of great concern to all South
Africans, and especially to the livestock industry and veterinary services.
South African Veterinary Services have taken every precaution at their
disposal to prevent FMD from entering the country. There are strict import
bans on all cloven-hoofed animals and animal products. There is also a
substantial increase in control of people and animal movements both at the
border posts and along the entire border fence.
South Africa has a very proud reputation for prompt and efficient reporting
of all OIE List A diseases. I would once again like to stress that South
Africa is recognised by the OIE as being officially free from FMD, except
for the official FMD controlled area around the Kruger National Park and
surrounding game reserves, and there have been no recent outbreaks of FMD
anywhere in the country.

[The title of the article in The Telegraph could indeed be confusing;
ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr van Wyk for this authoritative clarification.
We wish the South African Veterinary Services success in their energetic
endeavors to maintain South Africa's FMD-free status in spite of the
deteriorating situation in the region. For details on South Africa's
contingency plan, see ref below. - Mod.AS]
