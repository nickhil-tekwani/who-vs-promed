The Director of Portugal's Ricardo Jorge Institute Vector Surveillance Network, Maria Joao Alves, issued an alert about the possible entry of the dengue mosquito vector into the continent from Madeira Island, where it appeared in the autumn of this year [2012]

Joao Alves stated, however, that the risk represented by the presence of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, dengue virus vector, in continental Portugal is less than for [the island of] Madeira, because the temperatures are more rigorous [on the continent].

The appearance of dengue on Madeira Island has affected more than 2000 people, however, the number of reported cases has declined in recent weeks. Even so, specialists do not discard [the possibility] that the mosquito could arrive in continental Portugal soon. Given this situation, protection measures have been intensified and the traffic from the island has proceeded normally. The head of the Ricardo Jorge Institute considered that there is "a real risk that the mosquito can arrive in continental Portugal," where the _Aedes aegypti_ was present in the middle part of the past century [mid-1900s].

According to the latest bulletin issued by the Office of General Health Administration, during the last 12 weeks 2103 dengue cases were registered on Madeira, that caused the hospitalization of 122 affected people.

The appearance of the dengue [vector] mosquito in Madeira was reported this past 3 Oct [2012], but to date, there have been no fatalities.

[The number of dengue cases on Madeira Island continues to increase, from 2010 reported on 13 Dec 2012 to the 2103 cases and 122 hospitalizations officially reported above.

The establishment of _Aedes aegypti_ in continental Portugal seems more likely to occur during the warmer months than now, at the beginning of the winter season. There is no comment offered about the presence or possible spread of another competent dengue virus vector, _Aedes albopictus_ in continental Portugal.
