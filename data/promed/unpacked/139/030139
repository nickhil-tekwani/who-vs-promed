A cholera outbreak in war-ravaged Yemen has killed 315 people since [27 Apr 2017], the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said on [Sun 21 May 2017]. The cholera infection is continuing to spread across Yemen with more than 29 300 suspected cases reported in 19 of the country's 22 provinces, the agency added in a tweet.

The latest tallies come a day after the international charity organisation Doctors without Borders [Médecins Sans Frontières] warned that the cholera outbreak could get out of control in Yemen. The impoverished country has been devastated by a power struggle between a Saudi-backed government and Iran-aligned rebels since late 2014. Yemen's ongoing violence has taken a toll on its healthcare centres.

Last week [15 to 21 May 2017], a state of emergency was declared in the rebel-held capital Sana'a after a large number of cholera cases were detected in the city. More than half of the country's medical facilities no longer function, the WHO said. Some 7.6 million people live in Yemen's cholera-threatened areas, according to UN estimates.

On [Fri 19 May 2017], the WHO warned that Yemen could have as many as 300 000 cases of cholera within 6 months and an "extremely high" number of deaths. "We need to expect something that could go up to 200 000-250 000 cases over the next 6 months, in addition to the 50 000 cases that have already occurred," Nevio Zagaria, WHO Yemen representative, told reporters in Geneva. The cost in lives from an infection rate on this scale would be "extremely, extremely high", he said, adding that "the speed of the resurgence of the cholera epidemic is unprecedented [for Yemen]".

[Cholera follows floods, droughts, wars and natural disasters. What is happening in Yemen now, like what occurred (and is still occurring) in Haiti shows how this classical infection can behave when introduced into a vulnerable population.

The increasing numbers are as follows:

Date [2017] / Cases / Deaths
8 May / 1360 / 25
11 May / 2752 / 51
13 May / 8595 / 115
14 May / 11 000 / 180
17 May / 17 200 / 209
19 May / 23 500 / 242
21 May / 29 300 / 315
