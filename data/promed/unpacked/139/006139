KUANTAN: Some people in Kampung Cherating, about 60 km from here, are
alarmed over the discovery of a dead greenback turtle, a stingray, and
many fish, believing a green substance found in the Cherating river
nearby is polluting the sea.
Shivaun Orton, 29, who operates a resort, said she found a dead
stingray measuring 1.5 m across, about 100 m from her place early this
month. "On July 15, I saw the remains of an adult turtle close to
where I found the stingray. When I first found it thought nothing
about it but I felt something was amiss when I came across the dead
turtle. I believe there is something killing the marine life here and
the authorities should check what is in the Cherating river."
Orton said she also came across a green foamy slick in front of her
resort, adding that her 2 children developed rashes and sores after
taking a dip in the sea. "I, too, developed green and round festers on
an open ankle wound. My guests also complained of the same symptoms
and some had to take anti-itch shots to relieve the pain." Orton said
she reported the turtle carcass to the Cherating turtle
sanctuary on Friday but has yet to receive a response.
World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature (Malaysia) scientific officer Lau Min
Min, who was at the site with the senior head of Animal Species, Dr
Dionysius S.K. Sharma and WWF corporate affairs manager Teoh Teik
Hoong, said the authorities must take water samples from the sea and
river. "This is to determine whether the river was polluted with toxic
waste [that may have come from the Gebeng Industrial estate.
Something is causing marine life to die. Moreover, the residents here
said it was rare to find dead turtles or stingrays. But there is
definitely something wrong with the water here based on the slick and
the green foam seen." Checks at the mouth of the river showed the
froth left traces of green foam and this I believe, is not a natural
process," said Dr Sharma, adding there were also dead [fish fry found
close to the river mouth.
Local resident Ismail Ahmad, 43, who was looking for crabs, said it
was normal for the river to be foamy, adding he did not develop any
itch after wading into the river. He said he found nothing abnormal in
the river, adding that the turtle or the stingray could have died
after being caught in a fishermen's net. "I grew up here. I have seen
the foam before and it is not unusual."
