The report of the international team on their Wuhan field visit, from [14 Jan-10 Feb 2021], was published today [30 Mar 2021] as WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for further studies.

The report stems from a Member State resolution adopted by consensus at the World Health Assembly in May 2020 and calling on WHO "to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts, including through efforts such as scientific and collaborative field missions."

In remarks to Member States today [30 Mar 2021], Dr Tedros, who received the full report on the weekend, thanked the team for their tireless work. He said it advances our understanding in important ways while raising questions that will need to be addressed by further studies, as noted in the report. "As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table. This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end. We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do," said Dr Tedros. "Finding the origin of a virus takes time and we owe it to the world to find the source so we can collectively take steps to reduce the risk of this happening again. No single research trip can provide all the answers."

Background information [abridged]
---------------------------------
From the very beginning of the pandemic WHO has stressed the need to understand the origin of the virus in order to better understand the emergence of new pathogens and possible exposures.

Throughout 2020, WHO continued to discuss with China and other Member States the need to study and share information around the virus origins.

The World Health Assembly resolution of May 2020, which was adopted by all Member States, cited "as part of the One-Health Approach to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population."

In July 2020 WHO sent a small team to China to plan a joint study comprising Chinese and independent international scientists. It was agreed that WHO would select the international scientists. The Terms of Reference for the Virus Origins Study were completed by fall 2020 [available at https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-convened-global-study-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2].

The team of scientists came from around the world: Australia, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Kenya, Netherlands, Qatar, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Viet Nam.

The joint international team comprised 17 Chinese and 17 international experts from 10 other countries as well as the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE); and WHO [see list at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus].

From the outset, this study was designed as one step on the path of understanding the origins of COVID-19 reflecting the specific scope and mandate as outlined by Member States in the World Health Assembly resolution and negotiated Terms of Reference.

[The WHO report, mentioned above, includes 2 exhaustive components:
1. WHO-convened Global Study of Origins of SARS-CoV-2: China Part. Joint WHO-China Study, [14 Jan-10 Feb 2021], Joint Report, 120 pages, [30 Mar 2021]; available for download at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus.
2. Annexes to the Joint Report (26 annexes, including experts' presentations, 193 pages) at https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-convened-global-study-of-origins-of-sars-cov-2-china-part-annexes.pdf.

According to the report, the WHO selected an international multidisciplinary team of experts "to work closely with a multidisciplinary team of Chinese experts in the design, support, and conduct of these studies and to conduct a follow-up visit to review progress and agree upon a series of further studies." The joint international team comprised 17 Chinese and 17 international experts from other countries, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). (see Annex B). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) participated as an observer.

The team agreed, following arrival in China, upon a work plan and established 3 working groups to review the progress made in Phase 1 studies in the areas of:
1. epidemiology;
2. animals and the environment; and
3. molecular epidemiology and bioinformatics.

In addition to group work, the team shared scientific and thematic presentations on relevant topics to help inform its work, undertook a series of site visits to important locations, and conducted interviews with key informants.

The joint international team made a series of recommendations for each area (see details in the report). Eventually, it conducted a qualitative risk assessment, considering the available scientific evidence and findings, to assess the likelihood of 4 different possible pathways for the introduction of the virus from the virus reservoir (bats or pangolins). The final assessment of each possible pathway was as follows:
- direct zoonotic transmission to humans (spillover): considered to be a possible-to-likely pathway;
- introduction through an intermediate host followed by spillover: considered to be a likely to very likely pathway;
- introduction through the (cold) food chain: considered a possible pathway;
- introduction through a laboratory incident: considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway.

In this respect, the comment of WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to member-states, indicating that "As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table", is of significance.

Some highlights:
1. The epidemic in Wuhan preceded the spread in the rest of Hubei Province.
2. No firm conclusion about the role of the Huanan market in the origin of the outbreak, or how the infection was introduced into the market, can currently be drawn.
3. Coronaviruses most highly related to SARS-CoV-2 are found in bats and pangolins, suggesting that these mammals may be the reservoir of the virus that causes COVID-19. However, neither of the viruses identified so far from these mammalian species is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 to serve as its direct progenitor.
4. The high susceptibility of mink and cats to SARS-CoV2 suggests that additional species of animals may act as a potential reservoir.
5. Based on molecular sequence data, the outbreak may have started some time in the months before the middle of December 2019. The point estimates for the time to the most recent ancestor ranged from late September to early December [2019]; most estimates were between mid-November and early December [2019].
6. Widespread contamination of surfaces with SARS-CoV-2 in the Huanan market was compatible with introduction of the virus through infected people, infected animals, or contaminated products. See page 98 of the report, "Figure 2: Map of the Huanan Market, showing locations of stalls where domesticated wildlife products were sold in relation to environmental testing results, and confirmed human cases of COVID-19."
7. For the data of animal species that may have been traded in the Huanan market before its closure, see, page 189 of Annex F, Table 3: "List of supplier type, location, and animal products [including live animals] for all vendors selling wildlife products at Huanan Market."

Views of the exhaustive WHO/China report/annexes by COVID-19 experts, globally, after studying it, in particular illuminating the gross lacunes in the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 origin, may be anticipated. - Mod.AS
