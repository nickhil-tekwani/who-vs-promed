An uncommon but fatal liver disease affecting dairy cattle in Australia's southern and south eastern states is no longer confined to autumn, but has been found to be affecting herds throughout the year.

Acute bovine liver disease (ABLD) has periodically affected dairy cows in South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Tasmania -- with up to 83 per cent of a herd affected in June on one dairy farm in south west Victoria and more than 50 per cent of 2 herds affected in Gippsland, one herd in October, the other one in April.

Half of the animals died in the outbreak in south west Victoria and the remainder showed significant production loss, along with health issues such as ongoing photosensitivity. Half the herd died on one of the affected Gippsland farms.

A dairy farm in central Gippsland was quarantined for an anthrax outbreak initially, but a postmortem diagnosis on one of the affected cows, by a local veterinarian, identified ABLD.

Unfortunately, ABLD also has similar signs to other liver diseases, such as acute liver fluke and acute venocaval syndrome, and facial eczema.

Provisional misdiagnoses have included rye-grass staggers, plant or lead toxicity, hypomagneseamia, clostridial disease, pestivirus, anthrax, Johne's disease, nitrate poisoning, and blue-green algae toxicity, all of which have had to be excluded when cattle die suddenly.

This has led to a strong belief among authorities the farmers are not reporting small numbers of deaths, which means the extent of the problem is difficult to identify.

"Cases require samples taken from necropsy to diagnose. It's expected less severe cases may be occurring without being diagnosed," Agriculture Victoria Maffra district veterinary officer Michael Roberts said.

Information from Gribbles Veterinary Pathology and Agriculture Victoria indicates biochemistry revealed elevated liver enzymes and lesions observed within the liver of affected cattle (acute periportal necrosis and haemorrhage) were considered most compatible with a diagnosis of ABLD, or another hepatotoxic agent (plant or mycotoxin).

ABLD is a reportable disease because state authorities are trying to collate as much information as possible, to build knowledge about it.

It is also a syndrome, according to some veterinarians.

"ABLD is a syndrome associated with significant liver damage in cattle of all ages and classes, in Victoria, Tasmania, and parts of South Australia," Dr Roberts said.

There has been some progress on understanding what causes ABLD, with a toxin identified, but research is ongoing to identify if weather or other conditions, including pasture species, can identify if there is a short window of toxicity in pastures.

Weather conditions vary when ABLD occurs -- it has affected cattle following a distinct weather pattern: a dry period, then sudden rain in a short period of 15 mm or more, then a dry warm period; however, it has also occurred when low rainfall has been followed by bitterly cold and frosty weather.

ABLD does appear to coincide with the introduction of cattle onto less fertile areas of the farm or into new paddocks with dry feed -- including a grass known as rough dog's tail (_Cynosurus echinatus_) when it contains a highly toxic fungus on the standing heads.

For some farmers, feeding grain and fodder during a period of dry climate conditions also appears to be an implicating factor.

According to information provided by Biosecurity Tasmania and Agriculture Victoria, in cattle that don't die suddenly, the most acute sign is photosensitisation, which occurs when plant breakdown products react with sunlight in the skin.

Affected cattle may be distressed, agitated, seek shade, and develop sunburn on the muzzle and areas of pale skin, udder and vulva.

Other ongoing signs include fever, reduced milk production, and depression.

Some breeds of dairy cattle are at high risk to sunburn when they have large expanses of white hair in their coats.

If ABLD results in the death of cattle on-farm, the animals can be buried or disposed of according to state or territory requirements; affected, but still living, cattle can be sent to a knackery.

In the case of the central Gippsland dairy farm, the farmers recorded a meticulous amount of weather and paddock rotation data.

The forensic examination revealed the affected animals were all from the same paddock. A portion of the herd went back into that paddock and were not affected. However, on a 3rd rotation, some of the same cows grazed that paddock within the same weather patterns and a 2nd effect of ABLD was observed.

Unfortunately, by the time the implication of a toxin byproduct was made, it was no longer evident -- if it had existed -- on the pasture.

The standout defining sample from diagnosis among the cattle on this farm was the liver lesions.

The main clinical presentation was a number of the herd dying suddenly, with some bleeding.

In Tasmania, ABLD has been recorded in herds in the northern midlands and south, particularly the Derwent Valley and Copping areas.

In southern Victoria, ABLD has been diagnosed in herds in the south-western Warrnambool and Camperdown district, in the central and east Gippsland regions in the south east, and on some farms along the border region of Victoria and South Australia.

Herds in south west Victoria and south east SA were affected in autumn, whereas cattle in Gippsland have been affected in winter, spring, and summer.

[Thus far, this unusual disease/toxin appears to be only in Victoria and Tasmania and perhaps other very southern regions.

Severely affected animals undergo rapid clinical progression with mortalities often occurring prior to the recognition of clinical signs. Less severely affected animals develop photosensitization and a proportion can develop liver failure. The characteristic histopathological lesion in acute fatal cases is severe, with acute necrosis of periportal hepatocytes with hemorrhage into the necrotic areas.

Currently there are a small number of toxins that are known to cause periportal necrosis in cattle, although none of these have so far been linked to ABLD. Furthermore, ABLD has frequently been associated with the presence of rough dog's tail grass (_Cynosurus echinatus_) and _Drechslera_ spp. fungi in the pasture system, but it is currently unknown if these are etiological factors. Much of the knowledge about ABLD is contained within case reports, with very little experimental research investigating the specific cause(s).

Acute bovine liver disease (ABLD), formerly known as phytotoxic hepatitis, is a hepatotoxic disease principally affecting grazing beef and dairy cattle regardless of age, sex, or breed. There have been 2 documented cases of mycotoxicoses in sheep with a similar epidemiology to ABLD, which implies ABLD may not be specific to cattle. However, no further reports are documented, suggesting that if sheep are affected it is uncommon, presumably because of their differing grazing habits. This review will therefore focus on ABLD affecting cattle but much of the evidence presented is likely to be applicable to affected sheep.

Cases of ABLD are commonly reported in autumn/winter (April-July) almost every year, beginning around the time of the 1st rainfall and cooler temperatures after summer. Climatic risk factors for ABLD include a minimum temperature of 12 deg C [53.6 deg F] or higher, more than 4 mm rainfall with high humidity, and calm conditions for greater than days prior. Furthermore, it is likely additional cases of unrecognized or unreported ABLD also occur. This has resulted in speculation on the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease. The current advice to graziers includes avoiding putting cattle on high-risk paddocks, grazing out high-risk paddocks with sheep to reduce the amount of dry standing grass, cultivating high-risk paddocks, and grazing a small number of cattle on high-risk paddocks to test for toxicity.

Clarke and Weaver (Clarke RJ, Weaver JP. Acute bovine liver disease. In Proceedings of the Australian Association of Cattle Veterinarians; Australian Cattle Veterinarians: Brisbane, Australia, 2002; pp. 65-67) reported that the onset of clinical signs can occur as early as 12 h after apparent exposure. The clinical manifestation of ABLD consistently includes an initial drop in milk production, secondary photosensitization, and altered behavior such as seeking shade even on overcast days. Depression, pyrexia, loss of appetite, and agitation may be observed in some cattle. Acute cases may result in death before clinical signs are observed. Upon necropsy, liver damage is evident and periportal necrosis is often observed histologically. Hemorrhaging into the necrotic periportal area and progressive hepatocyte damage may also be observed. Serum biochemistry often reveals a marked elevation of glutamate dehydrogenase and aspartate transaminase activities and moderate increases in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, indicating liver damage. Although a biochemistry pattern such as this is consistently observed when ABLD is diagnosed, it is not specific for the diagnosis of ABLD. Furthermore, although periportal necrosis is a characteristic feature of acute and fatal ABLD, the pathology may be present in more chronic, sub-lethal cases has not been documented. It may be more difficult to differentiate from other hepatotoxicoses, and so incorrect diagnoses may be made. Additional documentation of histological features at different stages of toxicosis is required to better define ABLD.

Currently, the experimental evidence suggests _Drechslera_ spp. infecting rough dog's tail is the principle source of ABLD toxin. Aslani et al (Aslani MR, Pascoe I, Kowalski M, et al. In vitro detection of hepatocytotoxic metabolites from _Drechslera biseptata_: A contributing factor to acute bovine liver disease? Aust J Exp Agric 2006, 46(5): 599-604; https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/EA05204] found spores only had limited cytotoxicity; thus, spores may also contain ABLD toxin, but at a much lower concentration. Consequently, ingestion of either or both mycelium or spores may cause ABLD and the grazing habits of individual cattle would likely affect the concentration of ABLD toxin ingested. As with most poisonings, the concentration of toxin ingested is likely to cause the diversity in clinical signs commonly observed for ABLD.

Autumn climatic conditions may stimulate the production of fungal toxins or toxic spores which the cattle are exposed to when grazing infected grass. Contaminants of senescing rough dog's tail grass could be transferred to nearby palatable pasture via natural processes or by mechanical means. However, the specific toxin(s) and their source remain conjectural and their stability in the environment is unknown. The presence of rough dog's tail grass and _Drechslera_ spp. during an outbreak of ABLD remains suspicious. Consequently, it is hypothesized that _Drechslera_ spp. associated with rough dog's tail grass may be the source of the toxin(s) of interest.
