Since the beginning of 2009, 26 laboratory-confirmed rabies cases have been
reported in Israel, all of them in the north eastern region, bordering
Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan (map at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2009.html>). They included 15
dogs, 3 cattle, 2 sheep, 2 foxes, and 2 jackals, 1 wolf, and 1 stone
marten. 9 of the cases have occurred in August [2009] alone. This is a
significant increase compared with the same period in previous years.
During the 1st 8 months of 2006, 6 cases were reported (9 during the whole
year), 5 in 2007 (15 during the whole year), and 4 in 2008 (12 during the
whole year).

[The current significant increase in animal rabies incidence in northern
Israel is a further deterioration of a trend observed since 2004,
underlined by the emergence of canine rabies, replacing the sylvatic
rabies, which was reportedly dominant before. Sylvatic rabies is
characterised by cases in wildlife, predominantly foxes, which are the
virus reservoir. This worrying development was discussed earlier this year
in ProMED-mail posting 20090319.1101, which included the following
abstract, derived from the reference cited below:

"Between 1979 and 2000, foxes constituted the main reservoir of rabies in
the Northern regions of Israel. Following the implementation of the
fox-targeted oral vaccination programme (ORV) in 1998, rabies was
eradicated from this area. Subsequently during 2004-2007, the biological
and molecular characterization of the rabies isolates showed that stray
dogs emerged as the main animal reservoir in Northern Israel while lower
numbers of cases were reported in domestic animals. The virus isolates from
foxes and dogs differed, in their molecular characterization, suggesting 2
distinct separate lineages. The transition from fox-mediated rabies to
dog-mediated rabies is of great concern to public health because of the
close contact between dogs and the human population."

The full text of the paper, to which subscribers are referred, includes
additional information on the rabies dynamics in Israel and its Middle
Eastern neighbours, as well as phylogenetic analysis of the Israeli,
Turkish, Jordanian, and South Lebanese rabies virus isolates. Among others,
the paper includes data pertaining to the analysis of the G-L intergenic
region sequences of Turkish rabies isolates, indicating that clade VII of
dog-mediated rabies showed close relationship to the Turkish dog rabies
isolates T4, T6, and T7, which suggested an association between rabies
viruses in Turkey and the newly emerged virus in northern Israel.
