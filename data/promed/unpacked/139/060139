[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.4.12 "Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis" at, http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.12_IBR_IPV.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is a disease of domestic and wild cattle. The virus is distributed world-wide, but has been eradicated from Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy (Province of Bolzano), Switzerland, Norway, and parts of Germany (the 'Oberfranken' and 'Oberpfalz' districts of Bavaria). Control programmes are running in several other countries, for example in Germany and Italy.

The disease is characterised by clinical signs of the upper respiratory tract, such as a (muco) purulent nasal discharge, hyperaemia of the muzzle (red nose disease) and by conjunctivitis. Signs of general illness are fever, depression, inappetence, abortions and reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect the genital tract and cause pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis. Post-mortem examinations reveal rhinitis, laryngitis and tracheitis. Mortality is low, and most infections run a subclinical course. Secondary bacterial infections can lead to more severe respiratory disease, and BoHV-1 could play a role in multifactor diseases such as 'shipping fever'. - Mod.CRD

The main introduction of the "Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis" (IBR/IPV, BHV1) virus into Israel is considered to have taken place during the 1970's, with live cattle imported from North America. Ever since, the virus has been circulating.

Typical tracheal lesions can be seen in the most recent available annual report of Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH), published 2014, covering 2013; see picture on page 186 at, http://www.moag.gov.il/DocLib/doch_shnati_2013.pdf.

According to Israel's 2015 annual report to the OIE, the last clinical case IBR/IPV was recorded in cattle in Sep 2014.

Israel's bovine artificial insemination (AI) centers have been maintaining freedom from BHV1 since decades, confirmed by ongoing surveillance and testing of each batch.

According to the OIE's 2015 data, the bovine population of Israel is 432 000, and of the Palestinian Autonomy 30 041. - Mod.AS
