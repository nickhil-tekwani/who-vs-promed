Giardia cases have risen almost 50 per cent nationwide in the past 3
months, with concerns about an outbreak in the Wellington [capital]
region. National giardia cases rose to 555 in the quarter from
January to March [2010] -- up on 375 cases the previous quarter
[October-December 2009], and 470 in the same quarter [January-March]
in 2009.

There were 8 cases recorded in the Wellington region the week before
last [week of 1 Jun 2010], up on one the week before [week of 24 May
2010]. But Regional Public Health has been quick to dismiss any
suggestion of a serious problem.

The gut-residing parasite, which is found in animals and humans, is
passed through faeces but lives on in environments such as waterways
for a long time. It can cause diarrhoea, stomach cramps and nausea,
among other symptoms. The common symptoms make the parasite hard to
diagnose but any stool sample tested positive for giardia must be
notified to Regional Public Health, medical officer of health Stephen
Palmer said.

Giardia cases fluctuated from week to week, but concerns were usually
raised if there seemed to be a connection between the cases, such as
if they were in the same geographic region. "Even double that amount
may not raise any eyebrows, but then again if I had 8 [cases] linked
to one particular school or early childhood centres then it'd actually
probably be quite a bit [lower]." There were no links "as far as we
can tell at this stage", he said.

Worser Bay Primary School had one case of a pupil having giardia but
had no concerns that the problem was more widespread, board of
trustees chairwoman Katherine Butterfield said.

Wellington City Council was notified of 6 cases in April [2010] and 5
in May. There have been 6 so far this month [June 2010].
Measures to avoid its spread include washing hands thoroughly before
and after food preparation, and boiling water from roofs and waterways
for at least a minute.

[A recent paper on giardia and cryptosporidia infections in New
Zealand (Britton E et al: The impact of climate variability and change
on cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in New Zealand. J Water Hlth 2010;
8: 561-71; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375485>) found a spatial
temporal relationship between giardiasis and rainfall and temperature,
which was modified by the quality of the local water supply. This
suggests that giardiasis may be related to the drinking water and may
not be transmitted directly from person to person. - Mod.EP]
