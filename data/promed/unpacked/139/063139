Progress outlined on Ebola protective suit: much safer and quicker to remove
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAID chief Innovation officer Steven VanRoekel outlined progress on an Ebola protective suit at the CES Government session on Tue 6 Jan 2015, highlighting advances in more effective protective suits for doctors and aid workers. The challenges for field workers, according to VanRoekel, are 2-fold.

1. With the present suits, the hot and humid climate means that doctors and health workers can only spend 30-60 minutes in the suit before getting overheated.

2. Taking off the present suits can be a long and potentially dangerous process, where removing your goggles or hood could lead to Ebola exposure to your eyes or nose.

USAID recently awarded one of the 1st solutions in a grant competition to a team at Johns Hopkins that designed a suit, which takes the process of safely removing the suit from 30 minutes to 30 seconds. It is an example where technology and innovation have been rapidly applicable to solving one of the challenges with Ebola patient handling.

[2] Randomized controlled trials

Is the Ebola Crisis a Reason to Skip RCTs [randomized control trials]?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In a recent "Perspective" article in The New England Journal of Medicine, 3 physicians (Drs. Cox, Borio, and Temple) make a strong case for not letting the rush to save Ebola patients tempt us to deviate from good science and skip the randomized controlled trial (RCT). Their arguments cut to the essence of the scientific approach to medicine, and they deserve careful consideration.

Ebola is the kind of threat that really gets our attention. Few cases have even reached the US and Europe due to infected travelers and health care workers. We face a risk that Ebola may become endemic, smouldering along as a constant presence in Africa.

There is no known effective treatment.

The current approach consists of early identification, isolation, rigorous infection control protocols with space-suit-like personal protective equipment for health care providers, supportive care with intravenous fluids, and conventional treatments for symptoms and complications. The death rate is lower where good medical care is readily available. A number of experimental treatments have been tried or are being considered. Several patients have been given serum transfusions from recovered patients to passively supply them with antibodies to the virus. ZMapp, a combination of monoclonal antibodies, has been used to treat 7 individuals; some of them recovered, some did not. Several anti-viral drugs are under development, and certain selective estrogen receptor molecules and ion channel blockers have also shown promise in vitro. In the face of such a deadly threat, it seems like we can't afford to wait for the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in peer-reviewed journals. Some of these experimental treatments might be unsafe and ineffective, but we know Ebola is definitely unsafe and deadly. The doctors who gave their critically-ill patients serum transfusions or ZMapp did exactly what most of us would have done in the same circumstances. But was it really the best thing to do?

If we give patients ZMapp without a control group and some of them recover, how are we to know whether ZMapp contributed to their recovery? Some have argued that we wouldn't want to deny treatment to a control group, and that we can compare the recovery rate with ZMapp to the historical recovery rate without it. That approach is particularly problematic with Ebola, since the historical recovery rate is so variable and so dependent on differences in supportive treatment and other confounding factors. As Cox, et al. point out, "the historical case fatality rates are irrelevant if current study patients receive better supportive care."

Allowing patients access to investigational drugs, outside of properly designed randomized controlled trials, can have tragic consequences. Using no controls or only historical controls might lead to rejection of treatments that have real but modest benefits, or it might lead to widespread adoption of a treatment that is useless or even harmful. And there are ethical considerations.

RCTs tend to be slow and cumbersome, but there are ways to streamline the process. Advances in trial design can and should be incorporated into Ebola RCTs. For example, such trials should include ongoing monitoring of results (e.g., group-sequential designs), adaptive elements, and other trial efficiencies to reduce the time required to identify an effective treatment, particularly a very effective treatment. If one investigational drug clearly shows benefit, trials should incorporate it into the new standard of care for all treatment groups thereafter. Then a regimen adding a different investigational therapy to the new standard of care could be compared with the new standard of care alone. If multiple investigational drugs are simultaneously available for clinical testing, an RCT could include more than one drug and a shared control group. Trials could be designed to assess effects on survival (recovery from disease) as the most important and measurable end point.

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health [NIH], in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration [FDA], the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority [BARDA], the Department of Defense [DOD], and clinicians caring for patients with EVD [Ebola virus disease] in the United States, are leading efforts to develop and implement such trials.

It has been argued that patients should have ready access to untested and experimental treatments, and that they have the right to try anything they want, especially when their life is at stake and there is no treatment available that has been tested and proven effective. In some cases, trying an untested treatment might very well help the individual patient; but if the treatment is really effective, providing it outside of controlled trials tends only to slow the progress of science and delay the day when that treatment will be proven effective and added to the armamentarium of conventional medicine so that it can benefit all patients. We need to determine whether a treatment works or doesn't work, and there is only one way to do that: using scientific methodology.

Randomized controlled trials are the most reliable way to determine whether any new treatment is safe and effective. It is tempting to bypass them and offer experimental treatments to desperately ill Ebola patients outside of a properly designed RCT. We would be wise to resist that temptation and to insist on enrolling patients in a proper clinical study. ... -- more

6 Jan 2015 New Jersey-Based Johnson & Johnson Begins Testing Ebola Vaccine
http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/01/06/new-jersey-based-johnson-johnson-begins-testing-ebola-vaccine/

New Brunswick, New Jersey [USA]-based Johnson & Johnson has begun testing an Ebola vaccine in humans, intended to counter a strain of the virus similar to the one that has wreaked havoc in West Africa.

The company said Tuesday [7 Jan 2015] that the 1st volunteers have received an initial dose and that, in a partnership Bavarian Nordic AS, more than 400 000 regimens of the prime-boost vaccine have been produced for use in large-scale clinical trials by April 2015.

The early-stage research will focus on the safety and tolerability of a vaccine regimen that includes an initial dose and then a follow-up boost a couple of months later. A total of 72 healthy adults will receive either the vaccine or a fake drug [placebo].

The company said earlier experiments conducted by the National Institutes of Health [NIH] showed that the vaccine regimen protected against the Kikwit Zaire strain of Ebola [related to the Zaire strain].
