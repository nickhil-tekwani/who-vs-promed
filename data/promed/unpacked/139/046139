A male Hawaiian monk seal has died at a Big Island marine mammal hospital after a 5-week battle with toxoplasmosis, which is a parasitic disease spread by cat feces. Toxoplasmosis is the biggest disease threat facing the Hawaiian monk seal, a critically endangered species numbering just 1300 animals.

The seal that died last week [Wed 17 Nov 2021] was known as RW22, the Marine Mammal Center said in a news release. The center called on cat owners to keep their feline pets indoors and dispose of cat litter in the trash to protect the species. Feral cat feces are also a concern. Stray cats have no predators in Hawaii and their numbers have ballooned. Marketing research commissioned by the Hawaiian Humane Society in 2015 estimated Oahu alone had 300 000 feral cats.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration received a report early last month [Oct 2021] that RW22 had a fishing line in his mouth off Oahu. An x-ray revealed the seal had swallowed some fishing gear. It also showed signs of partial facial nerve paralysis and a corneal ulcer to his left eye, a suspected symptom of toxoplasmosis.

[Toxoplasma is a significant cause of mortality in other marine mammals, the threatened southern sea otters. As wild and domestic felids are the only recognized hosts capable of shedding toxoplasma oocysts into the environment, infection of sea mammals suggests land-to-sea pathogen transmission.

The Hawaiian monk seal, _Neomonachus schauinslandi_, is an endangered species of earless seal in the family Phocidae that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Seals nearly disappeared from the main Hawaiian Islands, but the population has begun to recover. The growing population there was approximately 150 as of 2004 and 300 as of 2016.

Toxoplasmosis can become an important obstacle to achieving recovery. Infection by _Toxoplasma gondii_ was first reported in this species in 2004 (J. Parasitol., 91, 2005, pp. 695-697).
