Herders in Mahaday district of southern Somalia's Middle Shabelle region [map at https://tinyurl.com/y8k74bvm] complain that they are losing their goats to an outbreak of disease caused by water-borne parasites.

According to the social welfare representative in the district, Salah Fulel Haji, 430 pastoralist families are being affected by the livestock disease in areas where the water has been contaminated after seasonal flooding of the river Shabelle.

Veterinary experts say the disease killing the goats is Fascioliasis, an infectious disease caused by Fasciola parasites, which are flat worms referred to as liver flukes. The adult liver flukes get into the bile ducts and liver of infected animals, such as sheep and cattle, and can also infect people.

[YH] lives in Aw-baale village. He said only 7 of his 150 goats had survived this latest outbreak of disease. "The disease started to spread at the end of October [2017] and the animals are still dying now - my last goat died on [Mon 25 Dec 2017]," [Y] said.

[DMH] in Dibir village, 25 km [15.53 mi] east of Mahaday town, said he had only 29 left of his original 250 goats. His family of 6 moved to town to stay with relatives, leaving the remaining animals in Dibir under the care of his neighbours. "I was told that 4 more [goats] have become infected with this disease, so I want to sell off the livestock towards the end of this week," [D] told Radio Ergo.

Local people claim that up to 4000 goats have died in the last 3 months of this particular disease. It is extremely difficult to verify such numbers, although experts say that Fascioliasis alone would most likely not cause such high fatalities. The disease normally appears after river flooding, when stagnant flood water becomes contaminated by livestock faeces. Other factors also decrease the immunity of animals during the flooding season, such as the windy cold climate that causes bronchitis and pneumonia.

Security is poor in this area and access for aid organisations is difficult. Moreover, the pastoralists are nomadic, making veterinary follow up more complicated.

Local people complain that they have been ignored by aid agencies and have received no veterinary services recently. Mahaday's social welfare representative said people were constantly asking for assistance.

However, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said it completed a vaccination campaign against Peste des Petits Ruminants and Sheep and Goat Pox (PPR/SGP) last October[2017] across Somalia, in addition to 2 rounds of earlier treatment between March and June 2017.

[Fascioliasis (also Fasciolosis/distomatosis/liver rot) is a trematode parasitic worm infection caused by the common liver fluke _Fasciola hepatica_ as well as by _Fasciola gigantica_. The disease is a plant-borne zoonosis, and is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). Intermediate hosts of _F. hepatica_ are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. _F. hapatica_ is found worldwide in all continents where the relevant ecosystems exist, with a high infection rate among sheep, goats, cattle and other herbivores; it also infects humans. _F. gigantica_ (the giant liver fluke) is a common parasite of herbivorous animals, particularly cattle, in Africa, Asia and Hawaii. Infections in man have been reported sporadically. Its life cycle, pathology and clinical symptomatology are similar to those of _F. hepatica_.

The lifecycle of _F. hepatica_, similar to other trematodes, involves both a final (e.g. cattle, sheep, goat) and an intermediate snail (_Galba truncatula_) host. _F. hepatica_ outbreaks have a seasonal pattern. Infections in livestock can result in significant economic losses, from decreased productivity to mortality. Obviously, environmental hazards and the involvement of other disease agents (eg PPR) will seriously exacerbate the losses caused by the trematode. This may have been the case in Somalia as described above, where PPR [Peste des Petits Ruminants] and SGP [Sheep and Goat Pox] are circulating as well.

In the framework of a recent research by the University of Liverpool, addressing the impact of climate change on the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, _Fasciola hepatica_ was found to be one of the 4 diseases with the largest number of different climate drivers (the others were _Vibrio cholerae_, _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Borrelia burgdorferi_; see 20170803.5225669).
