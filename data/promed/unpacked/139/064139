Summary
------
The description of a so-called cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 has prompted consideration of anti-cytokine therapies, particularly interleukin-6 antagonists. However, direct systematic comparisons of COVID-19 with other critical illnesses associated with elevated cytokine concentrations have not been reported. In this Rapid Review, we report the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 studies published or posted as preprints between 1 Nov 2019 and 14 Apr 2020, in which interleukin-6 concentrations in patients with severe or critical disease were recorded. Twenty-five COVID-19 studies (n = 1245 patients) were ultimately included. Comparator groups included 4 trials each in sepsis (n = 5320), cytokine release syndrome (n = 72), and acute respiratory distress syndrome unrelated to COVID-19 (n = 2767). In patients with severe or critical COVID-19, the pooled mean serum interleukin-6 concentration was 36.7 pg/mL (95% CI, 21.6-62.3 pg/mL; I squared = 57.7%). Mean interleukin-6 concentrations were nearly 100 times higher in patients with cytokine release syndrome (3110.5 pg/mL, 632.3-15 302.9 pg/mL; p less than 0.0001), 27 times higher in patients with sepsis (983.6 pg/mL, 550.1-1758.4 pg/mL; p less than 0.0001), and 12 times higher in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome unrelated to COVID-19 (460 pg/mL, 216.3-978.7 pg/mL; p less than 0.0001). Our findings question the role of a cytokine storm in COVID-19-induced organ dysfunction. Many questions remain about the immune features of COVID-19 and the potential role of anti-cytokine and immune-modulating treatments in patients with the disease.

Key messages
- Inflammatory cytokine elevations in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, including elevations of interleukin-6, are profoundly lower than those reported in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unrelated to COVID-19, sepsis, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome.
- In contrast, several non-cytokine biomarkers, including D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and ferritin, are elevated to a similar or greater extent in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with these comparison disorders.
- As in other syndromes of critical illness, the role of inflammatory cytokine elevations in the pathobiology of COVID-19 remains unclear.
- The systemic inflammatory profile of COVID-19 is distinct from that of non-COVID-19 ARDS, sepsis, and CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome; applying the descriptor cytokine storm to COVID-19 might be particularly problematic.
- Alternative models of organ dysfunction in COVID-19, such as endovasculitis, direct viral injury and lymphodepletion, or viral-induced immunosuppression, might be worth considering.

[I guess labeling cytokine storm as the ultimate culprit for the progression toward and exacerbation of severe disease would be tantamount to "oversimplifying" and/or "complicating" things...more questions than answers at this point.

The above publication reviewed 25 studies with approximately 1250 patients compared with non-COVID-19 trial data. Apart from statistical comparisons for interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and other inflammatory and host response markers, the authors conclude:

"Our results suggest that the descriptor cytokine storm does not appropriately describe the milieu in COVID-19-induced organ dysfunction. Autopsy reports consistently note widespread dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 throughout diverse tissues. Lymphopenia is common, as we report here, and prognostic, as others have reported. T lymphocytes are directly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are depleted in clinical COVID-19.

"In this context, it is worth considering that the less pronounced cytokine elevations in COVID-19 could reflect a regulated, or even inadequate, inflammatory response to overwhelming viral infection. A predominantly hypoimmune state with subsequent (directly) virus-mediated tissue damage and dysregulated inflammation is consistent with both the apparent clinical and pathological abnormalities in COVID-19....

"Importantly, although the mortality benefit from dexamethasone treatment reported in patients with COVID-19 informs clinical practice, it is difficult to causally attribute this benefit to IL-6 suppression. Of the myriad effects of glucocorticoids relevant to critical illness (e.g., inotropy, vasoconstriction in the more than 60% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who require vasopressor support), perhaps the most relevant is the ability of corticosteroids to suppress the late-onset fibrosis that leads to irreversible lung damage in ARDS.... Notably, the large effect in the RECOVERY trial of dexamethasone was driven entirely by patients who were randomised more than 7 days after symptom onset," and finally...

"The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis raise concerns about the widespread off-label use of cytokine blockade in the treatment of COVID-19 before the results of randomised trials are available. Cytokine blockade has not been effective in patients with sepsis and ARDS, in whom inflammatory cytokine concentrations are far more elevated. IL-6 elevation might have a role in endothelial activation and precipitation of a pulmonary immune-mediated thrombosis, so ongoing trials might ultimately show that anti-cytokine treatment is beneficial in some patients with COVID-19. However, unencumbered use of these agents in the absence of randomised evidence seems premature."

Clearly, more exploration is needed. - Mod.UBA]

[2] COVID-19 and all-cause mortality comparison: USA and 18 countries

Citation: Bilinski A, Emanuel EJ. COVID-19 and excess all-cause mortality in the US and 18 comparison countries. JAMA. Epub 12 Oct 2020. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771841

Excerpts
--------
"If the US death rates were comparable to Australia, the US would have had 187 661 fewer COVID-19 deaths (94% of reported deaths), and if comparable with Canada, 117 622 fewer deaths (59%)."

"While the US had a lower COVID-19 mortality rate than high-mortality countries during the early spring, after 10 May [2020], all 6 high-mortality countries had fewer deaths per 100 000 than the US. For instance, between 10 May and 19 Sep 2020, Italy's death rate was 9.1/100 000 while the US's rate was 36.9/100 000. If the US had comparable death rates with most high-mortality countries beginning 10 May, it would have had 44 210 to 104 177 fewer deaths (22%-52%)."

"Compared with other countries, the US experienced high COVID-19-associated mortality and excess all-cause mortality into September 2020. After the 1st peak in early spring, US death rates from COVID-19 and from all causes remained higher than even countries with high COVID-19 mortality. This may have been a result of several factors, including weak public health infrastructure and a decentralized, inconsistent response to the pandemic."

Summary
-------
The US has experienced more deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than any other country and has one of the highest cumulative per capita death rates (1,2). An unanswered question is to what extent high US mortality was driven by the early surge of cases prior to improvements in prevention and patient management vs a poor longer-term response (3). We compared US COVID-19 deaths and excess all-cause mortality in 2020 (vs 2015-2019) with that of 18 countries with diverse COVID-19 responses.

Methods
-------
We compared the US with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries with populations exceeding 5 million and greater than USD 25 000 per capita gross domestic product. For each country, we calculated the COVID-19 per capita mortality rate and grouped countries by mortality: (a) low (COVID-19 deaths, fewer than 5/100 000), (b) moderate (5-25/100 000), and (c) high (more than 25/100 000) (1). We used Poisson regression for comparisons across countries.

We calculated the difference in COVID-19 deaths between each country and the US through 19 Sep 2020 (week 38) under 3 scenarios: if the US had a comparable per capita COVID-19 mortality rate with each country from the start of the pandemic (13 Feb 2020) or if the US mortality rate became comparable with other countries beginning 10 May or 7 Jun 2020, to allow lag time for policy interventions (3) (see the Supplement [at the source URL] for formulas).

We also considered all-cause mortality per capita for countries with publicly available data through 25 Jul 2020 (week 30). This measure is robust to country-level differences in COVID-19 death coding and captures indirect pandemic effects. We estimated excess all-cause mortality (the difference between mean 2020 deaths and deaths in corresponding weeks of 2015-2019) for each country and the US, compared rates across countries using Poisson regression with country and week fixed effects (Supplement), and estimated the difference in excess all-cause mortality between each country and the US as described above. We used R software (version 4.0.2) for all analyses.

Results
-------
On 19 Sep 2020, the US reported a total of 198 589 COVID-19 deaths (60.3/100 000), higher than countries with low and moderate COVID-19 mortality but comparable with high-mortality countries (Table 1 [see source URL]). For instance, Australia (low mortality) had 3.3 deaths per 100 000 and Canada (moderate mortality) had 24.6 per 100 000. Conversely, Italy had 59.1 COVID-19 deaths per 100 000; Belgium had 86.8 per 100 000. If the US death rates were comparable with Australia, the US would have had 187 661 fewer COVID-19 deaths (94% of reported deaths), and if comparable with Canada, 117 622 fewer deaths (59%).

While the US had a lower COVID-19 mortality rate than high-mortality countries during the early spring, after 10 May 2020, all 6 high-mortality countries had fewer deaths per 100 000 than the US. For instance, between 10 May and 19 Sep 2020, Italy's death rate was 9.1/100 000 while the US's rate was 36.9/100 000. If the US had comparable death rates with most high-mortality countries beginning 10 May 2020, it would have had 44 210 to 104 177 fewer deaths (22%-52%) (Table 1). If the US had comparable death rates beginning 7 Jun 2020, it would have had 28% to 43% fewer reported deaths (as a percentage overall).

In the 14 countries with all-cause mortality data, the patterns found for COVID-19-specific deaths were similar for excess all-cause mortality (Table 2 [see source URL]). In countries with moderate COVID-19 mortality, excess all-cause mortality remained negligible throughout the pandemic. In countries with high COVID-19 mortality, excess all-cause mortality reached as high as 102.1/100 000 in Spain, while in the US it was 71.6/100 000. However, since 10 May and 7 Jun 2020, excess all-cause mortality was higher in the US than in all high-mortality countries (Table 2).

Discussion
----------
Compared with other countries, the US experienced high COVID-19-associated mortality and excess all-cause mortality into September 2020. After the 1st peak in early spring, US death rates from COVID-19 and from all causes remained higher than even countries with high COVID-19 mortality. This may have been a result of several factors, including weak public health infrastructure and a decentralized, inconsistent US response to the pandemic (4,5).

Limitations of this analysis include differences in mortality risk: The US population is younger but has more comorbidities compared with the other countries (6). In addition, since late August [2020] death rates have increased in several countries, and how mortality will compare with the US throughout fall remains unknown.

- The Americas region reported 34.5% of daily case numbers and 48.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 18.4 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Honduras, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Chile.

- The European region reported 39.1% of daily case numbers and 24.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 7.7 million. Countries not reporting cases today (17 Oct 2020) include Kazakhstan and Sweden. France is dominant, followed by the UK, Spain, Russia, Czech Republic, Italy, Poland, Netherlands, Germany, Ukraine, Romania, Switzerland, and Portugal. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Slovakia, Turkey, Israel, Armenia, Austria, Hungary, and Ireland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.1% of daily case numbers and 7.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.7 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, and UAE. Pakistan and Kuwait each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 while Oman, Tunisia, and Sudan did not report the cases in the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.25 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 0.88% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.67 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Japan, Malaysia, Guam, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 18.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 16.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.3 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe and the Americas region is still very active. While India had reduced daily confirmations by over 30% in the past few weeks, the region is still having active transmission.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 17 Oct 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[India and the USA are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, India (62 092) followed by the USA (54 232) have maintained their dominance. A global total of 5477 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (16-17 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (16 countries) include India, USA, France (32 427), Brazil (22 792), Argentina (13 510), UK (16 171), Russia (14 922), Italy (10 925), Belgium (10 192), Poland (9622), Czech Republic (8715), Spain (0), Colombia (7017), Netherlands (8114), Mexico (6751), Ukraine (6410), and Tunisia (5752). A total of 43 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 43 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 were from the Americas region, 7 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region and 5 were from the Southeast Asian region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 6.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.1%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean region and South East Asia region. The USA has increased in 7-day average daily reported cases in the past week compared with the preceding week by 14.1%, reflecting the increased transmission ongoing since the end of the summer. - Mod.UBA]
