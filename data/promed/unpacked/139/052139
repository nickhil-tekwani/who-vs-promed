More than 690 people in the Czech Republic were infected with tickborne encephalitis between January and November this year [2018], which is more or less the same as for the whole of 2017. The figure is also the highest since 2006, according to data published by the National Institute of Public Health on Thursday [20 Dec 2018].

The Czech Republic, along with the Baltic States, has the highest number of tickborne encephalitis cases in Europe. There is no cure for encephalitis, but an increasing number of Czechs get themselves vaccinated against the disease.

[Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus is endemic in the Czech Republic, and cases occur there annually. A 2016 ProMED-mail post indicated that although Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of TBE virus and cases occur there yearly, cases have declined significantly in Austria and remain low in Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, while remaining high in recent years in the Czech Republic [see Tick-borne encephalitis - Czech Republic (02): background 20160210.4009410].

WHO has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious" (https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/tick_encephalitis/en/).

TBE is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ixodes ticks. - Mod.TY
