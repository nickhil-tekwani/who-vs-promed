Buckeye Rot of Tomato Caused by _Phytophthora capsici_ in Michoacan, Mexico.

Nicolas de Hidalgo, Morelia, Michoacan 58240, Mexico; and J. M.

Plant Dis. 87:872, 2003; published on-line as D-2003-0506-01N, 2003.
Accepted for publication 23 Apr 2003.
The state of Michoacan is one of the main fresh pepper (_Capsicum annuum_
L.) and tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ Mill.) producers in Mexico.
During the last 5 years, pepper-producing areas in the state have become
unproductive due to root-rotting pathogens, mainly _Phytophthora capsici_
Leonian. Growers trying to overcome losses have increased tomato production
in areas previously used for pepper production.
Field-grown tomato plants with diseased green tomato fruits were observed
in Tacambaro, Michoacan, during August 2002. Initially, brown-to-black
lesions developed on fruits in contact with soil, followed by infection of
the upper fruits in the raceme. Lesions enlarged and dark zonate "buckeye"
bands were formed in the affected area. Disease fruit turned mushy.
Symptoms observed were similar to those for buckeye rot of tomato (1).
Disease fruit were surface disinfested with 70 percent ethanol, cut into
0.5-cm slices, and incubated in a moist chamber to induce mycelial
colonization. Isolation from mycelial tufts growing through the tomato
slice was performed 3 days later, and mycelia was transferred to PARP
selective medium (corn meal agar (CMA) plus ampicillin, pimaricin,
rifampcin, and pentachloronitrobenzene). _P.capsici_ was consistently
isolated from diseased tomato fruits.
Oomycete identification was based on sporangial and gametangial
characteristics of cultures grown on CMA (1). Sporangia microscopically
observed were spherical, broadly ellipsoid, or obovoid with 1 papilla
(occasionally 2 papillae), and deciduous with a long pedicel.
Chlamydospores were not present (2). The isolates were heterothallic, and
oogonia with amphigynous antheridia were observed in pairings with A1 and
A2 isolates of _P. capsici_. 3 isolates were A1 and 2 isolates were A2.
To confirm pathogenicity, 2 experiments were performed using 20 healthy
unwounded green tomatoes. 1 isolate of each mating type was tested.
Isolates were grown for 5 days on CMA, and fruits were inoculated by
placing _P. capsici_ in contact with the fruit. Inoculated fruits were kept
in a moist chamber at room temperature (17 to 20 deg C). Initial symptoms
in the form of brown-to-black lesions appeared 24 h after inoculation.
1 week after inoculation, symptoms were similar to those observed in
field-grown plants, and _P. capsici_ was recovered from the margins of the
diseased tissue. All inoculated fruits rotted.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of _P. capsici_ causing buckeye
rot on tomato in Michoacan and of the presence of both mating types in the
area.

[In addition to _P. capsici_, 2 other _Phytophthora_ species (_P.
parisitica_ and _P. drechsleri_) have been implicated in causing buckeye
rot. Other crops affected by these species include beans, corn, eggplant,
melons, onions, pepper, potato, pumpkin, rhubarb, squash, and turnip.
Disease development is favored by warm, wet weather. Management of the
disease depends on use of phytosanitary measures, preventing tomato fruits
from contacting soil, crop rotation, and application of chemical
fungicides. Apparently there are no tomato cultivars that are resistant to
_P. capsici_. - Mod.DH]
