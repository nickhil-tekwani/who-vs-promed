In Meix-devant-Virton, a Belgian border town not far from Thonne-La-Long [northeastern France], 10 carcasses of wild boar were found on Thursday [20 Dec 2018] on the Belgian side behind the installed fences in the so-called peripheral zone in front of a container park.

On Monday [17 Dec 2018], another carcass was found not far from Gerouville [northwest of Meix-devant-Virton, 1.5 km [0.93 miles] from the French border]. This carcass was tested and found positive for African swine fever [ASF] virus. On site, we realize that the erected fence will not stop ASF from crossing into France, especially as this area is interspersed with roads of the Walloon automobile network and forest roads in Macadam.

The test results of the 10 wild boar carcasses found in Meix-Devant-Virton are pending, but there is little doubt about the results. The distance between their site in Meix-devant-Virton and the French commune Thonne La-Long is 5.5 km [3.42 miles] as the crow flies. Its further advance into France's territory seems to be just a question of time.

Activities in the forest [in Belgium] are at a standstill. There are many other inherent issues, such as logging and the skidding of wood, which is now prohibited in the forest, with a consequent loss of profit of 400 000 euro [USD 456 000] just for the commune of Meix-Devant-Virton.

[The advance of ASF westwards from Zone II (the infected zone), composed of the Core Zone and Buffer Zone, into the peripheral (surveillance) Zone I (south) should be of serious concern to France. The zoning system of the affected territory in southern Belgium is presented in slide 5 of Belgium's recent (19 Dec 2018) presentation at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_asf_conf-20181219_pres-06.pdf. Subscribers are referred to the explanatory comments in ProMED posting 20181221.6217892.

Meix-Devant-Virton (in Belgium) and, to its southwest, Thonne-La-Long (in France), are presented on the map at https://tinyurl.com/y8a6b6k4.

The measures undertaken by France to prevent the introduction of ASF-infected wild boar from Belgium by fencing and other activities, involving hunters, and to discover the disease as early as possible if/when introduced by passive and active surveillance, were described in the report of a Mission of the EU Veterinary Emergency Team (EUVET) to France (17-19 Oct 2018), presented in Brussels to the PAFF committee on 23 Nov 2018, available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20181123_asf-euvet_fra.pdf. - Mod.AS
