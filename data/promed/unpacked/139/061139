Raccoon tests positive for West Nile Virus
------------------------------------------
New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced this
afternoon that evidence of West Nile virus has been confirmed by the New
York State Department of Health in 16 new mosquito pools, a bird, and a
raccoon in New York City. These findings necessitate new spraying in the
Brookville area of Queens. Other areas from which positive findings were
reported have been sprayed subsequent to the findings, and therefore,
spraying is not scheduled for these areas at this time.
"This is the first report of a raccoon testing positive for West Nile
virus," Dr. Cohen continued, "but this does not pose any additional risk to
humans. West Nile virus can only be transmitted to humans through the bite
of an infected mosquito, and the transmission cycle of the virus continues
to mainly involve birds and mosquitoes. Nonetheless, as is the Department
of Health's general recommendation, people should always avoid contact with
raccoons since they may be carriers of other diseases."
Dr. Cohen said, "Cooler weather does not mean that the mosquito season has
come to an end. While we will see fewer mosquitoes as temperatures drop,
the threat from mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus will not end until we
have 2 to 3 days of a hard frost (temperatures below 32 degrees). In the
meantime, personal protection measures must continue to be adhered to,
including wearing protective clothing, using mosquito repellent containing
DEET, and making sure that window screens fit tightly to keep mosquitoes
from entering people's homes."
