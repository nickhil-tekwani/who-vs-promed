----------------------------------------------------------------------
The spread of artemisinin resistance in _Plasmodium falciparum_ and the subsequent loss of partner antimalarial drugs in the Greater Mekong subregion presents one of the greatest threats to the control and elimination of malaria. Artemisinin resistance is associated with mutations in the PfKelch gene.

Initially multiple independent Kelch mutations were observed (1), but in a recent sinister development, a single dominant artemisinin-resistant P falciparum C580Y mutant lineage has arisen in western Cambodia, outcompeted the other resistant malaria parasites, and subsequently acquired resistance to piperaquine (2).

Cambodia had adopted dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine as 1st-line antimalarial treatment, but has now been forced to switch its 1st line artemisinin combination treatment back to artesunate-mefloquine as a consequence (3).

This dominant multidrug-resistant parasite lineage, identified first in Pailin in western Cambodia and tentatively denoted as PfPailin, then spread to northeastern Thailand and southern Laos (2).

We now find that the PfPailin lineage, with associated piperaquine resistance (evidenced by amplification in the PfPlasmepsin2 gene), has spread to the south of Viet Nam where it is responsible for alarming rates of failure of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine -- the National 1st-line treatment (4).

Microsatellite typing of 86 of 152 P falciparum isolates from the Binh Phuoc locality in 2016 shows the same flanking sequence surrounding the PfKelch C580Y gene as that observed in parasites from the affected areas of the other 3 Greater Mekong subregion countries (2). The evolution and subsequent transnational spread of this single fit multidrug-resistant malaria parasite lineage is of international concern.

We declare no competing interests. This study was supported by Mahidol University, Thailand and the Wellcome Trust. Some of the samples were from the TRAC [Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin] study supported by the UK Department for International Development (DFID).

[The news is alarming -- the spread of the artemisinin-piperaquine resistant _P. falciparum_ clone from Cambodia. The problem of a focus of artemisinin resistance in Cambodia has been known since 2008. The present strategies have not been able to control or constrain the artemisinin and now piperaquine resistant strains.

The danger is that the resistant strains will spread and, as has been seen from the previous experience with resistance to chloroquine, sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) and mefloquine, resistance in Southeast Asia will eventually spread to tropical Africa.

The way forward would be an ambitious plan to eradicate malaria from Southeast Asia using free drugs and active case detection. - Mod.EP
