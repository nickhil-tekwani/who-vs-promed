Glycan Microarray Analysis of the Hemagglutinins from Modern and Pandemic
Influenza Viruses Reveals Different Receptor Specificities
---------------------------------------------------
The following is the Abstract of a paper with the above title from the
current December 2005 online version of the Journal of Molecular Biology.
This paper describes a new technical approach using glycan microarrays to
determine the receptor specificities of a variety of avian and human
influenza viruses, which can be used to estimate the host range and
pathogenic potential of influenza viruses.

Abstract
-------
Influenza A virus specificity for the host is mediated by the viral surface
glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), which binds to receptors containing
glycans with terminal sialic acids. Avian viruses preferentially bind to
a2-3-linked sialic acids on receptors of intestinal epithelial cells,
whereas human viruses are specific for the a2-6 linkage on epithelial cells
of the lungs and upper respiratory tract. To define the receptor
preferences of a number of human and avian H1 and H3 viruses, including the
1918 H1N1 pandemic strains, their hemagglutinins were analyzed using a
recently described glycan array. The array, which contains 200
carbohydrates and glycoproteins, not only revealed clear differentiation of
receptor preferences for a2-3 and/or a2-6 sialic acid linkage, but could
also detect fine differences in HA specificity, such as preferences for
fucosylation, sulfation and sialylation at positions 2 (Gal) and 3 (GlcNAc,
GalNAc) of the terminal trisaccharide. For the two 1918 HA variants, the
South Carolina (SC) HA (with Asp190, Asp225) bound exclusively a2-6
receptors, while the New York (NY) variant, which differed only by one
residue (Gly225), had mixed a2-6/a2-3 specificity, especially for sulfated
oligosaccharides. Only one mutation of the NY variant (Asp190Glu) was
sufficient to revert the HA receptor preference to that of classical avian
strains. Thus, the species barrier, as defined by the receptor specificity
preferences of 1918 human viruses compared to likely avian virus
progenitors, can be circumvented by changes at only 2 positions in the HA
receptor binding site. The glycan array thus provides highly detailed
profiles of influenza receptor specificity that can be used to map the
evolution of new human pathogenic strains, such as the H5N1 avian influenza.
The following are some extracts from the Discussion which amplify these
conclusions.
Discussion
----------
A number of HA receptor binding studies have been reported previously, but
these have primarily employed cell-based assays to probe sialic acid
specificities among different influenza viruses. Such assays involve
enzymatic removal of endogenous sialic acid from red blood cells using
sialidases, followed by resialylation with linkage-specific
sialyltransferases. While such assays approximate the natural binding of a
virus to the host cell receptors, the results are subject to variation
based on the quality of the cell preparations and degree of enzymatic
modification, both of which are difficult to control. Use of whole viruses
also introduces the uncertain effects of the viral neuraminidase on the
binding assays. In other studies, competitive binding of viruses to
synthetic natural analogs was analyzed, but again whole viruses were used
here; we used recombinant HA protein as a probe to circumvent these problems.
The array technology, and the ease with which the chip can be customized
for display of appropriate glycans, enhances the ability to probe
pathogen-specific glycan interactions. In this application, the array could
detect fine differences in HA specificity, allowing systematic
investigation of the residues responsible for receptor specificity. The
array results were surprising in a number of respects. A distinct binding
profile was observed for each HA that could not be obtained by the usual
hemadsorption or hemagglutination assays.
With this powerful glycan microarray technology, it is now possible to map
the fine specificity of emerging influenza viruses and to revisit and
complete the analyses on earlier human, pig and bird isolates. Changes in
receptor specificity can now be quickly monitored and correlated with
mutations in the receptor binding site to aid in prediction of new
pandemics or epidemics. In-depth cellular studies will also now be needed
to ascertain the range, levels and distribution of different carbohydrates
on lung epithelial tissue and human airways, especially since HA
specificities for sialylated sugars can be assessed not only for a2-3 or
a2-6 linkages, but also can now include preferences for GalNAc versus
GlcNAc at position 3 of sialylated sugars as well as for additional
substituents, such as sulfate, fucose and extra sialic acid moieties.

[The mantra that: "Scientists fear it could mutate into a form that could
easily pass from human to human" has been attached uncritically by
journalists and commentators as an obligatory qualifying statement to
virtually all the 139 so-far-recorded human cases of A/H5N1 avian influenza
virus infection in East Asia. Little attempt has been made to define the
nature of the mutations that might determine a change in host range and
pathogenicity of avian A/H5N1 influenza virus. The approach and data
described in the paper by Stevens et al. represent a significant step
towards this end and may enable the evolution of a potentially pandemic
human influenza virus to be defined with some degree of precision and to
provide more meaningful epidemic surveillance. - Mod.CP]
