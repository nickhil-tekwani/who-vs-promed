Situation Update No. 7
-----------------------
The Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) reports today [4 Sep
2008] that laboratory analysis of water samples taken from a private
well on the property of the Country Cottage restaurant in Locust
Grove, OK has found no disease-causing bacteria. The restaurant has
been associated with a large _E. coli_ 0111 outbreak in northeastern
Oklahoma.

"The well water is not the source of this outbreak," said State
Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley. "We are continuing our efforts to
conduct microbiological testing of food preparation and serving
surfaces in the restaurant, and we continue to interview cases, as we
try to establish an association with those who became ill and a
potential source."

At least 206 persons are sick as a result of the outbreak, including
149 adults, 53 children, and 4 whose ages have not yet been
confirmed. Cases range in age from 2 months to 88 years. One person
has died.

"This appears to be the largest _E. coli_ 0111 outbreak ever reported
in the USA," Bradley stated. "The complexity of this outbreak and the
necessity to be extremely thorough in our investigation means we
still have more questions than answers."

OSDH disease investigators, along with staff from the Tulsa Health
Department and area local county health departments have interviewed
more than 500 persons in an effort to identify the source of the
outbreak. The restaurant is closed while the investigation continues.
Not all persons who ate at the restaurant have become ill. No other
restaurant or food service outlet in the area has been linked to the
outbreak.

Situation Update No. 8
----------------------
While the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) continues its
investigation into the source of an _E. coli_ 0111 outbreak in
northeastern Oklahoma, many of the persons who were hospitalized as a
result of the outbreak have recovered and are being released from
area hospitals. State health officials believe the total number of
persons hospitalized at the peak of the outbreak exceeded 50; about
27 are currently hospitalized.

The OSDH investigation continues to focus on the Country Cottage
restaurant in Locust Grove, OK. Most of those who became ill reported
eating at the restaurant from 15 Aug 2008 through 23 Aug 2008. OSDH
officials are sampling and testing food preparation and serving
surfaces in the restaurant for any _E. coli_ 0111 contamination. They
also continue to interview persons who may have eaten at the
restaurant during that period. The restaurant is closed while the
investigation continues.

Situation Update No. 9
----------------------
While the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) continues its
investigation into the source of an _E. coli_ 0111 outbreak in
northeastern Oklahoma, health officials stress that persons should
not be fearful of eating, visiting and otherwise doing business or
participating in recreational activities in the community of Locust
Grove, site of the Country Cottage restaurant, the focus of the
investigation. No other restaurant or food service outlet in the area
has been linked to the outbreak, and public health officials stress
they do not believe a source for additional illness related to the
outbreak exists in the community.

Nearly 600 persons have now been interviewed as part of the outbreak
investigation, and the OSDH says an additional 200 interviews are
pending, many added in the last couple of days as more persons were
identified as meal companions of those previously interviewed.

In addition, the OSDH public health laboratory continues to analyze
new patient laboratory specimens as well as environmental samples
taken from the restaurant's food preparation and serving surfaces.
"This analysis is a time-consuming and multi-step process as we work
to identify suspicious disease-causing bacteria and allow them time
to grow to a point where we can identify if they are indeed our
culprit _E. coli_ 0111," said State Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley.

"Our challenge has been to try and find answers as quickly as
possible while conducting a thorough and scientific investigation,"
Bradley said. "We believe that we are in the final phase as we
recheck data, conduct call-back interviews, and review and compare
laboratory reports to the investigation database."
