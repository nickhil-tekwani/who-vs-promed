The National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) has updated the Bat Submission Guidelines for the 2013/2014 WNS [white nose syndrome] surveillance season. These guidelines, available on the NWHC WNS web page at http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/white-nose_syndrome/USGS_NWHC_Bat_WNS_submission_protocol.pdf, replace all previous NWHC bat submission criteria.

Included are reference charts to assist submitters with selecting priority species and appropriate samples for diagnostic submission based on location (a map that designates WNS Management Areas as either within the endemic area, the intermediate area, or the at-risk area is included on page 10).

These guidelines support the WNS National Plan surveillance objectives for identifying new geographic locations and bat species impacted by WNS and its causative agent, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ (formerly _Geomyces destructans_).

New this year [2014], NWHC is providing limited numbers of swab sampling kits to select states within the intermediate WNS Management Area to assist with early detection of _P. destructans_. NWHC is hoping to extend this non-lethal sampling option into other WNS Management Areas in the future (contact Anne Ballmann at <aballmann@usgs.gov> for more information).

To confirm WNS in new areas or bat species, please collect and submit samples for histopathological evaluation. For best diagnostic interpretation, whole carcasses are preferable to wing biopsies. For more details, please refer to the submission guidelines.

Please note that disturbance at bat hibernation sites can result in unintended mortality in otherwise healthy bat populations. NWHC advises delaying entry into caves for surveys until mid-winter, as fungal infections of hibernating bats generally become more visible as the season progresses. Alternatively, hibernacula in areas where presence of WNS is unknown can be monitored at entrances for signs of increased bat activity.

WNS detected in Jackson County, Missouri
----------------------------------------
In December [2013], WNS was confirmed in a tri-colored [or eastern pipistrelle] bat (_Perimyotis subflavus_) from Jackson County, Missouri, which borders Kansas. This detection represents the western-most location of WNS in North America and is also the 1st detection of WNS during winter 2013/2014. The nearest confirmed cases of WNS from the previous winter are located in east-central Missouri.

Recent publication of interest:
Blehert DS, Maluping RP, Green DE, et al. Acute pasteurellosis in wild big brown bats (_Eptesicus fuscus_). J Wildl Dis. 2014 Jan; 50(1): 136-9. doi: 10.7589/2012-02-063.

This study, which stemmed from enhanced diagnostic investigations of bat mortality following emergence of WNS, describes a unique outbreak of acute fatal pasteurellosis in wild big brown bats.

An updated list of WNS-related publications from the USGS is available at http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/white-nose_syndrome/wns_publications_list.jsp.
