86 people, including more than 20 children, in 2 townships have
contracted hepatitis C virus (HCV) in a suspected case of
hospital-caused mass infection, government investigations have
confirmed. Authorities are looking into the possibility that the
source is a family-run clinic in Maqiao township, Yongcheng city,
Henan province.

Of those proven infected, 63 were from Maqiao township and the rest
from Dancheng township, Guoyang county in Anhui province, said Deng
Haihua, a Ministry of Health spokesman at a regular news conference on
Tuesday [13 Dec 2011]. "None of them were showing any symptoms, but
they have received proper treatment. Further investigation, mainly by
health authorities in the 2 provinces, are ongoing, and the final
results will be made public when they are ready," he said.

Jia Jidong, who leads the Beijing Friendship Hospital's liver-research
center, told China Daily that the actual number of cases might be
larger than the reported ones because 30 to 50 percent of those
infected could clear their systems of the virus within 6 months and
would test positive only for HCV antibodies. According to Jia, those
whose RNA test results come back negative could still test positive
for the antibody after clearing their systems of the virus.

When the scandal 1st broke out, many, including Anhui health
authorities, suspected that the family-run clinic in Maqiao township,
about 8 km from the border between the 2 provinces involved, may have
been reusing infected needles. But an initial probe in Maqiao found no
contaminated needles at the clinic, said a statement issued online by
the local government on Sunday [11 Dec 2011]. However, Wu Zunyou,
director of the National Centre for AIDS and Sexually Transmitted
Diseases Control and Prevention, has indicated that the needles might
have been discarded or sterilized [correctly] before the
investigation. The statement said the investigation at the clinic
continues, and the local health authority would increase supervision
of hygiene and disinfection, particularly at grassroots village
clinics. "Subsequent analysis conducted among confirmed hepatitis C
patients would help identify similarities, such as clinics they may
have all frequented before contracting the virus, and that would be
significant for the investigation," Wu said.

The probe at Maqiao found that most of those confirmed to have been
infected were aged 45 and older, said a statement issued by the city
of Yongcheng. "For them, it is also possible that they were infected
in the botched plasma-selling scheme in the mid 1990s," Wu said. But
the HCV incidence rate at Maqiao township, the probe found, stands at
1.22 percent, far higher than the national average of 0.43 percent. At
the village of Shenlou in the township, the incidence rate reached 4.6
percent. "Based on the surprisingly high incidence rate, we can tell
that something must be going wrong there," Wu noted.

Li Jian, deputy director of the health bureau of Guoyang county, Anhui
province, however, was cautious in discussing the latest findings of
their probe. Unlike Yongcheng in Henan, Li's bureau had not released
detailed investigation results by Tuesday [13 Dec 2011]. "We are still
working on it, and, so far, it's too early to say the clinic in Maqiao
is the culprit," he told China Daily on Tuesday. But he disclosed that
most of the 23 people confirmed infected in Dancheng were children,
and local people had no contact with the plasma-selling scheme in the
mid 1990s. "Moreover, we've found that many of the infected children
often went to the Maqiao clinic for treatment," he said.

HCV infections related to medical procedures are not rare on the
mainland. In late August [2011], 6 officials in central Henan province
were removed from their posts after a medical incident in which 8
people contracted HCV. Eight uremia patients got infected during blood
dialysis at the Xin'an County People's Hospital in Henan province.

Lei Zhenglong, deputy director of the ministry's disease prevention
and control bureau, said hepatitis C transmission through medical
practices like blood transfusions, dialysis, and organ transplants are
a concern, and the Ministry would regularly conduct field inspections
at health institutions across the country. But he also conceded that
clinics in rural areas are hard to manage and can hold a greater risk
of infecting patients.

Currently, of the estimated 6 million hepatitis C patients on the
mainland, "a majority acquired their infections before health
authorities required mandatory hepatitis C virus screenings in blood
transfusions in 1993," said Jia Jidong. "Most of the patients I
received at my hospital got infected in the early 1990s, and we've not
seen a lot of new infections in recent years," he said. But
susceptible groups, including AIDS patients and intravenous drug
users, are hit harder, he added.

60-90 percent of China's reported AIDS patients are also infected with
hepatitis C virus.

[The origin of the hepatitis C outbreak in the border region of Anhui
and Henan provinces remains unresolved, with suspicion shifting back
to the village clinic in Maqiao township, Yongcheng city, Henan
province, but without conclusive evidence of medical malpractice. The
large number of children (more than 20 of 86 confirmed cases) who have
contracted hepatitis C in the 2 towns at the centre of the outbreak
indicates that the exposure to infection is recent and not a
consequence of events in the past. The situation is becoming more
confused, and clarification is awaited.
