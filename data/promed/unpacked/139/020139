Illegal Sheep Movements
-----------------------------
Trading standards officers have investigated 309 suspected cases of illegal
sheep movements since the outbreak of foot and-mouth disease (FMD). A
report prepared last week for the prime minister suggests the scale of the
illicit movements may have contributed to the spread of the disease. The
agriculture minister, Nick Brown, says the illegal movements could have led
to FMD being transmitted to areas previously free of the disease.
