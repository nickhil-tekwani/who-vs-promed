A disease containment zone that carries tighter rules on deer hunting is expanding to Kent county and a broader part of neighboring Montcalm county as chronic wasting disease [CWD] has been confirmed in a new part of the state.

"It's a brand new location that leaves us with more questions than answers," said Chad Stewart, deer specialist for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources [DNR]. "We don't know if it's indicative of a spread."

Tests from a federal lab in Iowa have confirmed this week [week of 2 Oct 2017] that a young female deer from a township just across the Kent county border is the state's 10th case of chronic wasting disease since officials began monitoring in 2015.

The 3-year-old, free-ranging, female deer was killed during the September youth deer hunting season in Montcalm Township -- and is the 1st case of the disease in Montcalm county.

Previously, 9 of the 14 000 deer the DNR has tested for CWD since 2015 have been found positive for the disease from Clinton and Ingham counties near Lansing. The disease was 1st found in Michigan in 2008 in a deer from a Kent county farm.

According to the Department of Natural Resources, the 3.5-year old animal taken in Montcalm county is likely to be the 10th free-ranging deer in the state found to have the CWD, a fatal neurological disease that affects white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose.

As a result, the DNR will be adding several new restrictions this fall [2017] to confront the deadly, incurable disease in deer.

Starting 2 Jan 2018, feeding and baiting deer in all of Kent and Montcalm counties will be banned. The DNR is encouraging hunters to stop the practice immediately.

The DNR will be expanding its disease containment zone from southern Mecosta county and northwestern Montcalm county into nine townships in northeastern Kent county and most of central Montcalm county.

In Douglass, Eureka, Fairplain, Maple Valley, Montcalm, Pine, and Sidney townships in Montcalm county, and Oakfield and Spencer townships in Kent county, the following rules are now in place:
- mandatory deer registration at check stations within 5 mi [8 km] of the townships within 72 hours of harvest beginning [15 Nov 2017]. These include Flat River State Game Area and Howard City;
- mandatory submission of deer head for testing of a road-killed deer within 72 hours of pickup;
- removes antler point restrictions for the restricted tag of the combo deer license in the 9 townships;
- antlerless deer can be tagged using the deer or deer combo licenses during firearm, muzzleloader, and late antlerless seasons.
- allows disease control permits for landowners of 5 or more acres [2 or more ha] within the 9 township area.
-
As of 1 Nov 2017, there will be new deer check stations near the 9-township area that will accept deer for CWD testing.

A complete list of check stations, including locations and hours, as well as weekly CWD updates, are available at http://michigan.gov/cwd.

The new zone is the 3rd in the state after a zone was established this summer [2017] in a 9-township area within Mecosta and Montcalm counties around a game ranch and deer processor near Morley. 2 deer heads there tested positive for the disease -- but because they were taken from a carcass pile, it wasn't immediately known if the deer lived and died at the ranch.

Stewart said that case is still in the hands of law enforcement.

The positive test result in the deer from Montcalm county has researchers investigating whether the deer is related to those at the game ranch or deer from the Lansing area.

Though Ionia county links Clinton and the Kent-Montcalm county area together, no deer from Ionia county have tested positive for the disease, Stewart said.

No evidence yet of CWD in local wild deer.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is urging all hunters -- not just those in the affected areas -- to take their harvested deer to area check stations, especially as archery deer hunting season is underway.

"Because this family decided to bring their deer to a DNR deer check station, state wildlife managers were able to gain important information about chronic wasting disease in mid-Michigan," said Dr Kelly Straka, DNR state wildlife veterinarian, in a statement. "As we move through the archery and firearm seasons, voluntary deer testing will be critical not only within the currently affected areas, but also throughout the south-central Lower Peninsula and the entire state."

Chronic wasting disease is a contagious and deadly neurological disease affecting deer, elk, and moose. It causes a spongy degeneration of the brain, resulting in emaciation, abnormal behavior, loss of bodily functions and, ultimately, the animal's death.

There is no cure for the disease, and some deer can be sick for years without showing symptoms. It is transmitted through saliva and other bodily fluids of infected animals.

There's no definitive proof that CWD can spread to humans, but the US Centers for Disease Control nonetheless advises against consuming infected venison.
