Pets must have tattoo to leave France
--------------------------------------------
By Suzanne Lowry in Toulouse
France is undermining the new "animal passports" system by demanding
British pets are tattooed before they travel.
The edict from the French ministry of agriculture has infuriated British
expatriates hoping to bring their pets home after the long-awaited
relaxation of quarantine laws. Tattoos on dogs and cats leaving France are
required as proof of an anti-rabies vaccination. The ruling covers any
animals having been "resident" in the country for more than a month.
The inscriptions cost about Â£40 and include a code in numbers and letters
on the inside of the animal's ear or thigh, carried out under anaesthetic.
The marks are used to aid identification through a national data base for
rabies vaccinations. However, the inscription is not accepted in Britain
and can wear off over time. The tattoos are in addition to the
identification microchip fitted under the Pets Travel Scheme. Animals
leaving France must still complete the rest of the procedure, which
includes a rabies vaccination and blood test. The veterinary surgeons'
union in France, the Syndicat National Veterinaire (SNVL), has a monopoly
on microchips and is the sole authority issuing the health certificates
needed for animals to travel. It will only grant them to tattooed animals
which have been verified by a centralized base in Lyons.
A spokesman at the center where the microchips are issued defended the
tattoo system. She said: "The tattoo is very good. My dog is tattooed and
is perfectly clear." She added up to 300 microchips and certificates had
been issued since November.
Patrice Swinglehurst, the head of the French branch of the Passports for
Pets campaign, has been swamped by calls from British members based in
France. Many are worried at the prospect of having to tattoo several
animals to take them back to England. She said: "Some owners have up to 8
animals, which makes the additional cost a worry. And some of them are
quite elderly cats that would not survive an anaesthetic."
Certificates obtained before SNVEL was awarded the monopoly and which do
not have a tattoo number will still be recognized by the authorities in
Britain, she said. However, some Britons living in France were slipping
across to Belgium to have microchips fitted and certificates issued there
to avoid the tattoo system.

[The cost for multiple animals or for people who routinely travel as well
as anesthetic risk for elderly animals is inappropriate. As such it would
appear to be totally a scheme for financial gain. Microchipping can be used
for tracking vaccinations which would make tattooing unnecessary. The
British require the microchipping, so the tattooing is obsolete, especially
since they even admit to it wearing off. It is an ineffective tracking
system. - Mod.TG
