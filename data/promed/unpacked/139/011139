Bluetongue in Cyprus
---------------
Information received on 23 April 2004 from Dr Phedias Loucaides, Director
of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Nicosia:
End of previous report period: 12 March 2004 (see Disease Information, 17
[12], 82, dated 19 March 2004).
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_53.HTM#Sec3>

End of this report period: 23 April 2004.
New outbreak: 1, at Larnaca district, in the eastern part of the country.
Description of affected population in the new outbreak: cross breed of
Chios x Awasi.
Total number of animals in the new outbreak:
species/ susceptible/ cases/ deaths/ destroyed/ slaughtered
ovi / 260/ 28/ 0/ 0/ 1*
* euthanised in order to take tissue samples for virus isolation
Diagnosis: this outbreak was detected 12 days after the outbreak which was
found in Ammochostos district. It was not included in the emergency report
because laboratory results were not available at that time. These were
received last week by telephone.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Department of Virology, Centre of
Athens Veterinary Institutions, Greece.
B. Diagnostic tests used: direct immunofluorescence test; serum
neutralisation test; virus isolation test.
C. Causal agent: bluetongue virus serotype 16.
In addition to virus isolation attempts, sera from seroconverted animals
were sent to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del
Molise 'G. Caporale', Teramo, Italy, for antibody detection. With the
exception of one serum that contained antibodies to serotype 4 at a low
level (dilution 1:20), all other sera contained antibodies to serotype 16.
These results are in line with the findings of the Greek laboratory.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown.
B. Mode of spread: arthropods (Culicoides).
C. Other epidemiological details: the new outbreak occurred in Larnaca
district, about 20 km south-west of the first outbreak, which occurred in
Ammochostos district.
Control measures during reporting period:
The affected flock was placed under quarantine and insecticides were used.
Surveillance was intensified and all herds/flocks within a radius of 5 km
were visited for investigation.
In addition, visits are made to all herds/flocks that are included in the
bluetongue epidemiological surveillance programme (see below) and in which
seroconversion is detected.
Results of the epidemiosurveillance programme:
The epidemiosurveillance programme, which started in September 2003, is
going on as scheduled. Sentinel animals in 25 different sites on the island
are bled every month.
From the results obtained so far
<http://www.oie.int/eng/maps/isa17tab.htm>, the following findings are of
major interest:
1. Most herds seroconverted in November, December and January, which means
that infection took place in October, November and December. It was during
November that clinical signs were first observed.
2. The highest number of seroconverted animals was found in November,
December and January, which is in agreement with finding 1.
3. It is of great concern that seroconversion started in October in cattle
and continued steadily until February.
The results obtained will help to understand the epidemiology of bluetongue
in Cyprus.
