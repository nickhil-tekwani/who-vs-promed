[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, (DONs), abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/25-july-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in Democratic Republic of the Congo is ongoing amidst a complex crisis, and we continue to observe sustained local transmission and a high number of cases. Most notably, Beni health zone accounted for over half of all new cases reported in the last 3 weeks, as well as a number of cases and contacts that travelled to other health zones. This is the 2nd wave of the outbreak in Beni health zone, and it is larger in case numbers and longer in duration than the 1st. New healthcare worker and nosocomial infections continue to be reported in Beni and other affected health zones, despite substantial infection prevention and control by multiple agencies during the last wave of the outbreak; a total of 141 (5% of total cases) have been reported to date.

The intensive follow-up of contacts of the confirmed case who arrived in Goma on 14 Jul 2019 (see the 18 Jul 2019 Disease Outbreak News at https://www.who.int/csr/don/18-july-2019-ebola-drc/en/) will continue until the end of the 21-day period. In response to this case, 19 health workers were deployed from other posts to Goma to provide support. Rumours of his contacts travelling to Bukavu, South Kivu, were investigated and ruled out by response teams. No new cases have been reported in Goma to date. There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The 1st pillar of the 4th Strategic Response Plan (SRP4) for the control of the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was shared earlier this week by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with support from an international consortium of partners working on the response. The 1st pillar covers the core public health response to the outbreak. Other pillars of the plan are being finalized and will be progressively released.

In the 21 days from 3 Jul through 23 Jul 2019, 64 health areas within 18 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2). During this period, a total of 242 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Beni (53%, n = 129), Mandima (11%, n = 26), Mabalako (10%, n = 23), and Katwa (7%, n = 17) (Table 1). As of 23 Jul 2019, a total of 2612 EVD cases were reported, including 2518 confirmed and 94 probable cases, of which 1756 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1470) were female, and 29% (744) were children aged less than 18 years. Bunia, Kyondo and Musienene health zones all recently cleared 21 days since their last reported case. However, high risks remain for the virus to be reintroduced to these areas, requiring teams to remain fully resourced and vigilant.

- Wed 24 Jul 2019. Ebola region rocked by more violence as new funds announced
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/ebola-region-rocked-more-violence-new-funds-announced
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Yesterday [23 Jul 2019] the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel group, attacked 2 villages near Beni [North Kivu], killing 12 people who live in the heart of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) ongoing Ebola outbreak.

The terrorists killed 9 in Eringeti and 3 in Oicha, according to Reuters. ADF has not publicly pledged allegiance to the Islamic state (ISIL), but that hasn't stopped ISIL from claiming responsibility for the attacks.

The violence comes as 2 major donors announced added funding of response efforts.

Series of violence
------------------
The attacks are just the latest in a series of violent offensives launched by militant groups in the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The provinces are home to more than 1 million displaced persons and dozens of paramilitary and terrorist groups. Throughout the year-long battle against Ebola, violent attacks have shortly been followed by a spike in cases as the attacks temporarily halt disease surveillance and vaccination efforts.

The violence has also caused international actors, including the United States and Doctors without Borders [MSF], to remove or relocate health workers in the region for security reasons.

Today the United Nations' Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO) said groups like the ADF and the Mai-Mai, have created a "deadly environment" for responders, who have been both threatened and killed, UN News reported.

"I am concerned with the current situation in Ituri province, where spoilers are seeking to play on ethnic tensions to instigate inter-community violence," said Leila Zerrougui, the head of MONUSCO, in remarks made at a security meeting earlier today. Attacks by the ADF "continue to exact an intolerable toll on civilians."

World Bank, USAID increase funding
----------------------------------
Today [24 Jul 2019] the World Bank Group announced an additional USD 300 million to help scale up response efforts in the DRC.

"The communities and health workers on the front line of this outbreak urgently need more support and resources from the international community to prevent this crisis from worsening inside the country and from spreading across borders," said World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva.

According to the World Bank, the money will cover the Ebola-affected health zones in DRC and enable the government, World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, World Food Programme, International Organization for Migration, and other responders to step up the frontline health response.

Also today, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) announced an additional USD 38 million for the outbreak, which includes USD 15 million directed toward the WHO. USAID has given USD 136 million to the outbreak since August 2018.

"The DRC has fought and controlled 9 other outbreaks of Ebola successfully, with the help of the international community; however, this response has a unique set of obstacles because of the ongoing conflict in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces," USAID said in a press release.

"Continuing insecurity and difficulty in earning community trust are major hurdles. A robust, unified response by the Government of the DRC, the United Nations, other neighboring countries, the United States, and the international community in partnership with local communities is critical to stopping the spread of the disease."

Cases top 2600
--------------
According to the latest numbers on the WHO's online Ebola dashboard, there are 15 newly confirmed cases today, raising outbreak totals to 2612.

For the 2nd day in a row, DRC officials have provided no update on the outbreak, including statistics on the number of deaths, health workers infected, or suspected cases. Earlier this week, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the DRC's health minister, resigned following the DRC president's decision to move outbreak response management to a government expert committee.

[2] Preparedness and response
- Thu 25 Jul 2019. Student exam in quarantine
[The Independent, abridged, edited]
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-congo-virus-student-university-exam-family-a9020086.html
[Byline: Krista Larson]

[CMS] had lost his mother, a brother, and a sister to Ebola. Instead of fearing death when he, too, was diagnosed with the disease, the young man had a different worry: How would he complete his college entrance exams?

It had been his mother's greatest hope that [CMS] would go to college. To do so would require passing the secondary school baccalaureate, or "bac".

But the exams are held only once a year in Congo, and the 21-year-old [CMS] was being held in medical isolation, unable to sit in the same room with other test-takers. So the medical staff members caring for him at an Ebola treatment centre run by the Alliance for International Medical Action, or ALIMA, came up with a solution.

They found a school official willing to proctor the exam as [CMS] took it safely behind a window. The papers were passed to [CMS] without touching him.

After finishing, he held his pages up one by one to the window so they could be photographed with a smartphone and then emailed to officials for scoring. Then his work and his pencil were incinerated. For the oral part of the exam, the questions were asked of him through the glass.

On [Sat 20 Jul 2019], [CMS] completed the last of his exams. He is awaiting the results while still in isolation, where he will stay until the virus is gone from his body. He hopes to study political science at the University of Kisangani.

"My mother had told me: 'My son, you must study. If you have your diploma, you will succeed in life. Even if your parents are gone, you still have your life to live,'" he said.

- Wed 24 Jul 2019. Motorcycle taxis
[The Guardian, abridged, edited]
http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/24/are-motorcycle-taxis-making-the-ebola-crisis-worse
[Byline: Finbarr O'Reilly]

The Congolese trading city of Butembo relies on its "taxi-motos" to keep business running, but the taxi unions are resistant to helping government Ebola efforts -- and their bikes could be spreading the disease.

Swarms of motorcycle taxis overloaded with passengers and goods weave their way through traffic in the eastern Congolese city of Butembo. Motorbikes far outnumber 4-wheeled vehicles on the dusty roads of the regional trading hub, especially downtown, where drivers laden with cargo carve their way through crowded street markets.

These "taxi-motos," as they are known, are the lifeblood coursing through Butembo's arteries. With local unions representing around 10 000 taxi-motos, they are also a political force that has at times hampered efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic rampaging through North Kivu and Ituri provinces in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Without the taxi-motos, Butembo grinds to a halt, as it did in May [2019] when an accident involving a taxi-moto and a suspected Ebola response vehicle sparked clashes embroiling taxi-moto drivers, armed militia, and security forces. A total of 9 people were killed in the violence. The Ebola response was suspended for a 4th consecutive day due to general insecurity. The clash was just one of more than 200 attacks and violent incidents involving Ebola responders so far this year [2019], with some involving taxi-moto drivers. The most recent in the string of assaults that have injured or killed dozens of responders was the murder by unknown assailants of 2 Congolese Ebola awareness workers near Butembo. But with outbreak declared an international emergency last week by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the subsequent resignation of the country's health minister, the DRC must urgently address its response to the epidemic.

The attacks are driven by a deep resistance to outside influence in an area with a long history of ethnic killings. Many residents in this opposition stronghold blame ethnic violence on the central government, which blocked Ebola-stricken regions from voting in last year's [2018] presidential elections.

The insular Nande ethnic group dominates the commercial towns of Beni and [Butembo] at the centre of the outbreak. Butembo is one of the few major trading hubs in Congo with no visible presence of Indian or Lebanese businesses.

"Even me, I am Nande from Beni," said one taxi driver. "But if I go to Butembo, they will know I am not from there just by the way I speak and they cannot accept me."

The international Ebola response has brought money and convoys of gleaming 4 x 4 vehicles into this impoverished region, upending the local balance of economic power and exacerbating political rivalries.

Accusations that the response is a deadly money-spinning trick being played at their expense while outsiders -- including Congolese from other parts of the country -- grow rich. Local health workers have complained that Congolese nurses and doctors from other parts of the country are paid USD 150 per month while they can earn as little as USD 20, exacerbating existing resentment.

Many taxi-moto drivers believe the conspiracy theories about Ebola while also being aware that they are dangerously exposed to a virus spread by the kind of close physical contact unavoidable in crowded markets. With few cars in Butembo, most people rely on moto-taxis for transport. And when people fall ill they call moto-taxis to take them to hospital, increasing the risk of transmitting the virus. Taxi drivers transporting the sick have succumbed to Ebola during previous outbreaks, but even if they don't get sick themselves, they facilitate the movement of people carrying the virus.

One preventive measure involves moto-taxi drivers not sharing helmets.

During a recent visit to the hilltop village of Mabuku, about 25 km [about 15.5 mi] north of Butembo, Dr Deby Mukendi, a Congolese epidemiologist working for the WHO, was following up on 7 Ebola cases in the village, including 3 deaths and 170 people who had direct contact with those who died. 5 Congolese army soldiers escorted Mukendi and his 2 colleagues. As they prepared to leave a health clinic, 2 moto-taxis zoomed up the driveway carrying half a dozen youths with AK-47s perched on their hips. The bikes skidded to a halt; the Mai Mai militia fighters dismounted, levelled their weapons, and spread out around the Ebola responders. Mukendi stepped forward and walked toward the one unarmed militia member.

While Mai Mai have been behind many of the attacks on health workers, this group had granted Mukendi access after tense negotiations. He had arrived 2 weeks previously with 12 lightly armed soldiers and 60 heavily armed Mai Mai fighters quickly surrounded them.

"The soldiers were very twitchy," Mukendi said. "They were outnumbered and this is not their terrain. You'll find no state infrastructure out here, not even the Congolese flag. This area is controlled entirely by the local population and the Mai Mai. The members of our team were terrified and wanted to turn back. This is the situation we are facing here. Members of the response are always working under great pressure and strain because of the insecurity."

Mukendi negotiated with the Mai Mai commanders, who eventually allowed his team to work.

"They used to be against the response, but because of the awareness campaign we've been doing, they've accepted us," Mukendi said. "The Mai Mai here believe Ebola is real. They've seen it."

[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/24-07-2019-who-applauds-rwanda-s-ebola-preparedness-efforts

WHO applauds Rwanda's Ebola preparedness efforts
------------------------------------------------
WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today [24 Jul 2019] commended Rwanda on its ongoing Ebola preparedness efforts and confirmed that no cases of Ebola have been reported from the country to date.

"... there have been no cases of Ebola in Rwanda to date, despite high levels of traffic and movement of people between the two countries," said Dr Tedros.

Rwanda has a detailed National Preparedness Plan in place and is training health workers in early detection and response, educating communities about Ebola, vaccinating health workers in high-risk areas, equipping health facilities, and conducting simulation exercises to maintain a high level of readiness.

Screening for Ebola symptoms at points of entry has been ongoing since the beginning of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and has been reinforced since the confirmation of a case in the Congolese city of Goma. Tens of thousands of people cross the border from Goma to the Rwandan city of Gisenyi each day. People crossing the border have their temperatures checked, wash their hands, and listen to Ebola awareness messages.

An Ebola Treatment Centre has been set up in Rwanda and 23 isolation units are being prepared in hospitals in 15 priority districts. Ebola response simulation exercises have been conducted to test Rwanda's preparedness in response to a case, which will include Emergency Operations Centre activation, active surveillance, case management and laboratory testing. About 3000 health workers in high-risk areas have been vaccinated as a preventative measure, including more than 1100 in Gisenyi.

"Rwanda has made a significant investment in Ebola preparedness," said Dr Tedros. "But as long as the outbreak continues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there is a very real risk of spread to neighbouring countries. We urge the international community to continue supporting this critical work."

- Thu 25 Jul 2019. Loss of fear
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/07/25/what-if-no-longer-afraid-ebola/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

What if we're no longer afraid of Ebola? Why isn't this [outbreak] getting more attention?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part of the answer may be the setting, in a part of DRC that has been riven by conflict for more than 2 decades. Few journalists from outside the region have traveled to the outbreak zone to report on the ground. (I am not one of them.) Conflict zones are dangerous -- and expensive -- places to report from.

But there are other ways to cover the outbreak. While it's best to be on the ground, to tell the stories of the people affected and the people trying to help, it's possible to report on an Ebola outbreak from a distance. Along with others, I'm doing that from the USA. Still, the swell of coverage that I would have expected to see from an Ebola outbreak that has lasted this long and killed this many people simply hasn't materialized. #Ebola doesn't ever seem to trend on Twitter anymore.

For a while, my theory was that the West African outbreak of 2014-2016 completely reset expectations of Ebola.

It was the 1st where the disease spread in cities, where the world saw what urban Ebola could do. By the time the epidemic was finally extinguished, more than 28 600 people had been infected and more than 11 300 had died. ... The [DRC] outbreak of only hundreds or even a few thousand cases wasn't such a big deal.

Now I wonder if the West African outbreak taught citizens of the USA and other countries that typically help out in an Ebola outbreak a different lesson. Maybe the idea that eventually took root was that Ebola wasn't the threat to us that we thought it was.

[It may be that] donor fatigue, or the financial straits some countries and most media outlets currently face, or the turning inward that has accompanied the rise of populism can explain why this Ebola outbreak isn't as front burner an issue as it would have been a decade ago, why organizations struggling to stop it are finding fewer donors writing smaller checks.

But in the meantime I am left wondering if we have learned to fear this virus less.

- Fri 26 Jul 2019. Dying at home
[Associated Press (AP), abridged, edited]
https://tinyurl.com/y4dgpufz
[Byline: Krista Larson]

Two-month-old [LH] became an orphan in a day. Her mother succumbed to Ebola on a Saturday morning. By sunset her father was dead, too.

They had been sick for more than a week before health workers finally persuaded them to seek treatment, neighbors said. They believed their illness was the work of people jealous about their newborn daughter, a community organizer said, and sought the guidance of a traditional spiritual healer.

The Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo is ravaging Beni, a sprawling city of some 600 000, in large part because so many of the sick are choosing to stay at home. In doing so, they unknowingly infect caregivers and those who mourn them. "People are waiting until the last minute to bring their family members and when they do it's complicated for us," says Mathieu Kanyama, head of health promotion at the Ebola treatment center in Beni run by the Alliance for International Medical Action, or ALIMA. "Here there are doctors, not magicians."

To try to humanize the care of patients in isolation, ALIMA's Ebola treatment center in Beni places some patients in their own transparent room called a "CUBE," where they can see visitors from their beds. Others share a room with one other patient and a glass window where loved ones can gather.

- Thu 25 Jul 2019. Vaccine
[Los Angeles Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2019-07-25/panic-lurking-why-the-long-awaited-ebola-vaccine-wont-end-the-congo-outbreak
[Byline: Emily Baumgaertner]

When Ebola broke out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a year ago [2018], the global stockpile of a long-anticipated vaccine was 300 000 doses. At the time, that seemed like plenty.

But as the virus spreads from the epicenter and threatens to explode across the region, the supply of Merck's newly developed vaccine -- once expected to function as a silver bullet -- is dwindling, and likely to burn out before the outbreak does.

Officials have gone head-to-head in a bitter clash over the next line of attack. This week the country's health minister stepped down rather than bow to international pressure to also start using another vaccine that is much more experimental.

He had banned its use over doubts about its effectiveness. The president, Felix Tshisekedi, was widely expected to lift the ban by the end of this week. The manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, says it has 1.5 million doses on hand and is ready to start sending them to the region.

Health workers have administered more than 150 000 doses of the vaccine using a technique called ring vaccination, which prioritizes people who have had exposure to an Ebola victim, followed by expanding circles of their other contacts.

Ideally, the technique barricades the virus and snips each strand of the outbreak's expanding web. But in a region marked by mass migration, less than one-third of all confirmed cases have been linked back to known contacts, according to Doctors Without Borders.

Merck, which has 245 000 doses currently available for shipment from temperature-controlled US warehouses, hopes to triple the cumulative supply to about 900 000 doses over the next 18 months. But as the outbreak spreads, some models predict the current stockpile could be depleted by the fall.

Production of the vaccine takes about one year -- which means the region could see a several-month gap before a new vaccine lot is ready.

In response to the shortage, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, or SAGE, recommended in May [2019] that health officials divide each of the remaining doses by at least half in order to immunize more people. Merck officials are displeased with the dose-splitting approach, according to 2 health experts with ties to the company.

Pamela Eisele, a spokeswoman for Merck, said the data showing the vaccine is effective are based on a dose of 1 mL. "However, we fully recognize the public health need and the exceptional circumstances that led to the interim recommendation SAGE has made, and we respect that decision," she said.

In May [2019], WHO also recommended use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. But health officials in the DRC resisted using the vaccine.

Their biggest concern is whether it works. Tests in about 6000 people have shown that it is safe and that it stimulates production of antibodies against the virus. But there are too little data to know its efficacy.

Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the health minister who banned it, was also concerned that the vaccine is administered in 2 doses, more than 6 weeks apart. Keeping track of everybody who has been vaccinated -- let alone persuading them to return for 2nd shots -- is all but impossible in war-torn Congo.

Kalenga also sided with health workers who worry that introducing a 2nd vaccine could undermine public awareness campaigns that are already contending with deep-rooted distrust of authority.

Merck & Co., Inc., dba Merck Sharp & Dohme outside the USA and Canada, is an American multinational pharmaceutical company and not a German pharmaceutical company as mistakenly reported. Merck says it is moving production of the vaccine from the USA to a new plant in Germany that has not yet gained regulatory approval to ramp up manufacturing.
