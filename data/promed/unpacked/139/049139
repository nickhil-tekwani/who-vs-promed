A wild rabbit found in the northeast part of Colorado Springs has died of tularemia infection, also known as rabbit fever, according to El Paso County Public Health.

The rabbit was tested after someone recently found several dead rabbits near a property off Austin Bluffs Parkway and Stetson Hills Boulevard.

So far, there have not been reports of human tularemia infection.

Signs of infection in people include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. Tularemia can be treated with antibiotics. If you have any of these early signs, contact your doctor.

Tularemia most often happens by an infected insect bite, most commonly ticks and deer flies.

El Paso County Public Health is asking residents to keep an eye out on wild animals for your safety as well as your children and pets. If you do spot a dead, wild animal there are steps you should take to dispose of it.

[There have been reports of Tularemia in rabbits in CO a few weeks ago.

Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere.

_Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis_(Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread by contact with infected animals or environmental fomites, by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals, or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB
