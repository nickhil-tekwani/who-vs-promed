Background data on Leishmaniasis in Panama
------------------------------------------
Abstracted from Gideon www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon e-book series[1,2].

Time and Place:
Most cases are reported from western Panama - Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon, Chiriqui and Panama Provinces. Children and new settlers to forest areas are at highest risk.

Incidence of leishmaniasis in Panama - see graph:
http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Leish-Panama.png

Infecting species:
Leishmania mexicana amazonensis and L. braziliensis panamanensis are implicated.
- L. colombiensis is also encountered.
- L. naiffi has been identified in sand flies the region of the Canal Zone.

Reservoirs:
Leishmania braziliensis has been identified in the 2-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) and 3-toed sloth (Bradypus infuscatus).
The 2-toed sloth has also been identified as a reservoir for Leishmania panamensis and L. colombiensis.
Parasites have also been demonstrated in the night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus).
Dogs may also act as natural reservoirs in this country. 3 percent of dogs in forest settlements are infected (1968 to 1973).

Vectors:
The principal local vector for L. panamensis is Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) trapidoi.
- Additional species of anthropophilic sandflies have been implicated, including Lu. (N.) ylephiletor, Lu. (Ps.) panamensis, Lu. ovallesi, Lu.(Ps.) shannoni, and Lu. gomezi.
- The predominant vectors in Gamboa (central Panama) are Lu. (Ps.) panamensis and Lu. gomezi.

Notable outbreaks:
1984 - An outbreak (15 cases) was reported among Puerto Rican National Guard personnel conducting exercises in Panama.
