North Korea announced on the 12th [12 May 2022] that it was infected with the new coronavirus for the 1st time, and General Secretary Kim Jong-un ordered that all cities and counties be blocked.

Under these circumstances, the state-owned Korean Central News Agency reported that General Secretary Kim visited the National Emergency Protection Command on the 12th [12 May 2022] and received a report on the infection situation.

According to the report, "a fever of unknown cause has spread explosively throughout the country since late last month," and more than 350 000 people have had fever symptoms so far. It means that more than 18 000 people have been confirmed to have a fever.

On top of that, more than 187 800 people have been quarantined or treated so far, and 6 people, including one infected with the mutant virus, have died.

A spokesman for the NSC (National Security Council) of the White House in the United States told NHK on the 12th [12 May 2022] that North Korea revealed for the 1st time that a person infected with the new coronavirus was confirmed in the country. On the other hand, he revealed that he has no plans to provide a vaccine to North Korea at this time.

In it, a spokesman pointed out that North Korea has repeatedly refused to [accept] vaccines from the COVAX Facility, an international framework aimed at fair distribution of vaccines.

"The United States has no plans to provide vaccines to North Korea at this time but will continue to support international efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable North Koreans."

North Korea isn't known to have launched any COVID-19 vaccination campaigns and hasn't accepted its allocated COVAX shipments from the WHO and its partners" (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/05/south-africas-covid-19-spike-intensifies). - Mod.LK]

The true scale of the coronavirus outbreak in North Korea is still unclear, as North Korea -- which lacks COVID-19 diagnostic kits and other medical equipment -- said it hasn't found why the fever has happened. But some experts say the outbreak can cause major consequences because North Korea's health-care infrastructure remains broken, and many of the North's unvaccinated population are malnourished.

The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Friday [13 May 2022] that more than 350 000 people have been treated for fever that "explosively" spread nationwide since late April [2022] and that 162 200 of them were recovered. It said that 18 000 people were newly found with fever symptoms on Thursday [12 May 2022] alone.

As daily COVID-19 cases in South Africa topped 10 000 cases [yesterday, Wed 11 May 2022], officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [12 May 2022] that an uptick there and in a few other African countries is an early warning sign for other nations to step up their preparedness.

At a briefing, WHO officials said Africa's cases have risen for a 3rd straight week, with 87% of the cases from Southern Africa. Also, neighboring Eswatini and Namibia have reported case rises of 50% over the past 2 weeks, compared to the previous 2 weeks.

In South Africa, the hot spot, cases have quadrupled over the past 3 weeks. Hospitalizations are still low, but in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, hospitalizations and deaths have jumped 90-100% in the past 2 weeks.

Abdou Salam Gueye, MD, MPH, the regional office's emergency preparedness director, said, "This uptick in cases is an early warning sign which we are closely monitoring. Now is the time for countries to step up preparedness and ensure that they can mount an effective response in the event of a fresh pandemic wave."

Officials warned that Africa's last 4 waves occurred around the middle and end of the year [2021], coinciding with winter seasons and high population movements over the holidays.

Gueye said major pushes are needed to ensure that everyone completes their primary vaccine series and that people in high-risk groups get their booster doses.

Since April [2022], South Africa has detected mostly the BA.2 omicron subvariant, but also rising numbers of more transmissible BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, which officials said is concerning, due to concerns about potential immune escape. Alongside the subvariants, relaxed social measures are also fueling the surge.

On [Wed 11 May 2022] the country reported more than 10 000 daily cases for the 1st time since early January [2022], with test positivity remaining high at 25.3%.

Other global developments.
------------------
- The WHO's technology access group and the United Nations-based Medicines Patent Pool today [12 May 2022] announced they have finalized a licensing agreement with the US National Institutes of Health [NIH] for the development of several new treatments, early-state vaccines, and tests for COVID-19. Two licenses cover 11 technologies, including the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in current vaccines. The agreements are part of a plan to allow manufacturers around the world make pandemic-fighting tools more accessible to low- and middle-income countries [https://www.who.int/news/item/12-05-2022-who-and-mpp-announce-agreement-with-nih-for-covid-19-health-technologies].

- In China, rumors of a lockdown in Beijing -- which officials have denied -- have led to panic buying, according to Reuters. As the country battles ongoing omicron in some of its major cities with its "zero COVID" approach, officials said they will strictly limit travel outside the country for Chinese citizens [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2MY0EJ].

[3] Long term sequelae

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/05/many-long-covid-patients-report-symptoms-2-years-later


A pair of new studies describe the effects of long COVID, with one estimating that half of hospitalized patients have at least one persistent symptom 2 years after infection, and the other revealing a 4-fold higher risk of abnormal blood clotting in survivors struggling with basic physical activity more than 12 weeks after diagnosis.

Researchers at Capital Medical University in Beijing led a team studying the long-term outcomes of 1192 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at a single center in Wuhan, China, from 7 Jan - 29 May 2020, the 1st pandemic wave.

The results were published yesterday [11 May 2022] in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine [see 1st citation below]. The study is the longest-term follow-up of hospitalized COVID-19 survivors yet, the authors said.

Follow-up at 6 and 12 months and 2 years after symptom onset consisted of a 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) test, lab tests, and questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), return to work, and healthcare use. Overall, 94% of participants completed a face-to-face interview at 2 years.

A subgroup of patients underwent lung-function tests and chest imaging at each follow-up visit, and matched, uninfected patients served as controls. Median age at hospital release was 57 years, and 46% were women.

The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with one or more symptoms fell from 777 of 1149 (68%) at 6 months to 650 of 1190 (55%) at 2 years. The most common symptoms were fatigue and muscle weakness (31%) and sleep difficulties (31%).

The share of survivors with a modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale score of at least one (indicating shortness of breath when hurrying on even ground or walking slightly uphill) dropped from 288 of 1104 (26%) at 6 months to 168 of 1191 (14%) at 2 years.

There was continued improvement in HRQoL in nearly all domains, particularly in anxiety and depression, with anxiety symptoms declining from 256 of 1105 (23%) at 6 months to 143 of 1191 (12%) at 2 years.

Among all COVID-19 survivors, the proportion with a lower-than-normal 6MWD fell continuously, and 438 of 494 (89%) had returned to their original work by 2 years. Relative to participants without long COVID, those who still had COVID-19 symptoms at 2 years reported lower HRQoL, worse exercise capacity, more mental health issues, and more healthcare use.

Compared with controls, COVID-19 survivors had more symptoms and pain and discomfort and anxiety and depression at 2 years. A significantly higher share of survivors who received higher-level respiratory support in the hospital had impaired lung diffusion (43 of 55 [65%]) vs 24 of 66 [36%]), lower residual lung volume (62% vs 20%), and total lung capacity (39% to 6%) than controls.

In a Lancet news release [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/952229], senior author Bin Cao, MD, of the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases, said that the results show that some COVID-19 survivors may still need medical attention 2 years or more after infection.

"There is a clear need to provide continued support to a significant proportion of people who've had COVID-19, and to understand how vaccines, emerging treatments, and variants affect long-term health outcomes," he said.

In a 2nd study [see 2nd citation below], published yesterday [11 May 2022] in Blood Advances, a team led by University College London researchers assessed 330 patients seen in a long COVID clinic with an elevated (1.5-fold) Von Willebrand Factor (VWF)(Ag):ADAMSTS13 ratio 3 months after infection, indicating a pro-blood-clotting state, from July 2020 to May 2021.

The ratio was also calculated in 50 healthy volunteer controls. VWF is a blood-clotting protein, while ADAMSTS13 is a protein that splices VWF to prevent it from clogging blood vessels. The study was the 1st to report a link between abnormal blood-clotting tests and lower exercise capacity in long COVID patients, the researchers said.

An elevated VWF(Ag):ADAMSTS13 ratio was 4 times more likely in long COVID patients with impaired exercise capacity, as shown by a 3% or greater decline in blood oxygen concentration or an increase in lactate level of more than 1 from baseline on a 1-minute sit-to-stand test and/or 6-minute walking test. Lactate is a substance made by muscle tissue and red blood cells to try to compensate for low oxygen saturation.

Fifty-six of 276 patients (20%) had reduced exercise capacity, and 31 of those 56 (55%) had a VWF(Ag):ADAMSTS13 ratio at least 1.5 times higher than that of controls.

Factor VIII (FVIII) and VWF(Ag) were higher than normal in 26% and 18% of long COVID patients, respectively, supplying evidence of a pro-blood-clotting state. "These findings suggest possible ongoing microvascular/endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of PCS [post-COVID syndrome] and highlight a potential role for antithrombotic therapy in the management of these patients," the researchers wrote.

In an American Society of Hematology news release [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/952008], lead author Nithya Prasannan of University College London and the National Health Service Department of Haematology, said she hopes the findings will advance the understanding of long COVID's mechanisms and help guide future treatment options. "I encourage people experiencing long COVID to participate in clinical trials when available because the more data we have, the better we can understand this condition," she said.

A recent study [citation above] suggests a connection between severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and deficits in cognitive function that persist 6-10 months after illness onset.

- The cognitive deficits in COVID-19 survivors were of a similar magnitude to the decline in cognitive function that normally occurs in individuals between the ages of 50 to 70 years.

- The gradual recovery, if at all, of these persistent cognitive deficits highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing treatment strategies.

- Mild COVID-19 cases may report lingering cognitive symptoms, but the study authors report that the incidence is higher in severe cases, with 33-76% having cognitive symptoms 3-6 months after hospitalization.
