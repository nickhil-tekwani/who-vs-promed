An outbreak of a stomach bug [has hit] Britons at a Majorca hotel. Tests
have shown 4 tourists in Spain and 8 back in the UK [have been infected by
the waterborne parasite Cryptosporidium].
Symptoms include severe diarrhoea, sickness, stomach cramps, and fever. About
150 tourists at the Hotel Alcudia Pins in Majorca have become unwell. The
source of the illness was likely to be the hotel pool, tests on Saturday
suggested. It was drained and disinfected on Wednesday. Around 150 people
have been taken ill with symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting.
Lesley Casey, on holiday in Majorca , said "About 10 children have been to
hospital. We are still awaiting the results of more tests, which will not
come back now until next week."
Airtours said it would fly anyone from the hotel home early, but Ms Casey
said she understood this only applied to those who had been formally
medically diagnosed. "Guests are being offered GBP 40 compensation for not
being able to use the pool. The hotel was notified 2-1/2 weeks ago that there
were symptoms." She said the bug could prove fatal to very young children
and elderly with weak immune systems. Ms Casey said one family had been told
that all 4 of their children have been diagnosed with the bug.
A spokeswoman for Airtours and sister company Direct Holidays, which has 2178
customers at the hotel, said the pool had a modern filter system. She
said: "As soon as the first case was confirmed in the UK on Wednesday we
acted by draining the pool. We are not transferring existing guests to other
hotels because there could be a health risk. We have said that anyone who
wants to come home can come home, and we have only had 5 bookings."

water. The reservoir can be both animals and humans, and chlorination does
not kill the parasite. - Mod.EP]
