[In the previous posting Moderator JW asked whether there were botulism
outbreaks in 2000.]
There was major mortality associated with type E botulism in Lake Erie in
2000. Presque Isle State Park in Pennsylvania collected 535 birds, which
was about 200 more than they collected in 1999. The birds were collected
primarily in August through November. The Park submitted 13 birds to the
National Wildlife Health Center for necropsies; type E botulism was
confirmed in ring-billed, black-backed, herring, and Bonaparte's gulls.
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation estimated that about
5400 birds, primarily red-breasted mergansers, ring-billed gulls, and common
loons, died along the New York shore in a 2-week period in November. We
received several shipments of specimens, and confirmed type E botulism in
the above 3 species.
The Canadian Wildlife Service (Jeff Robinson) also recorded significant
mortality along their Lake Erie shoreline, with 2 waves, the first
consisting of gulls and shorebirds, the second, late in the fall, of
mergansers and loons. Type E botulism was confirmed in both events.
The information above, as well as additional information on previous
outbreaks and the 2001 situation, are available through the Pennsylvania and
New York Sea Grant Program websites. Eric Obert of PA Sea Grant and Helen
Domske of NY Sea Grant have organized workshops and compiled proceedings and
made those available on the websites. They have also sponsored focused
working group meetings for researchers to explore complementary and
collaborative projects. Eric maintains a list-serve for people involved in
and concerned about the issue.

The situation this year has been quieter in some ways than last year, but
there was a significant mortality event (3000+ dead) in a ring-billed gull
colony, with type E botulism confirmed, in eastern Lake Erie in June and
July 2002, and the more recent events (August - October) involving several
hundred cormorants and ring-billed gulls along the Canadian shore.
As Jeff Robinson noted, mergansers and loons have not yet arrived at the
lake, but should do so soon. In 2001, the loons arrived on 30-31 Oct. By 1
Nov, Jeff had received calls regarding hundreds of sick and dead birds. In
driving about 60 km of shoreline, he saw 4-8 dead loons per km, or several
hundred for that stretch of shore. About a week later, dead loons were
being found on the NY shore. There is considerable concern among wildlife
biologists that these 2 species will suffer significant mortality for the
4th year in a row.
