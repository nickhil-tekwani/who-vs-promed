Florida agriculture officials reported the 11th and 12th equid eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases this year [2021] in the state.

The latest cases are from Bay County and Jefferson County, both counties in the Florida panhandle. Both horses are alive and were undervaccinated.

To date, the following counties have reported EEE cases -- Jefferson (2), Nassau (2), Levy (2), Bay, Jackson, Leon, Madison, Volusia and Lake.

In addition to the positive horses, Florida officials have reported in 109 sentinel chickens from 24 counties. No human infections have been reported this year [2021].

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is spread to horses and humans by infected mosquitoes, including several _Culex_ species and _Culiseta melanura_.

In horses, the virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General signs include central nervous system signs such as: head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 F [39.4 C], ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression, and stupor. Other signs may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, in-coordination, circling, and staggering. All signs may not be exhibited by an infected horse.

The mortality rate in horses from EEE is almost 90%. For more information about EEE please go to the EEE Fact Sheet at https://bit.ly/3hVjvru.

[Clearly, Florida is already having a busy time with eastern equine encephalitis. But sadly, it will not be long before other states are reporting on this.

What is concerning is the number of cases already, and yet none of these sites are encouraging vaccination. Why are equine owners not vaccinating? This disease is often fatal in horses. Horse owners invest time, money, and emotions in these animals and yet they are balking at spending a few dollars to protect their investment. The EEE vaccine is often paired with the western equine encephalitis (WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), and tetanus vaccines. Some of these combination vaccines include flu vaccine as well. So this is a lot of protection.

Yes, these shots generally must be given in a series for 1st-time recipients, generally a set of 2 vaccines about 3 weeks apart. Likewise, for areas such as Florida and along the Atlantic seaboard and Gulf coast a repeat vaccination every 3-4 months is recommended as the EEE protection wanes the fastest.

Practicing good mosquito control and using equine sprays against mosquitoes is also recommended. Eliminating mosquito breeding places is helpful to control mosquitoes. Any place there is standing water is a breeding place for mosquitoes. These standing water places may include the catch pot on potted plants, the inside of a tire, a low marshy place in the yard, a long unused water dish holding water, an uncleaned bird bath, a stagnant water trough, and the list can go on.

The storms in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic seaboard will only increase the mosquito population. Please take action by using vaccines and sprays, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites to protect your pet and your investment.

Also recall, human beings are susceptible to EEE as well. So please use those mosquito sprays and long sleeves. Remember the 4Ds - Dusk, Dawn when mosquitoes are most active, Drain standing water, Dress in long sleeves/pants to prevent bites. The long sleeves/pants may be warmer but if you avoid this disease it is worth it.

Please take action to protect your equine friends and yourself. - Mod.TG
