CJD Death 4 Decades After Growth Hormone Use
-----------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: A 47-year-old Dutch man developed a fatal brain-wasting
ailment [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] nearly 4 decades after receiving
a low dose of human growth hormone (hGH) as a child, the longest
recorded incubation period for the disease, researchers report
(Esther A. Croes et al., Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and
Psychiatry 2002;72:792). Current users of human growth hormone (hGH)
are not at risk, since the hormone has been produced synthetically
since the mid-1980s. In the past, the hormone was derived from the
pituitary glands of cadavers. However, the case does show that the
disease can develop decades after exposure to even a small dose of
hGH.
The man was diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare
brain-wasting ailment that causes dementia and progressive loss of
control over the body. A sporadic form of CJD can occur at random in
the population, and tissue from such patients can pose a risk to
others. In the past, transplants or treatments with cadaver-derived
corneas or brain tissue have been linked to cases of CJD. Human
growth hormone was extracted from human cadavers in the Netherlands
starting in 1963 and the first Dutch patient with CJD related to hGH
died in 1990. The exact source of the hormone used in the 47-year-old
man is unknown, so the authors of the paper cannot prove without a
doubt that the hormone caused his later disease. But, they note,
"coincidentally receiving growth hormone and developing this very
rare disease is unlikely." One of the first in the world to be given
hGH, he received a small amount of hGH at age 9 during a diagnostic
test to measure his growth.
What distinguishes the present case is the long time between exposure
to growth hormone and development of CJD symptoms. According to Croes
and colleagues, most people who developed CJD after hGH use became
ill about 10 years after treatment with the hormone. But in this
case, the patient developed CJD 38 years after being exposed to hGH.
The authors speculate that the extended lag time between exposure to
hGH and development of CJD may be explained by the fact that the
patient received only a small dose of the hormone, not regular hGH
therapy. His case shows that it is possible for even a low dose of
hGH to cause CJD many decades later.

[This case of CJD is unrelated to the new variant form of CJD
(abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail) first
identified in the UK in the 1990s that has been associated with
consumption of meat from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
infected cattle. However, the long incubation period observed in this
case of classical CJD, apparently as a consequence of low initial
dose of infectious material, highlights the continuing uncertainty
with regard to prediction of the future course of the vCJD outbreak
in the UK, where the initial dose of vCJD prion may have varied over
a wide range in different individuals. - Mod.CP]
