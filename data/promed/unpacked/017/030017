[This outbreak has shades of the Newcastle epidemic in the US in
2005. There is a lot of bird interaction going to meets, probably
made worse by dirty holding containers. Such activities can be under
the normal veterinary radar, even in countries where cock fighting is
legal, as it is in Peru. - Mod.MHJ]
