----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am afraid that the information we published in English had a couple
of errors. An updated version has just been published on our website
[http://www.mattilsynet.no/english/animal_disease_control/scrapie].


The corrections relate to the number of flocks infected, but most
important, to the case in a goat herd, which was atypical.

[Dr Bar-Yaacov's submission is much appreciated. According to her
update, the total accumulated number of Norway's sheep flocks with
scrapie, including 2010, is 153 (and not 148). The single case in a
goat (2006) was 'atypical, Nor98' and not 'classic'.

Norway's experience in controlling 'classic' scrapie with impressive
success may be useful for other countries engaged with similar
problems. Having also the longest experience with 'atypical' scrapie
('scrapie Nor98'), Norway's policy in addressing this new disease
entity deserves attention. Subscribers are thus recommended to
download the paper "The Norwegian Scrapie control programme small
ruminants [January 2011]" at the URL above. - Mod.AS]
