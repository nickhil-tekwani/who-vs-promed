Eleven cases of food poisoning have been reported at the college of Ezzahra city in the governorate of Sousse. The students bought chewing gum from the college refreshment bar. The product is suspected of causing this intoxication, assured regional director of health in Sousse Boujemaa Fourati.

Fourati added in a statement to the correspondent of Mosaique FM in Sousse that students aged 13-14 were transferred in the afternoon of Wednesday [20 Feb 2019] to the emergency room of the CHU Farhat Hached. They all had vomiting and abdominal pain.

Blood samples and suspected chewing gum were sent to the laboratory for analysis. An investigation was opened at the college in cooperation with the Ministry of Commerce and the security units. The factory manufacturing the chewing gum has been identified.

[It is unusual for chewing gum to be the source of this situation, but not impossible. However, with vomiting being the only noted clinical signs, the possibilities are numerous. We look forward to a more detailed report of the toxin within the chewing gum. - Mod.TG
