The following Spanish news wire, dated 27 Nov 2006, reported the
confirmation on 15 Nov 2006, by the Central Laboratories of Algete,
of bluetongue virus [BTV] activity in a sentinel herd in El Barco de
Avila on the northern area of the Avila province. The municipality is
150 km northwest of Madrid and was outside of the established
restriction zone, which has been consequently extended.

Cattle have to be vaccinated 30 days prior to any movements outside
the restriction area. Vaccination is not needed for animals traveling
within the restricted area, the press reports adds.

The regional veterinary services of Castilla y Leon said that
previous entomological surveillance records document the absence of
stable populations of the BTV vector _Culicoides imicola_ north of
the Central mountainous region, where the outbreak has been detected.

The vector is very abundant in the neighboring areas of northern
Caceres and in the south of Avila, particularly in Candeleda and
Arenas the San Pedro. Both municipalities were included in the
original restriction zone and suspected as the origin for the current
outbreak, the veterinary services sources said. See map at

[According to a previous posting, the BTV serotype circulating in
central Spain is -- similarly to the one currently circulating in
Portugal -- BTV-4. It seems that this virus has become established in
the Iberian peninsula. Its spread northwards, as seen in Portugal and
Spain this fall [2006], is notable and might become another subject
in the currently discussed plans for EU-funded entomological,
virological and epidemiological BT research.

As noted in a previous posting from Pablo Nart (see 20061027.3078),
maps depicting the distribution of the _Culicoides_ vector in Spain
and Morocco and some graphs dated in the late 1990s representing the
annual dynamics of the vector population in both countries and
showing annual peaks in August and November are available at

-----------------------------------------------
According to the most current weekly update of table 11 (animal
disease situation per country and per disease, distributed 27 Nov
2006), the total number of confirmed bluetongue outbreaks, reported
by European Union member states during the period 1 Jan 2006 to 24
Nov 2006, was 2057 (178 added during the week of 17 to 24 Nov 2006,
compared to 197 added during the week of 10-17 Nov and 207 during the
week of 3-10 Nov 2006).

The following summarized, confirmed 2006 outbreaks are retrieved from
the last (24 Nov 2006) and the 4 previous weekly ADNS reports:

Country / 24 Nov / 17 Nov / 10 Nov / 3 Nov / 27 Oct / last confirmation date
