Kruger Tries Out New Vaccine In Fight Against Bovine TB
-----------------------------------------------------
The Kruger National Park is experimenting with a new vaccine to cure Bovine
Tuberculosis [BTB. BTB was first detected in the park about 12 years ago
and has infected about 50 percent of herds so far, specifically in the
south of the park.
Head of game capture and veterinary services, Dr. Douw Grobler, said the
Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine had been used on a certain herd for
the past year. He warned that it would take a while to see results, however.
"The vaccine was developed in France a long time ago, but no good results
were recorded until recently, in New Zealand," he explained. He said the
park had been collaborating with researchers at Otago University in New
Zealand.
BTB has spread to lions, which fed off infected buffalo.
Concerns are if infected animals escape from the park, they may infect
domestic livestock in neighboring communities.
