As the World Health Organization continues to investigate a mystery illness in South Sudan, the disease has claimed another victim. Up to now, the illness has killed 97 people in Fangak, Jonglei State, in the northern part of South Sudan. On Thursday [23 Dec 2021], Fangak County Commissioner Biel Boutros Biel told ABC News an elderly woman was the latest fatality arising from the unidentified sickness.

In a press release, the South Sudan Ministry of Health revealed that the illness seems to mainly affect the elderly and children under 14. The Ministry of Health also said that the symptoms of the mysterious illness include cough, diarrhea, fever, headaches, joint pain, loss of appetite, body weakness, and chest pain. WHO officials visited the region to investigate the illness, but Biel Boutros Biel told ABC News they had left the area without revealing their findings to local officials.

The Fangak region has recently been heavily affected by extreme flooding, which has raised the burden of local health bodies placed by endemic diseases like malaria and cholera, the South Sudan Ministry of Health said. In November [2021], humanitarian aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF; Doctors Without Borders), had warned that flooding in South Sudan was a "perfect storm for disease outbreaks".

Newsweek previously reported that over 200 000 people had fled their homes as a result of the worst flooding in the region for 60 years. MSF said people affected were at "higher risk of outbreaks and waterborne diseases such as acute watery diarrhea, cholera, and malaria".

[ProMED would still like more information about this significant outbreak. The total number of illnesses is not stated. Previously, malaria was thought to be involved in the outbreak, but this post does not clearly support that. - Mod.LL
