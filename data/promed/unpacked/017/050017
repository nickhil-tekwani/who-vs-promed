The Angolan Outbreak: Some Questions from a Non-filovirologist
-------------------------------------------------
Something has puzzled me about the Marburg virus transmission that is
presently happening in Angola. Many articles contain the statements that
Marburg virus infection is usually transmitted during care of an infectious
person or during death/burial practices, then go on to attribute a comment
to WHO that 3/4 of cases are in children under 5 years old.
It would seem that there must be another common transmission point, unless
the cases under 5 years old are always with a person who is doing the
caring for the sick. Or are young children particularly susceptible for
some other reason? I believe that Marburg virus is too rare for
exposure-induced resistance to be an issue.
I have to admit I'm quite ignorant about Marburg virus, other than having
heard it mentioned as an aside in introductory microbiology courses and
also in a general article about Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Still, I find the
epidemiological situation as described to be interesting for something so
rare. I'm familiar with malaria, and am not surprised to see age-dependent
divisions in endemic areas, but am wondering what could cause this in the
Angolan circumstances.

Is there information available, based on either sequence data from isolates
or epidemiological data, as to whether this outbreak is likely due to a
single point source introduction of the virus followed by person-to-person
spread, or whether this outbreak is likely caused by multiple introductions
of the virus from the natural reservoir (which is currently unknown)?
The 1999-2000 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo was noteworthy
in that evidence indicated multiple introductions into the human population
from a reservoir which was linked to an abandoned mine. All 3 subtypes of
Marburg virus were found to be circulating at the same time (Ravn-like
viruses, Musoke-like viruses, and POPP-like viruses) during the 99-00
outbreak. (Is it known which subtype(s) of Marburg caused the current
outbreak?). These multiple introductions were thought to be a factor in the
unusually high number of cases reported, as past outbreaks identified as
having one point source introduction resulted in a limited number of
human-to-human transmission cycles.
[In the 7th Report of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy,
published by Academic Press as "Virus Taxonomy" in 2000, 6 distinct virus
species are recognized in the "Marburg-like Viruses" genus of the family
_Filoviridae_: namely, strain Musoke (Kenya, 1980); strain Ratayczak, West
Germany 1967); strain Popp (West Germany, 1967); Strain Voege (Yugoslavia,
1967); Ozolin (Zimbabwe (1975); Marburg Ravn (Kenya, 1987); but this
classification is currently under revision. - Mod.CP]
From the initial reports, this outbreak appears to have the potential to
be as large as the 1999-2000 outbreak. If this were due to a single point
source introduction and human-to-human spread, it would be noteworthy, as
previous Marburg virus outbreaks have been limited when one point source
introduction occurred. Whether this is a property of the virus or the
state of health care and socio-economic status in the affected areas would
be an interesting consideration in the study of the current outbreak.

[Michael Hevey has articulated some very relevant questions. It is unlikely
that anyone can answer these questions at this stage in the investigation,
but they should be addressed with some urgency. ProMED-mail will assist in
communicating such information as soon as it becomes available. - Mod.CP]
[Lizz Kopecny asks some very good questions that hopefully will be
addressed in the course of the epidemiologic investigations. The
predominance of cases in those under 5 years old is highly unusual. In the
outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1998 through
2000, the majority of cases were in gold mine workers. A serosurvey of
health care workers showed no transmission, and one conclusion (see ref 1)
was that there was minimal secondary transmission of Marburg virus during
this outbreak. A serosurvey conducted in the Central African Republic
(see ref 2) demonstrated 3.2 percent of the population (137/4295) had
positive antibodies against Marburg virus. Similar studies have not been
done in Angola to date, so information as to whether this is the 1st
appearance of Marburg virus activity in the area is not known as yet.
There was a report in the literature of a cluster of cases in the DRC
outbreak that involved an infant (see ref 3). There were 6 cases, 3 of
which had a mild clinical presentation, and the infant was believed to be
infected during "nurturing" (breast feeding).
In the present outbreak we do not yet know the true age, as there may have
been a significant proportion of mild cases that did not come to the
attention of the health sector in the early reports of the
outbreak. Another explanation is that pre-existing immunity in the older
population from earlier outbreaks would leave the younger people
susceptible. And of course a 3rd explanation is that there is a common
exposure for the younger age group that has been placing it at higher
risk. (Less likely, as the younger age groups tend to stay more within
their family compounds and do not tend to congregate in the pre-school age
group.)
It should be remembered that Angola underwent a prolonged civil war, during
which the basic infrastructure -- such as health care -- was limited, with
limited communications as well. It is possible that Marburg or other
hemorrhagic virus activity in the country did not come to the attention of
the international health sector. Readers are reminded that there were
previous occasional individual case reports of hemorrhagic fever-like
illness (see ProMED-mail references in 2001 and 1995 below).We await
further information on the epidemiology of this current outbreak.
