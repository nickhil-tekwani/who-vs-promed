[1] WHO Global Review
Date: Tue 24 Apr 2012

WHO says that global deaths from measles have fallen by nearly 75 percent in the last 10 years. However, the figures are partly based on computer models and fall far short of an international target which aimed to slash the number of measles deaths by 90 percent by 2010. According to statistics released by the WHO and other bodies, most of the measles deaths occurred as a result of insufficient immunisation coverage in India and Africa.

In the 1st decade of the century, around 9.6 million child deaths were prevented by the rollout of major vaccination programmes around the world. In a study funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and published in The Lancet, researchers said the number of global deaths from measles in 2010 was estimated at 139 300, a fall of around 74 percent compared with 535 300 deaths in 2000. The estimates are based on data from just 65 countries, however. The research team used computer modelling to extrapolate figures from the other 128 countries. WHO measles expert Peter Strebel said the results were still very positive, and the fall in measles deaths that had been achieved had come with significantly accelerated effort. Current worldwide vaccination rates for measles stand at 85 percent, the highest ever recorded, he said.

However, Medecins Sans Frontieres immunisation expert Daniel Berman said that African countries had seen a massive increase in measles in the past 2 years, as governments failed to implement vaccination programmes, or simply ran out of money. Berman said one key challenge of healthcare policy-makers in countries with weak healthcare and political systems was to find ways to make measles campaigns happen at all. He was skeptical that there would much more of an improvement in measles mortality rates from now on.

Columbia University professor Nancy Leys Stepan said eradication campaigns were fraught with difficulty and health bodies should not try to adopt too many at the same time. Such programmes were plagued by a lack of good data, she said, making it more reasonable to stick to deadlines for reducing measles rather than trying to eliminate it. Measles has staged a comeback in Europe in recent years, with the number of cases seen by doctors tripling since 2007 on the back of concerns over the vaccine and a failure to take the disease seriously. In the United States, where routine immunisation programmes have been in place since 1963, cases have also risen, with 222 cases reported nationwide in 2011, mostly via overseas sources. Further efforts are still needed to maintain the decline in measles deaths, Strebel said, adding that experts were wary of setting deadlines for eradication.

Smallpox is, to date, the only human disease to have been completely eradicated. Major global initiatives aimed at eradicating polio and guinea worm have reached a stalemate.

Measles is one of the most infectious diseases on the planet and mostly affects children, who develop a rash, cough and fever. For every 1000 children that get it, one or 2 will die. The disease can also trigger miscarriage or premature birth.

The number of measles outbreaks reported last year [2011] in the United States (17) was more than 4 times the usual number, with 222 people from 31 states contracting the infectious disease. That's according to Anne Schuchat, M.D., director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who said that 2011 posted the largest number of U.S. measles cases reported since 1996, when 508 cases were reported. During a 19 Apr 2012 press briefing, Schuchat said 2 factors played key roles in the higher caseload: disease importation by U.S. citizens returning from travel abroad or by foreign nationals visiting the United States and those individuals' interaction with unimmunized people. In all, 200 cases were linked to such importations, she noted.

"There were 72 actual importations from other countries, and nearly half of them were from the European region," said Schuchat. "Most of us don't think of Europe as a place where you can catch an infectious disease, but, recently, there has been a lot of measles in Europe. It's very important for travelers heading off to Europe to make sure they are up-to-date on their immunizations and to make sure their children are as well," she said.

A compounding factor was that 86 percent of those infected were not vaccinated against measles or did not know whether they were vaccinated. Of the 166 U.S. residents who were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 141 people were eligible to receive the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. 66 of those individuals were between the ages of 16 months and 19 years, said Schuchat, "when they should have already gotten the vaccine and when school requirements or daycare requirements would have been good reminders they were eligible and expected to be vaccinated."

21-28 Apr 2012 is National Infant Immunization Week, said Anne Schuchat, M.D., director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, during a recent press briefing. In recognition of the event, the agency will launch a series of public service announcements to raise awareness of the key role of vaccines in preventing disease. In addition, 2 dozen states and U.S. territories will hold various activities to help educate health professionals, parents and caregivers about the importance of immunizing young children. Some locations actually will be offering free immunizations to participants. State-by-state information is available online. Of those 66 people, 50 (76 percent) reported a philosophical objection or a religious or personal belief exemption to vaccination. The other cases occurred in children who were too young to be vaccinated or in adults who may not have had accurate immunization histories. "Unvaccinated people put themselves and other people at risk for measles and its complications," said Schuchat. "They particularly put at risk people who are too young to be vaccinated, who can sometimes have the worst complications from measles. The continuing story of measles is that we're still having importations and disease this year [2012], with more than 25 cases reported so far in 2012, most of them associated with importation."

Schuchat said the CDC continues to strongly recommend that people of all ages keep up-to-date with all of their vaccinations and specifically recommends that children receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine: the 1st dose at age 12-15 months and the 2nd dose at age 4-6 years. "We really think it's important for parents to know the MMR vaccine is safe and very effective," she said. "Measles can be serious; your child can get it, and your child can spread it to people who can't even get the vaccine because they're too young or have problems like leukemia."

Global health officials are making headway with driving down the number of measles deaths, but there are signs that progress is stalling, a pattern that has kept nations from meeting a global mortality benchmark, researchers reported today [24 Apr 2012].

The new profile of measles deaths, which appeared in The Lancet yesterday [23 Apr 2012], comes as world health partners launch a new strategy to prevent the disease, one that involves pairing the vaccine with immunization against rubella. In 2008, the World Health Assembly set a goal of reducing by 2010 the number of measles deaths by 90 percent of 2000 numbers. However, according to the new Lancet estimate, the number of measles deaths fell 74 percent during that period. The international research team, funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), used a new type of modeling that incorporated surveillance data to estimate the incidence and age distribution of cases, factor in herd immunity, and use robust statistical methods to estimate uncertainty.

Measles deaths declined steadily due to increased vaccine coverage and the delivery of more than a billion doses, but progress stalled starting in 2008 due to large outbreaks in southern Africa that resulted in a small mortality increase for that World Health Organization (WHO) region. In India, delayed implementation of measles vaccination activities have hampered vaccine coverage there, the researchers said. The team found that measles mortality dropped by more than 3/4ths in all WHO regions except for Southeast Asia. India accounted for 47 percent of estimated measles deaths in 2010, and the WHO's African region accounted for 36 percent. Researchers noted that their estimate of measles mortality is lower than earlier estimates, though they lie within a 95 percent confidence interval of the new estimate, they wrote.

In a related editorial, 2 vaccine experts from Emory University, Walter Orenstein, MD, and Alan Hinman, MD, MPH, wrote that although the estimate of deaths from measles in 2000 was substantially lower in the new report, "this estimate still highlights that far too many children are dying from this readily preventable disease." The group's estimate of deaths in 2000 was 27 percent lower than an earlier estimate. Orenstein and Hinman wrote that the group's study highlights crucial gaps in data to guide prevention programs. The study noted that only 65 countries have vital registration data that measure actual deaths, and that the data are inadequate in 128 countries where most measles deaths occur. "As measles is considered for eradication, it will be crucial to improve surveillance to the point that deaths and cases will actually be measured, not estimated," they wrote.

The WHO said that its Measles Initiative, in keeping with global strategy to battle both measles and rubella, is now called the Measles and Rubella Initiative. Margaret Chan, MD, the WHO's director-general, said in the statement that the 75 percent drop in deaths shows how effective well-run vaccination programs can be. "Now we need to take the next logical step and vaccinate children against rubella, too," she said. For measles, the strategy's goal is to cut deaths by 95 percent of 2000 levels by 2015, the WHO said. Goals also include eliminating measles and rubella in at least 5 WHO regions by 2020. Strategies also include high vaccination coverage, monitoring measles spread with lab-based surveillance, outbreak and case management, communication initiatives, and research and development. The 62 countries that aren't vaccinating against rubella are being encouraged to do so within their measles vaccine delivery system. CDC Director Tom Frieden, MD, said in the statement that rubella is the leading cause of congenital malformations in newborns. "This new plan outlines strategies we know work. It is time to partner with key countries to implement the plan in order to save our children from these terrible diseases," he said.

The WHO said starting this year [2012], developing countries can apply to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) for financial support to obtain combined measles-rubella (MR) vaccine. Seth Berkley, MD, chief executive officer of GAVI, said in the statement: "With GAVI's USD 605 million investment for both the combined MR and measles 2nd dose vaccines in developing countries, this is an historic moment for the reduction and hopefully eventual elimination of both diseases."

Kathy Calvin, chief executive officer with the United Nations Foundation, said in the statement that USD 112 million more is needed to achieve measles and rubella goals for 2015. "We need significant commitments from governments and the private sector if we are going to stop measles and rubella, as well as the support of individuals worldwide, because a small donation from the public can go a long way and help save many lives," she said.

Since 1 Jan 2008, over 22 000 cases of measles were reported in France, with a 3rd large-scale epidemic wave compared to the 2 previous waves, and a peak in March 2011.

For 2011, 14 966 cases were reported, of which 16 showed a neurological complication, 714 severe pneumonia, and 6 died. The sharp decrease in the number of cases reported between May and October 2011 signaled the end of this 2rd wave. Since autumn 2011, there was a slight rise in the number of reported cases, approximately the same magnitude as that observed in late 2008-early 2009. However, there has been no increase in the number of cases in March 2012, as was observed in 2010 and especially 2011. Between 1 Jan and 31 Mar 2012, 356 cases were reported (including 17 severe pneumonia cases), with the number of monthly-or-fewer cases stable since December 2011. Although these data do not forecast a significant next epidemic, the updating of the immunization status of susceptible individuals with 2 doses of vaccine, particularly in the population aged 15-30 years, remains critical.

According to the Rospotrebnadzor of the Udmurt Republic, on 23 Apr 2012, a significantly increased number of suspected measles cases was recorded in Izhevsk involving tourists from Thailand. A total of 27 suspected cases of measles were admitted to hospital. Of these, 12 have been confirmed as measles cases by laboratory diagnosis, and the outcome of testing the remaining 15 are awaited. Earlier, it had been reported that as many as 16 local people had contracted measles, all inhabitants of the capital of Udmurtia and of the Zavyalovskogo area. 3/4ths of them were adults aged 19 to 47 years. Five cases were children of preschool age. The number of citizens of the republic exposed to carriers of infection was estimated to be 3200 people, of whom 484 were children.

To contain the spread of infection, the government of the Udmurt Republic purchased 10 000 doses of measles vaccine. Vaccination against measles is free of charge, regardless of age, in local hospitals.

As of 19 Apr 2012, 7997 cases of measles have been recorded in Ukraine according to the press service of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. Last night [22 Apr 2012], the Ministry of Health reported another 95 suspected cases, mostly in: Ivano-Frankivsk region - 26, Transcarpathian region - 16, Ternopil oblast - 15, Lviv region - 9, Rivne region - 5, Volyn region - 3. Last night, another case of measles was reported in Kiev. Enhanced control measures have been implemented in these regions.

The State Sanitary and Epidemiological Service has recommended that foreign persons should be vaccinated against measles before visiting Ukraine during Euro 2012 [Football championship]. "We have recommended and sent information to the embassies of all countries that will be represented in Ukraine to be proactive and disseminate information about the unfavourable measles situation in Ukraine. First Deputy Chairman Alexander Kravchuk also recommended that fans of the home country should ensure they have been vaccinated to provide cross-protection, reducing the probability of further introduction of measles virus infection into Ukraine and spread of infection by visitors returning to their own countries after the end of the tournament. According to the Minister, 93 sanitary and quarantine stations have been established in collaboration with the corresponding Polish authorities, as well as sharing of information concerning fans commuting between the 2 countries during the tournament.

In addition, teams of epidemiologists will be stationed at the stadium used during the tournament. However, the minister expressed his conviction that the Ukrainian epidemic control system would be adequate to respond to all the challenges that might arise during the staging of the tournament.

Seven deaths per 2257 cases have been reported [in Cameroon] since early this year [2012] in the Far North. This revelation was made by Babila Akaou, general secretary of the governor's office of the Far North.

In 2011, the region registered 1627 cases of measles with 17 deaths. For this year [2012], the counter is already up to 2257, and the number of deaths is 7. This epidemic already involves 7 of the 28 health districts in the region.

This information was given on 11 Apr 2012 at the launch in Maroua of the 1st week's issue of shares of health, child and maternal nutrition (SASNIM). This campaign is ongoing until 15 Apr [2012] and addresses many diseases.

Through next Sunday [22 Apr 2012], doses of vaccine against polio will be administered to children aged 5 years and under, and those aged 9 months to 5 years will be vaccinated against measles. Vitamin A capsules will be administered to children 6 months to 5 years, while children from 1-5 years will be dewormed. Women who have just given birth will receive vitamin A drops. All this is free.

The authorities in charge of health have adopted 2 immunization systems: 1st to vaccinate in all health facilities; 2nd to vaccinate in public places such as markets, places of worship, and schools.

Dr. Rebecca Djao, the regional delegate of Public Health of the Far North, has seized this opportunity to educate parents about the dangers of diseases against which children must be vaccinated, namely polio and measles. She also drew attention to the importance of vitamin A and deworming of children. Judging from the jostling of parents, who after following these tips came to vaccinate their children, we can say that the message did not fall on deaf ears.

[Hopefully, these 2 immunization strategies can cover many children quickly, because with 25 percent of districts involved in the epidemic, there is a high risk of it spreading to other districts of the region.

Parents must be educated about the importance of carrying their children to health centers as soon as possible. Traditional healers and religious leaders should also be involved in the fight against the epidemic.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Measles-outbreak-feared-in-Rayagada-9-children-killed/articleshow/12917924.cms


At least 9 children have died in the past 15 days in Rayagada district's Kasipur block, which is feared to be afflicted by an outbreak of measles. The state health department collected blood samples of a few affected children on Saturday [28 Apr 2012] for a laboratory test. Kasipur, which often makes the news for poverty, malnutrition, diarrhoea, and cholera related deaths, has been witnessing a flurry of medical activities recently after the outbreak of measles at Salapash, Katraguda, and Railighati villages under Kudipari panchayat.

"Blood samples have been collected from at least 7 children, and those will be sent to the regional medical research centre in Bhubaneswar for tests to confirm whether the children are affected by measles," said the medical officer of Kasipur hospital, Saroj Kumar Naik, who went to the affected villages along with deputy director of health K K Rout and Rayagada CDMO K V S Chowdhury.

Villagers claim that while as many as 9 children aged between 6 months to 3 years have already succumbed to measles, scores more are affected at the 3 villages, which lie at a distance of about 80 km from the district headquarters town of Rayagada. Locals alleged that due to the inaccessibility of the villages, health officials never come to their villages and healthcare facilities are virtually non-existent in the areas.

"The children succumbed to the disease at the villages without medical attention. In the absence of proper medical facilities, people depend on traditional methods of treatment and are succumbing to diseases," said Narendra Jhodia of Salapash, which lies on the border of Rayagada and Kalahandi districts.

However, officials said only 3 and not 9 children have died of measles. "There have been 9 deaths in 3 villagers in the past 2 weeks but not all from measles. Till now, we suspect 3 deaths to be from measles. Around 12 children are suffering from fever, and a medical team is campaigning at the village," said Naik. "Presently, our 1st priority is to contain the disease. Creating awareness against the disease has been initiated, and re-immunization programmes have been launched at the periphery villages to ensure that the disease does not spread to other areas," he added.

According to the medical officer, while the inaccessibility of the villages is creating an obstacle for the health workers in regularly visiting the areas, people's faith on traditional methods of treatment is also causing problems in arresting the situation. "People agree to follow our advice to combat the disease but never follow it. They organize pujas and depend on sorcery to cure the disease instead of taking medicines. It is a common practice among the tribal community to conduct pujas for 7 days to cure a disease, and if they fail in their attempt, only then will they take the patient to a hospital, by which time it is often too late," the medical officer said.

[Measles vaccine coverage (by a monovalent vaccine at 9 months of age) in India has been good, but measles incidence remains high in parts of India. Measles, even in previously healthy children, can be a serious illness requiring hospitalization. As many as one in 20 children with measles develops pneumonia, and about one child in every 1000 who get measles will develop encephalitis, which may leave a child deaf or even mentally retarded. In developing countries, where malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency are common, mortality from measles virus infection can be considerable. Sub-acute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE), a fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system, can be a very rare consequence of measles infection early in life.

Two patients were recently treated for measles at Providence Tarzana Medical Center, hospital officials said Thursday [26 Apr 2012].

The cases are significant because one patient was an adult and the other a child. "It is believed the source was a traveler from abroad who was visiting the younger patient's family," according to a statement from Providence Tarzana officials. The cases were reported to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. An investigation is ongoing, but it is believed neither patient was vaccinated. "Providence Tarzana is complying with a directive from the department to alert anyone who might have been exposed at the hospital," Providence officials said.

Measles, also called rubeola, is a contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. Those with measles can suffer fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For every 1000 children who get measles, one or 2 will die, according to the CDC. At least one case of measles has been reported each year in L.A. County since 2005, although there was a spike beginning in 2010, when there were 8 cases, said Dr. Nelson El Amin, medical director for the county immunization program. "There was a definite overseas or foreign born linkage," El Amin said. The numbers were almost similar in 2011, he said. "Usually, 2 cases at the same time is rare," El Amin said.
