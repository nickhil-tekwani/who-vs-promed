The toll from Zimbabwe's cholera epidemic rose again Tuesday [23 Dec
2008] with 1174 people now known to have died from the disease since
August 2008, the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF said. "The
disease is still popping up in the country which means it is still
not under control," UNICEF representative in Zimbabwe Roeland Monasch
told a press conference in Geneva by telephone.

Almost 3000 new cases have been diagnosed since the last UN figures
were published 5 days ago, Monasch said, taking the total number of
confirmed infections to 23 712.

[4] Cholera - South Africa (Limpopo)
Date: Mon 22 Dec 2008

The Afrikaans newspaper Beeld has reported over the weekend that
cholera has spread to another 3 rural areas within the Limpopo
province of South Africa. A spokesperson from the Limpopo health
department said that more than 100 people have already been infected
in these areas. Mr Seloba reminded the public that cholera isn't just
a Zimbabwean disease and that it can spread to any area with poor
sanitation facilities. The disease is spread through dirty water.

The Musina hospital in the province has treated close to 900 patients
for the disease, most of them Zimbabweans, since mid-November 2008. A
total of 8 deaths has been reported in South Africa.

The premier of Limpopo, Sello Moloto, declared the Vhembe district in
Limpopo a disaster area. Additional doctors and nursing staff have
already been dispatched to the area to assist with the treatment of
cholera patients. The department of health is distributing water
purification tablets in an attempt to contain the disease.

[5] Cholera - South Africa (Gauteng)

South African authorities reported new cholera deaths in the province
surrounding Johannesburg, indicating that the spread of the disease
from Zimbabwe is becoming more pronounced.

Another person had died of cholera over the weekend, bringing the
province's death count to 3, Chika Asomugha, spokesman for the health
department of Gauteng Province, told the South African Press
Association (SAPA) on Monday [22 Dec 2008].

Gauteng, home to both the city's economic center of Johannesburg and
the national capital of Pretoria, now has 21 positively identified
cases of cholera, with the heaviest concentration in the Johannesburg
district.

Health officials are worried that there could be further outbreaks of
the disease in both Zimbabwe and South Africa over the Christmas
holidays, when Zimbabweans who live in South Africa return home to
visit relatives, perhaps risking infection and the further spread of
the disease.
