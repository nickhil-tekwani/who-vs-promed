A team has been dispatched from Mae Sot Hospital in Tak to investigate a suspected anthrax infection after 3 villagers in Tambon Mahawan developed suspicious symptoms after eating goat meat reportedly brought in from a neighbouring country.

Hospital director Dr Thawatchai Setthasupana said the team was sent to Ban Mae Kone Kane (Moo 9) following news that people had anthrax-like small blisters or bumps on their hands and arms after eating the meat. Tests on the hospitalised patients initially yielded a negative result for anthrax, but this might be because they had received medication at a Tambon-level hospital, he said. It was reported that 30 villagers had consumed the meat in question, but most of them had already taken medication and they could not be successfully tested for anthrax. Instead, the hospital team collected samples from animal carcasses for lab tests with the results expected soon.

Thawatchai urged people to consume only cooked meat and not to eat animals that had died mysteriously. Anyone who developed anthrax-like symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible. While some reports suggested the meat had been brought in from another country, a villager told The Nation that it had come from 5 or 6 dead goats that someone had left in the village. The source said residents had asked to share the meat.

Anthrax is a rare but serious disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ that mainly affects grass-eating livestock. Humans can become infected through direct or indirect contact with sick animals, through an open wound, consumption of the meat or inhaling the spores. Symptoms can range from skin sores to vomiting and shock, depending on how the person is infected. Prompt treatment with antibiotics can cure most anthrax infections.

[To find Tak, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/thailand_admin-2013.jpg where you will find it in the middle of the Thai border with Myanmar.

Thailand has been free of livestock anthrax since 2000. Historically Myanmar has posed a real threat to Thailand from the movement of incubating sick stock being moved over the border into Thailand, putting Thai stock at risk. The previous anthrax outbreaks in Thailand were in 1999 and 2000. In 2000, 17 people were clinically affected in Phichit with cutaneous and gastric anthrax after exposure to infected sheep and goats legally imported from Myanmar at Mae Sot district in Tak province, with meat sold in Nakhon Sawan market. This year it was in Tambon Mahawan.

Prediagnostic antibiotic treatment can make diagnosis in humans difficult as the organism is commonly very sensitive to antibiotics. With any luck the investigative team has been able to sample the goat carcasses. If the village dogs had been scavenging the carcasses there may be a dead dog to sample. Until there is laboratory confirmation, this must be regarded as "suspect." - Mod.MHJ
