Mammoth toxic algae bloom sighted off Washington state coast
------------------------------
A toxic algae bloom 30 miles wide has been detected 15 miles off the
northwest coast of Washington state, the largest and most potentially
lethal yet found by scientists in the region.
Pseudo-nitzschia algae in the Juan de Fuca eddy can release potentially
deadly domoic acid, which accumulates in the tissue of razor clams and
other shellfish and, if ingested by humans, attacks areas in the brain
responsible for learning and memory.
Concentrations of the poisonous algae are as high as 11 million cells per
liter, compared with about 200 000 cells per liter in 2003, scientists said
Tuesday following a 3-week research mission.
"Within the next week, if there's a major storm, it's possible it might hit
the beach," said Barbara Hickey, a University of Washington
oceanographer. On the other hand, fair weather over the next couple of
weeks could reduce the bloom and help keep it from approaching land, Hickey
said.
State officials test coastal waters twice a week for the presence of domoic
acid, and satellites are being used to track the algae bloom and detect any
move toward the coast, scientists said.
"We'll have enough early warning to know for sure that the (shellfish)
resource is safe to dig," said Vera Trainer, a research oceanographer with
the Northwest Fisheries Science Center.
A 2nd project also is tracking algae off the Washington coast from Makah
Bay at the northern tip of the peninsula to Long Beach, near the mouth of
the Columbia River.
Hickey said her team in the $12 million project, ECOHAB Pacific Northwest,
benefitted from an unprecedented opportunity to study the conditions that
produce massive algae blooms.
There have been occasional "red tides," blooms of colorful but harmful
algae, along the coast for centuries, but for unknown reasons poisoning
from domoic acid did not become a significant problem until the late 1980s.
Harmful algae blooms have increased in number and intensity in recent years
but generally have been about a couple of miles wide outside the Strait of
Juan de Fuca, which links Puget Sound and other inland marine waters with
the Pacific Ocean.
Hickey said the current bloom may be so huge because of unusually cool,
rainy weather since late August.
Scientists believe Pseudo-nitzschia, of which there are about 8 species,
not all of them toxic, is fed by nutrients from deep in the ocean or
carried outward into the eddy by currents through the strait between
Vancouver Island and Washington's Olympic Peninsula.
"Basically, it's sort of a crock pot, stewing and retaining the cells and
the toxins," Trainer said.

[Storm tracking and early warning are beneficial in saving lives from
hurricanes, tropical storms, and now algae blooms. The weather conditions
have unusual in many places this year, quite possibly spawning the storms
and algae blooms.
An excellent review of domoic acid in mammals can be found in "Mammal, bird
die-off, domoic acid - USA (CA) (02) 20020708.4702."
Domoic acid is a neurotoxic tricarboxylic amino acid structurally related
to kainic and glutamic acids. It was chemically identified after its
isolation in 1958 from the seaweed _Chondria armata_, found off the coast
of Japan. In 1987, more than 100 people became ill and several people died
following the consumption of blue mussels caught off Prince Edward Island,
Canada. Canadian scientists found that domoic acid had entered the food
chain when the mussels fed on a toxic algal bloom of the pennate diatom
_Pseudonitzschia pungens_ forma multiseries. - Mod.TG]
