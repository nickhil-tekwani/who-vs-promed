[Information found in their annual report (January to December 2008) submitted to the OIE, shows that Botswana reported one outbreak of bluetongue in the region of Lobatse. The species affected was caprine (4 susceptible, 1 case), serotype was not typed. See http://tinyurl.com/mgx9u5o (Note: go to Section 3 of the report, "Detailed quantitative information for OIE-listed diseases/infections present," for information on these outbreaks).

Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, non-contagious, vector-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, deer, most species of African antelope, and various other Artiodactyla as vertebrate hosts. Infection with bluetongue virus (BTV) is inapparent in the vast majority of animals but can cause fatal disease in a proportion of infected sheep, deer and wild ruminants. Infection of cattle with BTV does not usually result in clinical signs, with the exception of BTV8 infection in Europe. Cattle are particularly significant in the epidemiology of the disease due to the prolonged viraemia in the absence of clinical disease. Clinical signs of BT are mainly attributable to vascular permeability and include fever, hyperaemia and congestion, facial oedema and haemorrhages, and erosion of the mucous membranes. However in mild cases of the disease, a transitory hyperaemia and slight ocular and nasal discharge may be observed.

The vertebrate hosts for BTV include both domestic and wild ruminants, such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, deer, most species of African antelope, and other Artiodactyla such as camels. Although antibodies to BTV and virus antigen or nucleic acid or live virus has been demonstrated in some carnivores, felids, black and white rhinoceroses and elephants, the role of non-ruminant species in BTV epidemiology is considered minimal. The outcome of infection ranges from unapparent in the vast majority of infected animals, especially wild African ruminants, cattle and goats, to serious or fatal in a proportion of infected sheep, goats, deer and some wild ruminants.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.1.3 Bluetongue at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.03_BLUETONGUE.pdf (NB: Version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014)

BT has a significant global distribution in regions where the insect vector (that is, biting midges, genus _Culicoides_) is present, including Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and several islands in the tropics and subtropics. The virus is maintained in areas where the climate will allow biting midges to survive over winter.

There is no public health risk associated with BT (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BLUET-EN.pdf).
