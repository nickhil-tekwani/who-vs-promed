re: avian influenza (157): Italy, LPAI H5N2, H7N3
-------------------------------------------------
With reference to ProMED-mail post [above] number 200709193113, published
on 19 Sep 2007, concerning the omitted notification of LP H5/H7 subtype
avian influenza (AI) viruses by Italian authorities, the Italian Ministry
of Health-General Direction of Animal Health would like to make the
following remarks:
1. In compliance with article 1.1.2.3 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code
of the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health), information on the
circulation of LPAI [low pathogenic avian influenza] is submitted on a
6-monthly basis and not through immediate notification systems;
2. Italy reports all notifiable diseases to the OIE in compliance to OIE
rules, this includes LPAI;
3. Information on the animal health status of Italian livestock is made
available to the international community through the World Animal Health
Information Database (WAHID).
4. All relevant information on AI outbreaks in Italy, is submitted to
international organisations in compliance with EU Directive 2005/94/CE.

[We are grateful to Dr Maroni Ponti for the update above.
Indeed, according to the WAHID's "OIE reporting history: Italy", during
2006 Italy submitted all 3 compulsory reports, namely semester 1, semester
2, and annual; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=country_reporting&this_country_code=ITA&detailed=1>.
The reports included the following data, pertaining to outbreaks of low
pathogenic avian influenza (which is, reportedly, not a notifiable disease
in Italy) during 2006, as presented in the page "Detailed country disease
situation":
Number of new outbreaks reported
Total: 2 outbreaks
November 2006: Lombardia. Affected species: birds. No further details.
December 2006: Lombardia. Affected species: birds. Susceptible: 939; cases:
939; died: 0; destroyed: 939; slaughtered: 0.
