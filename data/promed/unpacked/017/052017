[This is the 1st case of HPAI subtype H5N8 in domestic poultry. All previous cases reported in 2020 affected wild birds. See reports below.

Part of the following information was published on 29 Sep 2020 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA): "As a result of studying arrival status of winter migratory birds recently (by Ministry of Environment), the arrival of representative winter migratory birds, ducks and wild geese has been confirmed. As such, to prevent avian influenza (AI), MAFRA will strengthen quarantine measures such as disinfection of migratory bird sites and urged poultry farms to comply with quarantine rules.... It is urged for poultry farms nationwide to strictly adhere to quarantine rules such as blocking access to visitors and vehicles, installing nets to block wild birds and rodents, applying quicklime around the access road to farmhouses and livestock facilities, disinfecting and wearing dedicated boots before entering the livestock facilities, cleaning and disinfecting before work. In particular, during the Chuseok holiday period, it is emphasized that visitors are restricted from entering poultry breeding facilities and that farms are urged to strictly comply with the prohibition of visiting migratory birds."
