Veterinary sources revealed a state of confusion in the Ministry of Agriculture as poultry flocks were suspected of being infected with the "USA" avian influenza virus that has devastated the poultry industry in the United States. The sources said that veterinary colleges collected 500 samples from 3 provinces -- Beni Suef, Minya, and Al Sharqia -- and sent them to the laboratories of the Animal Health Research Institute [AHRI] for confirmation.

It is expected that the results will be announced within hours, amid anticipation and concern of the Ministry of Agriculture and the poultry production sector. It would be envisaged to send samples to the [AI] reference laboratory in Britain to confirm the test results. The General Union of Poultry Producers asked the minister of agriculture, Dr Essam Fayed, to approve the disbursement of the [costs involved in the tests in the UK] from the poultry industry protection fund, to AHRI.

The suspicion of H5N8 infection came after the mortality rate was estimated to have doubled in a number of poultry farms all over the country.

There is growing concern currently haunting poultry farmers in case these mortalities would be caused by the emergence of the "killer virus" H5N8, as it is feared it will cause the industry's disaster, especially since there is no vaccine in the world to combat this virus.

[This is rather breaking news and, therefore, it is better to wait for the confirmation of the identity of the agent that causes these high mortality rates before commenting. - Mod.AB
