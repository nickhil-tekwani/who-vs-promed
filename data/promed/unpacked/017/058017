Surgeon source of hepatitis B infection in Scottish hospital
-----------------------------------------------------------
Health officials are trying to trace 350 hospital patients following the
death of a 79 year old man who caught hepatitis B from a surgeon at Queen
Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline, Fife. A hospital surgeon was identified
as the source of the infection. A second patient also contracted the
disease from the doctor and is recovering. Yesterday, there were calls for
hospital infection control strategies to be urgently reviewed after it
emerged that the surgeon, with 27 years experience, had been immunised
against hepatitis B and had undergone tests that indicated that the
immunisation had worked.
Charles Saunders, acting director of public health for Fife Health Board,
said they did not know exactly how the tragedy occurred but a link between
the surgeon and the 2 cases of infection had been established by DNA tests.
"Preliminary results from the DNA testing suggest all 3 [isolates of the
virus are extremely similar -- suggesting, given that the surgeon was
involved in both the patients' operations within the right sort of time
period for the incubation of the virus -- that both patients caught the
hepatitis B virus from the [surgeon," said Dr Saunders. He said: "It is a
mystery how [the surgeon could have produced those antibodies in response
to immunisation, so the immunisation would appear to have worked, but still
remain infectious for hepatitis B virus."
Hepatitis B is a liver disease spread by body fluids in the same way as
conditions like HIV; it can be passed on by contact with infected blood or
through sex. Symptoms include extreme tiredness, joint pain, loss of
appetite, nausea, and jaundice. Most of those infected survive, but in
severe cases the virus may cause cirrhosis or cancer. The 79 year old
patient contracted the virus last autumn after a gall bladder operation and
died in Feb 2001.
Dr Saunders defended the time span of 5 months that elapsed between the
patient's death and yesterday's disclosures. "When we discovered the first
patient had been infected with hepatitis B [virus we set up a very large
investigation trying to see if we could identify the source," he said. The
Scottish shadow health minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said steps must be taken
to prevent a similar tragedy happening. "Given that the surgeon involved
followed all the correct safety procedures, there must now be a review of
these procedures to ensure that patient safety is absolutely paramount,"
she said.

[This incident is unusual in that the surgeon had followed all the
currently recommended safety procedures and was permitted to operate, yet
remained infectious. - Mod.CP
A larger incident of the same thing occurred in another European country,
where a surgeon who had been repeatedly vaccinated against hepatitis B but
never showed conversion turned out to be a carrier. A retrospective survey
showed that at least 28 patients (out of nearly 2000) operated on by this
surgeon over several years contracted hepatitis B -- 11 shown to be the
same strain as the surgeon's -- and the spouse of one of those became a
fatal secondary case. - Mod.JW
