The latest numbers are in and, so far, 18 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF] have been reported in the Upper Cumberland Region -- more than 100 cases statewide this year [2012] alone. "There's a fair amount of (the disease) here; it's not common but it's certainly not uncommon," Dr Mark Pierce, an infectious disease specialist at Cookeville Regional Medical Center, said. "Eastern Tennessee is probably worse than Western Tennessee."

He adds there is no way to visibly tell if a tick is carrying the disease. "(Specialists) can culture ticks and see if they carry it but you can't tell by looking at it," Pierce said.

RMSF is considered the most serious tickborne disease in the United States. "RMSF is present in the United States through Canada (and) South America, for the most part," Pierce said. "In the US, the most common areas are the south eastern United States and the south central United States so this is one of the highest endemic areas. Usually North Carolina and Tennessee are the 2 states that carry the most of it."

Symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever typically appear 2 to 14 days after bite from an infected tick. Early symptoms of the disease include: sudden onset fever and headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, lack of appetite, and severe headache. Later symptoms include rash, abdominal pain, joint pain and diarrhea. Pierce says the symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are more common in children.

"If you have a tick (on you) that has actually fed for a while, at least a few hours, then there's a possibility it's transmitted (the disease)," Pierce said. He adds that if you know you've had a recent tick bite and then develop symptoms, that's when a trip to the doctor is recommended. The disease can have devastating effects and can be fatal, even in normally healthy people, if not treated correctly. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics.

The best way to prevent tickborne diseases, as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is to prevent tick bites in the 1st place. CDC recommends [see http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/]: wear light-colored clothing; tuck pants into socks to keep ticks off your legs; apply repellents [DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide)] to discourage tick attachment; search your entire body for ticks upon return from a potentially tick-infested area; and remove any tick you find on your body. To do so, grasp with tweezers and pull straight back, if the tick is attached. Check children for ticks, especially in their hair, when returning from potentially tick-infested areas. Ticks may also be carried into your home on clothing and pets, so examine both carefully. Reduce tick habitats around your home by removing leaf litter and brush.

Pierce adds that cases of RMSF can occur at any time of the year but spring and summer are when the majority of cases are reported. "This is clearly the height of the season right now when ticks are starting to be active," Pierce.

[Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tickborne disease caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_, the case fatality ratio for which approaches 25 per cent if untreated. The incidence of RMSF in the United States has increased during the last decade, from less than 2 cases per million persons in 2000 to over 8 cases per million in 2008 (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/). During the same time period, the proportion of RMSF cases resulting in death (case fatality) has declined to a low of less than 0.5 per cent. Although RMSF cases have been reported throughout most of the contiguous United States, 5 states (North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri) account for over 60 per cent of RMSF cases (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/).

The primary tick that transmits _R. rickettsii_ in these states is the American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm#fig1). _R. rickettsii_ is passed transovarially from adult females to their progeny (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014489463900195). Although cases of RMSF can occur during any month of the year, the majority of cases reported to CDC arise during the summer months and a peak in cases typically occurs in the months of June and July.

The incubation period of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is about a week after the tick exposure, days after the tick has detached. Frequently the patient is unaware of a preceding tick bite and the presenting illness is nonspecific, often leading to a delay in diagnosis. Typical symptoms include: fever, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, and muscle pain. A rash may also develop, but is often absent in the 1st few days, and in some patients, never develops ('spotless fever'). The classic rash that first appears 2-5 days in more than 50 per cent after the onset of fever is small, flat, pink, non-itchy macules on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/symptoms/index.html#rash). The red to purple, spotted (petechial) rash of RMSF is usually not seen until the 6th day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in 35-60 per cent of patients with the infection. This is a sign of progression to severe disease, and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop. Thus empiric treatment should be started in patients with a compatible illness who live or have visited an endemic area during the spring and summer, even if there is no knowledge of a preceding tick bite. Doxycycline is the 1st line treatment for adults and children of all ages, and is most effective if started before the 5th day of symptoms.

The diagnosis can be confirmed by serologic tests, using the indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm). IgG and IgM titers increase concurrently by the 2nd week of illness, and IgM antibodies wane after 3-4 months, whereas IgG titers persist for 7-8 months. Because of cross-reactivity, serologic tests that detect antibodies reactive with _R. rickettsii_ might have resulted from previous infections with other spotted fever group rickettsial species. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) can detect the etiologic agent in a skin biopsy or autopsy tissue specimen.

Prevention, as outlined in the news report above, which includes use of insect repellents (DEET, that is, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) and prompt removal of ticks, are important in endemic areas.
