_Leptospira pomona_ has been serologically diagnosed in milking dairy cows in a moshav [semi-collective village] farm in the Jezreel Valley [south of the Lower Galilee region]. The affected farm maintains a cattle fattening unit (about 600 fattening bull-calves) as well as a dairy cattle operation.

About 3 months ago, 8 of the fattening calves died showing jaundice. Serological tests in the unit revealed suspected titers of _L. pomona_. The calves are known to have been exposed to _L. pomona_ in another fattening unit.

Disease signs in the milking cows included a sharp drop in the milk yield, elevated 'somatic cell count' in milk, icterus and haematuria. Following the detection of _L. pomona_ infection in the fattening calves, all cattle in the other 11 dairy operations in the moshav underwent serological tests with negative results.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease. _Leptospira borgpeterenii_ serovar Hardjo and _L. interrogans_ serovar Pomona have been shown to be the most important pathogenic serovars in cattle, responsible for systemic illness, abortion, neonatal death, weak calves and various production losses throughout the world.

While leptospirosis infections caused by _L._ serovar Hardjo are consistently detected in Israel, since decades, _L._ serovar Pomona has been regarded absent for many years. In fact, the most recent major event was terminated in 2004, when an entire large dairy cattle operation in the Kibbutz Kiryat Anavim (Jerusalem area) was culled after 4 years of unsuccessful efforts to clean the herd from this infection by 'test and slaughter' policy (see annual 2004 report of Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health, page 66, in Hebrew, at http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/AB9D09DA-A5FC-4949-B45E-53802AAFEDA/0/snati_2004.pdf).

The current infection in a dairy operation, described above, seems to have been introduced by the fattening beef bull-calves kept on the feedlot of the same farm. Most of such animals are imported. During 2016, Israel imported a total of 307 142 head from 5 countries, as follows: Australia (68 387), Romania (65 333), Portugal (44 347), Hungary (44 190) and Lithuania (14 378). (Source at http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/00C1D4A7-CAD4-4CF1-B928-8172C760A639/0/import_12_2016.pdf).

It will be interesting to obtain information about the following issues:
1. Are the beef fattening calves, suspected to be the vehicle of dairy cattle infection, imported animals/had contact with imported animals?
2. From which country/ies?
3. Which measures have been undertaken to prevent the introduction of infectious diseases, in particular _Leptospira_ serovar Pomona, from those countries in which the cattle population is known to be infected by this organism? - Mod.AS
