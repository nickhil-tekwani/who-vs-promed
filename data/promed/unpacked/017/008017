[The amount of information in the posting is very
sparse and we do not know what kind of meat was
consumed and how it was prepared. The source can
be domestic pork or wild boar.

Trichinellosis in Chile has been reported before
from wild boar (Garc√≠a E et al. First record of
human trichinosis in Chile associated with
consumption of wild boar (Sus scrofa). Mem Inst
Oswaldo Cruz. 2005;100:17-8.) A review of
trichinellosis in South America including Chile
found that "Most of the outbreaks of human
trichinellosis in Mexico, Argentina and Chile
have occurred as a result of the consumption of
undercooked pork or pork products from animals
raised under poor hygienic conditions and which
are clandestinely slaughtered" (Ortega-Pierres MG
et al. Epidemiology of trichinellosis in Mexico,
Central and South America. Vet Parasitol. 2000;93:201-25).
