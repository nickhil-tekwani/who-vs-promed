Cruise ship hit by 2nd virus outbreak
-------------------------------------
The world's largest cruise ship was held in port on Monday [11 Dec 2006]
for intensive cleaning after a 2nd outbreak of gastrointestinal illness in
2 voyages affected 106 people. More than 380 passengers and crew members
aboard Royal Caribbean's "Freedom of the Seas" were sickened by norovirus
during a 26 Nov to 3 Dec 2006 Caribbean cruise. The ship was cleaned before
its next cruise, but 97 passengers and 11 crew members became sick with the
same illness last week, officials at the Miami-based cruise line said.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended
keeping the ship in port and will oversee repeated cleaning of "high-touch"
surfaces, such as door handles, railings, and elevator buttons, officials
said. Two additional doctors and 45 more cleaning staff will be aboard for
its next voyage, now scheduled to begin on Tuesday [12 Dec 2006]. The ship
carried more than 3900 passengers on its latest cruise.
Another ship, Princess Cruises' "Sun Princess," is also undergoing a
thorough cleaning after docking at Port Everglades on Sunday [10 Dec 2006]
with 97 sick passengers. "This is not a very serious outbreak, but we did
treat it as we treat all increased incidents, very immediately and
swiftly," said Julie Benson, spokeswoman for Santa Clarita,
California-based Sun Princess. The ship carried about 1950 passengers.
Norovirus is a group of viruses that cause [gastric] flu symptoms, such as
diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, according to the CDC. It spreads
through contaminated food or liquids, contaminated surfaces, or direct
contact with someone who is infected. Last month [November 2006], nearly
700 passengers fell ill on the Carnival [cruise ship] "Liberty" during a
cruise.

[The recurrence of viral gastroenteritis on the "Freedom of the Seas," the
world's largest cruise ship, may be a function of its exceptional size, and
the corresponding greater probability of introduction of a viral
gastroenteritis virus by a passenger, rather than failure of the
decontamination process. - Mod.CP]
