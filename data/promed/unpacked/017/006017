3rd Ebola patient headed to Nebraska Medical Center
---------------------------------------------------
The patient is a Sierra Leonean national who is a permanent resident of the United States and lives in Maryland, AP reported, citing an anonymous source. He reportedly was working at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone, when he came down with Ebola symptoms on 6 Nov 2014. He tested negative for the virus at that time, AP reported. When he was tested again on Monday [10 Nov 2014], the results came back positive. The patient will arrive on Saturday [15 Nov 2014] at the University of Nebraska facility, the Omaha World-Herald reported, citing an unidentified person "with knowledge of the patient's impending arrival". He is in a stable condition at an Ebola treatment center in Freetown, AP reported.... -- more

[2] New strategy for Liberia

Health officials reassess strategy to combat Ebola in Liberia
-------------------------------------------------------------
As the rate of new Ebola infections in Liberia has slowed, American and Liberian officials are debating whether to build all 17 planned Ebola treatment centers in the country or to shift money from the Obama administration that was planned for the centers into other programs to combat future outbreaks. The United States announced on Monday that it had completed the 1st of the 100-bed centers, some 40 miles outside Monrovia, in Tubmanburg, and turned over its operation to the International Organization for Migration, which will staff and run the center. 2 other treatment units, in Sinje, to the north of Monrovia, and Buchanan, to the south, will be completed by the end of November [2014], American military officials said. 7 additional treatment units across the country are in various stages of construction.

A 25-bed hospital recently opened outside Monrovia, and American and Liberian military officials are clearing the land for 2 more units. If all of them go ahead as planned, that would bring the total units built by the American and Liberian militaries working together on the project to 13, or 4 short of the units promised by President Obama on 16 Sep 2014.

But Mr Obama's promise came at the height of the epidemic, when new cases were increasing at a brisk rate. Since then, the rate of new infections in Liberia has come down and several treatment units around the country have reported empty beds for more than a month.

[3] USA: nurses strike
Date: Wed 12 Nov 2014

http://time.com/3580028/california-nurses-strike-ebola-union-kaiser-permanente


The 2-day strike is organized by National Nurses United and will affect 88 hospitals in the Golden State [California], 86 of which are owned by Kaiser Permanente, Reuters reports. [ProMED found only 37 listed on Kaiser Permanente's website -- see ProMED-mail post: Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (34): US doctor discharged, robots, WHO, Google 20141111.2946186. - Mod.JW]. The larger national strike will involve 100 000 nurses in 15 US states and the District of Columbia.

"Inadequate preparedness for Ebola symbolizes the erosion of patient care standards generally," a spokesman for National Nurses United told Reuters, adding that numerous other patient care issues, including under-staffing, have been "stonewalled and ignored." National Nurses United is in the midst of contract talks. In rebuttal to the union, an ad published in the Sacramento Bee by Kaiser over the weekend called the strikes counterproductive to making sure that US hospitals are ready for any future Ebola cases. "There is never a good time for a strike," it read. "Calling one now, just as we are entering the flu season, and when the nation and our members are concerned about the risk of Ebola, seems particularly irresponsible." ... -- more

[4] Australia to screen all arrivals
Date: Fri 14 Nov 2014

http://www.cqnews.com.au/news/ebola-check-australian-airports/2453506/


Ebola check at Australian airports
----------------------------------
Travellers arriving at Australian airports now have to complete a travel history check to see if they have visited countries with an Ebola outbreak. The increased checks at airports will be part of overall screening methods, and it will also involve temperature checks of those posing a higher risk. Fever is a symptom of the virus.

Agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce said the measures began on Friday [14 Nov 2014, and would mean every one of the 45 000 people arriving in Australia through airports would be checked. He said while the risk of an Ebola outbreak was still low in Australia, the extra screening could help identify at-risk passengers.

[5] Worldwide: safety video free to mariners

KVH offering Videotel's new Ebola safety video free to mariners
---------------------------------------------------------------
"Ebola -- Staying Safe", produced by maritime e-Learning leader Videotel, explains the dangers of Ebola and its impact on ships and seafarers.

KVH Industries, Inc, (Nasdaq: KVHI) is offering Videotel's new video about Ebola safety free to all mariners worldwide in an effort to increase awareness of the vitally important prevention measures that can keep seafarers safe. Ebola, a severe and often fatal illness for which there is no vaccine [true, so far] or cure [not true, unless you write "no specific cure". - Mod.JW], has been ravaging parts of West Africa since March [2014] in the largest outbreak ever known. The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak a public health emergency, and it is critically important that anyone working in the global maritime industry understand the steps they can take to prevent the further spread of the disease.

KVH has created a website, http://www.kvh.com/EbolaSafety, for all mariners to download the free video and an accompanying workbook. In addition, KVH delivered the entire video program today to its IP-MobileCast customers on vessels across the globe, who will automatically receive the video for immediate viewing onboard. "This is a perfect example of why it is sometimes necessary to send out urgent training updates without delay and not wait for the annual update process," says Nigel Cleave, Videotel chief executive officer.... -- more
