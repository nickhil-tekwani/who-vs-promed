Health authorities in Los Santos province report the 1st hantavirus victim registered in 2018, a 62-year-old man who resided in El Bebero in Tonosí [district, Los Santos province].

His death was registered on Sunday night, [28 Jan 2018] in the Joaquín Pablo Franco Sayas hospital in the city of Las Tablas [Los Santos].

The man was one of the tireless fighters against the hantaviruses in Los Santos province.

Germán Solís, Regional Director of the Ministry of Health (MINSA) in Los Santos province, said that an increase in cases is expected due to the considerable production of grains and other [crops] in this district and other places in the province.

Meanwhile, MINSA will begin an operation in Tonosí district and has urged the population to follow the measures to avoid an increase in cases of hantavirus [infections].

[There are frequent cases of infections by hantaviruses in Los Santos province. The situation in which the man acquired his infection is not mentioned. There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva.
