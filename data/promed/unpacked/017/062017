The Ministry of Health (MOH) said the index cases are a 25-year-old
Bangladeshi and a 41-year-old Singaporean. They were working in the
vicinity of the Lim Chu Kang Agro Technology Park, located at Lim Chu
Kang Lane 2.

As part of active case detection, 30 workers were screened and 3 more
workers were found to be positive for chikungunya virus. They are a
23-year-old Malaysian, a 21-year-old Chinese national, and a
31-year-old Myanmar national.

The Health Ministry said the total number of cases linked to Lim Chu
Kang now stands at 5. Investigations are continuing.

Separately, one new case was identified at the Pasir Panjang
Wholesale Centre, 2 at Kranji Way, 3 at Sungei Kadut, and one each at
Yishun and Tuas. To date, a total of 150 cases of chikungunya fever
have been notified to MOH this year [2008].

The MOH has advised persons who develop symptoms of chikungunya to
consult their doctors immediately. These include fever, joint pain,
and rashes.

Chikungunya fever, like dengue fever, is a mosquito-borne disease.
Persons infected with chikungunya fever should be isolated from
further mosquito bites so as to reduce the risk of further
transmission of the virus.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[Singapore is taking a very aggressive, proactive approach to finding
chikungunya virus infections in an attempt to halt transmission of
the virus. Coupled with their active mosquito vector control program,
they have doubtless reduced the number of infections. The occurrence
of cases at various localities makes control challenging.
