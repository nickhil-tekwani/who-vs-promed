Comment on the Latest CJD Statistics from Great Britain
-------------------------------------------------------
The most recent official Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) statistics from the
UK (from 3 Jan 2001) give a detailed overview for the period 1 Jan 1985 -
28 Dec 2000. Not only do the variant CJD (vCJD) cases increase after 1994,
but less rampantly also the well-known traditional spongiform
encephalopathies -- more clearly when looking at 4-year periods:
year/referrals/sporadic/iatrogenic/familial/GSS/vCJD*/vCJD**/vCJD***/total
1985-1988/-/97/2/2/1/-/-/-/102
1989-1982/242/131/10/10/1/-/-/-/152
1993-1996/415/164/13/10/12/-/-/13/212
1997-2000/656/221/15/12/2/5/2/68/325
Key:
vCJD* = probable, still alive
vCJD** = probable, still awaiting postmortem results
vCJD*** = confirmed
That means: Suspicion increases (of course), so do 'sporadic' cases,
iatrogenic and familial cases, and GSS (which is inherited too). The latter
figures increase only slightly, indeed, but for the whole group together (5
- 21 - 35 - 29) a tendency is assumable. Only variant CJD figures, however,
increase without any doubt (0 - 0 - 13 - 75). What will these figures look
like after 4 more years? Is it pessimistic to assume the following picture,
by simple analogy with other tardive [said of a disease in which the
characteristic lesion is late in appearing - PG epidemics that are due to
lenti-causes and -pathogens (such as drug abuse, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis):
[year/referrals/sporadic/iatrogenic/familial/GSS/vCJD*/vCJD**/vCJD***/total
2001-2004/1100/250/18/12/8/20/12/260/580
This could be no more than the gradually continuing taking-off slope of a
delayed curve which may peak around 2025-2040, partly depending on how
efficiently we cope with the BSE/variant CJD risks today. If traditional
spongiform encephalopathies indeed participate in this increase, it could
mean that they may be triggered by the same pathogen. Here we ought to
look for crucial pathogen-specific or host-specific factors (as Flowers has
proposed, e.g., a M/M-homozygotic position 129 in the PrP-gene). Such a
connection would further strengthen the plausible hypothesis of H. Diringer
(Lancet 1995), which combines all known traditional spongiform
encephalopathies as a complex epidemic-epizootic transition pattern.
Personally, I am inclined to believe that the less significant increases in
the British CJD statistics are predominantly a result of sudden diagnostic
alertness and growing compliance in reporting, which only can be hampered
by elderly people's multiple or clouded diagnoses.
Conclusions that go even further (Honhold, Flowers, Hotz de Baar) are
likely to over-interpret poor data in a context of high 'random noise'
(statistical blips). I fully agree with G. Hoffmann that the scanty
figures presented do not yet allow any reliably prognostic curve
fitting. What we can really say today is (in an admittedly sweeping
statement): It doesn't look good.
