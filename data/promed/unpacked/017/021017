Israel reports first case of mad-cow disease
---------------------------------------------
Israel confirmed Tue 04 Jun 2002 its first case of mad cow disease,
found in a cow in a kibbutz in the Golan Heights, but officials said they
were confident that no infected meat had reached the market.
The Agriculture Ministry said it would launch an emergency plan to
examine brains of all cattle over the age of 30 months that are sent to
slaughterhouses before releasing their meat to the market.
Oded Nir, the director of the Agriculture Ministry's veterinary services
department, told Reuters that the Israeli-born animal bred in Kibbutz
Ortal was "probably infected by poultry fish meal imported from
Europe."
An Israeli Agriculture Ministry statement said a brain biopsy performed
on the 10-year-old cow by the World Organization for Animal Health
[reference laboratory] in Switzerland showed bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, commonly known as mad-cow disease.
Mr. Nir said they evaluated the risk of the disease's spreading
throughout the country, and especially in the meat market, and
determined that there was little chance it would happen.
"Based on the surveillance we have been doing since 1996, we are
pretty sure that if we had cases, they would be very few, maybe 2 or 3
per million. That's why we don't think there is a danger in the meat that
exists in the market," he said. Mr. Nir also said there was no danger to
the milk industry, because mad-cow disease is not transmitted through
milk.
A spokeswoman for the Agriculture Ministry said there was no fear
that other cows have been affected or that the disease might be
spreading. Tests have been continuously conducted on cattle since
Britain's mad cow disease epidemic in 1996, she added. "We are not
worried at all," she said. "Since 1996 we have examined every cow. We
are looking for the disease, it's not like we just discovered it (by
accident). From now on the future is covered."
In addition to the plan for examining the brains of slaughtered cattle,
the internal organs of slaughtered cattle over the age of one year will be
destroyed.

Meat Board opens Mad Cow hotline for concerned public
------------------------------------------------------
The [Israel] Dairy and Meat Board opened an phone line Wed 05 Jun
2002 to provide information to the public on questions concerning beef
consumption in the wake of the confirmation of Israel's first case of
Mad Cow Disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy).
The board's director-general, Avshalom Dolev, said that although both
the Health and Agriculture ministries had stated that it was safe to
consume beef, the public had many questions on the issue and that the
help-line would provide reliable information from professional
sources. The line will operate from 8 A.M. to 22 P.M. on weekdays,
and 8 A.M to 2 P.M. on Fridays. The number of the information line is
03-576 5170.
Dr. Oded Nir, head of the Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Services,
revealed that the 5 cows related to the cow that died last week of BSE
had been put down and cremated Wednesday. Of these, 2 that were put
down were the same age as the infected animal and came from the
same herd in the Beit She'an Valley. The cows were put down because
of the high likelihood that they had been fed on the same feed as the
contaminated animal. The infected cow's 3 offspring were also put
down.
Brain tissue from the 5 cows was taken for testing at the Veterinary
Services' laboratory in Beit Dagan to check whether the animals were
also infected with BSE; the results of the tests are expected within 24
hours.
Dr. Nir on Wed 05 Jun 2002 refuted reports from Britain that between
1990 and 1996 it had exported to Israel thousands of tons of beef meal
animal feed that may have contained the proteins that cause the disease.
Nir said that the mistaken report stemmed from the fact that British
customs officials had not differentiated between beef meal, chicken
meal or fish meal, and had labeled all 3 as beef meal.
In any event, Nir said, since 1998 [sic, actually 1988], Israel has not
imported beef or beef meal, which is made from offal and carcasses
unfit for human consumption. He stressed that Israel comes under strict
European Union supervision, which has found that there were no
violations of its standards set to prevent the spread of the disease.
Britain's ambassador to Israel sent a letter to Agriculture Minister
Shalom Simhon on Wed 05 Jun 2002, offering his country's assistance
to Israel in handling the Mad Cow Disease. Britain has accumulated
extensive experience in handling the disease since it was first diagnosed
there in 1996 [sic, actually 1986]. The Agriculture Ministry expressed
its gratitude for the British offer, but said that it had prepared in
advance for an outbreak of the disease and at this stage did not need
any outside assistance.
Meanwhile, despite extensive media coverage of Israel's first case of
Mad Cow Disease, restaurants and butcher shops report that there has
not been a drop in beef consumption. Butchers Braun, in Tel Aviv, and
Hinawi, in Jaffa, both reported that they had not seen a fall in beef sales.

[Israel's earliest restrictions on imports of MBM's are found in the
review "BSE ­- Worlds Situation and The Danger of Outbreak of the
Disease in Israel", indicating that "the import of MBM of mammalian
origin from the UK and from all other countries was prohibited in 1988
and 1990 respectively. The import of poultry MBM was permitted only
from plants authorised by the local veterinary authorities. The purpose
of the authorisation was to ensure that the MBM is produced in the
plant specifically allocated for poultry MBM."
