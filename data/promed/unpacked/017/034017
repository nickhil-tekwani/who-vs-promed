[It has now been 24 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan, 10 days more than one incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). In today's (27 Apr 2020) report, there were 3 new locally transmitted infections in Heilongjiang reported. With an additional 3 imported cases, the total number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours is 6. There is 1 suspected case in an importation. It has now been 34 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 21 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from both Guangdong and Heilongjiang are decreasing, with no newly confirmed cases reported from Guangdong for 2 days now (26 and 27 Apr 2020).

According to the report above, a total of 82 836 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 6 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (26 Apr 2020) report. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 48 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 40 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 3 were in imported cases. There were no conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 997, and 130 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 199 414 cases, including 26 977 deaths, up from 197 675 cases and 26 664 deaths reported on 26 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 26 and 27 Apr 2020 was 1739 newly confirmed cases, compared with 2324 newly confirmed cases between 25 Apr 2020 and 26 Apr 2020, a slow, vacillating, but steady decline. Numbers of hospitalized cases and numbers of cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 68.3% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 33.9% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont, 2 other provinces (Liguria and Trento) have reported more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 6 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 7 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 010 356, including 56 797 deaths, an increase from 987160 cases and 55 413 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 298 004 (29.5%) cumulative case reports and 4013 (17.3%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 156 100 as of 1:00 PM on 27 Apr 2020, including 11 708 confirmed deaths and an additional 5228 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (2150 -- 9.3%), Illinois (1980 -- 8.5%), Massachusetts (1524 -- 6.6% of total), California (1465 -- 6.3%) and Indiana (949 -- 4.1%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Connecticut.

More sobering, if you treat each state like a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the UK, Turkey, New Jersey, Iran, and Russia as number 10 (idea given by Mod.LXL).

The US military has confirmed 6568 cumulative cases, with 355 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 7001 cumulative cases and 141 new cases today (27 Apr 2020). There have been 1376 cases reported from federal prisons (258 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 1716 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (176 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1389 cases (18 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[It is clear Spain wishes to report only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The amount of antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available. While the website for 26 Apr 2020 showed 209 465 cases, the Johns Hopkins CSSE data show 229 422 cases reported for today accessed at 4:22 PM EDT on 27 Apr 2020 (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6

That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 1831 newly confirmed cases by PCR (2793 new cases counting PCR and antibody testing) in the past 24 hours bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 209 465 as compared with 207 634 PCR confirmed cases yesterday (26 Apr 2020).

As of today (27 Apr 2020) and as per the Spanish health webpage, 209 465 total cases and 23 521 deaths have been reported, up from 207 634 cases and 23 190 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (25 Apr 2020) (from Johns Hopkins CSSE 229 422 on 27 Apr 2020 vs 226 629 on 26 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 85.19, a continual slow decrease over the past 14 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 85.19 today (27 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 209 465 cases, approximately 114 081 (54.5% have been hospitalized (a major increase from 80 150 in the past 24 hours) and 10 372 (5.0%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). Caution should be taken in interpreting this rise due to the decreased denominator.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7274497,43. Madrid, Catalonia, and La Rioja are now the most affected communities by population-based rates. La Rioja and Catalonia are located in the northern part of the country. Madrid is located in central Spain, with Catalonia and La Rioja to its northeast. Barcelona is located in Catalonia. - Mod.MPP]
