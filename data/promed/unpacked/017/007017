Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The USDA, Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS), the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services are conducting comprehensive epidemiological investigations of these events. Affected animals were detected through routine sampling. There were no clinical signs of disease present. All affected shrimp were depopulated, and their tanks were cleaned and disinfected. Surveillance related to this event is ongoing. Any newly identified tanks with positive animals would also be depopulated, cleaned and disinfected.

Control measures
Measures applied: Surveillance within infected and/or protection zone; quarantine; selective killing and disposal; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
University of Arizona Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory (local laboratory) / Pacific white leg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 16 May 2019 / Positive
University of Arizona Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory (local laboratory) / Pacific white leg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 7 Jun 2019 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (national laboratory) / Pacific white leg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 10 Jun 2019 / Positive
Private laboratory (private laboratory) / Pacific white leg shrimp (_Litopenaeus vannamei_) / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 28 May 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) is an economically important pathogen that causes shrimp diseases worldwide. IHHNV is highly contagious to several penaeid species, and it is usually fatal for _Penaeus stylirostris_, causing significant losses for shrimp farmers.

"IHHNV causes the chronic disease runt-deformity syndrome (RDS) in _P. vannamei_, characterized by reduced, irregular growth and cuticular deformities. IHHNV infection in _P. monodon_ is usually subclinical, but RDS, reduced growth rates and reduced culture performance have been reported in IHHNV-infected stocks.

"Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis is on the list of diseases notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)." Source: https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/59940
