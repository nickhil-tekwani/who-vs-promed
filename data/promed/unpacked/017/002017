The Ministry of Water and Livestock Development has put 4 regions (Mbeya,
Iringa, Rukwa, and Ruvuma [southern Tanzania) under quarantine after
establishing the presence of African Swine Fever (ASF). The move aims at
preventing the spread of the disease to neighboring regions.
According to a statement from the director of livestock development in the
ministry, Dr. Reminiscele Kweka, the ministry has imposed restrictions on
livestock movements as well as pork in the area, except under written
permit of authorized veterinary officers. The government has put up
checkpoints at different places along trunk and feeder roads linking one
region to another at which transporters would be required to declare pork
or pigs cargo en route.
According to the statement, the government has banned importation of pigs
and related products into the country from neighboring countries considered
to have ASF. "The disease is smouldering in Mbeya as well as adjacent areas
in Malawi and south of Zambia.."
The government has banned feeding of pigs with swill and left-overs [food,
unless they are rendered safe by boiling. All the infected pens should not
be restocked.
The quarantine has dealt a big blow to residents of the region, who, until
recently, were the main suppliers of pigs to Dar es Salaam, popular in
urban areas as kiti moto.
