'Flesh-eating' germ infects 2
------------------------------
A patient [infected] with flesh-eating [bacteria] spread the infection to a
health care worker at Flagstaff Medical Center, leaving both people
hospitalized in serious condition. The state Department of Health Services
has asked doctors at the hospital to monitor other workers for symptoms,
even though they don't think it has spread. The DHS said the Flagstaff
case represents the 1st documented case in Arizona of invasive Group A
streptococcus spreading from a patient to a health care worker. Officials
at the medical center don't know how the disease was spread.
Health experts say about 25 percent of the population has Group A strep in
their throats or on their skin at any given time. "99 percent of the time,
it's benign such as strep throat or impetigo like little kids get. There's
just a rare instance where that organism can cause severe disease," said
Dr. Mark Lacy, an infectious disease specialist at Flagstaff Medical Center.
"There's nothing really specific about invasive Group A strep. You can't
spell it all out, like look for a, b, c, d and e and see a doctor. It can
mimic a lot of things."
In Arizona, there are about 300 cases of invasive Group A strep infections
a year, state records show. Invasive Group A strep can manifest itself in
many ways. In the case of the Flagstaff patients, it led to serious illness.
The initial patient was admitted to the hospital on 9 Feb 2005. The
bacterial infection had developed into necrotizing fasciitis. The patient
also developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and bacteremia, a
bacterial invasion of the bloodstream. The condition became so severe that
doctors had to amputate the patient's left leg at the hip. 6 days later,
on 15 Feb 2005, the health care worker was hospitalized with pneumonia,
bacteremia, and STSS.

[Necrotizing fasciitis, the so-called "flesh-eating disease," can be
multibacterial (often related to mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora) or
caused by a single organism, most commonly the Group A beta-hemolytic
streptococcus. Many cases, as reflected in the Davies report below, have
an underlying disease. The above posting is noteworthy because of the
spread to a health care worker, who developed invasive streptococcal
disease as well. The posting does not state whether the health care worker
had any underlying diseases. Several citations with their corresponding
abstracts relating to the spread of invasive streptococcal disease in
health care settings are shown below:
1. Davies HD, McGeer A, Schwartz B, et al:. Invasive group A streptococcal
infections in Ontario, Canada. Ontario Group A Streptococcal Study Group. N
Engl J Med 1996; 335:547-54.
Several reports suggest that the incidence of invasive group A
streptococcal infections, including streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and
necrotizing fasciitis, is increasing. During 1992 and 1993 we conducted
prospective, population-based surveillance of invasive group A
streptococcal disease in Ontario, Canada. We reviewed clinical and
laboratory records, searched for secondary cases of invasive disease, and
cultured specimens from household contacts. We identified 323 patients with
invasive group A streptococcal infections, for an annual incidence of 1.5
cases per 100 000 population. The rates were highest in young children and
the elderly. 56 percent of the patients had underlying chronic illness.
Risk factors for disease included infection with the human immunodeficiency
virus, cancer, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and chickenpox. The most common
clinical presentations were soft-tissue infection (48 percent), bacteremia
with no septic focus (14 percent), and pneumonia (11 percent). Necrotizing
fasciitis occurred in 6 percent of patients, and toxic shock in 13 percent.
The mortality rate was 15 percent overall, but it was 29 percent among
those over 64 years of age (P<0.001) and 81 percent among those with toxic
shock (P<0.001). 14 percent of the cases were nosocomial, and 4 percent
occurred in nursing home residents, often in association with disease
outbreaks. Invasive disease occurred in 2 household contacts of patients
with infection, for an estimated risk of 3.2 per 1000 household contacts
(95 percent confidence interval, 0.39 to 12 per 1000). The elderly and
those with underlying medical conditions are at greatest risk for invasive
group A streptococcal disease, toxic shock, and necrotizing
fasciitis. Invasive steptococcal infection is associated with a
substantial risk of transmission in households and health care institutions.
2. Rutishauser J, Funke G, Lutticken R, Ruef C: Streptococcal toxic shock
syndrome in two patients infected by a colonized surgeon. Infection 1999;
27:259-60.
The incidence of severe invasive infections caused by _Streptococcus
pyogenes_, a group A streptococcus (GAS), has increased in the past 10
years. Most cases occur outside of the hospital setting. We report on 2
patients with nosocomial streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (StrepTSS). In
patient 1, the syndrome was associated with the development of necrotizing
fasciitis following inguinal hernia repair. Patient 2 suffered from
StrepTSS shortly after receiving a tetanus vaccine in her left deltoid.
Epidemiologic investigations of these cases, which were noted within 48
hours of each other, showed that the same surgeon performed the vaccination
on patient 2 after assisting a colleague during the hernia repair procedure
on patient 1. He was found to be a nasal carrier of GAS. All GAS isolates
from the patients and the surgeon were indistinguishable by pulsed field
gel electrophoresis. PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of
streptococcal pyogenic exotoxins A and F. All strains !
were of the T-1 serotype and possessed the gene for M-protein 1. This
report demonstrates that a virulent strain of GAS may be spread by
asymptomatically colonized medical personnel via the air route.
3. Reid RI, Briggs RS, Seal DV, Pearson AD: Virulent Streptococcus
pyogenes: outbreak and spread within a geriatric unit. J Infect 1983; 6:219-25.
An outbreak of infection due to _Streptococcus pyogenes_ occurred in a
geriatric rehabilitation unit between Feb and Sep 1981, affecting 10
patients and 2 staff. The severity of the illness ranged from asymptomatic
throat carriage, through skin and soft-tissue sepsis, to fulminant
septicemia and necrotizing fasciitis: 2 patients died of their infection.
_Streptococcus pyogenes_ infection may present in a variety of ways, and
may be dangerous. Recently developed serological tests have been found
useful in the surveillance of an outbreak. Although _Streptococcus
pyogenes_ is sensitive to penicillin and other antibiotics, good ward
hygiene is still essential for controlling such an outbreak in an
institution. - Mod.LL]
