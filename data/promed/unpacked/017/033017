CLIMATE CHANGE & EMERGING INFECTIONS (8):
==========================================
CLIMATE FORECASTING AND HEALTH EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS

[This is in response to the posting, "Epidemic Warning - Central
America" (By Silvio Hernandez [edited by MH-J], sent by hjelte@it.net
(Anette Hjelte), dated Wed 20 Dec 1995 07:50 + 0100)]

I write a propos of the ProMED message regarding expectations for
rains in Latin America and upsurges of vector-borne diseases (VBDs).
Patterns of precipitation have become more predictable, using data and
climate models based on the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPMP).
In 1991, 1992, 1994 and 1995 the WPWP was anomalously warm, i.e.,
"El Nino" conditions, with negative Southern Oscillation (sea
surface pressures and decreased easterly 'trade' winds). Since
1877 El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years has occurred on
average every 4.2 years, and has consistently brought excess
rainfall and flooding to coastal Peru, Ecuador, Southeast Brazil
and equatorial east Africa; and reduced rainfall or drought to
Northeast Brazil, Southeast Africa, India, the Philippines,
Indonesia and Australia (1,2). Unusually warm temperatures are
experienced in the Pacific Northwest, northeast North America and
Japan. In Central America ENSO years are drier than normal in the
Pacific basin and tend to be wetter than normal on the Caribbean
side (P. Ramirez, CR Met Office, personal communication, Nov
1995). The precipitation 'signal' is less consistent in the US,
but Gulf Coast states and the Great Basin tend to have increased
precipitation and warmer temperatures (3).
In August 1995 the WPWP reversed, and cold upwelling began a "La
Nina" event. Ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific are now
in a minus 2 xC anomaly from average. (El Nino's are + 2-4 xC
anomalies.) ENSO "cold episodes" (1984, 1988 and now 1995) --
associated with increased easterly winds -- bring the OPPOSITE
weather patterns globally (4), ie, excessive rains to the Pacific
basin of Central America and northern South America (as in
Colombia [55]), and Southeast Africa (as with flooding late
December, raising concerns for spread of water-borne diseases
outbreaks [WBDOs] like cholera and typhoid).
La Nina's tend to follow El Nino's, exaggerating the adverse
impacts of the variability and associated extreme events. Thus
even in areas where the signal is not strong - like NE US -
weather patterns usually reverse, with wet, cold conditions
(Blizzard of 1996) following the hot, dry summer. In Florida (a
Gulf state) and in Mexico conditions have also reversed. The
overall increased hydrological cycle (6) associated with the
global heat taken up by the deep oceans (the Atlantic is still
warm) may be adding fuel to current conditions.
This spring several coupled atmospheric-oceanic models project
that a warm anomaly (El Nino) will return. Overall, either
anomaly brings extreme weather conditions to many parts of the
world.
Four global circulation models have projected more El Ninos with
a global and ocean warming trend. Indeed there has been an
increase in anomalies and accompanying extreme weather events
since 1983, the largest El Nino of the century.
Tracking precipitation and temperature patterns this season
(which will also involve mountain snow/ice cover and spring
runoff), and anticipating weather patterns in the coming April-
December "rainy" season, may help target areas to prepare early
public health interventions, regarding VBDs like dengue fever and
malaria, and WBDOs.
Three, six and twelve month "Long-lead Climate Forecasts" based
on El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions (warm and cold
events) are available from the Climate Analysis Center of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and on
the World Wide Web - see NOAA home page, Climate Prediction
Center. The International Global Ocean Service System Products
Bulletin (IGOSS) provides current and historical Sea Surface
Temperatures.
While predicting outbreaks of "new" diseases is not possible,
improved prediction of CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE for the resurgence of
established VBDs and WBDOs may be more feasible. While still
probabalistic, improvements in the prediction of CLIMATE
VARIABILITY and global linkages of WEATHER PATTERNS could help to
generate HEALTH EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS. Note that analyzing range
extensions of VDBs involves assessment of LONG-TERM changes in
climate (and vector populations, or both). Changes in altitude is
not just academic: mountain ranges can present barriers to the
spread of VBDs.
