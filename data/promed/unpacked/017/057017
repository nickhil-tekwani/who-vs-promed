TRYPANOSOMIASIS? - SRI LANKA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
*****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Dr. D. S. Rajasingham <epidunit@sri.lanka.net>

A case of suspected Trypanosomiasis has been detected from Eastern Sri
Lanka. The _Trypanosoma_ in the blood samples seem to be similar to
_T.evansi_. Sri Lanka has no experience of Trypanosomiasis.
Any advice regarding management as well as control measures would be welcome.

[_T. evansi_ is known to occur in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the
Far East, Central and South America. It is essentially a disease of camels
and horses but all domestic animals are susceptible and the disease can be
fatal particularly in camels, horses and dogs. Other animals may function
as a reservoir of infection. Transmission
is primarily by biting flies, probably resulting from interrupted feedings.
A few wild animals are susceptible to infection and may serve as
reservoirs. - Mod.TG]
[_T. evansi_ is not known to infect humans. Dr. D. S. Rajasingham does
not make it clear whether this is a human case, but many human cases of _T.
cruzi_ (Chagas' disease) have been seen in Central American immigrants to
the USA, and the disease has occasionally been transmitted by blood
transfusion. So if it is a human case, it is
probably _T. cruzi_, not _T. evansi_, and a Mexican, Central or South
American connection (Nationality? Travel? Blood donor?) should be looked
for - Mod.JW]
