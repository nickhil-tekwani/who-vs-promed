A total of 33 new cases of foot and mouth disease [FMD] have been
registered in the Russian Far East in the past 24 hours, a spokesman for
the regional center of the Emergency Situations Ministry said on Friday [9
Sep 2005]. Animals infected with the Asia-1 strain of the disease have been
discovered in 4 villages in the Maritime Territory [Primorsky Krai, also
called Primorye; for information on the administrative divisions of Russia,
and particularly the Far East Federal district, see commentary in
20050908.2666. - Mod.AS].
In all, the outbreak has affected 8 districts and more than 500 cattle have
been slaughtered after either contracting the disease or coming into
contact with infected animals.
Disinfected barriers have been set up in all the villages where the disease
has been recorded and quarantine conditions have been imposed. Entry into
the Maritime Territory is also restricted.
The 1st case of FMD [in Primorsky Krai] was registered on 26 Aug 2005.

Lawmakers in the Far Eastern Primorye region blamed federal officials for
the outbreak of FMD in the region and proposed that the office of the
Prosecutor General investigates the reasons of the epidemics.
The press center of the regional legislature told Tass on Friday [9 Sep
2005] that lawmakers said "the slow reaction of corresponding federal
structures and complete ignorance of the alarming signs from the region by
certain officials in the center had serious consequences".
The main problem was the delayed delivery of the vaccine against FMD.
During the June 2005 outbreak of the disease in neighboring Amur region,
Primorye authorities requested the Agriculture ministry to supply the
necessary vaccine. However, the 1st vaccine arrived in the region when the
disease had already broken out.
As of [9 Sep 2005], FMD was registered in 8 districts of the region [The
disease seems to advance; in the previous media report, dated 6 Sep 2005, 7
districts were indicated as affected; see 20050906.2643 - Mod.AS].
Quarantine has been imposed in 9 settlements. Over 500 cattle were
slaughtered and another 500 will be slaughtered in the coming days. The
damage is estimated at 20-25 million rubles [USD 707 000 - 885 000].
Primorye lawmakers are planning to request that the prosecutor of the Far
Eastern federal district and the office of the Prosecutor General
investigate the developments, the press center said.

[Since the 3rd week of August, FMD -- caused by serotype Asia 1 -- spread
into 2 previously unaffected regions along the Chinese border, namely the
Khabarovsk and Primorsk regions. Contrary to the requirements of the
International Animal Health Code, no notification of these outbreaks has
been forthcoming from the Russian authorities. Their last follow-up report
was sent on 30 Jun 2005; it related to a previous outbreak, in the Amur
region, more than 1000 km northwest of the current outbreaks. - Mod.AS]
