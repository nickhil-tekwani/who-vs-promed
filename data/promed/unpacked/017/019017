A series of "understandable" near misses accounted for a Georgia
man's odyssey to Europe in which he might have exposed fellow
passengers on a series of commercial flights to an exceptionally
dangerous form of tuberculosis, federal officials said yesterday, 30
May 2007. The man is being detained under a federal isolation order
in an Atlanta hospital for treatment of extremely drug-resistant
tuberculosis, which is often lethal.
American officials and those in many other countries, meanwhile, are
seeking to advise more than 100 passengers who sat closest to him on
the longest flights and crew members to be tested for the infection.
Health officials are also offering testing to hundreds of other
passengers on the flights.
It was the first airline-contact tracing investigation for extremely
drug-resistant tuberculosis, and it exposed many flaws that need to
be fixed for future episodes, officials of the CDC said at a news
conference in Atlanta.While many infectious-disease experts and
ethicists supported the agency's action, at least one strongly
criticized it as over-reacting.
Among the problems the agency identified were dealing with time zone
differences; a lack of coordination between American and
international authorities concerning how to medically isolate the man
while he was abroad; and how to speed the retrieval of passenger
manifests from airlines.
The episode also raised questions about how rapidly health officials
could respond to a similar emergency with other deadly infectious
diseases. Even after the news conference, many other questions
remained unanswered, including why it took health officials in
Georgia so long to try to deliver a letter that explicitly told the
man, whose identify was not disclosed, not to fly abroad for his honeymoon.
In an interview published yesterday, 30 May 2007, in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, the man disputed statements from disease agency
officials about warnings it said Fulton County, GA, officials gave
him about flying abroad. The agency said he was told not to fly. The
man told the paper that Fulton County health officials said they
"preferred" that he not go abroad for his honeymoon and did not
advise him to take any precautions.
"There are different perspectives on who said what to whom when,"
said Dr. Martin S. Cetron, who directs agency's division of global
migration and quarantine. "It is very unfortunate that this whole
situation wasn't prevented" before the man flew with 432 other
passengers and 18 crew members to Paris from Atlanta on Air France
385 on 12 May 2007, Dr. Cetron said. He took at least 5 flights
within Europe and then flew with 190 other passengers and 9 crew
members from Prague to Montreal on Czech Air 104 on 25 May 3007.
The Fulton County health department in Atlanta met with the man and
his family on 10 May 2007, 2 days before he flew to Paris, and told
them that he should not travel because he had multi-resistant
tuberculosis, the disease agency said. No legal order was issued at
the time, Dr. Cetron said in referring further questions to the
Fulton County health department.
The extraordinary dangerous form of the tuberculosis was not detected
until 22 May 2007, while he was in Europe. Dr. Cetron said that an
agency officer telephoned the man in Rome and explicitly told him not
to fly on a commercial plane. Doctors believe prolonged exposure is
needed to spread tuberculosis while the agency worked out options to
bring him back to the United States. They included an air ambulance.
By the time a former disease agency doctor, who is working in Rome,
arrived at the man's hotel, the couple had left, Dr. Cetron said. The
agency was in the process of putting the man's name on a no-fly list.
But by this time he had cut short his honeymoon that was supposed to
last into June 2007 and was landing in Montreal.
The efforts "weren't fast enough," Dr. Cetron said, adding that "we
certainly will be learning lessons and looking to improve" current systems.
The man drove to the United States and somewhere between Albany and
New York spoke with Dr. Cetron, who instructed him on how to continue
to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. There, he was isolated for 72
hours until the disease agency flew him in its plane to Atlanta on
Mon 28 May 2007. The man told the Atlanta paper that tuberculosis was
detected by accident when he had a chest X-ray in Jan 2007 for
another undisclosed problem.
Dr. Cetron said that lesions showed up in the upper lobe of the man's
right lung, making doctors suspicious for tuberculosis because the
infection often affects that area. Because the man had no symptoms
and little cough, his doctors performed a procedure to obtain the
secretions from which the tuberculosis bacteria were detected.
Repeated subsequent smear tests of the man's sputum performed at
Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan and at Grady Memorial Hospital in
Atlanta were negative. Those findings suggest a low chance that the
man transmitted the infection to others. But in 17 percent of
tuberculosis cases the source is a patient whose smear is negative,
according to studies from Vancouver, BC, and from San Francisco.
The man's bride is not infected.
While most patients voluntarily agree to isolation for medical
problems, government officials, doctors and ethicists interviewed
said that issuing federal orders for isolation or quarantine must be
done with care to balance an individual's liberties and the public's health.
Dr. Robert Klitzman, a co-founder of the Columbia University Center
for Bioethics, said that there are legitimate concerns about abuses
in isolating patients to avoid infecting others.
An expert, Dr. Richard P. Wenzel, president of the international
society for infectious diseases, called the patient "grossly irresponsible."
"It's irresponsible in active tuberculosis for anyone to be on an
airplane whether it's multi-resistant or not," said Dr. Wenzel, an
infectious disease expert at Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond. At a time when airline passengers have to discard shampoo
bottles in the airport security line, Dr. Wenzel said, "We don't have
a simple sort of wand at the airport to wave to say, 'You have
tuberculosis.' It really counts on the responsibility of the individual."

[A summary of the news conference and link to the full text can be
found later in this posting. The information provided clarified some
of the issues regarding the man's case. That is,
1- his chest radiograph abnormalities (not described above) were
found incidentally when the procedure was done for other reasons;
2- he was essentially asymptomatic (no fever, weight loss, cough);
3- the specimen that revealed the mycobacterium on culture was
obtained with facilitation (unclear if bronchoscopy or induced sputum); and
4- more recent sputum stains for mycobacteria continue to be negative
with cultures of this slow growing organisms incubating.
As noted in the New York Times article, smear-negative TB infection
is not non-infectious but rather less infectious than infection in
which the organism is found on staining a concentrated sputum. This
is directly related to organism load. - Mod.LL]

An Atlanta attorney quarantined with a dangerous strain of
tuberculosis (TB) apologized to his fellow plane passengers in an
interview aired Fri 1 Jun 2007, and insisted he was told he wasn't
contagious or a threat to anyone.
"I've lived in this state of constant fear and anxiety and exhaustion
for a week now, and to think that someone else is now feeling that, I
wouldn't want anyone to feel that way. It's awful," the man told
ABC's "Good Morning America" from his hospital room in Denver [where
he was transferred for further care - Mod. LL].
Sitting in street clothes but speaking through a face mask, he
repeatedly apologized to the dozens of airline passengers and crew
members now anxiously awaiting their own test results because of the
exposure to him.
The man, 31, said he, his doctors and the CDC all knew he had TB
before he flew to Europe for his wedding and honeymoon. But he said
he was advised that he wasn't contagious or a danger to anyone.
Officials said they would rather he didn't fly but no one ordered him
not to, he said. He said his father, also a lawyer, taped that meeting.
"My father said, 'OK, now are you saying, prefer not to go on the
trip because he's a risk to anybody, or are you simply saying that to
cover yourself?' And they said, we have to tell you that to cover
ourself, but he's not a risk."
Dr. Steven Katkowsky, director of the Fulton County Department of
Health & Wellness, said he was told in early May 2007 not to travel
to Europe: "He was told traveling is against medical advice." Dr.
Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and
quarantine, said once Speaker was in Europe, "He was told in no
uncertain terms not to take a flight back."
The man, his new wife and her 8 year old daughter were already in
Europe when the CDC contacted him and told him to turn himself in
immediately at a clinic there and not take another commercial flight.
He said he felt as if the CDC had suddenly "abandoned him." He said
he believed if he didn't get to the specialized clinic in Denver, he would die.
"Before I left, I knew that it was made clear to me, that in order to
fight this, I had one shot, and that was going to be in Denver," he
said. If doctors in Europe tried to treat him and it went wrong, he
said, "it's very real that I could have died there."
Even though officials had put the man on a warning list, he caught a
flight to Montreal and then drove across the USA border on 24 May
2007 at Champlain, NY. A border inspector who checked him disregarded
a computer warning to stop him, officials said Thu 31 May 2007. The
unidentified inspector later said the infected man seemed perfectly
healthy and that he thought the warning was merely "discretionary,"
officials briefed on the case told The Associated Press. They spoke
on condition of anonymity because the matter is still under investigation.
The inspector ran the man's passport through a computer, and a
warning -- including instructions to hold the traveler, don a
protective mask in dealing with him, and telephone health authorities
-- popped up, officials said. About a minute later, Speaker was
instead cleared to continue on his journey, according to officials
familiar with the records. The inspector has since been removed from
border duty.
The next day, the became the first infected person quarantined
[actually it was not a quantatine, see below - Mod.LL] by the
American government since 1963. He was flown by medical transport Thu
31 May 2007, to National Jewish Medical and Research Center, where
doctors put him in an isolation room where he will be treated with
oral and intravenous antibiotics.
Dr. Charles Daley, chief of the National Jewish Hospital's infectious
disease division, said he is optimistic a cure can be accomplished
because he is appears to be in the early stages of the disease.
He is "a young, healthy individual" who is "doing extremely well,"
Dr. Gwen Huitt said Thu, 31 May 2007. "By conventional methods that
we traditionally use in the public health arena ... he would be
considered low infectivity at this point in time," she said. "He is
not coughing, he is healthy, he does not have a fever."
Doctors hope to determine where he contracted the disease, which has
been found around the world and exists in pockets in Russia and Asia.
The tuberculosis was discovered by accident when Speaker had a chest
X-ray in January for a rib injury, Huitt said.

[As explained in the news conference -- link below -- it was not a
quarantine which is used for those exposed to certain infections but
not yet known to be infected. The word quarantine originates (source:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine>)
from a 40 day isolation of ships and people prior to entering the
city of Dubrovnik (a.k.a. Ragusa). This was practiced as a measure of
disease prevention related to the plague. Between 1348 and 1359 the
Black Death wiped out an estimated 30 percent of the population in
Europe and Asia. The original document from 1377, which is kept in
the Archives of Dubrovnik, states that before entering the city,
newcomers had to spend 30 days in a restricted location (originally
nearby islands) waiting to see whether the symptoms of plague would
develop. Later on, isolation was prolonged to 40 days and was called
quarantine. - Mod.LL]

Questions and Answers: XDR Tuberculosis in a USA Traveler From 30 May
2007 CDC Press Conference
--------------------------------
Why did the patient travel?
Normally, when a patient has tuberculosis (TB), he or she is
influenced through a covenant of trust to ensure that they don't put
themselves in situations where they could potentially expose others.
In this case, the patient had compelling personal reasons for
traveling and made the decision to go ahead and meet those personal
responsibilities.
How did the patient return to the United States and then Georgia?
On 12 May 2007, the patient departed Atlanta on and arrived in Paris
on 13 May on Air France flight 385. The patient flew to Canada on
Czech Air flight 0104 and then entered the USA by car on 24 May 2007.
It was not safe for the patient to fly on commercial aircraft, so
government resources were used to bring the patient from New York
back to Georgia in the safest and quickest possible way. In New York,
the patient was put into isolation fairly soon after his arrival and
was later flown to Georgia, his state of residence on the CDC
aircraft, a step that we were not obligated to take under our
quarantine authorities, but one that we felt was fair and appropriate
given that he is a citizen of Georgia. His family members are here
and his disease does require prolonged treatment.
Did the patient know he had TB before he got on these flights?
Our understanding from the county health officials, who were
responsible for managing the patient when he initially presented with
TB, is that he was aware of his diagnosis. When he departed, he may
not have been aware of the fact that he had extensively drug
resistant tuberculosis.
Where did the patient become infected with the extensively
drug-resistant (XDR) TB?
The source of the patient's TB is still under investigation. CDC is
conducting something called an Epi Aid, which means our epidemic
intelligence service officers are actively participating and
investigating not only opportunities for exposure to passengers,
crew, family members, or others but also looking backward to try to
determine where the original infection occurred that is an ongoing
investigation.
Why was a federal order of isolation issued?
After the patient had left the jurisdiction, the TB organism was
identified as extensively drug resistant. A federal order of
isolation under the Public Health Service Act that gives CDC
statutory responsibility for issuing quarantine orders was executed
to protect the public.
This patient was ordered to be in isolation and is required to stay
in isolation until the responsible public health official deems that
he is no longer infectious to others. The patient currently is
isolated and is undergoing medical evaluation.
Under what circumstances was the federal isolation order executed?
After speaking to CDC authorities, the patient voluntarily drove
himself to the isolation hospital in New York City to be evaluated.
He was given instructions on how to do that safely without putting
public health at risk. He was admitted and served a provisional
quarantine order that held for 72 hours while this assessment was
going on. The patient was asked if he preferred to remain in New York
City for his treatment or if he wanted to come home to Atlanta. He
preferred to come home and we ensured the safe transport for that
return to Atlanta on Monday via the CDC plane.
He was issued a federal isolation order on arrival in Atlanta to
cover the period of time for us to hand over the jurisdiction and
public health management of this case to the state and local
authorities in Fulton County in the State of Georgia where he is a resident.
The order is in effect until it is either rescinded and the
responsibility is transferred over to the local jurisdiction or until
determined by the CDC Director that he is no longer a public health threat.
Has a federal order of isolation been issued at any other time?
Taking a measure such as issuing an order of isolation is unusual.
The last order was issued in 1963.
What was the isolation order that was issued in 1963?
In 1963, the statute was used for quarantine, not isolation, of
someone who had been exposed to smallpox. The decision was made to
err on the side of caution and implement a federal quarantine
requirement for the person until they were outside of their period of
incubation.
What row numbers was the patient in?
We are still working with the airlines from the involved countries.
On Air France flight 385, the patient was seated somewhere between
rows 14 and 57, possibly on row 30. On Czech Air flight 0104, the
passenger was seated in 12c.
How many people were on the planes?
The airlines involved in the investigation are large transcontinental
airlines and they are generally full of passengers. Air France flight
385 had 433 passengers and 18 crew members and was approximately 13
hours in duration. Approximately 40-50 passengers and the 18 crew
members are a priority. The Czech Air flight 0104 had 191 passengers
and 9 crew members, and it was longer than 8 hours; around 30 people
are a priority for evaluation.

1. I understood that air within the cabin of modern aircraft is
re-circulated to a very large extent, possibly less so in any first-class area.
2. During my last flight over the French Alps, I noticed that the
outside air temperature was minus 61 deg C [minus 77.8 deg F],
according to an overhead monitor, and it again struck me how
expensive it might be to provide us passengers with fresh air at high
altitudes.
3. The air inside these cabins is of very, very low humidity, so
favouring the long-term suspension of droplets, I think?
All these points suggest to me that, were a person exhaling tubercle
bacilli (or pathogenic viruses, say) inside a modern aircraft, not
just his/her immediate neighbors might be at risk.

[Tom Kelly's questions bring up the issue of the risk of transmission
of tuberculosis during travel which have been addressed by a number
of studies in the past.
In a 1994 published study, a flight attendant was found to have
transmitted infection to other crew members but not clearly to any
passengers (1). Subsequently, the CDC reported on 6 (5 plus reference
1) different episodes of exposures of passengers and flight crew to
TB on commercial aircraft between 1992-1995 (2). In each
circumstance, the index case had smear-positive and therefore
substantially infectious disease. In the 5 circumstances not
previously reported, only one reported transmission despite all the
index cases being smear-positive (having a much higher organism burden).
In this last circumstance, reported in 1996 (3), a symptomatic
patient traveled from Honolulu to Chicago, Chicago to Baltimore,
Baltimore to Chicago and Chicago to Honolulu over several weeks. The
index case had smear-positive, cavitary, multidrug resistant
infection which was not under treatment. Of the 4 flights, only the
last one (when she had presumably had the highest TB burden showed
evidence of TB transmission using the author's definition of
tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion. A total of 6 TST conversions
occurred, all in the same cabin section as the index case and nowhere
else despite a shared air supply. Four of 13 individuals with seats
within 2 rows of the index case (30.8 percent) and 2 of 55 with seats
in the same cabin but farther away (3.6 percent) converted. These 2
were 12 and 13 rows away. These observations suggest that close
contact (not a shared air supply) was important as well as a lengthy flight.
In a corresponding, well thought-out editorial (4), Wenzel points out
that modern airlines with ventilation systems supplying 50 percent
fresh air and 50 percent recirculated air and high-efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filters seem to be remarkably clean. He notes
that the fresh air is obtained after heated through the jet engine
and then cooled at high pressure with air exchanges every 3-4
minutes. Additionally, expelled potential respiratory organisms enter
laminar sheets of air flowing from the top to the floor of the cabin.
This information suggests transmission of TB on aircraft is not
common and, when it occurs, is associated with close contact to
smear-positive index cases on long flights. In the on-going case, the
lack of cough and smear-negative nature of the case suggests a low
risk of transmission.
