From: Dr. Oscar Pedro Larghi <oplarghi@pinos.com>

The control of rabies in developing countries can be very successful if
based on:
1. Appropriate planning
2. Health education of human populations
3. 70% vaccine coverage of dog populations
4. Epidemiological surveillance
These parameters, with little emphasis in dog population reduction (less
than 10% of the estimated population), were applied in the metropolitan
area of Buenos Aires, Argentina (10.5 million inhabitants), Lima-Callao,
Peru (6.5 millions) and Sao Paulo, Brazil (14 million). Dog rabies cases
were reduced to zero, from close to 5,000 cases per year in Buenos Aires,
1,000 in Lima and 1,200 in Sao Paulo.

[Numbers like those presented here are hard to argue with. If you combine
the strategy suggested here with the previous comments of Henry Wilde and
Arthur King, total elimination of dogs appears to be unnecessary for
successful control. This thread is closed again. - Mod.PC
