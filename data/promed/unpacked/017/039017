The 4th case of [a] hantavirus infection, resulting in death, was
confirmed in La Araucania. The person involved is a 32-year-old female
who lived in the rural sector of Pitrufquen. The 1st symptoms of the
disease appeared on 12 Nov [2011], then the woman had her 1st medical
consult on the 15th of that month in that community.

The following day, she was sent to the Temuco Regional Hospital where
she was hospitalized and a rapid hantavirus detection test was carried
out, with positive results. Finally, the woman died on that same day,
16 Dec [2011], 4 days after the 1st symptoms appeared.

The Araucania Health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de
Salud; government administrative agency], Gloria Rodriguez, stated
that this year [2011] in the region there have been 7 cases of
hantavirus infections, with this last one the 4th [ending[ with a
fatal outcome. Also, this government official issued some
recommendations to prevent new cases.

At the present time, Araucania SEREMI epidemiological teams are
carrying out related investigations, visiting places where presumably
the infection might have been acquired.

[Although not specified, the hantavirus most likely involved in this
case is Andes virus. Infections can occur when individuals come in
contact with surroundings contaminated with excrement and urine from
Andes virus infected rodents. In rare cases, there can be human to
human transmission of Andes virus when an infected person is in very
close contact with a susceptible individual. This seems unlikely in
the above case, since there is no mention of another human case with
whom the patient was in contact.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
