Officials with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources
[ENR] are hoping an outbreak of anthrax among bison in the South
Slave Lowlands has ended.

A spokesperson with ENR, Ella Stinson, says crews found 2 more bison
carcasses over the weekend [31 Jul-1 Aug 2010], both of which were days old.

Officials have found 45 carcasses since [12 Jul 2010], all presumed
dead from an anthrax infection.

Crews will continue monitoring the South Slave Lowlands until
mid-August [2010].

There have been 14 outbreaks of anthrax in the Slave River Lowlands
and Wood Buffalo National Park between 1962 and 2007.
