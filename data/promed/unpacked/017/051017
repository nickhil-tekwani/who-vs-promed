Several cases of illness from eating raw oysters and lab detection of
bacteria that can make people sick has led state health officials to
close 2 Hood Canal growing areas.

Lab tests in Hood Canal Six, which runs from Hoodsport south and east
to the boat launch area at Twanoh State Park, showed the presence of
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, which can cause an illness known as
vibriosis. While no illnesses have been linked to oysters from this
area this summer [2010], at least 4 cases of vibriosis have been
confirmed in people who ate raw oysters harvested in the neighboring
Hood Canal Five, which runs from Clark Creek (about a mile north of
Hoodsport) north to Cummings Point.

Both areas have been closed by the state Department of Health to
reduce exposure to the bacteria. There have been several other
vibriosis cases identified this summer [2010], scattered around the
state's growing areas. Typically, Washington sees about 50 cases of
vibriosis a year.

_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is found naturally in the environment. The
warm temperatures and daytime low tides are likely contributing to
these recent cases. These 2 areas are closed for all recreational
harvesting of oysters. Some commercial growers may still harvest
oysters from these areas, but those oysters can only be sold when
they are shucked and intended to be cooked before consumption.

The illness is usually moderate and lasts for 2 to 7 days; it can be
more serious, and may be life threatening to people with weak immune
systems or chronic liver disease.

Thorough cooking will kill the bacteria and leave the shellfish safe
to eat. Food safety specialists recommend oysters be cooked to an
internal temperature of 145 deg F [63 deg C] to kill the bacteria.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is
naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage
contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ sp. or _E.
coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of the
American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates can
also be associated with oyster-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

In 2005, a New England Journal of Medicine report highlighted this
infection linked to even Alaskan oysters:

McLaughlin, JB, DePaola A, Bopp CA, et al: Outbreak of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ Gastroenteritis Associated with Alaskan Oysters. N
Engl J Med 2005; 353: 1463-70 (full article available at
<http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa051594>).

"Abstract
---------
Background: _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, the leading cause of
seafood-associated gastroenteritis in the USA, typically is
associated with the consumption of raw oysters gathered from warm
water estuaries. We describe a recognized outbreak of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ infection associated with the consumption of
seafood from Alaska.

Methods: After we received reports of the occurrence of
gastroenteritis on a cruise ship, we conducted a retrospective cohort
study among passengers, as well as active surveillance throughout
Alaska to identify additional cases, and an environmental study to
identify sources of _V. parahaemolyticus_ and contributors to the outbreak.

Results: Of 189 passengers, 132 (70 percent) were interviewed; 22 of
the interviewees (17 percent) met our case definition of
gastroenteritis. In our multiple logistic-regression analysis,
consumption of raw oysters was the only significant predictor of
illness; the attack rate among people who consumed oysters was 29
percent. Active surveillance identified a total of 62 patients with
gastroenteritis. _V. parahaemolyticus_ serotype O6:K18 was isolated
from the majority of patients tested and from environmental samples
of oysters. Patterns on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were highly
related across clinical and oyster isolates. All oysters associated
with the outbreak were harvested when mean daily water temperatures
exceeded 15.0 deg C/59 deg F (the theorized threshold for the risk of
_V. parahaemolyticus_ illness from the consumption of raw oysters).
Since 1997, mean water temperatures in July and August at the
implicated oyster farm increased 0.21 deg C per year (P less than
0.001 by linear regression); 2004 was the only year during which mean
daily temperatures in July and August 2004 at the shellfish farm did
not drop below 15.0 deg C/59 deg F.

Conclusions: This investigation extends by 1000 km (621 mi) the
northernmost documented source of oysters that caused illness due to
_V. parahaemolyticus_. Rising temperatures of ocean water seem to
have contributed to one of the largest known outbreaks of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ in the USA." Mod.LL]
