Brazil will today issue an international alert about yellow fever in
the light of the 2nd death of a Brazilian from YF in Brasilia, the
capital. Both cases were infected outside the capital, but
hospitalized in the city in the acute phase, potentially able to
infect the urban vector mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, which is abundant
there.
Yesterday the Brazilian Ministry of Health asked the Ministries of
Tourism & of External Relations to advise all its embassies
worldwide, and international organizations, about the threat.
Diplomats and staff should be vaccinated.
Tourist agencies will be warned, and leaflets distributed at Brazil's
airports and bus stations, advising all tourists, international and
national, to get
vaccinated. The Ministry of Tourism emphasizes that coastal Brazil,
the part most visited by tourists, is "practically free" of YF.

[However, it should be remembered that in January 2000, an ecotourist
who had spent the New Year holiday in the interior of Goais state was
hospitalized with YF on her return to Rio de Janeiro, which was
suffering a dengue epidemic at the time. More than 22 000 cases of
dengue were recorded in the city of Rio de Janeiro last year (2007),
and the epidemic is continuing. Since the mosquito vector of dengue
is the same as that of urban YF, if YF patients start to arrive in
Rio hospitals, the potential for spread will be there.
Travelers should be vaccinated at least 10 days before entering
Brazil, to allow the vaccine to take full effect. The Brazilian
government is to be highly commended on issuing this international
alert, in spite of the possible negative impact on its tourist
industry. - Mod.JW]
