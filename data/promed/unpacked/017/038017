A resident of Kabupaten Wonogiri is suspected to have died of bird flu
[avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection]. The victim is a 55 year old
resident of Dusun Pakelan RT4/RW2 Desa Jeporo, Kecamatan Jatipurno,
Kabupaten Wonogiri.

Previously, 2 children from Kecamatan [sub-district] Eramoko and Kecamatan
Manyaran of Wonogiri were reported to have died of bird flu [but so far not
confirmed by laboratory diagnosis?].

"By observing clinical signs, the cause of death indicates bird flu
infection. But, we're still waiting for blood test results from Jakarta
laboratory," stated the head of Health Service, Kabupaten Wonogiri, dr AUG
Jarot Budiharso, MKes.

According to the head of infectious disease eradication and environmental
health (Pemberantasan Penyakit Menular Penyehatan Lingkungan/P2MPL), Dr
Tuti Darsari, the victim started to develop fever, nausea, and vomiting on
30 May 2010. He was brought to Amal Sehat hospital in Kecamatan Slogohimo,
and then transferred to Marga Husada hospital in Wonogiri. Later, he was
referred to Dr Oen hospital in Surakarta due to evidence of pneumonia. On 9
Jun 2010, the patient was transferred again to Dr Murwadi hospital in Solo.
After only about 10 hours of medical care, the patient died with a
suspected diagnosis of avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection in the Dr
Murwadi hospital.

Epidemiological investigation in Dusun Pakelan by the Health Service found
that several chickens died of bird flu close to the victim's residence.

The Head of Livestock, Fishery and Marine Services (Nakperla) of Wonogiri,
Ir Ruli Pramono MM, stated that a team had been dispatched to the suspected
location to undertake disinfection and investigation of any deaths of birds.

Merdeka, <http://suaramerdeka.com/v1/index.php/read/news/2010/06/15/56986>.

ProMED-mail does not routinely report suspected human cases of avian
influenza (H5N1) virus infection published in the local Indonesian press,
because fewer that one in 50 of such reports is confirmed eventually by
laboratory diagnosis. Indeed, there has only been a single human case of
avian influenza reported from Indonesia since the beginning of 2010. This
particular suspected case is reported because it is better documented than
most.
