Banana disease found in North Queensland
----------------------------------------
Banana growers in Queensland are [concerned after the discovery of Black
Sigatoka disease on some feral plants in the state's north. Black Sigatoka
is a fungal leaf disease that's widespread in Asia and Central America but
so far only 8 minor cases have been discovered in Australia. [Vicki Kippen
O'Connor, Chair of the Banana Growers Council in Queensland, says an
action plan [has been introduced but the discovery is still a worry. She
said that [an outbreak on feral banana has always been a possibility. [She
also expressed concern that the outbreak could trigger a very significant
increase in the cost of production of bananas in Australia.

[Black sigatoka disease is caused by caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella
fijiensis_. Detection of black sigatoka disease on feral banana in
Northern Queensland represents a major threat to production of banana
(_Musa_accuminata_). Northern Queensland is the major producer of bananas
in Australia. If any of our subscribers in Queensland know the extent of
the outbreak and its geographical relationship to existing cultivated
cropping areas in Queensland, ProMED-mail would appreciate any information
they could provide. - Mod.DH

NSW battens down for banana disease
--------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the dreaded banana disease, black sigatoka, in Queensland's
major growing area has prompted an urgent effort by New South Wales growers
to cordon off their industry. New South Wales agriculture minister Richard
Amery is expected to officially declare a quarantine zone around local
growing areas later this week. It's too early to panic, says the chief
executive of the New South Wales banana industry committee, Michael
Lines-Kelly. But he [is worried about suggestions in north Queensland that
the disease might be too hard to control. [He added that the New South
Wales industry must ensure that the New South Wales industry is not
prejudiced by what [is happening in North Queensland.

[In an update on the outbreak, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on
11 Apr 2001 announced that the New South Wales Agriculture Minister has
moved to ban imports of bananas from the black sigatoka quarantine zone in
far north Queensland. The fungal disease has never been detected in New
South Wales, and the State's Governor is expected to approve a ban later
this week, to protect the local industry worth 60 million dollars a year.
Queensland banana growers fully agree with the New South Wales action. A
voluntary ban [has been imposed on the movement of fruit from within a
50-kilometre radius of the outbreak site, south of Tully. - Mod.DH
