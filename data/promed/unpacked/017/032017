["Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, non-contagious, vector-borne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants. Midges of just a few species in the genus Culicoides (the insect host) transmit bluetongue virus (BTV) among susceptible ruminants, having become infected by feeding on viraemic animals (the vertebrate host). In many parts of the world infection has a seasonal occurrence. BTV does not establish persistent infections in ruminants, and survival of BTV in the environment is associated with insect factors. Epidemiological systems (episystems) delimited by vector species and their natural history are considered to determine the global distribution of BTV. Recent observations in Europe and the USA indicate that strains of BTV can move between episystems and adapt to different species of vector midges.

The vertebrate hosts for BTV include both domestic and wild ruminants, such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, deer, most species of African antelope and other Artiodactyla such as camels. Although antibodies to BTV and virus antigen or nucleic acid or live virus has been demonstrated in some carnivores, felids, black and white rhinoceroses and elephants, the role of non-ruminant species in BTV epidemiology is considered minimal. The outcome of infection ranges from unapparent in the vast majority of infected animals, especially wild African ruminants, cattle and goats, to serious or fatal in a proportion of infected sheep, goats, deer and some wild ruminants.

However, a higher incidence of clinical disease has been observed in cattle infected with BVT 8 in Europe. Some breeds of sheep are more susceptible to disease than others, with the result that in some countries BTV infections of livestock can occur unobserved and be detected only by active surveillance". http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.03_BLUETONGUE.pdf

"Bluetongue Disease is historically an African disease. It is probably enzootic throughout Africa but has not been reported in every country. This is probably because clinical recognition of the disease largely depends on the presence of highly susceptible European breeds of sheep as indigenous African breeds generally exhibit subclinical infections.

It was 1st described in the late 18th century as 'tong-sikte' by a French biologist Francois de Vaillant. Some of the clinical features of Bluetongue disease were recorded by the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Cape Colony (Duncan Hutcheon) in his annual report for 1880. He later wrote about malarial catarrhal fever, suggesting that it was transmitted by insects. At the beginning of the 20th century Spruell published details of his experiments with malarial catarrhal fever describing clinical features and a typical case of the disease and suggesting that the name of the disease be changed to Bluetongue". http://www.bluetonguevirus.org/history-and-distribution-bluetongue. - Mod.CRD
