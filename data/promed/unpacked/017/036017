Zimbabwe hit by anthrax outbreak
--------------------------------
Nine people have been killed and 630 hospitalised in Zimbabwe following an
outbreak of the cattle disease, anthrax, which started a month ago in the
central region of the country in the Mhondoro communal farming area to the
southwest of Harare. As of 15 Dec 2000, 44 cattle were reported as having
died in this area. [In addition anthrax outbreaks were reported in the
north of the country in November.

Supplies of vaccine are reported to have run short, heightening fears of a
more severe outbreak. The authorities said there was a shortage of drugs to
prevent the spread of the disease due to a shortage of foreign currency to
import the vaccines. "If there are any delays in the delivery of the drugs,
it is because of lack of foreign currency," Dr Wellbourne Madzima, director
of the Department of Veterinary Services, said.

Farmers say attempts to control the spread of the disease have been
undermined by the [inability of the police to prevent the movement of
cattle onto land occupied by government supporters. In normal times
Zimbabwe's relatively efficient veterinary service would be expected to
control the outbreak. These, though, are far from normal times. Commercial
farmers bordering the communal area say potentially infected cattle are
being driven onto their land without hindrance. In addition hundreds of
kilometres of fencing have been cut down by squatters, allowing [wild
buffaloes to mix with domestic cattle. [Anthrax is normally rare in the
Zimbabwe commercial herds. - MHJ

In the southeast of the country there are growing fears of a serious
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.

[The total number of hospitalised human cases indicates that this outbreak
is already far more widespread than the "44" dead cattle would indicate.
Obviously we are getting geographically limited reports based on the
interviews by Harare based journalists. Further information is being
requested off line. Clearly the situation is going to get much worse before
it gets better if vaccine stocks are down and rural unrest prevents
efficient vaccination programmes, much less the proper disposal of dead
stock. The numbers of human cases indicate that dead stock are being
butchered and eaten in significant numbers; this unfortunately is not
unusual in poverty stricken areas in rural Africa. - MHJ
