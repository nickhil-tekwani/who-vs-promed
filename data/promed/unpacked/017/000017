The Chinese Embassy in Angola posted a message in Chinese on [23 Mar 2016] explaining that yellow fever vaccination provides protection for 10 years. They also state that individuals who received the vaccination should not require another during the 10 year period, but that if they do receive another dose, a new 10 year protective period begins from that point. They also note that the certificate of vaccination becomes effective 10 days after the date it is administered. (http://ao.chineseembassy.org/chn/sghd/t1350179.htm in Chinese, trans. Dan Silver)

On [24 Mar 2016], the Embassy issued another message saying that Chinese citizens in Angola who have not been vaccinated, or who have passed the 10 year period of protection, should immediately get boosters.

An article in Xinhua [news agency] says that at least 6 Chinese workers in Angola are suspected to have died from yellow fever, according to an Embassy statement. (http://news.xinhuanet.com/world/2016-03/22/c_1118409108.htm in Chinese, trans. Dan Silver)

[With 6 deaths that are suspected yellow fever (YF) cases, it is likely that there are several more non-fatal cases among the thousands of Chinese workers in Angola. This situation underscores the need for individuals who will be traveling to YF endemic areas, such as Angola, to be vaccinated at least 11 days before arrival there. One hopes that the Chinese Embassy's advisory is heeded for all Chinese workers in Angola who have not been vaccinated to do so, for their own health while in Angola and to eliminate the risk of dissemination of the virus when they leave, should they be viremic on departure.

China says it will vaccinate all its expat workers going to Angola. Since China has thousands of workers deployed worldwide, now is the time for at-risk countries receiving Chinese workers to check even before their arrival that they are not coming direct from Angola, Ghana, Mali or any other country in the YF endemic zones with a recent YF outbreak. China is producing its own YF vaccine. All Chinese now working in Angola should be vaccinated as soon as possible.
