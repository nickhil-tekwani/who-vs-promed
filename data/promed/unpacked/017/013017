A total of 51 food poisoning cases were registered in Kyrgyzstan in 10 months of 2020, 28 botulism cases among them affecting 57 people, the Ministry of Health reported. Botulism cases were mostly registered in Osh region - 19 cases affecting 42 people.

Signs of botulism appear within 2-36 hours after consuming the contaminated product, sometimes the latent incubation period can last 8-10 days, but most often the disease occurs in 12-24 hours. In most cases, botulism begins acutely. It may occur at once in several family members or other people who ate canned salads or cucumbers, mushrooms, eggplants or other vegetables and meat products the day before.

Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than 85 Â°C for longer than 5 minutes.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1). In Ukraine, many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish (2).
