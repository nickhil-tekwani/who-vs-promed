Abstract
--------
Some filoviruses can be transmitted to humans by zoonotic spillover events from their natural host, and filovirus outbreaks have occurred with increasing frequency in the last years. The filovirus Lloviu virus (LLOV) was identified in 2002 in Schreiber's bats (_Miniopterus schreibersii_) in Spain and was subsequently detected in bats in Hungary. Here we isolate infectious LLOV from the blood of a live sampled Schreiber's bat in Hungary. The isolate is subsequently sequenced and cultured in the _Miniopterus_ sp. kidney cell line SuBK12-08. It is furthermore able to infect monkey and human cells, suggesting that LLOV might have spillover potential. A multi-year surveillance of LLOV in bats in Hungary detects LLOV RNA in both deceased and live animals as well as in coupled ectoparasites from the families Nycteribiidae and Ixodidae. This correlates with LLOV seropositivity in sampled Schreiber's bats. Our data support the role of bats, specifically _M. schreibersii_, as hosts for LLOV in Europe. We suggest that bat-associated parasites might play a role in the natural ecology of filoviruses in temperate climate regions compared to filoviruses in the tropics.

Introduction [abridged]
--------------
Currently, the only filovirus known to be endemic in Europe is Lloviu virus (LLOV), where genomic RNA was identified during the investigation of Schreiber's bats (_M. schreibersii_) die-off events in the Iberian Peninsula in 2002. After its initial discovery, no other reports were published with regards to the presence of this virus until 2016, when RT-PCR-positive bat carcasses in Hungary confirmed a more widespread presence of LLOV in _M. schreibersii_ across Europe. This was followed by a report on seropositivity among Schreiber's bats in Spain, suggesting the circulation of LLOV in that area. The circumstances of the initial detection of LLOV in Hungary were similar to the original events in Spain, with multiple possibly related die-off events in the area, exclusively affecting Schreiber's bats.

Discussion [abridged]
------------------
We describe the circulation of LLOV in a colony of Schreiber's bats over the span of several years. This study represents the first detailed observation of the natural circulation of a filovirus in a temperate climate region. In addition to virus isolation results, the seropositivity and presence of LLOV RNA in these bats and the continuous circulation of the virus are supportive for the putative role of Schreiber's bats as the natural reservoir hosts for this virus. However, at this point we can only conclude these animals as hosts for the virus in Europe.

We have also provided evidence of filovirus RNA presence in arthropods. However, the precise role of bat flies and other ectoparasites in LLOV transmission is unknown. It is not yet clear whether these bat flies may be acting as natural vectors or mechanical vectors for LLOV transmission or are simply dead-end LLOV spillover hosts. A recent article reported the unsuccessful infection of bat flies with MARV, ruling out the biological vector competence but still considered the possibility of mechanical transmission. Our observations are in accordance with this recent report, since LLOV-positive ectoparasites were only retrieved from positive animals, suggesting the presence of the viral RNA in engorged parasites. Coupled sequencing results from host and parasite also support passive transmission without active viral replication, since no differences were found in the viral genomic sequences derived from the bat fly (LLOV_378_P1) and its bat host (LLOV_378). Given the current relatively limited dataset, it is not clear whether these ectoparasites play a role as a vector in the transmission of LLOV.

[The geographic distribution of _Miniopterus schreibersii_ is described as "from south western Europe, in the Balkan and Carpathian Mountains and in the Caucasus. Patchily distributed over its range in some large and vulnerable colonies" (https://www.eurobats.org/about_eurobats/protected_bat_species/miniopterus_schreibersii).

Within that broad geographic area, Lloviu virus (LLOV) has only been reported in Spain and Hungary. The initial report was of a die-off of this bat due to LLOV in Spain. The situation in Hungary was different in that LLOV was present in a colony over several years. In both the Spanish and Hungarian situations, there were individuals that had antibodies, indicating that there was infection and survival. Further studies of the. pathogenesis of LLOV in these bats and effects on their populations are needed. As the authors point out, the role of bat flies as possible mechanical or biological vectors of LLOV is uncertain. Detection of the virus in the bat flies does not prove their capacity to transmit the virus. Experimental transmission trials would be necessary to determine vector capacity. Studies of the presence of LLOV in _Miniopterus schreibersii_ and their ectoparasites is needed across their range. - Mod.TY
