Trichinellosis outbreak in Lithuania, Ukmerge region [Vilnius
County], June 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An outbreak of trichinellosis due to wild boar meat was detected in
Lithuania in June 2009. The outbreak affected 107 people all of whom
had consumed sausages made of wild boar meat. Inspection of food
samples confirmed the presence of _Trichinella larvae_ in the meat.

Background
----------
Several human cases of trichinellosis are reported in Lithuania every
year. Between 1999 and 2008, a total of 359 cases were registered,
including 66 sporadic cases and 42 outbreaks. During these 10 years
the incidence of trichinellosis decreased from 1.7 to 1.2 cases per
100 000 population (1).

The epidemiological investigations show that human trichinellosis in
Lithuania is mostly spread by consumption of meat from infected pigs
and wild boars. Of all outbreaks reported from 1999 to 2008, 58
percent occurred due to consumption of meat from home-raised pigs, 10
percent due to infected wild boar meat and about 8 percent due to
illegal sale of meat. Some 24 percent of outbreaks were unexplained.

Outbreak investigation
----------------------
On 11 Jun 2009 the Lithuanian Centre for Communicable Disease
Prevention and Control received an urgent report of about 5 suspected
cases of human trichinellosis in Ukmerge municipality. An
epidemiological investigation was started on the same day in order to
determine the extent of the outbreak, identify its source, and
propose control measures. The investigations involved specialists
from the Ukmerge department at Vilnius public health centre and the
Ukmerge district State Food and Veterinary service.

Case finding
------------
A standardised questionnaire was used to collect information on the
clinical features, date of onset of symptoms, consumption of meat
products, and dates and places of meat purchase. Investigation of the
1st cases quickly revealed that they had consumed homemade sausages
from wild boar.

A confirmed case was defined as a person with the following clinical
symptoms: fever (higher than 38 deg C/100.4 deg F), with myalgia, or
facial or orbital oedema, who had consumed homemade sausages from
wild boar, produced on 16 May 2009, and had positive serology for
_Trichinella_. A probable case was defined as a person with the
following clinical symptoms: fever, myalgia, facial or orbital
oedema, or hypereosinophilia, who had consumed homemade sausages from
wild boar, produced on 16 May 2009. A suspected case was defined as a
person with hypereosinophilia alone or associated with fever, myalgia
or orbital oedema, who had consumed homemade sausages from wild boar,
produced on 16 May 2009.

Patients and their family members were interviewed and active finding
of persons who had consumed suspected meat was implemented after
receiving an urgent report from a personal healthcare institution
(general practice and hospital) about a suspected case of
trichinellosis. Active case finding was started every time a
healthcare institution reported a suspected trichinella case. Persons
who had consumed suspected meat were referred to their local
healthcare institutions for laboratory examination and medical
observation. Blood samples were tested for eosinophilia and
serological investigations for antibodies against trichinellosis were
performed by ELISA.

Food investigation
------------------
On 11 Jun 2009 the State Food and Veterinary service collected the
remainder of wild boar sausages (13.4 kg [approx. 30 lb] produced
from several animals) from hunters and their family members and
tested them for trichinellosis. The food samples were tested using
the artificial digestion method.

Results
-------
Human cases
-----------
As a result of the investigations, it was established that 128
persons had consumed sausage made from wild boar meat suspected as
the source of infection. Of these, 107 people were considered to have
been affected by the outbreak. 14 cases (13.1 percent) were
laboratory-confirmed, the remaining 93 (86.9 percent) were regarded
as probable cases fulfilling clinical and epidemiological criteria.

Blood serological reactions for the detection of antibodies against
_Trichinella_ were performed 3 to 4 weeks after meat consumption. It
is presumed that this time was too short for finding antibodies
against _Trichinella_, which can explain the relatively small
proportion of confirmed cases.

The 1st patient fell ill on 20 May 2009; the last case was detected
on 26 Jun 2009 (Figure 1). The outbreak lasted 37 days. The shortest
incubation period was 5 days and the longest was 25 days.

Figure 1. Cases of trichinellosis reported in an outbreak in
Lithuania, May-June 2009, by date of disease onset (n=107). Most
cases were reported from Ukmerge municipality but the infection
spread beyond this region, affecting 6 municipalities in total (Table)

cases were adults (88.8 percent), only 12 cases in children were
registered (Figure 2).

The main clinical symptoms were: fatigue (100 percent), nausea (94.6
percent), fever (91.6 percent), muscular pain (88.2 percent), facial
oedema (52.3 percent), orbital oedema (94.6 percent), and
haemorrhagic rash of the skin (14.6 percent). Eosinophilia was found
in all patients. The clinical symptoms of disease were serious in 5
cases (4.7 percent), medium in 50 cases (46.7 percent), and mild in
52 cases (48.6 percent). A severe course of disease was defined by
fever higher than 39 deg C [102.2 deg F], face swelling, pain of
neck, shoulders and trunk, myalgia, and neurological complications
(lethargy, apathy, and excitement). A medium course of disease was
defined by fever of up to 39 deg C [102.2 deg F], orbital oedema, and
lesser myalgia. A mild course of disease was defined by subfebril
temperature and insignificant orbital oedema.

55 patients (51.4 percent) were hospitalised. The patients were
treated with mebendazole. Corticosteroids were administered for
patients with a severe and medium course of disease. All patients
were followed up after treatment and all recovered. Persons with a
severe or medium course of disease will be followed for 6 months by
their local healthcare institutions. For these patients, an
assessment of eosinophilia and myalgia will be done regularly.

Food source
-----------
On 12 Jun 2009 the laboratory department of the State Food and
Veterinary Risk Assessment Institute found _Trichinella_ pathogens in
the collected sausage samples. In 1g [0.04 oz] of meat about 20
larvae were found. The samples will be sent to Italy for the
determination of the _Trichinella_ type.

Conclusion
----------
The source of infection was identified to be wild boar meat. Several
wild boars were hunted on 10 May 2009 in Ukmerge region. The meat was
not inspected for the presence of _Trichinella_.

On 16 May 2009, 50 kg [110 lb] of cold-smoked sausages were produced
from the wild boar meat in a joint stock company 'Alekniskis'. The
sausages were not produced for trade but only for private
consumption. The sausages were distributed to huntsmen who ate this
meat themselves and distributed it further among their family
members, neighbours, relatives, and acquaintances.

Wild boar meat is the 2nd most common cause of trichinellosis in
Lithuania. Another larger outbreak had been registered in 2001, in
which 65 persons fell ill with trichinellosis (69 cases or 65 percent
of all cases in 2001). Investigations performed in 2000-2002 showed
that about 0.5 percent of wild boars in Lithuania are infected with
_Trichinella_ (2). The infected animals are evenly distributed in the
whole country. Therefore the meat of wild boar remains an important
source of infection in Lithuania.

According to legislation in Lithuania all slaughtered pigs and hunted
wild boars must be examined for _Trichinella_. Presently there are 2
methods used to detect _Trichinella_ in meat: trichinoscopy
(compressorium) and artificial digestion method. Epidemiological data
suggest that in spite of these regulations, consumption of
uninspected meat still occurs. Therefore, intensive public education,
especially for small pig breeders and hunters, is needed in order to
prevent human trichinellosis in Lithuania.

[The outbreak underlines the importance of wild board as a source of
_Trichinella_. Interestingly, wild board is only the 2nd most
important source of human trichinellosis in Lithuania, the most
important being domestic pigs often slaughtered without veterinary
inspection. It is surprising that the antibody assay failed to detect
specific antibodies in a large proportion of the cases, and a follow
up some weeks later would be interesting to see whether the assay
used was not very sensitive, or whether indeed many cases did not
develop antibodies. - Mod.EP]
