The deaths of at least 14 marmosets are under investigation by the Health Secretary of Pernambuco, who was notified of this mortality in Camaragibe [Pernambuco], Recife region, at the end of December [2019]. Professionals of the State Program for Arbovirosis Control went to Camaragibe to collect the corpses and conduct tests to find out the cause of death. Among the hypotheses is infection by yellow fever virus. Other viruses considered are herpesvirus and dengue virus. Samples are being processed at the Pernambuco Central Laboratory for Public Health.

In addition, as a preventative measure, inhabitants of Camaragibe and surroundings will be vaccinated against yellow fever, by health officials trained by the State. There will also be public seminars to inform about the disease.

Further training by the Arbovirosis program included teams to conduct surveillance and gather information about monkey deaths.

[New World primates (Platyrrhini: Ceboidea) are used as sentinels of yellow fever virus circulation in South America, due to their susceptibility to infection. Old World non-human primates are generally tolerant of infection, whereas New World monkeys (Ceboidea) are more affected. However, in some species the virus causes more disease than in others. Of the New World primates, howler (_Alouatta_ spp) and spider (_Ateles_ spp) monkeys are the most susceptible species, while capuchins (_Cebus_ spp and _Sapajus_ spp) are more resistant or tolerant. It has long been known that for these species, infection with yellow fever virus is almost always fatal.

Marmosets (_Callithrix_ spp) are small New World monkeys. The species that prevails in Pernambuco is the common marmoset (_C. jacchus_). Marmosets also become infected with the virus and show a considerable case fatality, for which they are thought to play an important role in the eco-epidemiology of the disease. - Mod.PMB
