The Center for Health Protection of the Department of Health today [23 Jul 2021] is closely monitoring 3 new cases of human infection with avian influenza (H5N6) in the Mainland, and once again urged the public to keep [good personal, food,] and environmental hygiene.

The 1st case involved a 51-year-old woman living in Xuanhan, Sichuan Province, who had been in contact with live poultry before becoming ill. She developed symptoms on 25 Jun 2021 and was admitted to the hospital for treatment on 2 Jul 2021. The patient died on 4 Jul 2021.

The 2nd case involved a 57-year-old man living in Kaijiang, Sichuan Province, who had been in contact with live poultry before he became ill. He developed symptoms on 22 Jun 2021 and was admitted to the hospital on 5 Jul 2021 in critical condition.

The 3rd case involved a 66-year-old man living in Tongnan, Chongqing, who had been in contact with live poultry before he became ill. He developed symptoms on 23 Jun 2021 and was admitted to hospital on 30 Jun 2021 in critical condition.

Since 2014, the Mainland health authorities have notified a total of 35 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N6). A spokesperson for the Center for Health Protection said: "All new influenza A, including H5N6, are statutory notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong."

If you go to the Mainland or other affected areas, please remember to avoid going to wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. When visiting relatives and friends, pay attention to whether there are free-range poultry. Do not buy live poultry or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid contact with poultry or birds or their droppings. When going to any place with live poultry, keep personal and hand hygiene at all times.

After returning to Hong Kong from the affected area, if you develop symptoms, you should seek medical advice immediately and take the initiative to inform your doctor of the places you have been to so that [they] can diagnose and treat potential diseases as soon as possible. If you have ever seen any live poultry while traveling, you should inform your doctor because you may have been in contact with a contaminated environment. This will help diagnose a possible avian flu case and arrange the necessary investigation and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

Locally, the Center for Health Protection has formulated a series of monitoring and prevention and control measures, and will always remain vigilant, and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health departments to monitor the latest developments.

The public should maintain personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene at all times, and pay attention to the following suggestions when handling poultry:

- Avoid contact with poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;
- When buying live chickens, do not touch the live chickens and chicken manure, and do not blow their tails. Wash the eggs stained with feces, use detergent to assist in washing, and immediately cook and eat. After touching chickens and eggs, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water;
- Eggs should be cooked thoroughly until the yolk and egg whites are solidified. Do not eat raw eggs or sauces with raw eggs. Cook poultry thoroughly. If there is still pink gravy flowing out or the bone marrow is still bright red, re-cook the poultry until it is fully cooked;
- Wash your hands frequently, especially before touching your mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, after going to the toilet, after touching public objects such as elevator handrails, elevator buttons or door handles, or when your hands are contaminated by respiratory secretions, such as coughing or after sneezing; and
- Wear a mask if you have fever or respiratory symptoms, go to a hospital or clinic, or take care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public can refer to the thematic webpages of the Centre for Health Protection for more information: bird flu page, bird flu weekly report bird flu statistics around the world and affected areas, Facebook page and YouTube channel.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi and Dan Silver for sharing the important reports on human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in China.

Since 2014, Mainland health authorities have notified a total of 35 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N6). The 3 cases in the above report had histories of contact with live poultry and all are above 50 years of age. There have been recent reports of additional cases from Sichuan Province, China in March, June, and July 2021, as well as in Laos in April 2021.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as frequency of cases is increasing. - Mod.UBA

The 1st human infection with (A)H5N6 avian influenza virus was reported from central China in 2014; the patient died. Avian influenza virus subtype H5N6 was identified in samples from contact poultry. Though the clinical signs in the affected poultry were mild, the virus was laboratory confirmed as highly pathogenic (HPAI). This strain has since been identified in additional countries in SE Asia. The most recent OIE report on the global situation of HPAI, from 15 Jan to 4 Feb 2021, is available at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/03/hpai---asof04022021.pdf. - Mod.AS
