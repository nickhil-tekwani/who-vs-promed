# CS 7290 Final Project: Disease Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project, completed as part of CS 7290, involves the analysis of disease data from multiple sources, focusing on identifying peak periods and visualizing the data. The diseases analyzed include Avian Flu, Cholera, Meningitis, Plague, and others where data was available. 

This project was inspired based on a rumor that the World Health Organization (WHO) slightly delays reporting of widespread disease outbreaks when "politically convenient."

- Promed
- World Health Organization (WHO)

## Key Analysis Steps
1. **Data Resampling**: The data was resampled to both monthly and weekly frequencies to analyze trends and identify peak periods.
2. **Peak Identification**: Top peaks for both monthly and weekly data were identified for each disease.
3. **Visualization**: Line plots were created to visualize the counts of records over time, with peak periods highlighted.

## Disease Analysis
### Avian Flu
- **Monthly Peaks**: Identified and visualized top 5 peaks.
- **Weekly Peaks**: Filtered data from 2007-2010 to identify top peaks.

### Cholera
- **Monthly Peaks**: Identified and visualized top 5 peaks.
- **Weekly Peaks**: Filtered data from 2007-2010 to identify top peaks.

### Meningitis
- **Monthly Peaks**: Identified and visualized top 5 peaks.
- **Weekly Peaks**: Filtered data from 2007-2010 to identify top peaks.

### Plague
- **Monthly Peaks**: Identified and visualized top 5 peaks.
- **Weekly Peaks**: Filtered data from 2007-2010 to identify top peaks.

### West Nile Virus, Salmonella, Rabies
- Insufficient WHO data for detailed analysis.
